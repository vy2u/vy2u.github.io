Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my polish pics update
this is my third third video in this
series I will leave my playlist linked
down below with my intro my update one
and two I have three four five six I
think it means seven polishes since the
last time I talked to you so one just
like it know about that don't like me
and my nails throughout the video and
for all the videos I'm filming this
round this is real life phonies and yeah
I don't know I'm not going to really
apologize it or too much because that's
just my life but yeah let's talk about
me I apologize I just thought it was at
least appropriate to bring up some
that's the whole point of this video if
you guys don't know what the series is
it's kind of like a different take on
project polish and it's supposed to it's
kind of void just to like go through
your collection use your nail polishes
at least once and then make a decision
if you want to keep it if you don't if
you like formula if you don't because
sometimes you get to the point where you
can't really do clutter anymore if you
don't really want to but you haven't
worn everything so sometimes something's
really pretty and you want to keep it
but it sucks the formula sex or it's
ugly on your skin or whatever and then
this kind of way to just like really
narrow down things to only things you
like and force you to actually wear some
of the nail polishes that you're just
holding on to and looking at in the door
I saw this from curious sparkles Maggie
here on YouTube but Vinci Keener Laura
is also doing it so I'll link both of
them down below so you can check them
out but now that I got the proper things
down the way let's get into it this is
the SP polish cascade cool this is the
first polish I was wearing in this group
of polishes I really liked it it's a
nice cool tone pink I just I love pink
you guys know that I think is just my
favorite color I love it so I definitely
won't be keeping this I kept I thought
it was really pretty I thought that the
formula is pretty nice so something i'm
realizing is that yeah i have a lot of
things but i do want to keep them all
most of them unless i just don't like
the formula but even if they're pretty
similar and if i still liked it i'm
going to keep it because those are
honestly going to gravitate to
so i'd rather have like 50 different
pinks and like no other colors that have
one of each color and have variation but
use them next combo beautiful.i I was
really happy with most of what I picked
this month but this combo is gives me
life it's so pretty so classic it's the
best so the first one here this is se
again I wore a lot of SP this month
and this is gogo geisha and this is from
their fall 2016 collection
I felt BB moon she's like one of my
favorite nail polish youtubers I will
leave her link down below to she's
watched this collection and I got this
color and the gray color because they
just they were like almost one coat
polishes and they were just so pretty
and I just love this it's like a topi
pink and it's beautiful it's a really
really pretty nude it's a little bit
like greater than my skintone but it
kind of gives you mannequin nails or
something like that
but with like a pink version I just
really love this polish just by itself
it's beautiful formula is so nice
especially for Essie I feel like
sometimes they can be hit or miss or
like three coders but this is like an
easy to coder and just looks beautiful
but then then you put this on it and I
will actually put a picture in law on
talking you can see how it is my nails
is good because I was really proud of
myself I did this whole like paint in my
whole nail with the color and then I fit
the glitter on just like the first
portion on my nail kind of like a French
manicure but like ombre it down I guess
it was so beautiful I liked it so much I
painted all my nails
twice so I did so much twice as I trying
to do a little rhyme I don't know anyway
this is the glitter from OPI and it's
called
rose of light I don't know if this is
limited edition I kind of feel like it
was oh my gosh it is so beautiful it has
big pieces of holographic glitter in it
mixed in with like a silvery pink
regular glitter and it looks absolutely
beautiful on the nails the reason I
chose this polish combo is because I
knew it was going to be seeing Katy and
if you don't know who she like started a
business called the painted nail and has
her own nail polish line Dolly's thing
so she's always like you know wondering
Elsa look thanks and she could like
comment on
when we were doing the show she'd be
like okay paint your nails while I'm an
interview oh yeah I wanted to have these
nails and she of course loves glitter I
love glitter and she of course how much
is on this is like those are so pretty
like I figured for you girl anyway I
love this so much I painted it twice I
will paint this again I already wish my
nails look like this I got many
compliments people think and they were
professionally done I was really I was
really into this one so how do they
suggest these if I can find these
polishes i link them down below but I do
like limited edition collection so if
you like a lot of my stuff is limited so
hold on my next polish combo
I did another polish combo a lot of
combos this month and this one was
absolutely beautiful as well I used yet
another Essie polish this is the
underwear color um it's just a really
pretty purple and I was going to do a
cream but then I saw this and this is
from what in wild it's called are you
free to dance with like it's are a you
and then spelled out free too
anyway this is so pretty this is one of
those really like sheer top coats with
glitter it has an insane shift to it it
looks like blue then green then pink and
purple it's so pretty and then over this
it just looks like unicorn eels like if
you were to have unicorn hoes this is
the color combination they'd be and I
absolutely loved it it was subtle but
still really fun and beautiful I really
like this combo I will probably do this
one again as well and it was just nice
to find something to wear this with
because there's no way you could wear
this on your own
it would take so many coats to build up
its decked out more like a topper it
probably looked really pretty on a dark
polish as well because it would just
show that your add essence to it so much
but highly suggest this combination
really really liked it so so far I'm
keeping everything
my last combination I don't have the
actual color I don't know where the
bottle went but it was OPI is Lincoln
Park after dark it's the like dark color
underneath the glitter that was really
nice
I haven't worn an OPI color why I
painted like my whole nail in such a
long time and the brush is so big
compared to Essie I wish it was rounded
though I feel like I'm not very good at
painting my nails with it because I can
just see like lines of where I touched
my I don't know I wish it was just
rounded it would be easier to paint by
the cuticle but I really liked that
color it's really deep it almost looks
black but it's kind of just like purpley
red it's like leans more purple so I
really like that one I will be keeping
that and then the color I put on top of
it with this glitter from butter LONDON
I chose this nail polish combo because
of the dress I wore to the premiere for
second Wives Club it was like it was
black and then I had like this gold
bottom and it was really really pretty
and so I wanted to like match my nails
with it but I just hated this
combination it looks so gross but it was
getting so late I didn't have time to
like change it for the premiere it looks
fine but like I would never paint my
nails like this again yes this is a
pretty gold polish it's like gold but
then it adds a little bit of like this
orange e gold mixed in as well it's very
fine
and it's quite opaque so you can easily
like if you wanted to you could just
paint this on your nail I'm getting a
little goopy I'm going to need to put
some thinner in I don't hate this polish
I don't necessarily recommend it it's
okay you know it's like one of those so
I'll probably keep this but if I find
the gold I just like better I might
eventually get rid of this or maybe I'll
try to you like use it up like I don't
know somehow find a combination I like a
lot and just get through it but it's
nowhere near like the love I have for
these glitters like these are me and
that one is not me it's pretty it don't
get me wrong it's super pretty and it
has a purpose like I think it's a good
like holiday polish or I don't know
depending on the look you know I just
need to be inspired to use this like
have a look I already want to create and
then go find this whereas these inspire
me
by looking at them does that make sense
do you see the difference that's
everything mail for the Polish pegs I
will be keeping all of those I will be
adding the gold one I guess to the Navy
pile just because if I use another bolt
glitter and I like it better I might
just get rid of that one I just don't
have as much of a love for it but all of
these icy polishes I thought were so
pretty again
this is so my color palette oh I love
pinks the pastel pink I love bright
pinks little pink and that purple is
pretty too I like that kind of like
warmer lavender okay that's everything I
hope you're having a great rest your day
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
