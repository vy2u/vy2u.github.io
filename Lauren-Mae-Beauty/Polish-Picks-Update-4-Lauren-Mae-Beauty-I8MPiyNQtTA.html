Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be talking about my
polish pics project which is different
than a project polish oh it's so hard to
say all those Peas instead of trying to
use up X amount of bottles of nail
polish I'm just trying to work through
my nail polishes to try them all on and
see if I like them and then get rid of
the colors that don't work for me I went
back through my project and looked at my
first couple of videos just to kind of
see what the heck this whole inspiration
was what's going on with it because it
has been a second since I've uploaded a
video like this so I'm kind of changing
it up I am NOT going to be leaving all
the numbers at the bottom it's just too
much for me I'm not as into strict
numbers like that like I used to be I
just it's too much work and I want this
to be more fun and I don't want to feel
like I have to like figure out all this
math to upload a video or to make
progress or any of that type of stuff so
I'm getting rid of all of that sorry
guys and instead I'm just gonna be
trying to paint my nails as often as
possible like I was supposed to and just
decide if I want it if I don't if it's a
maybe and then I can come back to it or
whatnot so hopefully that's okay with
you guys I doubt any of you guys are
like looking at those numbers and just
like where are they Lauren so if you
were sorry I have six different polishes
that I wore this month
oh no seven I have seven different
polishes that I wore in this round so
first off is my absolute favorite color
ever and this is not about you by OPI
I love this color so so much it's so
beautiful it's the perfect like baby
white based pink I especially love this
on my toes although I think it's so
pretty on the fingers too it just makes
my feet look so cute like whenever I
wear this on my feet I'm like girl
you've got some cute feet even though
they are definitely not cute this tricks
the eye I love it so much I highly
suggest this color it's so beautiful
love it it's like one of my top favorite
nail polishes ever I'm gonna mention
this one next to it because although you
may think Lauren you just held that one
up this is different this is from OPI is
fiji collection this is getting knotty
on my honeymoon
it's what i'm wearing right now and
this is so similar to OPI is not about
you the difference is very very slight
oh you can tell a little bit more on
camera than in person this one
definitely has a wider base this is not
about you and Fiji has that more pink
tone to it I got this from octa Lee and
they had a bunch of different colors to
choose from but of course I went with
the pink they had two different Pink's
one was more hot pink one was this like
baby pink and I thought I'm gonna go for
the baby pink I feel like they usually
go for hot pink and I do really like
this I personally like the formula of
mod about you better it's a little bit
more opaque this has it's not a jelly
formula at all but it definitely needs
like three coats to be completely opaque
and this one just needs to so if I was
gonna pick one I still pick OPI smart
about you but I do really like this
color again it's so similar to mod about
you that it's like oh yeah I'm gonna
like it hello I love that color we'll
continue on with pink nail polishes
because they're my favorite next this is
Dulli dance and this is from FC this I
just got it Marshall so I'm pretty sure
this is limited edition I don't think
you can get it if I can find any of
these I will leave them linked down
below but if they're from eBay or
something like that buy at your own risk
because they might be fakes I don't know
I really like this this is like a hot
baby pink if that makes any sense
it's beautiful love this keeping it then
I went on a butter LONDON kick the first
one I put on was sprog and this one's
really pretty it's kind of like a muted
periwinkle I do like it I'm gonna keep
it I really do like the butter LONDON
formula for the most part they don't
stain I think they're nice polishes then
these two are like throwbacks for me
this is slacker and I remember when this
came out and everyone was talking about
it I think Ingrid was talking about it
it was just like everywhere so of course
I was like I have to have it it's a
beautiful color don't get me wrong I do
really like it you guys liked it too
this is what I was wearing in one of my
videos and some people were asking me it
was slapper from butter LONDON
it's just an ice cream formula it's nice
and bright on the nails I got some
compliments so I do like that one and
then last was a combo so the butter when
the nail polish was trout pout again
this came out the same time as slapper
this is really pretty it looks more
orange on my nails and I feel like it
does in person like in the bottle it
looks more pinky peach but on my nails
it looks more like orange e peach and
then I just
to have like an accent nail with it and
this is gaining momentum I have no idea
what this is from mol maybe like a spy
collection I'm not sure this is like cut
up pieces that I don't even know metal
not my favorite glitter I don't hate it
it definitely gives you a specific look
but um it's just very angular you know
and it kinda reminded me like old
eighties carpeting or something even
though it's like you know metallic and
not crazy primary colors something about
it just reminded me of that Plus even
with the topcoat this one it can kind of
like stick up and there was like some
pieces that were really hard and they I
don't know I just kept like picking at
it so I do still like this one I'm gonna
keep it for now I might go back and
change it later and get rid of it we'll
see but I do have updates on maybes from
my past videos so the first movie that I
had was this one from Deborah Lippmann
and I wasn't really a huge fan of it on
my nails like it looked okay but it was
my favorite and I just decided that I'm
gonna pass it on I have too many colors
that I love to keep this one that I
don't totally love and I'm not gonna
keep it just because it was expensive
and just because it's pretty in the
packaging like I don't want to wear this
as much as so many of my other polishes
so I'm gonna pass that one along and the
other polish I'm gonna pass on is from
butter LONDON this is a glitter and West
End Wonderland it's beautiful don't get
me wrong I love glitters but I just
there's some glitters just don't work
and just cuz it's pretty and sparkly and
the packaging doesn't mean that it works
for me and that I love it I was looking
at the old videos and it's like I have
glitters that I was just dying over and
loving and then I kept these still even
though I'm not dying over them or loving
them so I'm gonna pass them on and
that's everything for my update I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
