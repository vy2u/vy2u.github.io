I'm super excited for the video I'm
filming because I collab with my cousin
actually here on YouTube Taylor her
channel name is Tay official we did to
spring videos for you guys she's doing
like spring outfits on her channel and
then I'm doing a spring inspired makeup
look over here so definitely go check
out her channel go say hi and support
her for sure she actually started making
videos before me at the beginning of
this year so definitely show her some
love and then if you guys want to know
how to get this look I used the
Esperanza palette by Kat Von D which
this was limited edition but when I was
looking for a palette or any makeup item
to do this spring look you know we were
talking about pastels and things like
that and when I went in my collection I
saw this and I just thought that spring
that's it so this is what the palette
looks like I tried using as many colors
from this palette as possible which I
believe I used all but two in this look
and I really really like the way this
look came out I think it's beautiful
it's fun it's bright but it's still
definitely wearable and I love the
corals the mint that purple on the lid
I'm into this look so if you want to see
how to get this look definitely keep
watching and don't forget to check out
Taylor's channel too I'll see you guys
in a second so my camera is being
difficult but first thing I did is I
prime my lids with this Laura Mercier
caviar stick an orchid just to give
myself a purple base for the shadows
we're gonna go in with then I went into
my crease with this fluffy blending
brush from Sigma this is the e-40 brush
and I took this color south from the
palette it's just a matte topee grey
brown color and I put that in the crease
as a transition color now we are going
in with mac fix+ and just a very small
little shadow brush to get in there and
put the purple color which in the
palette this one here that's called
selena we're going to put that on our
lids and we're gonna start from the
inner corner and go about two thirds
away across the lid saving the last bit
for
color but yeah that's what we're doing
I decided to take that color actually
all the way to the outer portion of the
eye because I just love the purple and
I'm just gonna do a darker color in the
crease instead of my original plan now
that we have that color built up I'm
just gonna take this medium brown color
here and I'm going to be putting that
into the crease just to start building
up a brown base there
now that we've built that color up in
the crease I'm going to go in with this
kind of crease brush it's pretty dense
and then I'm going to go in with the
darkest color on this palette that one
there and I'm going to put that as much
in the crease as possible and keep it to
the outer corner of the eye just to
darken up the look and give it some
definition
now that we've kind of placed that brown
color in the crease I'm gonna go in with
this original brush with no extra
product on it that we use for the light
brown color and I'm gonna go in and
blend that color just out on the outer
edges I don't want to blend the color
away too much because we do want it
there but just enough to kind of make it
a little more see
now we are gonna go in with this Coralie
matte color this is called placebo and
we're gonna put that on our duo fiber
like little wispy brush and we're gonna
tap that in there tap off the extra
we're gonna go to the very top of that
crease where we you know blended it out
and we're gonna put this in there just
to give some warmth and color to the
look and kind of transition it into this
color if that makes any sense so
that color just gives some warmth
through the eye a little bit of pop
color I really like though it looks so
now we are going to highlight the brow
bone I don't know I think I'm gonna go
in as a mad I can't do it guys I was
gonna go shimmery but I don't think I
can do it I am taking this just very
dense shader brush it kind of comes to a
point if you can see it there you can
I'm gonna use this to highlight my brow
bone and I'm going in with the lightest
white color here or cream color more
like from this palette and I'm gonna put
that right under the brow bone
and then just using this brush that we
used before with the coral color I'm
going to blend those two colors together
with no additional product
I really like this look so far I'm gonna
go do the rest of my face like my
foundation all that type of stuff and
then we're gonna come back and do the
lower lash line and liner and all that
stuff I'll be right back
okay guys I am back with my face done
I'm actually just gonna touch up the
tiniest bit now that we have that all
done we're going to start working on the
lower lash line I am gonna go in with
this liner here from Stila this is in
the color mint julep and we're gonna put
that on the bottom lash line I'm pretty
much gonna put it on the whole lash line
I might just only smudge it in the very
very inner corner so it's not too
intense but that's where we're putting
it
and now I'm just gonna smudge that color
in with my fingers
that's the smudging we're gonna go to
for now now using this small detailed
like smudger brush I'm going to take the
color Archangel from the palette which
is this one here and I'm going to put
that on my lower lash line and I'm not
going to put it too much in outer corner
cuz we're gonna go in with the darker
color so
and now using that same brush we're
going to go into the colors Santeria
which is that one there from the paladin
we're gonna put that on the very most
outer corner and now be careful with
this color guys there's glitter in it
and we just did our face so we don't
want to get too too much fallout so just
take your time and build it up if you
need to so you don't get fallout
like this looks so much
okay I mean I look super good now I'm
going in with this date low shade it's
called the transforming shade so you can
put this on like any of these shadows to
transform it but that's gonna go in our
inner corner and kind of blend into that
lower lash line with the other mint
colors
like super it like it feels good when
you make a look you like oh I'm just
going back in with that like medium in
color and like making sure that it's
still visible and blended into that
other darker color because I wanted to
make this look over the top I am going
to actually add some glitter y'all so
this is just a glitter liner I'm gonna
put this just on the bottom lash line
you know I'm gonna put it I think on the
inner tear-duct but it is a darker
glitter so I'm not really sure I'm not
really sure how I'm gonna use this I'm
not gonna do it it's gonna mess it up
this is how the process goes guys just
kidding instead I am just going to take
this purple mascara and I'm going to put
this on the lower lash line and just
make those lower lashes purple let's see
how that works I am cleaning off I'm
cleaning it off because there's a lot of
product and I don't want goopy bottom
lashes cuz that's not cute ugly actually
it was a way better idea than the
glitter so I'm gonna go in and tightline
my upper waterline I'm gonna add a
little bit of a wing because they think
it'll look really good with this look
and then I'm going to coat my lashes
with some mascara and I'll be right back
to showcase the final look okay guys
this is the final look I hope you guys
really liked it I super I really like
this look I think it's so pretty
it's turned out better than I thought it
would I know that's sad because it's my
channel and I should like know but I
don't plan these looks out I just kind
of like go with the flow and I think
this one's really pretty I think gives
you that bright pop of color but it
still it's not neutral but I think it
just looks really good and I also just
so you guys know on my lips I used
Revlon juicy papaya but I just I really
wanted to incorporate the coral that we
used in that upper crease so I put that
on my lips and then I also did like a
coral a blush I used the coral blush
from hourglass I have that like palette
it's the middle one but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this look and I will see
you guys in my next video definitely
make sure to check out Taylor's channel
as well and give her some love show or
some support and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
