Lauren thanks so much for watching it is
so again Sam is out of town for filming
and I am alone I'm trying to stay
productive so I thought it would
continue on with my declutter series we
are going to be going through powders
and foundations I have a bunch of stuff
over here and probably going to try to
declutter my entire collection tonight
we'll see how much I can get into this
and how many parts I can split it up
into I'm trying to just make sure the
videos aren't like longer than 20
minutes like that's scared of the cutoff
so that's why I'm breaking them up
anyway a few things before we get into
it I did pin my nails and they are so
pretty I will leave the color in the
description box if you're wondering also
again my focus is to try to get rid of
as much as I can I do project pan so I
like to use a lot of stuff up as well I
don't know how much I'm going to get rid
of so I'm going to title these
collection videos to you because this is
truly everything I own and yeah I think
that's it let's just get into it will
start with powders here first one here
this is the Ben Nye mutual set and I am
almost done with that you can like they
look like there's nothing in there so
I'm going to finish that off I really do
like this I use it in my most recent
tutorial so if you want to see that I'll
leave it linked down below but I will be
keeping that this is another Ben Nye
powder this isn't a color fair I will be
keeping this as well I don't know how
this looks on my skin just by itself
because it is tinted whereas the other
one was a translucent powder cuz I'm
going to be keeping this and yeah
hopefully I like it it's a lot of powder
to get through I've been really enjoying
loose powders this one's from Make Up
For Ever this is their HD powder I have
like less than half the container I'm
going to keep this and I'm also going to
potentially mix it with the Ben Nye if
this is too dark I'm just going to share
it out with this powder and use them up
at the same time yeah so far I don't
know how good we're doing this is the
pure for when pressed powder foundation
I am almost done with that as well so I
will be keeping it so I can finish it up
powder is definitely one of those things
that I go through quite often so I tend
to want to like pan it before just
getting rid of it even if it's not my
favorite just because I know I'll go
through all this is one from Kat Von D
and this is the locket setting powder I
got the Trinity to lynnster and again it
looks like I'm almost done
so I'm going to also keep that and
finish it off this is the tart powder
foundation Amazonian clay one you guys
know I have been trying to work on this
product for so long I am also going to
keeping this this isn't my finished 17
and 2017 challenge and I really do want
to finish it but I need to be a little
bit darker so I'm waiting until like
summer officially hits I'm already more
tan than I was so I will be keeping this
and trying to ease it up but if I do not
finish this at the end of this year it
will be gone okay I'm just going to try
to find something I will want to get rid
of I'm going to get rid of this this is
the Maybelline fit me in 220 I've had
this for a very long time so it's just
old I have almost a pan on it you can
see the Rings it's just a little too
dark for me this power is a really nice
powder but I am quite oily and even
though I am going for a more dewy look
because this is old and I haven't used
it yet I'm not going to keep this I'd
rather try a new powder so I'm going to
be getting rid of it
this one's a little bit newer to my
collection this is from Laura Geller and
this is the balanced and brightened
foundation in Portland this is so light
I am usually pretty light but I feel
like really really light I'm going to
keep it it's nice for like if my
foundation is a little dark I can set
with this and I obviously haven't tried
it a ton but yeah I'm going to keep this
I decided no how light this is
this is a fitness patter but this is the
matte and poreless version and it's in
translucent I have obviously repressed
this horribly but it is repressed I am
trying to work through that for my
project 10 pan so I'm going to keep that
this is the Maybelline better Skin
Foundation and this is an aligner shade
porcelain
I feel like this powder is so yellow and
kind of dark I don't know man this one's
like not that successful honestly I'm
going to keep this too I'm going to try
it out in summer when I did get this it
was like Christmas times so I'm going to
see how it works I mean I like the
texture of this on the skin again I've
been kind of into the routine of in
doing so I haven't been trying the other
ones out I'm gonna keep that being with
this Revlon nearly naked I've already
hit pan on it so I'm just going to
finish it up it's not that this powder
is not good it's okay
it's not like my favorite ever but it's
not like that at all some to keep that
and again just like get my money's worth
out of it this is one that I've hit pan
on from black opal I use this in my kit
and then one tickets to this level
I don't like put the repressed version
in there so I'm gonna repress this and
finish it up on itself I do really like
this powder especially for my kids so I
will be keeping that this is a newer one
in my collection from Wet n Wild this is
the photo focused pressed powder in the
color warm light I do like this powder
and I think it's going to work really
well for me in the summer but it got
hard pan so fast so that was like the
only bummer with it I really like this
powder though in the darker shade called
golden light I believe or golden warm or
something I use that as a bronzer so I'm
going to keep this I'm going to like
scratch off I think some of the surface
but it's a really pretty powder it looks
like skin it's kind of like this like
baked kind of formula this is Sephora
powder and I have this in my bag as like
a touch-up powder so it just got so beat
up again I want to finish this one off
even though it's like crazy beat up it
just was a little bit dark for me but
for summer it's going to be great so
this is the lightest shade and I guess I
feel like this is more of like a light
flash medium than just a straight-up
light so anyway I'm going to keep that
too I'm keeping everything no obviously
I do feel like I have a lot of things
that are like on the way out almost done
so I know that I'm going to have a
really send out collection soon so I
feel like some of these products I
actually will get to you know somewhat
soon with anyway so this is the gorgeous
Cosmetics powder and this one I am so
close to hitting pan on this one again
is just slightly too dark for me in the
winter these oh it's so soft this one's
so soft but I am going to be finishing
that one up as well something I can get
rid of guys this is the this is the
bourgeois Canyon campus as my upstairs
neighbor stomping around
we are joke about how she has like a
catwalk up there and
crying out for America's Next Top Model
anyway this is from Bourjois and it's
their like rice color I got this in
France when me and Sam got engaged it's
a very finely milled powder but have
Sparkle in it and it's just not my style
I don't want to try to finish using this
up the packaging is beautiful I love it
but I am going to be getting rid of that
one
that kind of makes me sad that's like
memories you know only a few more left
this is the Rimmel stay matte and I'm
going to be keeping this I just finished
up as seeing that this one's a brand new
I started using it but then was like one
you need to finish this one that's like
half use repress before you just start a
new one so I will be keeping this and
last is a powder foundation from Jane
Iredale and this is only color warm sand
I got this as gratis when I work at the
beauty store we worked at and this is
just pretty dark I want to really try to
sell I think Jane Iredale has really
awesome cosmetic products and I want to
try this out so I'm going to keep it see
if I can match it in the summertime and
it's not I'm going to pass it on to my
mom this leather will find out very soon
if it's going to work out for me or not
and if not it will be going to my mom
and I'm sure she will love those okay so
that one's not as successful as I
thought it was going to be but I am
getting rid of two powders and I have a
lot of powders let's see one two three
four five six that are like on the way
out one with pan on it so I feel
definitely good about this that this
will be thinned out in the next like
four months or so okay we are now going
to be moving on to my foundation it's
kind of a lot so let's just get into it
again I'm not sure how much I'm going to
get rid of I'm going to try to be hard
but foundation is also one of those
things that I'm like a mixer because I'm
a makeup artist it's like sometimes
really hard for me to just use like one
color foundation I like to like mix to
get the right texture I want and I
honestly switch up my routine and what
I'm feeling quite a lot so anyway let's
just get into it we'll see how I do
first off the top here this is the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD I'm in love with
this foundation I think this is such a
nice foundation it's what I want to move
my kid over to on a second industry
standard but this has medium coverage it
lets the skin show through but it kind
of just evens you out I really really
love it definitely keeping
love that this is the Revlon Colorstay
foundation in 150 bucks I was mixing it
with the better spoon and you can tell
they have quite a bit of wear because I
was using those together toward the end
of 2016 I am going to keep these because
I really did like that combination and
again I like to mix them because this
one on its own I felt was like a little
light this one is just like really
peachy and kind of a weird color so
together they work nice and I do kind of
want to like finish them off that way so
I'm going to keep this I have some good
progress in them I don't see why I would
just throw them out this is one that I
feel like I'm really into now that I'm
into a more medium coverage foundation
this is the Sun catcher soft focus satin
matte foundation if you're looking for a
full coverage this is definitely not it
I feel like the soft focus and that kind
of maybe can be a little misleading I
really do like it I like this color
match for me I don't like the smell of
it it feels like flowers I'm kind of
weird but I am going to be keeping that
these are two foundations are absolutely
love they are more full coverage and
they are matte so this isn't something I
see myself using in like the next couple
of months but I will be keeping these I
love the formula this I have the color
cool vanilla and calico these are really
good for looking for a drugstore matte
foundation I do really like these this
is the foundation that I kind of talk a
lot of crap about I feel like because it
was so light on me I need to go through
and like clean look how dirty everything
I wanted my gosh anyway I do want to
keep this because it's great for
lightening foundations this is a very
light color and make me look like a
ghost when I tried it on the side itself
but I do really like this for mixing so
again I'm going to keep that and it is a
perfect example of why I want to keep
that foundation this is the Milani
conceal and perfect to unwind foundation
I bought this to do a first impression
on it and I never did it so if you want
to see that definitely let me know but I
would need to mix this in because this
is too dark and this is the lightest
shade so yeah I do want to try this out
I think I've used it one time but
honestly I have no memory of like how it
wore or if I liked it or really anything
about it so I want to definitely try and
set forward to like get rid of it
again let me know if you want to see a
foundation video on that this my gosh
everything is so dirty guys we try to
like not be disgusting this is the
hourglass stick foundation I have the
color linen and Heather swipe this over
to me as well I really like this but as
you can see it's just a bit a little
dark for me so well I hope you can see
that I know my lights are kind of crazy
but it's a nighttime that's why this was
in my monthly favorites video recently
it's a really nice foundation I I would
love to have my color like my more
normal color but this is very nice you
can build this up to get full coverage
you can also share it out and just like
get the coverage you want use your
fingers use a brush use a sponge
whatever you want to do after I wreck
using a brush I not like a sponge but
yeah anyway I like this a lot okay I'm
just spreading these out um this is
something actually just got this is the
kiss Pro touch a lip of cushion
foundation I think liquid is a very
generous name this is not liquid it's
like a cream I've only used it in that
one video but it's definitely like
really sick although this doesn't really
work as a cushion for me I am going to
be keeping it I've only tried at that
one time and I honestly just don't feel
like I got a good idea of if I like this
I want to use it a little bit more
before I make like a get rid of it
decision but my first impression on it
besides everything finish wise it looks
really pretty on the skin definitely
gives you like medium coverage with a
your skin showing through which I like I
know you guys want to see me get rid of
something so I think I'm just going to
do that these are two foundations that I
bought at Daiso it's like a Japanese
dollar store but everything's like a
dollar fifty anyway I got these to do
first impression on and I just haven't
done it yet and I just don't know if
it's available for everyone else to get
if you guys would even want to see that
so if you would really like to see it
let me know and I can film it but if if
everyone says no then these are going in
to the declutter I'm going to put them
in the decoder file and then if you guys
want to see it I'll get them out but if
you don't I don't I don't know it was
just like this idea I had and
something about me I'm very much like
into something and then potentially not
into it at all so I should have filmed
this like the week I got these and since
I didn't they're just sitting in here
and they made it they need to go so I
will be getting rid of these two this is
something I got from optically this is
the Rivlin cream compact this is any
medium light I really do like this
foundation it has the only thing I don't
like about it is that it does have a bit
of a smell to it but it does look really
nice on the skin especially when you
just do like a nice light layer I was a
geek until I have hit pan on it so I'm
going to keep it and finish it up and
enjoy it all I do this is another part
that I got from actually this is the
pure bear doll foundation I've tried
this a couple times since I did a video
on it I'll leave that video link down
below I did a bunch of like first
impressions on pure products I feel like
I have a love-hate relationship with
this this is so thick like that's the
thing we don't necessarily love about it
I want to try this out and really get an
idea if it's something I feel like I can
work through and mixing with other
things and make work or if it's
something that is not worth it to me I
know so many people love this so well so
it's like I want to like figure out why
they love it so much I mean I don't know
I want to work on it I need to actually
use it I use it a couple times after
that video and then kind of just went on
to a new routine so I just need to give
this more of a chance this is the issue
I'm at Moisture tinge I use this so much
last year and I'm almost out of it I
probably have less than half the
container left so I want to finish it up
this year so one of those products that
like I want to have done by the end of
this year and if not I will get rid of
it but I am going to be keeping it for
now it expires in 4:18 so a little bit
of time on it but I do want to make this
a focus this year this is the Sephora
airbrush foundation and I really do like
this I feel like there's not much left I
got this at the end of the year like in
Christmastime 2016 so it's not very old
but it's almost done definitely keeping
this very beautiful foundation
I don't like spring this year down the
face I like to spray it like on a sponge
or on a pallet and then work from there
but it's really pretty
okay basically I kind of know how I feel
about all of these so we'll just I'll
try to run through pretty fast this is a
foundation from Eden mineral and it is a
beautiful foundation it's very liquidy
I'll so watch it because I want to be
fed well this is a very hydrating
foundation it's absolutely beautiful
I wish I had a better color match but
it's one of the ones I want to keep and
just like mix because this is so
beautiful on the skin I like love it
it's a little bit too pink for me in a
little too dark if you're looking for a
brand that caters to lighter skin tones
this is one for you and you're looking
for like a really nice like everyday
luminous foundation this is so beautiful
just which have my perfect shade but I
didn't have tonight you can see what in
wild photo focus foundations know either
Bowl like this so many people say it
smells like paint I encourage people
that sell fake paint it's not that I
hate this foundation or anything it's
just also not like my favorite it's been
awhile since I use it so I kind of want
to like again give this a try I also
like cocktailing so maybe I can mix this
with another foundation to like lighten
it up or darken it up or whatever you
know and I mean find my perfect
foundation cocktail so I'm going to be
keeping it it's only $5.99 so it's even
if I get rid of it later it's not a big
deal this is the covergirl clean that BB
cream and this one is in lightest shade
of 510 fair really like this such a good
BB cream so they're all of these to be
my favorite and I don't like it any more
this one's definitely better I wish the
color range is a little better and I
wish it did oxidize but regardless of
all those problems I still think it's
really really good and it keeps me matte
for a really long time surprisingly so
definitely keeping that let's get rid of
something these are from Stila and I
recently in my empties video got rid of
these foundations because they're
expired and these must have just been in
my drawer I do really like these
foundations but I've had in a while and
there's no reason I should be using
expired foundation on myself either so
even though they're a product I really
like and wish I could have used on
myself I'm going to just get rid of them
I have so many foundations obviously I
wanted to hold on to these last 30
things in the bin I am going to be
getting rid of this this is from
dermablend this is their cover cream and
chroma one and a half warm ivory I just
am never going to use this it's not my
style
to be that full coverage really I just I
don't want it I don't I'm getting rid of
it
goodbye and the last things here this is
a sample of the Mac next to nothing like
skin color thing I have a whole haul if
you want to see that only the length
this is just a sample of the lightest
shade and I'm going to keep it and use
it up for myself I really do like this I
think these foundations look really
really pretty on the skin as long as you
have the right moisturizer and a primer
so that they don't fall up but they're
really really pretty and last this is
something I recently got as well from
NARS this is a cream foundation this is
super beautiful on the skin it gives
really good coverage but I don't know if
you can tell I feel like it oxidizes I
don't love this color on me it's a
little I don't know I feel like it looks
exactly like my skin but sometimes I
don't like it I don't know why but I
mean it does it I guess is a good color
match maybe I just don't want this color
to be my color match I don't know man
but I'm going to be keeping that I feel
like I can use that up relatively fast
as well okay guys so this is what I'm
keeping and I will review really fast
what I'm getting rid of it wasn't a ton
of product but I am really happy with it
I do feel like I go through powders and
foundations and concealers kind of the
most in primers just because I do if I'm
going to do my face I definitely do a
base but anyway at least I got rid of
one two three four five six seven
products I'll take it these will be
moving on I'm really happy about that
I hope you guys enjoyed this declutter
flash collection video be on the lookout
for my other ones coming soon I don't
know how I'm going to post them so yeah
just keep watching I will see you then
