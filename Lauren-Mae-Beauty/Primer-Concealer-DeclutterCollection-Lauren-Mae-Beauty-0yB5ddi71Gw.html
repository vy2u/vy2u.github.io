Lauren thanks so much for watching today
we're going to be going through my
concealers as well as like my primer
slash setting sprays and then this
bucket over here is stuff for my kit so
it's all the concealer / color
correctors I keep in my kids and also
the things I keep in a drawer that
aren't in the kit but are for my kit in
case I need them checker thing I'm
really excited to go through these and
then over here I even have a whole
another situation I want to go through
as well so yeah I'm excited to get
through it let's do this this is kind of
like a collection Anna declutter because
I don't know how much I'm going to get
rid of I'm trying to be ruthless but I
also don't want to just get rid of stuff
to get rid of stuff so if I know that I
would actually use it up or haven't
given myself enough time to see if I
want to like pan it or work through it
I'm going to keep it so anyway let's
just get into it I'm going to start with
primers first first on the top here I do
have two like settings right this one
it's from Mac I am like almost out of it
seriously
two sprays away so I'm gonna obviously
keep that finish it up then I'm going to
be working on this this is the blue
marble sealer spray I got this when I
was at school because you just feel more
like sealing monster makeup or at least
that's when my teachers told me I feel
like I look 4 times really naive when
they told me I needed stuff and like you
know you want to like do well and have
the right products for the job but it's
like I'm never going to use this for
that type of situation
so you can just set your regular makeup
with it and I'm going to try it out see
if I like it at least see if I can work
my way through this because this was
like $24 some will just kind of
expensive lots of stuff that's like on
the way out I'm so good to finish it up
this is the Becca ever matte primer I
have a love-hate relationship with this
sometimes like it sometimes I hate it
I'm really trying to work on this this
year so I only have this much less
keeping it to work on it this is one
that seriously has like a youth left so
I will be using this next I recently
just finished up a Smashbox one that was
also in a very similar state to this I
was using it in my kit and I just it's
just hard to use so I moved it out put
something else in and
going to finish up in my collection so
this will hopefully be gone by the end
of next week this is probably my
favorite primer and the one I can see
myself repurchasing this is the hard
candy sheer envy primer and the shine
free version really like this and
obviously almost done so I will be
keeping that this is the by Terry
hyaluronic primer I like this I had this
for a really long time now I got it when
I was working at that beauty store and
it's been a little bit since I've been
working there and personally it's just
not my favorite for me so I'm just going
to actually get rid of this one maybe my
mom can use it before it goes bad I
don't know I just know it's not for me
and I had it in my kit but I never used
it so it needs to go this is something
that's relatively new to me this is the
Physicians Formula instant ready face
primer I just thought I would try this
out plus they were having a really good
deal on finishing formula at CVS this is
such a weird consistency from what I was
expecting it's a very thin silicone
prober I've tried it a couple times I
don't know how I feel about it
Margaret loves makeup on Instagram just
posted about this and said she like
loved it so I guess I want to give it a
fair shot and see how I like it
so I'm going to keep that this is
something from first aid beauty this is
the coconut skin smoothie priming
moisturizer I only have it's only a
small size so I'm going to use that up
see if I like it this is a new primer
for me from kiss this is the pro touch
smoothing primer as all using this one
and it's a nice primer I don't think it
doesn't like smooth out pores but it's a
great like base for the skin so I'm
going to keep this hi my name of this
into my kit eventually at some point I
do think it's nice I do like this is me
Mac oil control lotion I moved it from
my kit into my collection because I felt
like on set when I was using it whatever
I don't know what product it was but it
was like balling up with my other
products and it just was not looking
nice so I really do like this it feels
so nice on the skin I'd love to try more
Mac like skin care type of stuff really
like it I'm just going to use it on
myself so
yeah I do like this it also smells like
a man it's all good this is something
that I'm so close to finishing that I do
want to keep it this is the Smashbox
photo-finish
pore minimizing primer I've gone through
a couple of these I used to really like
it now not so much
it's just a little too dry for my skin I
feel like um I don't know I don't know
if I just don't care about my pores as
much about the smoothing and being like
airbrushed in that way so I'm going to
finish it up but I won't be repurchasing
this I don't think it's a must have in
my collection anymore this is a Laura
Geller even tone spackle treatment
primer I'm going to keep this this has
like a tint to it if you can see I've
only used it like one time but I think
this is just like a nice product to have
I also want to keep it just in case I
want to move it into my kit it kind of
leaves you with a bit of like a glow and
a tiny bit of like a bronze but like
nothing too much really nice it's kind
of more of just like a moisturizer feel
this is something I'm getting rid of
this is the if you can read it sorry the
number seven beautifully not primer I've
had this for a very long time never use
it never wanted to use it I don't need
this I'm getting rid of it
I don't even really like the way it
feels on the skin like it just pooled
and it could because it's older or
whatever but I just I can't imagine
having a really nice base I'm really
into a more moisturize base and being
more oily throughout the day but having
just like beautiful skin then putting
credit for my face that are going to
just mattify and like take up and then
just like hold products weird well make
a few more products in here this next
one is something that I want to keep
this with the YSL Touche cloth and I
really do like this product it made me
more oily when I used it before but now
that I'm kind of more into that I want
to try it out for myself and see how I
like it I know a lot of people think
like these silicone types of primers are
just like lame or whatever but I think
that they just are so nice for prepping
the skin like you can put whatever you
want on top of this isn't a logo so good
just feel so smooth it's about texture
without like adding a huge layer or film
over the skin
really like it so I'm definitely keeping
that and I'm going to take it out of the
box and actually try to use that this is
another wild product I was using this in
my kit for a little bit and then I moved
it back into my stuff so I just want to
finish this up I have a good dent going
in it it's not my favorite I don't think
it's like the worst ever I don't think
it's worth the price but yeah how many
is that oh this is the spackle tinted
under under makeup primer in bronze from
laura geller I've never used this yet so
maybe in summer or whatever it'd be nice
but I'm going to keep it and just see
these have such a nice feel on the skin
I do like it I just don't ever tried
this so I want to keep it and try it out
see if I like it see the bronze actually
makes a difference
orcs like I can't even see it so doesn't
matter anyway and I keep it up we'll see
last thing here this is from pure
cosmetics and this is like an under eye
primer I do not like this this is like
just not good I have such high hopes for
this I wanted this to work out so so bad
because I thought this was such a cool
idea to put this on under the under eye
and hydrated and you know then you can
go on with products but either I don't
think that it really did anything or it
balls up and like how the weird texture
compared to the rest of my face and the
concealer looks weird so I'm not getting
rid of this sadly I really hate when you
have like high expectations for
something and it just totally left it
down so over there we got rid of three
primers I feel pretty good about that
let's move on to the computer so these
are all the concealers in my personal
collection at the moment as well as my
color correctors I don't know how much
I'm going to get rid of we'll see I
don't feel like this is a lot of
concealers compared to like so many
videos on YouTube plus I've learned from
panning that concealers are Maj am there
what I go through I use concealers all
the time I love concealers I don't know
I go through concealers faster than
probably anything else in my collection
yeah I just love them so first here this
is the better skin I think this is okay
I wish it was a little bit lighter but
yeah I'm going to keep that one this is
the Physicians Formula in steady
concealer I recently got this and I
really only tried it a couple of times
I'm not quite sure I wanted the one do I
know is that it's quite
Pete you don't need a lot either like
that was one little pump and it's like
crazy so I want to still try that out
see how I like it
this is the Maybelline master conceal
and I'm almost done with this I'm going
to keep it and finish it up it was a
nice that white for whatever reason
especially when I'm a little bit tanner
isn't a big deal whereas other lights
are too dark for me this concealer
actually didn't really like when I first
got it but the more I use it the more I
did like it it's the photo focus
concealer from wet and wild I am going
to be keeping that and cinching it up I
think it's pretty nice this is the color
light ivory this is the bare minerals
bare skin concealer I thought I was like
this so much because I loved that it was
like a serum and that it can be more
hydrating I sold so many of these
because I just thought it was so pretty
on the skin it's not my favorite I'm
going to try to use it up if I really
start hating it once I'm like using it
every day I will pass it on but for
right now I am going to try to use it up
so again I just go through concealer so
much I have four concealers here and
maybe probably my favorite ones that I
own right now the first one is from even
minerals and it's just like a click up
pen concealer I really like a more
medium coverage concealer that's going
to like sheer out nicely on the skin and
this one's really beautiful so I do like
that one
this lighting though is like horrible
I'm trying to fix it but I really just
don't know how you know how to fix it
it's just really bright is that better
probably not this is the Maybelline fit
me I'm almost done with it like I took
the stopper out and everything so it is
on its way out I will be done with that
soon this is one of my all-time favorite
concealers I bought probably like seven
of these loved it this is a foundation
from Milani this is the retouch and
erase really like this concealer I think
the coverage is really nice the way it
looks on a skin and really lines I don't
apply it with this like weird sponge
thing but it is really pretty so I
definitely suggest that liked it a lot
and then this is something I recently
just got from Big Lots it was only 280
and that's why I got it I loved like
spending no money on makeup so that's
actually good this is really nice
get them out I really like the way that
this looks on the skin as well it's just
really nice oh gosh okay I'm going to
try to save that for later awesome
it just shares that really nice with my
CD cylinder I I just like this one I
really like so if you can find that at
Big Lots like get it super good and last
I have some color correctors now these I
got from obsolete from the brand YBF and
I really didn't like these these have a
really nice texture on the skin I was
carrying them in the kit for a long time
but I got some new ones and since I had
ever used these on anyone else but
myself I just thought that I would move
these out move those in type of
situations I really like these so I'm
going to keep the green one I'm going to
keep this PG one for under the eyes and
I'm going to keep the yellow one because
it's like brightening and I feel like I
could even use it as a concealer the
lavender one I know I'm never going to
use so I'm going to pass that one on and
then for this lavender I am going to
keep this but this is going to go in
like Mike it's tough though that's my
concealer and color Carter's not too
much so this is all the stuff that I was
either keeping in my kit or I had in
like a separate section in my drawers
for my kid and I just want to go through
it get rid of some stuff really only
keep the things that I feel like I
actually will potentially use in the
future or whatever so I'm going to keep
all of these from Lancome I really do
like these this one specifically I've
been using and I really like it it's
very potent you need the smallest amount
and at first I was intimidated because
these are a bit of a thicker texture but
I find that if I just use the tiniest
amount it color corrects just enough it
doesn't add too much texture under the
eye or anything like that and it just it
helps so much is color correcting so I
am going to definitely be keeping these
and these are kind of like my color
correcting tools I don't need anything
else to color correct in my kit I love
these and I really love the packaging to
they're just like everything about these
they're what I was hoping I would get so
after using them and testing or more
they're definitely awesome I do like
them this is something I was keeping in
my kit to color correct with I don't
need that anymore I'm going to keep it
still but I'm going to move it back into
just my drawers for like more like
Halloween makeup and things like
that but I don't need to be bringing it
with me to every job I do this is some
wild again that are kind of like color
correcting wheel hate this now no get
rid of it
these are two of the NARS like velvet
concealer plots what do they call self
that complete concealer really like
these I haven't used them a ton but I do
really like them I recently bought them
so I'm obviously going to keep those
because you have a Kat Von D concealers
I got these in an insulin stir box and I
am going to keep one of these in my kit
because this is a very light shade this
is the color L one neutral so I like
keeping this for like super fair clients
this one though I just don't need this
color I have different concealers that I
like to use from NARS radiant creamy I
feel like kind of does the job of this
one so I'm going to move this back into
my collection so that way I can get use
out of it and yeah I just don't feel
like I need both of them in there and
I'm trying to pare down what I bring
with me so I'm going to move this to
myself this is harmony it sticks and I
use this of a cream contour this is the
color
DP it's just like a concealer I really
like using this I'm gonna keep that this
is a concealer from Laura Geller I love
using this as well as super 9 so it just
for like darker skin another thing I'm
going to keep because I'm almost out of
it this is the vibe i under i from it
cosmetics i use this a ton on katie on
second wise Kolbe so I'm going to keep
this and try to finish it up because
it's too dark for me and I do really
like it it works nice oh yeah this is
something I got from octa Lee and it's
from Ally beauty and I just do not
really like it I keep it in my kit
because color wise would just doesn't
work for me and it's variable coverage I
have used those actually I was like
literally doing like a transformation
makeup where I had to like turn them
first off into a woman and then into
like a specific celebrity so I'm going
to keep this in my kit I think it comes
in handy sometimes it's just definitely
not something I can use so I feel like
it's perfect for those weird situations
that you might need something like that
this is another one of those samples of
the next to nothing foundation from Mac
I already have those in my kit and I
just don't I'm never going to reach for
example some of the past
on I have to concealer wheels here from
Ben Nye I am going to keep these in my
kit as well
I just feel like they come in handy so
much and these have some nice like
peachy colors I don't know I just I've
used these I know the texture I do
really like it something to keep them
we're starting to get to like some weird
stuff I feel like um but before we do
that these are some stick foundations
from laura geller I am in and keeping me
I recently bought them I haven't gotten
a fair chance to use these I feel like
I've just used other things and move on
to liquids and just different things so
I don't want to get rid of these yet
they're still like new and ever since
I'm going to keep these but again
they're not going to be in my actual
kits they're just going to be like on
the side in case I might switch things
up I have a powder here from Ben Nye
this is the colors fair I recently
showed this in my powders collection to
color video this one is almost done so
I'm going to keep this yeah and try to
finish this one up as well but this is
just going to go on my personal
collection I think I don't have that one
in my case so I don't need this one of
my kit you there this is just like a
white cream foundation I'm going to keep
this in my kit these are actually the
same exact thing these are the Ben Nye
ultralight make sure yeah they're both
the ultra light I have like multiple
kids from school and different things
this is actually quite useful so I'm
going to get rid of one and keep one I
don't need both so I'm going to keep the
one with the most product and pass the
other ones and then I actually have this
in a talent let me show you
I need these cream foundation palettes
so this is my light to medium and this
is my medium to deep which doesn't isn't
all the way full anyway I believe this
shade is the ultra light so I already
have a ton of those but I just don't
want to get rid of this one anyway I
don't need to keep this in my kit I'm
going to keep it in my like backup
container these are some more been night
cream products this one here is yellow
mellow yellow really like this this is
great for like highlighting on darker
skin tones it also is great for like
cancelling out dark circles or redness
because of how yellow it is so I'm going
to keep I'm also going to keep this file
sharp this is a great beard cover-up or
anything that you're trying to like
cover up darkness or anything was like a
bluer darker tone you wanted to cover up
tattoos on that word black or blue this
is really nice so I'm going to keep that
I have some like Korean foundations from
Ben Nye like I just showed you these are
already in my
Foundation kits I'm going to get rid of
these I just don't think I'm going to
run through what's already in my palette
I need to refill it before those even go
bad or anything so yeah it's just
getting rid of those these are magic
cake aqua Pink's or something from Ben
Nye I just don't think I'm ever going to
use these so I'm going to pass these on
cake foundation and cake products like
this for you like wet them with water
they just aren't what people use
nowadays and I don't want to keep these
even for like special effects I have
some cream products here from the nine
these cute I believe aren't blushes this
is the dusty mauve and this is the coral
I really don't have any other cream
blushes so I'm going to keep those one
and I'm just going to keep them in my
back kit these look amazing I'm also
going to keep this is character shadow
and this is the color maroon
again for a more like stage makeup
Halloween makeup just in case you keep
those guys and then these are some color
wheels so I'm going to keep these as
well but I didn't want to keep one of
each their double I don't know why I
have both so I'm going to keep the
newest ones these ones are not even
opened this is the olive light medium
wheel and this is the bruising abrasions
wheel I don't need to I know me too
I barely do that type of stuff but I
want to keep it but not not that much
I'm really happy with how I cleaned that
out because honestly I had a lot of
stuff that I just did mean this is kind
of random but I wanted to like go
through this this is where I kept a lot
of that makeup that is like where my
backup stuff is or just like extra
alternative products to switch into my
kit so I want to go through this stuff
and hopefully get rid of some I don't
know how much these are my like wolf
special effects like water activated
face paint I got these because I did
some Halloween makeup last year I made
like the corpse bride if you don't hold
and scream you can and I did post a
picture of the of that there if you want
to check it out I also did like a sugar
skull so these are awesome they're so
good so I'm definitely keeping all of
those and then same with these Nazarenes
these are
- you can get these out like Michaels
and they're very similar water-activated
and they're pretty good so I don't have
a ton of that type of stuff want to keep
those this is from Kryolan and it's an
aqua color palette again this is
activated by water so I'm going to keep
that those are kind of things they don't
use all the time but definitely want to
keep I have some like random lip
products in here and I'm gonna get rid
of both of them this is just like a
colored lip balm I don't know why it's
in here and this is from by Carrie and
it's just a nice high-end product I just
put my finger in it today like other
than that it was sanitary I tried it out
and I just can't get over the rosin it's
just not my type of things I'm getting
rid of that this is something I had in
here to do like bronzy type of makeup
can I just I won't use it myself but
it's a nice high-end product so I'm
going to keep this as like a potential
bronzed situation you can use it either
by on its own or move them together I
don't know I don't want to get rid of it
because it's a nice product and I can
use it in my kit and I feel comfortable
and all that so I'm going to keep that
this is like a white cream paint from
like next door I'm just getting rid of
that I have some actual cake makeup here
this is again from Ben Nye I have white
cream color cake makeup it's not cream
it's cake and then I have like a one
that's kind of my skin tone I'm going to
keep both of these because you just
never know this like cake makeup is what
you could do like clown makeup in so
that really like powdered correct Maps
you look so I feel like I definitely
could use these or like texture just
different things even outside of like
maybe it's potentially what they're used
for so I'm keeping those I already
showed you guys these actually keep
these in my kit I just wanted to bring
them out so you could see that I you
know fun I'm going to keep these as well
cuz they're just like tattoos and I
didn't even last year and I even this
year who knows keeping that and then
lasting hairs like this is like what
came with my kit like I think that's so
ridiculous
honestly I've actually switched out some
of the eyeshadows and here these are
actually Stila you can tell they don't
look fit the pan but anyway I think it's
ridiculous at my school charging me as
much as they did for my makeup kit and
gave me some private label um
anyway I mean I should have known I
think as I have a lot of anxiety about
things so I thought like oh I want to
get the kid because like they know how
everything I need even though I'm like I
know more about products and so many
people there I'm just because of like
how much use content I consume and how
much I'm into products anyway that's a
whole other story but I'm definitely
getting rid of this I just I would want
to use products that actually know how
they perform and I just don't want to
keep this around just because like I
might want to do some like more whatever
makeup on someone anyway stupid hate
this I'm really happy to be getting rid
of it right now
okay so here's an overview of all the
products I'm going to be getting rid of
really really happy about this one I
hope this wasn't too boring I know it's
kind of weird because some of those like
random weird girls but I'm really happy
like there's so much stuff that I've
kept because like I might need it in my
kit and when I go through my blushes and
bronzers which I think I want to do
tomorrow just because the lighting is
just really like grossing me out
anyway when I'm going through those I
really want to keep the mindset of like
I don't want to keep things for my kit
you know I because the thing is I'm
going to want to get new stuff permit it
like I like if I haven't use on myself
and don't love it where it's like I love
it so much I want to use it on other
people then I'm probably not going to do
it though it's like I need to just be
looking at it that way saying when I go
through my eyeshadow collection because
again I'm just I use the things that I
like to use on people on myself and vice
versa you know what I mean okay that's
rambling at the end thank you so much
for watching guys I hope you're having a
