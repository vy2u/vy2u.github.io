is going to be a product I regret buying
video now over the years I've been on
YouTube not very long but I've been
watching YouTube for a long time so
there's a lot of stuff that I bought
that I wasn't so happy with and then
there's also a lot of stuff in this
video that are things that I bought but
maybe I haven't used because I have a
lot of stuff or I thought I would use
but I haven't so it's kind of like a mix
between crap products or products that I
think aren't good or don't do what
they're supposed to and then also a mix
of things that are good products but I
just regret buying personally because I
don't use them or I would have bought
something else going back in time so
let's get started with this video cuz I
do have quite a few things I want to
show you guys that's everything let's go
I'm just getting real from the beginning
so these are the naked 2 and naked 3 I
love the naked 1 palette I've used that
palette quite a bit in my collection but
these two just haven't gotten as much
love for me so I'll start off with the
naked 2 the reason that I regret buying
this is only because of the types of
colors in here they are all very cool
toned I mean there are some warmer
colors in here but I just don't use them
nearly as much as other shades in my
collection and for the price of this
palette it just wasn't worth it for me
to have my collection I bought it to buy
it to have the second one so I wish I
hadn't bought this and skipped out on it
and then for the Naked 3 this one is a
beautiful palette I have no problems
necessarily with the shades in here the
reason I regret buying this one is just
because I have the lorac unzipped and
personally for like a rosy neutral
palette I do prefer that palette so
usually if I'm going for and I look with
these types of colors I'll just
gravitate to that palette before this
one so it just doesn't get as much use
as it should I think the quality of
these shadows are pretty good the only
one I have a problem with is this dust
color it's crappy it's really bad so it
just really flaky and glittery and I
know Orban decay is known for like
they're really awesome glitter shadows
and I know that we all know that those
have follow up but I feel like this one
is especially like not good so those
palettes I regret and
get rid of them because I do enjoy
having them or for comparison reasons
and maybe I'll try to bust amount and
use them but if I could go back in time
I would not get these pallets we'll keep
going with pallets these are blush
palette so this is Laura
cheek palette it has four blushes inside
here there's nothing wrong with these
blushes in the sense that they are very
pigmented they swatch out really pretty
the light colors are really pigmented
they're buttery and soft they're like a
regular lorac like powder formula I just
personally don't use this and I find
that with these since they're so
pigmented especially like these even
these top two sheets are so pigmented
that they make it hard to use I know
everyone loves pigmentation and having a
lot of it and the swatch being so
beautiful but I almost would rather with
blushes have something that I can kind
of build up and that's more
user-friendly than something that's just
like oh crap I just ruined my whole look
that I spent a bunch of time on because
I like put way too much hot pink blush
on my face I just don't use this palette
I have seriously never reach for this
palette except for one tutorial which I
filmed really early on on my channel so
I mean money-wise this is $30 it also
came with a lipstick which I declutter
so I didn't even use that they're just
really I bought this because it came out
that's why I bought it
Zico and I regarded this is a similar
story this is the hourglass blush trio
and these blushes are really nice
especially like like I was saying they
build up nicely they have a sheen to
them but there's no like glimmer or
sparkle it's just really nice Sheen like
a lit from within type of look I just
don't reach for this I had mood exposure
and a single and I love that blush but I
could have I would have been totally
fine just having that and I bought this
because of the hype and because it was
new and I'm really trying to stop doing
that now like being really cautious
about the palettes and stuff I buy
because there's just so many things in
my collection that are expensive and
that I regret and don't use and wish I
just wish I had things in my collection
only things that I use but this one's
ever great I have two primers in here
they're upside down and backwards these
are two different mattifying type of
primers the first one here is the
benefits de flawless 15-hour primer I
bought this off a recommendation from
someone in Sephora and I was gonna get
the benefit Porefessional that's the one
I wanted but she convinced me to get
this and it was like the new item at the
time so I just let her convince me this
product goes on and it dries really
really fast it's one of those ones that
kind of makes your skin feel tight after
you put it on not necessarily in a super
bad way just like in a more mattifying
way it's not like silicone II a really
smooth feeling in that same way if that
makes sense anyway what I hate about
this product not only the packaging the
lid does not close all the way it like
pops open and so this product has dried
out on me and it's almost like removed
from the base because it's like a stick
form but this product throughout the day
turns to a weird glue consistency it
feels like stick glue I put it on my
face and then I let it dry and then
throughout the day my oils have mixed
with that glue and it's turned into some
weird gross consistency on my face and
it feels like if I like took my nails
and scratch my face that you would see
like flesh and then it'd be this thick
layer of like goopy foundation with
primer and glue and it's just disgusting
it's the grossest feeling ever that's
the reason I also don't like this I've
used a lot of this and I thought I liked
it but as I wore it again that same type
of feeling I just I think it's something
similar with the formula on these I do
not like that feeling it's the most
disgusting thing ever
so I regret buying these cuz that
grosses me out a lot this is a product
that I just hate I think it's really bad
this is CoverGirl's full lash bloom
mascara I bought this it was one with
Katy Perry the brush looked promising
it's a nice full looking brush but this
is not like the what's the really
popular one from covergirl LashBlast I
don't know it's a really popular end
from covergirl in the orange tube it is
not like that mascara this
barely pulls up enough product to like
coat my lashes as I use it so I feel
like I'm constantly having to like
wiggle it and nothing's going on my
lashes I do have naturally really nice
lashes so I a lot of mascaras work for
me unless they're really wide or clump
them together or something there's just
I can't get enough product on my lashes
I don't have time to sit there for like
seriously forever to get this on my
lashes and the brush for whatever reason
like it is meant to like poke you I
swear I poked my eye with this so so
many times and that is the worst when
you're getting ready cuz mascara is one
of the last steps I do and so I'm like
have everything done and then I poked my
eye with this over and over again and
I'm like crying my mascaras running
everything is becoming ruined so I just
really just like this mascara and
usually mascaras are fine for me so I
was really surprised just like hey des
these are some other products that I
regret buying these are from Stila these
are the countless color pigments I have
the color indie and this is the color
lyric I also have another one and I've
also decluttered many throughout the
years any of the products like this
where they have like many different
colors blended in there they're so
beautiful in the pan but realistically I
just don't feel like they work these two
colors specifically I have in my blush
door to try to make them work since they
are like blush tones that you could make
work but they had other ones in their
collection that were like blue pink
unlike a champagne color eye and they're
like mixed it's hard to get your brush
in it's hard to get the same look on
each eye I just feel like these are
novelty fun items that we pick up
because they look pretty in the pan but
usefulness wise and like later I always
regret them so I wish I had you picked
these up they were like 22 I only bought
one at that price and then the rest I
bought really cheap like five dollars on
some type of site so luckily I'm not out
like the full price on these but I'm
trying to stay away from things that
just look pretty in the pan because they
usually don't work out as well on your
face or aren't as practical as other
items you might love way more but don't
look as pretty some other products I
regret buying are these wet-and-wild
like limited edition type of palettes
what in wild have amazing eyeshadows
especially for the drugstore and
especially for the price there are eight
pan pallet the trio's that are like
$2.99 and $4.99 are amazing the great
quality but there's something about the
limited-edition formula not all of them
but some of them have this nasty flaky
consistency and I don't understand why
they can't just put the same formula
onto each of them they would be amazing
if they just use the same formula that
we all know and love but instead they go
with like this glitter flaky crap and
it's super frustrating when you see it
and it looks so pretty and you're like
well I know they're really good and they
suck so this is like a newer trio type
of thing this is the stay wild I did a
review on this already but I thought I'd
throw these in here again just to
reiterate how much I do not like these
and how disappointed I was I only paid
179 but it's still disappointing because
I don't want to have fall out and just
flakiness
I just wanted these to be there oh gee
formula and they're not this one here
the whole palette as a whole isn't bad
but again this gold shade looks so
beautiful but it's that nasty flakey
formula which is just annoying other
than that I feel like most of these are
like the nice one but I just wanted to
point that one out again it's just not
this one collection it's throughout that
you just they use this formula and some
of them are the whole palette and not
just one shade so frustrating I have a
couple Maybelline products that I regret
buying and these are kind of ones that
I've regretted buying slowly I realized
after the years like oh wait I'm gonna
stop buying me so the first one is baby
lips these are so cute there's no
denying how adorable this packaging is
how it sucks you in with their limited
edition shades and collections and all
of that but this is not a good
moisturizing lip balm so when you buy
700 of these there's really no use for
them because they don't really have a
lot of color payoff so they're really
just a balm and the balm sucks I'd
rather use I'd rather spend all the
money I spent on all seven of the ones
that have and buy one really nice one
that actually works well and moisturizes
my lips so I have sworn myself off with
baby wipes and I'm doing a good job I'm
trying to
some up I just they're not a go to
formula they're not a good formula for
actually moisturizing it's been its
Gracie and I find that when I use this
over and over my lips feel more
dehydrated than they did when I
originally wasn't using it so that's not
a good thing another thing that I am
swearing off are Maybelline Color
tattoos now I don't have a specific
shade this one here just to let you know
is inked in pink these are creamy when
you first get them but they dry out so
fast and luckily I didn't buy a million
of them I only have two right now in my
collection but because they dry up so
fast I just think they're a waste of
time I love cream shadows that work
really well I love using them as bases
and also a good one that can stay on all
day is great just alone especially if
you're in a hurry but these are just not
worth the money for how fast they dried
up and I find it's not something where
they're pulling away from the edges but
it's still really creamy these when they
dry out you can't really put them on the
lids very well because they just look
kind of crocodile lash or like they make
your eyelids look dry and kind of gross
and I just it's not worth it to me I'd
rather have instead of a bunch of
different shades of this I'd rather help
one really good cream eyeshadow like the
benefit ones those are my favorite in my
collection so that I can enjoy it and
use it and it feels good on the lids
instead of a million of these that are
all dried up and nasty in my collection
so I regret buying this I only have a
few more things to talk about and a lot
of them aren't necessarily like crap
products they're just regrets for me so
I'm sure if you've subscribed to me
you're not surprised to see this in this
video this is the turret exposed cheek
stain this is just one of the eight that
I used to have I am down to one now
because I have decluttered them but I
bought this huge set with all of them in
it
and I just regret that purchase buying a
ton of cream products all at once when I
had a ton of other blushes was stupid in
the first place but I have been
currently trying to pan one of these
like minis and it takes so long and I'm
just not enjoying it so instead of
holding on to those items I have to
clutter them except for this one because
it's a more neutral
shade but I just I can't I can't believe
I did that I really regret that purchase
it was super expensive I mean they were
all full size and I think it was the
whole collection of eight of them like
it was so insane to me to buy that but
that is just a big regret of mine and
again it's something that I've reflected
on so that I cannot make those types of
purchases again but you just have to
think about some of these purchases
instead of getting caught up in this
like whirlwind of like let's get it
hurry to go yeah it's limited edition oh
that's what happens to all of us I'm
gonna talk about tulip products and then
be done with this video so the first
look product is a drugstore product
these are the Revlon lip butters this
shade happens to be pink lemonade and
this is juicy papaya I bought all of
these when I first started watching
YouTube videos these are what the rage
was these just came out they were like
soo popular I wanted every color and I
had quite a few of them these just
aren't my favorite formula they're very
glossy on and they're supposed to be a
mix between like a lip balm and a
lipstick but they aren't quite pigmented
especially like the Reds and stuff but
then they're also quite shiny and
slippery so I find that they just don't
stay on the lips well I don't like the
texture of them I feel like there's so
many other things out there and I wish
that I dunno crazy and by like every
color of these I've decluttered
since then but he's just went actually
that good when we go back and realize
all the hype that was around these like
was it deserved no no it wasn't so I
just regret getting so many of these
instead of just enjoying a couple colors
like wanting to just collect all of them
last one for this video this is the
fresh sugar lip balm this happens to be
in the color plum but I just regret
buying the little mini kits of these I
bought them the last two Christmases so
I have quite a few of these little
suckers hanging around and the packaging
on these for the product does not work
the product is such a soft soft product
and this is my favorite lip balm I love
the regular tinted treat not Tintin I
love the regular lip like treatment from
them it's my favorite lip balm but in
the small form these just get so soft
and by the end they're like all over the
place they're messy they just this
packaging
in the little one sucks for him and
that's how I have most of them I wish
that I would have saved that money and
just bought the couple shades that I
think would work for me instead of
wanting to try everything and then
having them in this packaging and not
really wanting to use them because
they're just messy and yeah I wish I'd
just bought all of the regular ones and
had backups or something okay guys that
is everything for this video I hope you
enjoyed it obviously every one of these
videos is very personal to the person
saying them talking about these products
not all of these products are just bad
they're just things that I regret
purchasing and I wish weren't in my
collection and if I could go back in
time I would not buy them I hope you
enjoyed anyways and I will see you guys
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
