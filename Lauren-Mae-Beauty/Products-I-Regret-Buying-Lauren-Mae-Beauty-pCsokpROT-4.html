Lauren this is going to be a products I
forgot buying video I did with these
videos about a year ago a little over a
year ago in October of 2015
I literally just finished watching that
video and it was very scary
I mean I'd still me but the lighting
just so much has changed and it's just
funny watching back so I'll have that
link down below if you want to check out
another products I were gonna find video
it was the only other one I've done
besides this one now we don't need a
disclaimer right I think we're all
adults here these are all products that
I regret buying either cuz they suck or
because I just don't get the use out of
them that I wish I did proud expense if
they were I'll do palettes first because
they're my favorite and so it's really
really sad to me when I just don't like
a palette I'm just gonna throw out the
first one here I literally just got this
in the mail yesterday
and I regret it I was really hoping
against every hope and everything I'd
ever seen this is gonna be good and I
regret purchasing this because it's just
not worth $44 this is not worth $44
pigmentation on this just isn't it's
just not there enough for me to to like
it I know it's a pastel palette and I
get that but I just I don't know I don't
know I would have been fine without it
I'm realizing so I kind of don't suggest
anyone pick it up I just don't think
that many people would be happy with
this palette and it makes me really sad
cuz I'm down for Laura but this palette
just needed a little bit more
pigmentation and it just wasn't there
for me so me sad while the next one's
gonna be super sad too I contemplated
putting this in this video but if I'm
being a hundred percent true with myself
the Kat Von D male matte palette is a
regret for me personally I don't have
issues with the quality of this palette
I know a lot of people do I think this
was a great palette I think the quality
is really nice it's just the color
selection for me isn't my ideal colors I
basically like love these three colors
and like some of the lighter shimmery
shades but I feel like the pastel goth
what if totally it basically gives me
these
a little bit more pigmented and not as
pastel as this so I don't need this
whole palette I'm definitely gonna keep
it in my collection because I think it's
nice and I am a pro makeup artist so I
do have like other people that I can
potentially be buying stuff for I try
not to use that as an excuse just to buy
everything but when I'm getting rid of
something or something doesn't work for
me if the quality is so good a lot of
the times I'll just put it with my like
pro stuff so that way it's not in my own
collection but I don't want to ever have
to like repurchase something that's in
this palette because I got rid of this
palette because I didn't like it or
didn't use it if that makes sense I had
a whole video on that and I did like it
I thought the quality was nice I was
excited to get it and it's just the
regret comes in for the amount of use
I've gotten out of it I've seriously
used like only half of the mattes in
that palette and it's just not enough
for the price for me so it's just not
it's just not my favorite but just that
the last palette is kind of similar this
is from Tarte it's the showstopper
palette I really liked the rainforest
after dark palette so when this came out
I was like oh that's really pretty
and I think the shades are really pretty
if you're someone who really likes
neutrals I feel like these are a mix
between cool and neutral tones and
nothing too warm really but you could
use this coral and really warm up the
crease if you wanted I just don't get
the use out of this that I should I keep
this because again it's really nice for
like soft glam looks like in my kit and
stuff the shadow pigmentation isn't bad
or anything it's not a me palette for
short it's just something that I
definitely would have been totally fine
without and this is just kind of
expensive to have some neutrals laying
around so those are just my regrets I
feel like I would be totally fine if I
didn't have this in my collection so
that's the reason I'm just like me I
couldn't not spend that money and if you
add up how much money all that is it's
like what 130 dollars one hundred fifty
dollars that's a lot of money I would
like that back that would be awesome to
have that back like when you think about
it that way I would death
you have those shipped off and have that
money back you know this is what's left
so oh I do have another little pallet I
just don't consider drugstore pallets
pallets but this is gonna go in here
this is the blush nudes I did a five
first impressions of Maybelline products
I'll leave it linked down below if you
wanna check it out in that video I was
talking about like I don't think this is
the worst quality ever I really I truly
don't let me swatch a few things for you
I really don't think this is the worst
quality ever I have so much in my
collection I don't need this you know
what I mean I don't suggest basically
anyone who loves like YouTube have this
but if someone's just a simple girl
simple woman she's in the store she sees
this I think she could get some really
soft looks it's just there's no punch of
pigmentation at all this is like very
soft very similar looks even if you're
using the different shadows and I just
think it's kind of expensive for that
you know I have some like sponge
application type of products here these
are both from Beauty Blender and this is
the blush Beauty Blender and this is the
little like micro mini I do not
understand the need for little sponges
honestly I never use a little sponge in
my kit I would just use a brush I don't
use them on myself I've tried to make
this one work I just don't understand it
I don't think that they work well I
don't think they're worth the money I
just think the Beauty Blender original
the shape of it it works for anything
you need it to like it can get why the
areas it can get small areas with the
tip like it's just it's all-in-one if
it's done we're done I don't need any
other things
I appreciate brands trying to evolve and
come out with new products but I just
don't think these are good and I don't
think they're worth the money that being
said I also tried this silly sponge now
mine's pink which I thought was really
cute because it looks like the Beauty
Blender I was super excited to try this
I saw so many pretty much I mean I feel
like all the reviews were pretty good no
this is not good like it's not good the
only thing I could think about this
being good is the fact that you aren't
gonna lose any product when you're
putting you know
foundation on your face but to me the
whole point of a brush and a
Beautyblender is that they help control
the product those products just smooth
the foundation onto your skin so much
better and I personally like that they
suck up a little bit of product because
you can actually get a more controlled
application and for me and how I use the
Beauty Blender I like that it puts the
right amount of product on my face but
not too much product and this is just
there's smearing stuff on your face it's
hard to get into the crevices mm-hmm
this is your fingers like I I'm just
like this is so gimmicky the other thing
I can see this though for is like
initial application like to dot it all
over but I would never use this to
actually blend anything in no not a fan
I don't think it's worth it I know it's
still pretty cheap it's like usually
under ten dollars but save your money
just get the regular Beauty Blender I'm
telling you once you bite the bullet you
will be so happy because fabula is a
miracle tool I love it this is something
that I don't think a lot of you guys
have seen or heard of this is an a high
def mattifying spray a lot of people in
the industry will use this to kind of
like set makeup and mattify without
using a powder especially for like super
close-ups or just different things it's
just nice to have a product that's more
invisible on the skin let me see if I
get this to spray I don't know if you
saw that but it's like a jet stream
it'll like spray and I like you'll shoot
your eye out you'll spray your eye out
with this this sprayer on this just gets
clogged by whatever product happens to
be in here you are supposed to shake it
really really well and I tried to do
that so maybe it's my fault and I didn't
shake it well enough but I still don't
think that's an okay thing and also I
did use this on someone with a darker
complexion and you can see like a white
residue so that was like a scary
situation for me luckily I mean I caught
it but I'm like not good I don't like
that I'd rather use the mayor on anti
shines or just products like that
instead of a spray so I don't suggest it
the next product is a blush this is from
benefit and it's sugar bomb I just don't
like this color and I'm down for some
warm colors this is just ugly I can
never make this work it barely shows up
but when it does I just
don't like it and it's very weird to me
I hate that there's like a purple color
in the top there like everything about
this is just ugly
it's just ugly I know that's so harsh
but that's exactly how I feel about this
the longer I have it the more I feel
that way I'm I'm getting rid of this and
I'm excited that it's gonna be gone
because it's ugly
the next product I have to talk about is
the Rimmel stay matte now I mentioned
this because I was trying to use this up
in 2016 and obviously that didn't happen
because there's a ton loved this is just
so thick and moosie and sits on the skin
and just is really bad it's super bad
well this is like the definition of a
foundation that just no one needs in
their life when I mentioned how much I
hated this in the video everyone agreed
with me so not alone this is pretty fair
it's really pink toned but no it's just
so bad I really don't see that working
on anyone and I have oily skin which I
feel like that's who I'd be for so if
you have dry skin oh my gosh it's gonna
look horrible on you I just think it was
kind of a bust that one is just like not
a good product I can't wait to see what
other type of Matt products they come
out with but that one's not good I have
a little product here this is something
I talked about in an empties video
because I'm getting rid of it but I knew
I was wanting to film this video so I
wanted to save it oh my gosh I forgot to
have another palette don't let me forget
I'm gonna go get that right after this
let's finish with the lip product though
this is from L'Oreal it's in choco Lac
or something gross I mentioned how I
hated that name so it's not a good name
now this product seems like it'd be
really pretty but I just feel like the
colour is misleading like I don't feel
like this these colors don't match right
so that's like the first no-go for me
and then second when this wears away and
as you wear it it turns like hot pink on
my lips it's like the Revlon color balm
stain color stain balm whatever those
are called and honey does the same thing
to me it's like a pretty color but as it
wears away it's like bright pink and
that's like not what I signed up for so
I just don't like deceiving lip products
I already have a hard time with lip
products I'm someone who's like a lip
balm girl and go the ones that stain
like that it's just like no one has time
for it and just like false advertising
I'm super glad I caught this how will
how could I forget to bring this one
over
is the bomb a petite pallet this is kind
of what sparked this whole thing for me
oh I'm not a fan I think the colors are
pretty but they're kind of weird - I
don't know what possessed me to buy this
I did get this half off because I bought
it at a pro store so maybe even like
discount on it just like mess with my
mind I don't know
uh I like okay to me this palette why
can I get rid of them here that's better
to me this palette works for like these
colors and this color wise and maybe you
could throw that in I guess but this is
just hug Lee to me I think this is like
the weirdest color ever it's like this
green gray gold pewter it's the
freakiest color I like hate that color
also a lot of these have like sparkle to
them like this shade which is one of my
favorites it looks nice right it's like
the one shade that performs but it does
have a bit of like a glitter in it I
tried so hard this is just not the same
formula as other the balm palettes like
these are dry and Scratchy
I just I'm not inspired by this palette
I don't think it was a good release on
their part I think the packaging is cute
I just wish more thought had gone into
it oh I'm holding it upside down this
entire time it's just my mother mm-hmm
no I wanted to like it couldn't like it
couldn't do it and I think that's like
the difference to me between this
palette and the lorac palette is the
colors are there are so pretty to me and
the formula is nice it's just lacking in
pigmentation it's just not quite there I
just wanted like just knock it up like
two more punches and I feel like I can
definitely be happy with it because they
are pastels whereas this one just like
the pigmentation is sometimes there and
sometimes not the formula is not good
the color selection is weird it's not
inspiring whereas that one is like
that's like the worst one out of
everything here I'm really disappointed
with that I just feel like they can I
know they can do better so it's like why
aren't you you know like why is that
palette out there I think I might have
said I only had one
the product I lie to have two more the
first one here is the Burt's Bees of
flavor crystals lip balm I got tropical
pineapple
I bought this will meet in Sam work in
San Francisco and I thought this is just
so cute oh it's new I wanted to get it
you're on vacation it was fun this just
isn't moisturizing enough to me it
smells like pineapple but it also has
almost like this like off scent I don't
know why and then the flavor crystals in
here make it really gritty and almost
exfoliating it's just not a good lip
balm my favorite lip balm is the fresh
lip balm I know it's expensive but I
told Sam the other day I was like I
can't wait till I can just I have like
no other lip balms and I can just get
that one because that one's like my
favorite it's just the best it smells
good it feels good it's just work it's
worth it to me like I would rather spend
$22 on a lip balm have it for six months
it works great amazing I love it didn't
have a bunch of these little crappy ones
that don't feel nearly as nice and
really don't do the job the next one is
from Wet n Wild this is also in my wet
mile like first impressions and it's
just clear it has like really no scent
to it it's just kind of greasy it's just
not that good I don't know it's just
like a crappy lip balm once again I just
want to call any lip balm I just maybe I
have high expectations for lip balm
since that's mostly what I wear I don't
normally wear like you know a super
colorful lip product so no I don't
suggest either of those the last two
products are eyeliners and I have one
high-end in one drugstore for high-end
let's start there this is almost gone I
used quite a bit of it this is Urban
Decay's perversion this is really black
I'll give it I'll give it that it is
it's super black here's a little swatch
isse woowoo swatches swatch of it and it
is a pretty color
I mean it's black but it's really black
whatever this does not stay in my
waterline or my tight line it like
transfers out and gets in the inner
corner and outer corner which is just
irritating to me this also leaves like a
film over my eyes I don't know what it
is but this just makes my eyes feel like
I am like literally going blind in that
moment
oh my gosh it's happening you know
finally I'm not gonna be able to see
that's what this makes you feel like and
that's not good this is the same exact
thing this is from Maybelline it is the
lasting drama waterproof gel pencil
it looks really pigmented in a swatch
but on the waterline it does not perform
you can barely see it and again this
makes me have a film over my eyes I hate
that feeling that's part of the reason I
not only do I not like wearing step on
my like actual waterline when it comes
to like dark stuff because my eyes are
quite small and I don't want to close
them off but I also just hate the
feeling of having stuff in my eyes I
just oh that's gross who likes that I
mean I don't think anyone likes it I
especially don't I'm that's like a deal
breaker like get out of my house this is
just a no-go I don't suggest it and I
probably I mean I'm guessing the rest of
the formulas are like this so don't get
it that's everything for my
disappointing products video I hope you
guys enjoyed these are just some of the
things that I've either had for a long
time and finally and like coming to
terms with myself like yeah I don't like
it or they're newer and you know they're
just not quite working out I think that
these videos are just as helpful if not
more helpful than favorites videos
because it's talking about things that
maybe you know other people don't want
to talk about the thing is everyone's
just like I know a lot of people don't
like these or I know that a lot of
people you know don't like the
negativity that's not true these are
super popular videos everyone likes to
hear about it so don't try to lie to me
and say you don't like it you love this
everyone likes it I want to know I want
to know what you don't like as much as I
want to know what you do that's
everything let me know if you like some
these products or didn't if there's
something I can maybe do differently to
like them but I feel like most of these
products I mean it's not an error of use
it's just like they're not my thing
personally or they just kind of do suck
so anyway that's everything guys I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
