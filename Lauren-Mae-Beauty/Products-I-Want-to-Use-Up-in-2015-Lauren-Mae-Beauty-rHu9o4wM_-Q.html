freaking me out that I can have so many
products in these project pans and still
have so so so many things this video
here is going to be the products make up
items that I want to use up in 2015 I
don't know if people are calling this
like use-it-or-lose-it or project use it
up or I don't know what they're calling
it but that's what this is so this isn't
gonna include any lip products I'm gonna
do a whole separate video on that
because I'm kind of trying to purge a
lot of those this year so yeah I'm just
gonna get straight into it oh my gosh so
much crap one of the items that I want
to use up this year is the benefit stay
flawless 15 hour primer I bought this at
Sephora I was going in to buy the
Porefessional hat and try it again I
went in to get that and then the sales
associate convinced me to get this
instead and I definitely don't like it
as much as that that is how much product
I've used up of it not very much
this just feels like I'm putting a glue
stick on my face and I don't like that
it kind of feels like that throughout
the day as well so I'm twisting this up
right now so you guys can see sadly how
much product I have to use up of this
ouch
lots and lots of product it's basically
almost full but I'm gonna have a whole
year so it's not like a big deal I just
want to use it up a lot of people were
saying that theirs was like oh my gosh
mine is too it's like cracking and it
like falls out because it's just not
it's not sealed properly the product I
just this is expensive and I bought it
without like a sale without a kit
without any type of discount so I only
have my money's worth out of it even
though I don't like it and and get that
on my collection this year another
primer that I want to use up is this one
this is the maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser this is not my favorite
primer I have used quite a bit of it
there's some air I think in there but I
can kind of pinch it pinch it down to
about right there this is just too slick
on my face I feel like it doesn't ever
like set and so my makeup can just kind
of move around even though yeah I might
fill in my pores but if it's moving
around it's not doing me any good so I
just want to get through it maybe use it
with another primer or something I know
it's not like a super expensive one but
I still want to get rid of it this is a
color pop shadow in the color lovely
I'll swatch it for you
it's a Goldy sparkly color really
neutral so I feel like I can definitely
wear this like every single day um and
I'm wearing it today on my eyeballs it's
super pretty and I think this would be
just a fun one to use up I guess I have
quite a few of the color pop eyeshadows
because they're so cheap and I order
like a billion naturally might be cool
just to get through one and these are
creamish
so I want to use it up before it goes
bad I have to like real cream eyeshadows
I want to use up this is the Maybelline
Color tattoo in the color Bailey Brandon
I've already hit pan on this item a
while ago and then I put it away because
I did but these just dry up so fast so I
just want to get get it gone and make
sure that I use it up all the way before
it dries out completely again it's a
great color I do like this product I
just personally would probably go
high-end and have something that I don't
feel like I have to rush through to use
up this is another cream eyeshadow this
is another one of those little tart ones
this isn't a color sleep though so it is
kind of like a pewter e gray
taupey color swatch it for you I thought
this would be just a little different
than the other ones and a little bit
more of a challenge kind of it's still
super light I mean don't get me wrong I
thought this would be pretty on lazy
days just all over the eye by itself or
you could darken it out or you can put
light your shadows on top of it you can
really just do whatever you want with it
just want to get another little cream
shadow out of my collection my makeup
inventory will be up soon so you can see
like what my goals are but I definitely
want to cut down my cream shadow
collection this is a weird product this
is a steal a one-step prime color in the
color kitten I don't really know what
the heck this is for why I really wanted
this I got it off like a discount site
it's not like it cost me a ton of money
but it's just weird I don't know you
can't even
see the swatch I don't know if it's used
for a primer on the eyes I think you can
use it as a primer on the eyes lip color
eye shadow cheek color in a luxurious
formula it's just it doesn't do anything
so I just want to use it up I know I
probably should just start away but
something about this makes anyone use it
up so probably use it as an eye primer
slash eyelid color lots of cream stuff
on my eyelids this year this is where
I'm at on it so um yeah I mean I put a
little bit of a dent going on in there
so hopefully it won't be too bad by the
end of the year to use that guy up this
is a little mini or I don't know if it's
mini or this is the regular size that
this is a concealer by bare minerals in
the color bisque it is a powder
concealer I am if we turn it to the side
like about halfway with it and I just
I've had this for a while and I just
never reach for it I don't reach for
powder concealers I like the bright one
for the under eye but this is just like
a regular one so I'm trying to be really
really creative on how to use this
product up since it's not something I
gravitate to so if you guys have any
ideas leave them down below so I can
kind of maybe you know use those and
work through this a little better this
one's kind of a big one this is my
starlooks brow palette in the color bs1
I use this color right here for my brows
now but yeah I want to just it wanted
all gone it's kind of like my mini pan
that palette I want to use up this one
for my brows and use this one for my
brows as well this darker shade I want
to use as like a transition like a
deeper outer V color and this one I'm
gonna use also as a transition color and
then this white one I want to use under
the brow bone I have a plan for it I
definitely think I can I mean I've
already hit major pan on this one so I
think I can do it and it'd just be nice
to get actually all the worth out of
this guy instead of just the one brow
powder why not find ways to use all of
them up they're all matte color so you
know they're super useful that'll feel
really good to see four empty eyeshadow
cans this one is a blush from Michael
Todd this isn't
lilia and it's just a really nice dusty
rose pinky blush
nothing really honestly too special
about it that's it there but it's just a
really nice natural blush and it's kind
of powdery so I don't think I'll have a
problem using it up and it's quite small
as well I haven't used it all that much
by itself
now's the time now's the time to use it
so that'll be that'll feel good to use
up a blush I've never used up a blush
before a million liners in here so be
prepared to finish with anything that's
not a liner or like a cream shadow this
is the Urban Decay tinted moisturizer in
the color halo I've had this for a while
now
it's basically full I just want to get
through this
only it's supposedly on like six months
is how long you have to use this up and
it's been a lot longer than that
the consistency hasn't changed and it
still smells fine so I'm not worried
about that but I just know that soon
soon and very soon this product is going
to be you know obsolete and not able to
use so I want to get my wear out of this
I did get it on sale off the websites if
not get paid full price but I don't care
I still want my money's worth this is a
mini Stila
Oliver shimmer duo in the color kitten I
did not know at first that this was
actually like a highlighter I thought
this was an eyeshadow duo so that's how
I was using it for a while and I do have
some pretty good dips in it I might go
back to using it that way if it helps me
use it up more it's just little it's a
baby so hopefully I can do that and get
somewhere under this I got this in like
a Sephora kit a couple years ago so it's
time to go this is the lorac 3d liquid
lustre and gold I did have to revive
this with mac's fix+ because it was all
the way like dried out so I want to get
my use out of this one because yeah it's
already been a goner once I brought it
back from the dead and I don't have to
do that again this one here it looks
disgusting sorry this is just a Tarte
powder it was like a free gift with
purchase and it is the provocateur
pressed mineral powder in light I don't
honestly think they make this powder
anymore I'm not really sure but I just
want to use this up I was using this for
a while and it's like
running powder even though it's just a
sample size so this has to go this year
I'm throwing it away everything else
after this is a liner so this is the
Rimmel scandaleyes in the color
bulletproof beige that's it right there
this formulation does stay on my lids so
I don't need a primer anything with it
so I just want to use it up I already
have used quite a bit of it I want to
see some progress on this I have I don't
think I have a problem with like chubby
pencils like eyeshadow pencils but I
just want to use this one up since it's
an easy color and then just like an
overview of all the liners it's kind of
crazy the bulk of them are gonna be
these liners here these liners are from
Stila they are like the convertible
color eyeliners and I have five
different shades here so the first shade
this is the color indigo that's how much
I have to use there these are how big
most of them are like that's like the
full size cause I haven't used this one
these are called convertible colors
because they do have like a powder on
the other side that you can kind of like
top the liner with or I don't know I'm
not worried about using that part up I
don't really care about that part so I'm
just worried about the liner and if I
use that up I would feel good about it
this is a lilac that's how much I have
to use there this one is in the color
violet that's how much I have to use
there that's what I have left of cheek
and the last color is called berry
even though they are kind of all
colorful they're not that colorful so I
feel like I'm just getting the most
neutrals and get them used up I have
three full size liners I want to use up
this one is a Mary Kay one this isn't a
bronze color
it's called bronze so I have that much
the end stops right here I am wearing
this one today on my lower lash line
it's super pretty and it brings out the
blue in my eyes I'm super excited to use
of all these liners actually a lot of my
liners are Urban Decay ones because I
bought like the Oh - loco twice and you
get them in all the kits and you know
they always are handing out free liners
so it would be great to get some of
those used up on but these ones are kind
of
the older one so those are gonna be my
focus next year these ones I think will
be good for this year this is a tarte
emphasize aqua gel eyeliner in a brown
color it doesn't have a name on it this
I can't roll up and let you guys know
what how much is in it because it is so
creamy when I see that this liner is
creamy I mean like it's like almost too
bad that's it there it's super pigmented
it is would be like an aqua gel but it
is like it's just so creamy tight it's
hard to work with it's like oops out or
breaks off it's not my favorite it's not
practical to me I want to get through
with this because it is I mean in a way
nice quality it just doesn't work for me
so I want to get through that this year
this came in one of my aah Nastasia
palette this is just the black eyeliner
the covet waterproof eyeliner in doir
this starts right where my finger is
so that's all the products I have to use
up that's just black I'll probably use
this on my tight line like I do with
black and then I have three mini liners
to use up and then this will be my
project pan so one of those is the
Smashbox limitless eyeliner and this is
just a black color it's called onyx I've
had this since like I first started
using makeup it's been a really really
really long time
I want to just get this one out of this
collection I like this it's a drier
formula but I'm not necessarily opposed
to that sometimes I can make it stay
longer it's a mini so it shouldn't be
too hard to use up this is like a mini
little aqua eyes makeup forever one it's
black I got it as a sample so I think I
can use that one up and then this is the
buxom inside eyeliner eyeliner insider
eyeliner eyeliner and this is in the
color black Jasper but that's all the
product that's in there so that's it not
too too too much again this should be
like an easy one to just kind of fly
through whew thanks for sitting through
that with me guys those are gonna be all
the products I want to use up in 2015
