learned this is going to be a products
I've hit pan on video I've done one of
these for eyeshadow and I could have
sworn that I did one for other products
like face products but I could not find
it I searched my channel couldn't find
that video so I think maybe filmed it
and just deleted it I'm not really sure
so if I have filmed this and for some
reason I'm just not the Sherlock Holmes
I think I am please forgive me I'm not
trying to like repeat products but
someone requested me to do a products I
hit pan on and I thought that it would
be fun I will leave the eyeshadow one
down below because these will be all
face products let's just get into it
I'll stop rambling and we'll look at all
the things I've hit pan on so first off
I have the pure four-in-one foundation
you guys know I really like this
foundation and this is my second one of
these actually this is a great powder
foundation if you're looking for
something I really like the way it goes
on the skin I do have really oily skin
though so it doesn't combat that but if
you have like dry skin or even just
combo skin you might really like this
and it probably won't make you Olli I'm
just like a grease monster this is a
palette from Tarte and if you've been on
YouTube a long time you guys all know
about this this is the blush palette
that started at all mine is a little
beat up because I do spray this with
alcohol and just different products to
disinfect the powders because I do use
this in my kit and I have hit pan on the
brown shade I like to use this as just
like an all-over bronzer type of color
also just warm up the skin when you're
doing someone where you're getting them
ready and then you put them on set their
skin with the lighting and all that
sometimes it just needs a little bit of
warmth and that's definitely a way I
used a lot of this up but I just in
general love this palette on set it's so
nice I get a lot of use out of this this
is a blush from laura geller
and it is in the color bora-bora you can
see the little bit of a pan there since
it is baked it's on like a terra cotta
plate i believe is what they usually
bake them on but I really love this
blush it's so pretty and I enjoyed
hitting pan on this throughout this
video you will see some highlighters
this one's from bareMinerals and it is
in the color the love affair and it's
just smack dab in the middle there
pan I was working on this last year
toward the end of the year and I love
this highlighter I've been talking in
the last couple videos that I'm not
really into like a super metallic
highlight and this one just gives a
really nice glow and Sheen to the skin
without looking just like too frosty
everyone has your own style but I
personally just find that those look so
beautiful
on so many different skin tones and so
many different skin types that I just
prefer that look so this is one of those
really good more natural-looking
highlighters this is a product from it
cosmetics and it is the CC plus radiance
ombre bronzer and as you can see up here
I've hit pan on the bronzer side I
haven't been using this a ton lately I
use this a lot a couple years ago so I
want to kind of expand the pan on this I
know amber F I believe is panning this
or has panned part of this the thing is
mine I feel like wasn't very um braids
like it's like highlighter highlighter
Oh finally some bronzer I don't feel
like it was super cut off so it kind of
makes it hard for me to use this up
that's a lot of highlighter but I really
haven't given this highlighter a chance
so maybe it'll be one of those really
good ones that I like this is a powder
from black opal and I have repressed it
but I hit pan on it and there is still
pan in there I use this on set I love
this powder so much because it works on
all different skin tones so even people
with darker complexions this is not
gonna leave a gray or white cast on
their skin and I find that for film I
have to continuously mattify people and
so guys don't have like a lot of makeup
on they have a little bit just to like
color correct or even out their skin or
just hide anything that's really jarring
on the face if they have anything that's
jarring but anyway this powder I find
just I can get in there with a little
sponge or a brush and really Pat away
any shine without leaving any trace of
color on all skin tones which is what
I'm talking about so I actually have
another one of these I need to finish
this one up but sometimes it's just
easier to have a new compact these are
only nine dollars - which is amazing
this is a spoiler for my 12 pans of
Christmas but I did hit pan on my butt
bronzor I was wondering I thought it was
gonna hit pan it so much sooner than I
did so I thought maybe the pan was
really deep but I have hit pan I really
like this it's what I'm using today I
just think this is so good I'm
definitely gonna repurchase I find that
it just warms up my skin I like it as
like a nose contour I'm just like into
this bronzer I love it more bronzers
this is a little pan of hoola bronzer
from benefit I need to just suck it up
and finish this I've been working on it
this year though so in between different
bronzers I've been using I just need to
repress it and get this out of here so
that's probably something I'm gonna work
on next year this next product I have to
be pretty gentle with because it's the
Sephora bronzer and this is it I did hit
pan on this section but as you can see
there are ridges in the pan and that
caused it to be very just unstable once
I hit pan on it so I can't really travel
with this but I do really like this
bronzer it's a really good one this is
the Boyne concealer from Benefit and I
hit pan on this a long time ago there's
barely any products left in the corners
I'm trying to finish this up by the end
of the year but I thought I'd mention
that why not I only have like four more
products left really so this is
something that's more recent and it's
the Sephora and Pantone blush palette
and this was when the color was radiant
orchid and I hit pan on the highlighter
shade in here I was working on this in
my finish 13 by Halloween this
highlighter is kind of a shimmery as I
like to go
it looks just a nice and gives a nice
Sheen but again it's not like a straight
up foiled shadow on your cheekbones so
this is really pretty but it's limited
edition so you can't really get it sorry
another thing that if you follow me a
lot you've seen this is my Smashbox
contour kit and I am proud of this
mother
this one is beat up yes I loved this to
death it's almost dead this is the
contour color I'm almost done with it
again I'm trying to finish that by the
end of the year this was the
highlighting powder I really liked it
and this was the bronzer and I really
liked it so I'm almost done with this
entire palette last two products this is
another highlighter this is probably one
of my favorite highlighters ever this is
a Laura Geller baked highlighter in
French vanilla this is the bottom of the
pan there if you can see that like
Honeycomb kind of texture I really like
this it's so nice if you have more
mature skin and you're looking for a
highlighter that will just look good
this will look great
if you have skin this will look
beautiful I just love this umm I really
highly suggest this and that is what I'm
wearing today if you are wondering glass
this is my brow quad and this is from
starlooks
and I've hit pan on well technically
three of the shades this one's
completely used up but these are my two
brow powders that I go back and forth on
I usually use this lighter more warm
tone shade at the beginning of the brows
and then I'll use the darker shade at
the tail I go back and forth using this
so I'm either using it a ton or not
using it so eventually this will be gone
I feel like it'll hang on a couple more
years honestly though those are all the
products I've hit pan on guys I hope you
enjoyed this video again I hope it
wasn't too repetitive hopefully I can do
another one of these and a couple of
months or so once I hit pan on some more
products if you're someone who really
likes these videos and really enjoys
hitting pan I definitely suggest
checking out other people in the project
panning community and I also suggest
trying to project pan yourself because a
lot of the pan that I've hit that I've
shown you in this video I hit because I
was project panning and trying to hit
pan on those products and feels really
good to get a really solid idea other if
you like a product or if you don't like
a product and to also get your money's
worth out of a product I feel like on
some of these bigger ticket items and
products that you use all over your face
like blushes highlighters bronzers it's
hard to use them up but at least if I
hit pan on it one I know if I like it or
not and I also feel like I got my
money's worth out of it and either can
pass it on or continue to use it if I
love it so anyway I thought I would just
mention that at the end I will see you
guys in my next video I hope you're
having a wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
