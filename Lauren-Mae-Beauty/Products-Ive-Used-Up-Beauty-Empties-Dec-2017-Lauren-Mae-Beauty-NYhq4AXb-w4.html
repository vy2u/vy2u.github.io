Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is my first video back from all my
pre film videos I'm super excited so I'm
gonna film just a couple of like updates
and things like that and then I'm going
to be filming it get ready with me
tomorrow so we can chitchat and talk
besides that I'm gonna get into the
empties I'm gonna start off with an
empties video something that is
something I know it feels so weird I've
been gone for like two weeks so I
haven't filmed in a while anyway these
are the items that I used up in the
month of December it's kind of like
month for me because I usually I'm
usually here more I was gone for two
weeks like I said already so I don't
have quite as many items as I normally
do so it's gonna be a short sweet video
stay tuned though for my other videos
coming up I have my 12 pins of Christmas
finale and I also have like a haul in
retrospect so yeah stay tuned for those
and let's get into the undies
okay I just dropped a thing in my
bathroom it was like a hair serum so
there's just like oil everywhere it's on
my floor
there were even like glass shards - so
I'm like scared I'm gonna be cut up like
in the middle and I have to pee in the
dark and then you get cut by a bunch of
glass cuz you broke a bottle
you know the classic situation anyway
first item here let's talk about soaps
because I love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works soaps
this is the fall lakeside breeze it was
okay I thought this stuff was nice but
it's not that memorable so I probably
won't necessarily get it again like it's
not what I'm like big good of but it was
nice it was like a fresh kind of fall
scent so glad I used it up something
that you guys know I absolutely love
this is the Moroccan oil dry shampoo and
this was amazing and I have another one
already this is even my second more
third time using this up so I really
enjoy this it's expensive but I do think
it's really nice and I love the smell
I'm showing you guys this in the empties
instead of my project use it up because
I'm going to be starting a brand new
project use it up for the new year I had
some items that I kind of just they just
fell off the face of the earth so I'm
gonna let you guys know about those
through empties and I just thought they
should start fresh like I'm just
constantly learning about myself and I'm
always in different moods but I think
just starting French for the new year
will be the best anyway this was in that
project pan and I did use it up it's the
coconut water
it's from pearl essence and it's a
hydrating face mist I think this is
supposed to be like kind of modeled
after the herbivore or before products I
think anyway I enjoyed this I got it at
Marshall's for like $6 great great price
I love the bottle it's actually glass
I'm probably gonna actually reuse this
bottle because they like it that much so
I do suggest that if you happen to find
it there this serum is like seriously
this serum is seriously everywhere okay
cotton ions I finished one of those up
you guys know they're the slippers I do
enjoy them I wanted to put this in here
this is a weird one this is the wellness
formula herbal defense complex these are
pills that me and Sam take if we're
starting to feel sick you can also take
them every single day if you wanted but
we usually start like if we start
feeling ill we'll start taking these I
really enjoy this I basically just
emptied this bottle into the massive
bottle that we had so I suggest this if
you're looking for like a more natural
way to kind of keep your immune system
up or you want to like fight off some
stuff I honestly do think this helps me
get not as sick if I do take it like
actually you know before I start getting
sick so anyway I really like that
thought I'd mention it I actually have
quite a few makeup items which quite a
few is three makeup items I don't know
why I didn't start with that sorry guys
the first one here this is from oh gosh
there's just junk all over me okay I'm
getting creeped out by myself anyway
this is the colour-pop brow boss brow
pencil in the shade blonde I have had a
love-hate relationship with this and
I've decided that I absolutely love it I
have it in my brows today I actually
repurchase this and I have two backups
in one I'm using now because I like it
that much so I do highly suggest this
this is a waxy pencil formula I think
it's very comparable to the Anastasia
brow Wiz and I love the color of this
because it is so light I don't go too
dark when it comes to like this inner
portion of my brows and that's what I
love the most about it so I really do
like that another product that I
absolutely love this is the Urban Decay
perversion
Scarah I have had quite a few minutes of
this and I finally bought myself the big
one so I have that waiting in the wings
of my mascara drawer I'm just trying to
work through a few other ones I brought
them all to Arizona with me if you guys
watch the makeup I brought to Arizona
then you saw that but I have just so
many right now and I'm actually figuring
out which formulas I like which formulas
I don't because some of them are just
like they look so great but they're
flaky and I can't stand it I cannot wait
to open the big one definitely would
repurchase have repurchased it's super
great and last for makeup this is a
concealer from Milani it's the retouch
and erase light lifting concealer I have
the shade fair and I actually really
love this concealer the packaging is not
my favorite I don't like the sponge tip
and it's got me a really dirty in there
but the product itself I really like the
way it goes on the under eye I did
repurchase this when I was in Arizona
before the new year because I just
didn't have any concealers that I just I
loved plus I'm pretty fair right now and
I need something quite light to go under
my under eyes so I don't know I feel
like the formula is different from this
one to that one and I don't know if it's
because that one is the real one and
this one was bad I opened this quite a
bit after I had already bought it
like probably good six months I bought
it and I just had it in packaging for a
really long time that I finally opened
it so I don't know if I love the one I'm
using now as much as I loved this one
which i think is really strange but um
anyway I would repurchase this one I
have a purchased it but I'm not sure if
I like it or if I just got a dud or
what's going on I have some skincare
type of things this is a hand cream from
L'Occitane and this one is in the 20%
shea butter hand cream formula this is a
rose scented one this is really really
old I don't know how it didn't go off
but I'm really excited because this is
the oldest hand cream I had so now I'm
free to use the Crabtree and Evelyn ones
that I absolutely love and they're brand
new and I'm excited to try so it can
actually bus some of those out I did use
one of them up but now I can like feel
free to use as many as I want but I do
love the locks of tong one I think it's
great this is something that took
forever for me to finish it was like a
love hate love hate relationship product
it's the olay regenerist micro-sculpting
cream this one has SPF 30 I got it at
Costco in a two pack for $30 at the end
through the ups and downs I think
overall I do really like this
moisturizer I like it for the day
because it has the SPF it doesn't like
me to oily but it gives me a lot of
moisture especially for I feel like the
winter time for my oily skin it smells
like Garnier Fructis like conditioner so
it's kind of strange at first but it
smells good so I potentially would
repurchase this I just think that's so
much money for a drugstore it's like I'm
either gonna spend probably a lot more
money or a lot less like I I don't know
it's just kind of like a medium price
range that I'm not I mean they're like
going for gold or I am like you know
it's saving the money so it was okay I
potentially would repurchase it and if
you were looking into it I would
recommend it I have a many of these
simple micellar cleansing water I really
like this this is what I use to take off
my eye makeup every single night I love
that it's a water type formula instead
of something oily so yeah it's great
this is something I actually truly loved
it's the it by my under eye eye cream
this is a really great eye cream for a
night time if you're looking for
something that's moisturizing I don't
like anything that like feels like it's
getting into my eyes or leaves my eyes
goopy in the morning and this was just
such a nice little sample I would
potentially repurchase this this is one
of the best eye creams I used last year
and I just thought it was hydrating
without feeling like it was sitting on
top of my skin even though it was quite
moisturizing so I highly recommend this
I thought this was really nice and last
I have a little toothpaste this one is
from quick you guys know that I got the
quick tooth brush I will be having a
video on that at some point soon but I
used up the mini travel toothpaste
because I brought this with me to
Arizona and me and Sam used it it's
supposed to last you two weeks and it
lasted us almost the whole time for us
both using it so I think that's pretty
nice I really love the taste of this
toothpaste it's kind of herbal but it's
minty too I don't know I really enjoy it
I was actually like sad when this was
gone I was like no we have to use a
different toothpaste so I would suggest
like if you're looking into qyp or you
want to try like a good toothpaste I
really
like this I know it's weird but I did
like it alright guys those are out my
empties for December I hope you enjoyed
the video I will be having my year-long
makeup empties coming up soon and I'm
really excited to film that I'm gonna
show you guys everything that I used up
in the year of 2017 when it comes to
makeup and it's just such a positive
video to see how much makeup you can
actually use in a year it's crazy so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed I will
see you in my other videos I can't wait
to like sit and chitchat with you guys
in my next video tomorrow it's gonna be
great but until then thank you so much
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
