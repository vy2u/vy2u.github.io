thought I would hop on real fast because
Sam's at the gym and I have some time so
this video is going to be an update on
all the products I want to use up in
2015 I've made some decent progress I
think especially since these items are
supposed to be used up throughout the
year I'm also going to do something
different to i'm going to leave my goals
a lot of people have done that and i
really like knowing how they're going to
be using the product so you can kind of
focus in on your progress because there
are a lot of items in this project i
guess so i'm going to tell you guys my
goals at the end of how i want to use
things or what items i'm going to be
focusing on let's just get straight into
the items the first things i'm going to
show you are the things that I haven't
made really any progress off of yeah
we're just gonna get through those first
like fly by them and then we'll get into
the other products the first thing I
have here is this bareMinerals bisque
concealer I've used this may be one time
on the back there where that pink line
is that's how much I have to use it is a
small container but yeah I haven't even
tried really using that this is my
maybelline color tattoo in the color
barely branded i hit pan on this long
time ago so i'm just trying to use it up
this year and i haven't used it at all
my benefits day flow is 15 our prime are
not having is this at all I have all
these stila eyeliners are the
convertible color ones that are really
old I've haven't used any of these
colors and I use this lilac one like
maybe one time so really no progress on
those guys yet I have the scandalized I
shadow stick cran cream shadow stick and
it's in the color bullet for bullet
proof beige I haven't used this at all
it's so so bad like nope nope no but
there's a lot of product so I promised
I've used some things these two liners
I've use these a little bit like i'd say
probably three times each not that much
but you know at least they've been
touched the Urban Decay tinted
moisturizer in the color halo I haven't
used this yet I am working on a tinted
moisturizer right now for my finished by
by Cinco de Mayo so I wasn't expecting
to get through this so I'm not worried
but not yet i have this tart cream
eyeshadow in the colors late i have used
this probably like three times but
there's really no progress you can't see
anything in the pan but i am working on
I'm just trying to use up again another
one another project that's like the due
dates faster and then this one I've only
used this is the lorac three liquid
lustre in the color gold I've only used
this maybe twice kind of over gold yeah
so it's been hard like if I'm gonna go
sparkle or do something crazy i don't
really want to do gold like this type of
gold like a rose gold or copper maybe
but just straight-up gold I'm kind of
getting over so I'm gonna try to like I
don't know I've decided on this thing
I've already had to put more fix+ in
there um if I don't use this up at the
end of the year it's just gonna go but
I'm gonna just try my best to use it and
see if like any occasion could call for
it maybe around the holidays too I mean
I know it's so far away but something
like that or from doing a night out but
I'm not gonna like put too much pressure
on myself to use this just because I
don't always want this so there's that
um the rest of the stuff that i have
here i have pretty good progress on our
i'm really happy with the progress I've
made so yeah let's get into those this
is the Stila one-step primer color in
the color kitten you can use this
basically to prime whatever you want
it's like super weird anyway um that's
where it was and I am down to about here
now I've been using this as like a
primer on my face just because you can
use a lot of that way I will probably
keep using it that way once i use up
another thing but i'm not worried about
this one but yeah there's that I have
this michael todd blush in the color
lilia i was using this like every single
day until that tarina tarantino blush
came into my life but there is some good
progress I don't think you're going to
be able to tell but like in the pan I
can see it being like warmth down in
some areas so I feel really good about
the progress on this one and I was doing
a really good job of like keeping the
same blush every single day so proud of
myself on that this is
baby skin primer I have since used up my
benefit primer and so now i'm using this
as my everyday primer and I haven't made
too much progress from like the line but
this is the one I am working on so i
have used as quite a few times already
this is the mary kay liner in the color
bronze now it's going to be really
difficult to show you progress on here
but um on the lid on the lid from the
base I was um I was about there so now
it takes a long time to roll this one
sorry it's gonna take a second okay and
now and now I'm right there on the lid
so I mean it's not a ton of progress but
it is definitely progress now how it
used this one a ton of times this is a
lot of product in it I am currently
using up another bronze liner and
another project I have a lot of liners
this year I feel good about the progress
on this and I'm going to try really hard
to finish that one up so we can start
using this one this is one of my
favorite colors there's quite a bit of
red in this bronze so it looks really
good it really makes my eyes look blue
so yeah I hit pan on my color pop shadow
in the color lovely I feel really
awesome about this if you guys have some
of these these the pans on these are so
shallow like there's barely any product
in these shadows which I'm not
complaining about I'm just saying if you
have some if you work on them seriously
i use this maybe like six times and i
hit pan so um if you have some you can
definitely make these go kind of quick
or at least see some progress really
fast I feel good about this one so
that's awesome hit pan yeah i've also
been using my steal a kitten
highlighting duo quite a bit you're not
gonna be really be able to see any
progress that there are some substantial
dips in here so feel good about that
especially i've been using this lighter
pink shade i love a pink highlights oh
I've been using that one a lot and I
will use the bronze I'm probably more in
the summer but I've been using this
quite regularly i would say i've also
done really awesome on my brow quad so I
have I already hit pan on this color but
I have a lot more showing I hit pan on
this color I don't know if you can see
it in the viewfinder but this has quite
a bit of pant I mean not a ton of pan
but pan showing now which it didn't
before I have quite a good dip going in
the light brown shade and then even this
one I've been getting some pretty good
use out of as well so I feel really good
about the progress I've made on these
I've been using these I'm bringing them
to school and like disinfecting this
I've been using it on myself on my bros
i also use this if I need like
translated colors it's been in a couple
tutorials so um yeah I feel good about
this I feel really good about this so i
am just trucking away on this item I
feel good and then I have hit pan quite
a bit of pan on the tart powder that I
had in here I seriously thought this
powder was going to go forever and then
I finally hit pan it feels so good so
this one will be on pretty soon I feel
good about that and then the last item
here is this buxom liner in the color
black Jasper or something and it's gone
it's the only item I finished up but I
have done it it doesn't roll up anymore
you can't do anything it's awesome so um
that one's gone and I feel great about
that those are all my items it's a lot
of items I have let's see it's 25 items
that I want to use up this year in this
like year-long project I'm working on so
I feel really good about the progress
I've made one item down 24 to go and
some progress on some of them now for a
plan here some plans I have one of the
things i want to do is I'd like to hit
pan on the pink shade in this steel a
highlighter so I'm going to be using
this a lot this you know month and a
half or a month or so and I'm use it as
an eyeshadow if I have to whatever just
to see some progress on this one like
hitting pan so that's one of my goals is
to hit pan on that pink shadow I
obviously want to be done with this by
the next update for sure if not in the
next like week and a half two weeks so
that's something I want to have you done
with I'm still just going to be working
on this item I'd like to use this item
basically every single day maybe like
two days a week I can go to something
else but other than that
this item to be used so that way I just
want to get this one done as fast as
possible so I just I'm not tied to this
blush blushes take a long time to use so
that's what I'm gonna go with I can also
layer this blush it's so light so am I
you know use this and I can use another
one in the back or in the front or
whatever I want to do so but I want to
be using this basically every single day
just to see what progress i can make in
a month i also am committing to this
item I'd like to see a lot of progress
on this so this is the only primer are i
will be using this primer every single
time I do my makeup so that's a goal is
just to like see what progress i can
make on this guy in a month or so i
think i forgot to mention these in the
like actual video but anyway these are
two more lawyers that i have to use up
and i've been using these quite a bit
back and forth but i am going to focus
in on this Makeup Forever aqua eyes
eyeliner and use this up this year this
year of course this year use this up
hopefully in a month or so I don't know
but I definitely want to like focus in
on this one so i can see the progress
and get this one out of here since it is
tiny so I'm gonna put this one on the
back burner the smashbox one and go for
this one and I think those are going to
be my goals obviously I'm so I'm going
to try to use the other stuff but those
are like more specifically I'm gonna try
to use this like five times just to get
some more pan showing on it too so those
are my goals I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
