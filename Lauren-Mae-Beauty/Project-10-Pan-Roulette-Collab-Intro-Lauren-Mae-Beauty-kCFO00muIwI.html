Lauren yes I did change my lip color I
just wanted something different and it
was just kind of I don't know I just
felt like really self-conscious like I
was gonna like smear it all over so I
went to the other bite stuff that I got
in the different box box anyway let's
talk about this video I'm so excited to
be doing this collab it's going to be a
project ten pan roulette style and I am
clapping with love Heatherette here on
YouTube I absolutely love her she's the
one that kind of got me an El together
to do this I've been wanting to do a
clap with her for a really long time I
feel like she's like my youtube bestie
even though I don't talk to her ton I
don't know I just like her a lot so
definitely go check out her channel but
she got us together she wanted to do a
ten pan roulette style challenge I
thought I'd be really fun and the other
person in this collab you guys all know
her it's LS she's like the project
panning queen she does so many project
pans she's up so many products it's
crazy I love her too so definitely go
check her out yeah she's amazing
so I'm just really excited to be working
with these two lovely women here on
YouTube and let's just get into the
roulette I am going to be doing the
random.org thing for the random choosing
of these categories I have 30 different
categories that are potentials to be
chosen from we each came up with ten
different potential categories my gosh
it's so hard to say that let me pull up
random gorg and we'll get to pickin I
thought I would mention two that we are
doing this we're gonna do month updates
and we're gonna be running this project
between three and four months we are not
going to be adding in extra products as
we go as we use things up just because
me and L are you know like a ton of
other projects and I don't know I just
kind of want to focus on the 10 and just
be excited about the 10 and not have
additional stuff to add on so probably
won't get repetitive we'll see what we
pick so I have random.org on here so I
have it through 1 through 30 let's see
my first number is number 20 and number
20 is an eye product so I'll have to
pick out an eye product let's see next
we have number 7 and number 7 isn't the
oldest item so one of the oldest items
in my collection next we have number 20
again
today I'm gonna doing that number three
and that's a primer I like that one I
can definitely go through a primer the
fourth category is number fourteen and
that is a skin care item next is number
one I feel like all mine are like really
early I want some like older or later
ones what am I saying
number 22 is next which is a repurchased
item so how many do we have we have one
two three before we're six in we need
four more next is number eighteen and
that one is a gift the next number is
ten and that is an item of my choice ooh
I like that
I feel like none of these are that hard
so far the next one's number 20 for
something a little bit later down the
list and not as something with pretty
packaging that 1l came up with I like
that one and next we have number 17 and
that is a drugstore product and then I
think I have one more to pick oh no that
is that's all ten of them so those are
my ten items I'll go through them one
more time oh I didn't tell you what
number one was but I have a bronzer so
recap we definitely need this I have a
bronzer a primer an oldest item an item
of my choice a skincare item a drugstore
product a gift an eye product a
repurchase item and something with
pretty packaging so I'm gonna go pick my
items to start off with and I will be
right back guys okay guys I am back I
picked my items I feel good this is a
little bit harder than I thought it was
gonna be I honestly thought it would be
way easier to pick my stuff so number
one and actually number one is the
bronzer item and I chose to pick a pan
of hoola that I have obviously I've hit
a lot of pan on this but I really want
to see an empty pan so my goal is
obviously to finish this up
I do like hoola but I also switch off my
bronzer is kind of a lot so I want to
just get this pan gone and out of my
collection and have a completely empty
item so I'm excited about that I feel
like that's almost a trend for some of
the items in here they may be closer to
being done than usual but it was either
pick those items and have them finished
up and completely out of my collection
or pick something that's more full and
then only
pan so I really want to just move some
of these products out so I can enjoy new
things in my collection anyway next we
have a primer and I have two that you
guys have never seen before ever just
kidding you guys have totally seen these
this is my Becca ever matte primer and I
am all the way down here so I only have
this much left I know that seems like
nothing but this primer just lasts
forever for me so like when I bend it
down that's all I have left but this
just takes forever I really want to see
this gone I want this out of my
collection it's not my favorite but I
don't hate it as much as I used to so I
just want it gone so I can get this out
of my collection I want it out and then
just kind of piggybacking on that one
this is the pure correcting primer I'm
so close to being done with this there's
barely anything left so I just want to
kind of add this on top of that one and
get it out next is the oldest item in
your collection or an like one of the
oldest and that was really hard for me
because I feel like a lot of my stuff
I've either declutter a lot of the older
things in my collection yeah I just
don't have a lot of the older things or
they're all like the same age so it's
hard to pick some things so I decided to
go with a classic product this is the
Urban Decay Naked palette and this is
one of the first purchases I can
remember making and just being so
excited for when it came in the mail
like I was like oh my gosh I'm getting
the Naked palette like The Naked palette
so it's so excited for this and I've had
it for quite awhile I have the tiniest
amount of pant on this shade here virgin
and so I'd like to expand the pan in
that but I really want to hit pan and
Naked make it is such a nice basic
transition color really pretty and I
would love to just see pan in it I feel
like so many people have this palette
and talk about how it's the oldest and
they and they don't have that much use
out of it so I would like to get some
more use out of this and hit some pan
since it is older who knows maybe I can
hit pan in a couple more shades but
definitely want to hit pan and Nikas
next was an item of my choice and for
that I decided to pick a color pop
eyeshadow I just did a really big
colour-pop haul I'll leave it linked
down below I
got a lot of the shades and I really
like this color Kennedy this is in the
Just Peachy or peachy keen quad and I
really like this shadow again it's great
for a transition and I thought putting
something warm in along with that like
more cooler naked color would be nice I
want to hit pan on this but I do know
that it is kind of easy to hit pan in
color pop shadows so I just want to hit
as much pan as I possibly can oh I hate
that that rhymed but I want to hit as
much pan as possible in this during this
project and just get really good use out
of it I might even like hip an in this
one and then move on to a different
color pop shadow and try to hit pan and
that one and so on and so forth
we'll see how it evolves but I really
just want to continue using my color pop
shadows I really do like them but I am
more of a palette person so since these
aren't in palette sometimes it can be
hard to remember to bust them out so I
would love to hit pan in this next I
picked a skin care item and for that I
picked this totally a beauty elixir I
love this this smells absolutely amazing
this is very expensive this is a $50
bottle of this which is crazy but mine's
broken it sucks so like mine doesn't
spray like normal it's like effed up so
that really sucks I was going to depop
this but I cannot take the cap off I
tried and that almost made it worse
spraying so I really have to focus to
use this up I really like using this in
the daytime or in the morning after
getting out of the shower because it has
this like almost minty cooling feeling
on the skin it just kind of wakes you up
and refreshes you it feels so nice so I
just want to really focus on getting
this used up since its busted I
definitely would repurchase this though
it's really nice I really like this next
I have a drugstore item and this is the
fit me matte and poreless transparent
powder I already have pan on this
product but I do want to use it up
completely I like using this to set
under my eyes I do find that if I set
too much it can look a little powdery so
I'm going to try to make this work for
me I'm not sure if I'd repurchase this
eye
it's nice so I could see myself maybe
we're purchasing it either way I just
want to use this one up and get it
completely gone again I'm really excited
that I think at least like half these
products would be completely like out of
my collection once I used them up in
this project which would be awesome next
was a gift and this one was really hard
for me as well because I don't have a
lot of makeup that was gifted to me
people don't really buy me makeup I find
myself makeup I gift myself makeup
especially recently to like in the last
couple of years I just buy it myself no
one else my style I when it comes to
makeup enough to like buy something to
surprise me and I really just wanted
people to buy any other things and not
have my life so consumed with makeup
anyway long story short I decided to
pick something other than makeup this is
it perfume that was gifted to me by my
mother for my wedding day / a Christmas
gift I really wanted this this is also
in my finish 17 up in 2017 project pan
collab so I'll leave that link down
below if you want to check that out I
thought that I would use this project as
a way to get a jump start on this for
the year I did go through if you can see
how that's like open I went and like
scraped off the white paint so I can see
where I'm at this bottle is all the way
full whoo so I have a lot to go let's
try it now let's get it going so there's
a lot of product to get through but I
really would like to but I really would
like to finish this if I could really
just focus on it for the next four
months oh my gosh I'm sorry I have like
a frog in my throat I would just like to
get through this product and just have
it out of my collection it's beautiful
it smells okay but it's definitely not
one of my favorites and it would just
feel amazing to get that gun three
products left I have an eye product and
I decided to go with an urban decay
eyeliner now this one is all the way
full
so it's massive it measures from the tip
of my finger almost to the end of my
hand I don't know if I want to have a
piece of paper floating around with me
for forever I might just use this as my
marking thing so sorry but I really just
want to use something different
this is like a green color because it's
in the color stash like a stash of cash
really know why it's green so I just
want to get through this I find it go
through eyeliners pretty fast so
hopefully I can get through that one
fast as well next is a repurchased item
and I found that this one was really
hard in connection with like the other
products I already had picked out so I
went with an oldie but a goodie this is
the Rimmel BB cream and it's the matte
one I have it in the shade light ivory
purchased this like three times this is
my third bottle I really do like this
but I feel like the covergirl clean
matte BB cream is the newer better
version of this plus this is just a
little dark for me so I want to just get
this out of my collection and I probably
will just repurchase the covergirl one
from now on I am about here on it so I
don't have much left but I am gonna have
to mix this with other products to make
it work for my skin just cuz it's a
little orgy I thought that would just be
a nice one for like easy everyday and
whatnot so hopefully that won't be too
hard to get through and the last item is
pretty packaging and I chose this
compact from I can't say it this is that
one brand that has like the petals
better blushes and whatnot and obvi this
is like the cutest packaging ever I got
this when I was in France with Sam and
this is the blush color so as you can
see there is like a embossed women's
head it's kind of like one of those
portraits and my goal with this is just
to get rid of the embossing so basically
it's like a flat product like there's
nothing there if I could hit pan that
would be amazing but I don't want to be
confined to this blush that much where I
hit pan so again if I could just get it
flat I would be really excited and happy
with that mostly I just want to use this
product more than I have been using it
since it is so pretty I really wish I
had picked a different color pink this
is just so bright but it's not it's not
crazy pigmented so I feel like I can
kind of like sheer it out and make it
work so yeah I really am excited to try
to make some progress on that those are
all my items that I picked out I'm
really excited to be doing a roulette
these are always fun because you never
know what you're gonna get I'm really
excited to see what Heather picked and
what L picked so definitely go check
them out as well and that's a
I will see you guys in my next video I
hope you're having a wonderful day
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
