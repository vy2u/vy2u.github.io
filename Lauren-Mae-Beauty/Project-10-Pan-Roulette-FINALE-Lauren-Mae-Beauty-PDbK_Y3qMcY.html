Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be an update on my project
ten pan roulette before I get into the
progress I wanted to say if you guys
could please go subscribe to Hunter she
has a new channel because her original
beauty channel got deleted from some
Apple who got her computer and deleted
her channel she tried to work with
YouTube and bring it back but it had
been too long for her to do that so I
would really appreciate it if you guys
were subscribed to her before to go
check her out and Reece obscure to her
new channel
she's starting over from scratch which I
can't imagine doing I would literally
cry forever I would really appreciate it
and I know she would too if you guys
could go over there say hi show her some
love and subscribe to her she did quite
a few subscribers so it's definitely
shitty starting from scratch is like a
super good attitude about it but I
wanted to give her a shout out here I'm
going to try to mentor in my next couple
of videos but if your creators you want
to give her a shout out that would be
awesome as well I'm just kind of shows a
love and help her out so thank you so
much in advance but let's get back to
this this was a collab with Heather from
Love Heatherette and L from LS I believe
both of them have already completed
their projects I kind of just like kept
it going because I had a few things I
was so close to finishing up and I want
to say one but it's been long enough I
feel like I've gotten some good progress
I didn't get exactly where I wanted to
be but I'm still definitely really
satisfied with this project so let's get
into the progress I made on excited the
first thing I have here is the coda
leave you D elixir and this is entirely
used up this is a facial mist so you can
use it to like revive your makeup
throughout the day just give your skin
extra moisture or something just to
refresh your skin I super enjoy this
product mine has a broken top which I've
heard from a lot of people in the
comments that that is not uncommon so
that kind of stuff because this is a
very expensive product but I love it
it's so good has this very like minty
spa-like scent and it's great so I'm
really glad that I used it up because of
its broken cap it was just sitting
around in my collection so I'm glad that
I got the money's worth out of this I
can see myself repurchasing this in the
future I would just definitely make sure
I buy it from a place that I could
easily
turn it if the same issue happened but
it's worth it to me I do like the
product a lot something that you guys
already know I used up is the hoola
bronzer this is just a little pan of it
and this is a weird shaped pan that's
not like the normal square I bought this
in a pop sugar must-have box when I was
living in Arizona it was in this like
Cabana set it was like yellow if you're
like oh gee you can kind of remember it
has this it had a pan I've had three
eyeshadows in it they were all in the
same pan though and it came with a
couple other products and I was so
excited to get that fit anyway I
finished this up I do okay I feel like I
have mixed feelings about hula
I think it's an OK bronzer I feel like I
would like to a light for myself better
I kind of want to try it out I was
actually not that interested in it when
it first came out but the more I'm like
looking at it and like I think I might
like it so so for me the regular hula
pan is just a little dark it's a little
bit just kind of neutral which is nice
but I think sometimes they like a little
bit something a little bit warmer I like
kind of like this mix between a bronzer
and a contour and kind of use one
product to do a little bit of both
anyway it was okay I liked it I'm just
glad I used it up another product that
you guys already know I reached my goal
on this is the color pop eyeshadow and
Kennedy my goal is just to hit pan and I
have it pan
I like this shade I really liked a map
from colour-pop but I will say I feel
like they just are drying out my mats
are drying out that's a swatch of it
there it's so pretty as a transition
color I like using this just by itself
or again like using this and then
putting other shades on top of it and
just using this like that a little bit
of warmth in the crease happy I hit pan
on something from colour-pop since I
tend to forget about them in my
collection I was very dramatic last time
in my update was the BB cream from
Rimmel I wasn't expecting to be I threw
this out so this is just the packaging I
will be just throwing this out I'm not
counting it in my empties because I
technically did not use it out I put
this on this project to try to finish it
up but I just didn't like it it's just a
little bit too orange for me and my skin
tone I honestly just prefer the cover
all clean Matt bb-cream if you're going
to get a decent cream from the drugstore
so although I didn't finish it I
definitely kind of learned what my new
loves are I will not be suggesting this
anymore
that's something nice through my
declutter and through project panning
that you kind of learn what something
used to be your favorite and it doesn't
always have to stay that way and it
usually doesn't new things come out and
new formulas and your tastes change so
this is definitely something that falls
into that category adjust I used to love
you but you gotta go something I'm super
excited about this is mine Elizabeth and
Jane serve on a white perfume and I
believe I'm basically done with this I
can no longer see any of the perfume in
the bottle I started all the way up here
and worked my way down there's a lot of
wines even though there aren't that many
updates because this is in my like
overall finished 17 and 2017 projects
but I am just so ecstatic that I
finished this out I have been going
through perfumes like crazy I think a
lot of them I worked on last year but I
just I can do any wearing perfumes plus
I keep forgetting that hello we're
halfway through the month Lauren it's
not like it's January anymore or
February it's crazy it can bleed half
the years already gone right so here
well I mean I guess technically once we
finished this month copy your will be
gone right pretty crazy
anyway I'm going to be trying to like
squirt out the rest of this just because
it's hard to see but this is I mean why
I support it it doesn't like do pull
squirts anymore I'm really happy about
that this is probably one of my biggest
accomplishments this perfume is okay I
get compliments on it which is nice but
I would not repurchase it it's not
something that's going to be a staple in
my collection there are so many perfumes
that I like so much more than this so
I'm going to be so happy when that last
break comes out and the last thing I
feel like I officially did kinda hit my
goal on or at least the changed goal is
in my Naked palette I actually declutter
that so if you haven't seen my declutter
series I'm going to leave the playlist
link down below I have pictures for it
so all the pictures of anything I have
will be showing but I just personally
don't love that palette anymore my goal
is to hit pan on sit No
my bullets hit pan on naked and it's
just not a color that I really love and
feel like I have similar things in my
collection that yeah it's an okay mat
but I usually like something a little
bit warmer there's no reason to keep
that palette I feel like it was one of
those palettes that was a staple at the
beginning of YouTube but I kind of you
know one of the first things of its kind
but apps companies are trying to kind of
top that and simulate that things have
gotten better and it's just not my taste
anymore so I passed that palette on and
I don't really I mean I have it I like
anything but I'm not going to show to
you guys because I don't care about it
and yeah I'm getting rid of it three
more items to show you guys next I have
my primer kind of combo I did finish up
the pure correcting primer in the
illuminate I don't really think I like
this this is very sticky and I feel like
it just feels heavy on the skin and
although I'm into a more luminous kind
of foundation and primer situation this
one just still feels heavy with being
luminous so it's not my favorite the
matte one from Becca I really have no
more progress on it this is one of those
products that I'm going to be using
until the end of the year and then I
will be getting rid of it regardless of
if I finish it up but hopefully I can
finish it up I'm just so getting close
to finishing it and I just don't want to
give up on it so I'm going to try my
hardest to use this up but it might be
one of the things I just ditch at the
end of the year something that I make
really good progress on but didn't quite
finish up is my liner from Urban Decay
this is in the color stash when I
measured it originally I went all the
way down to the bottom of my hand and
that's where we're at now
so definitely good progress it's
definitely shorter and I hope to finish
this up by the end of the year it's not
quite done the color allas just isn't my
favorite although it doesn't really show
up green or translate green it's mostly
just dark it's just very creamy and I
feel like it gets everywhere it's on my
waterline when I use it on my tight line
and I like to keep that area a little
bit more bright so anyway it was okay
one thing is it to my Urban Decay liners
that I haven't declutter I'm going to be
trying way different brands probably
drugstore under nose
different things I lied I have two more
items now not before this is something
that I made really good progress in and
was really hoping I could finish up but
I didn't it's the Maybelline fit me
powder the matte and poreless and
translucent I have repressed it so
that's what it looks like now I just
don't use as much powder as I used to
plug this powder just isn't my favorite
I do like it for setting like the t-zone
area but I do not like it for under my
eyes I like something just a little bit
finer than this so I'm going to be
working on this I will finish it up I
just didn't in this project I definitely
made some good progress on it so I'm
happy about that basically the fact that
my skincare routine is foundation
routine kind of switched up in the
middle of this project is the reason
that I wasn't able to finish this and
last this is a blush so before it had an
embossing and it kind of still does I
don't know if it's going to read on
camera but I will have pictures I still
count this as such a success I
definitely use this way more than I
would have and I did basically wear down
the lady like it might not look like it
in the picture but I really think that
the embossing on this is pretty like
deep I just feel like the powder still
shows the remnants of it even though
it's not raised anymore so I am still
very very proud of the progress I made
in this I'm happy I put this in this
project it's an OK blush it's not my
favorite like I know if I went back in
time and was buying this again in France
I would totally take a different color I
think I used to be in the mindset of
like oh I want a bunch of different
colors to have in my collection but I
realized that it's like now I'd rather
have like all of the same blushes and
love them and use them all then have
like a bunch of different colors and
still gravitate to the same ones I love
you know anyway I believe that's
everything for my update thank you so
much for watching guys I hope you're
having a great day and I will see you in
my next video well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
