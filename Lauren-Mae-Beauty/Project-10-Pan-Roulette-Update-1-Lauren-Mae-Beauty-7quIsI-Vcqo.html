thanks so much for watching this is
going to be an update to my 10 pan
roulette this was in collaboration with
love Heatherette here on YouTube and
also ALS I might be getting this up a
little bit late we uploaded our intros
on the 4th I'll have it linked down
below if you haven't seen that video but
February was just such a short month it
doesn't feel like it's been that long
since I you know filmed and uploaded
that video so let me just show you some
of the progress I'm excited I think I'm
doing pretty well we're doing this
project for about 3 or 4 months we
haven't really decided we're just kind
of like going with the flow the first
thing here this was a skin care item
that I picked out of the roulette and
this is the ko talib UT elixir I started
the project up here and I am down to
here I'm really excited to be using this
this is one of my favorite beauty
products it's very expensive but it does
feel luxe and I love that minty tingling
feeling when you spray this on your face
it feels refreshing I think it's a great
toner for the morning or like a
pick-me-up and it smells amazing too I
was talking about in my last video how
the spout or the sprayer was broken and
I don't know if it's just with more use
it's still not like a full-on sprayer
but I'm making it work
some genius in the comments was telling
me that I should put it in like a travel
lo type of thing like you would a
perfume I think that's such an amazing
idea I thought I had one empty but I
don't it has perfume in it and I don't
want to spray perfume on my face so I'm
making this work but if you ever have a
sprayer that won't work and you can't
dupatta it or take the top off that is
such a smart idea and I'm going to be
keeping that in mind for next time and
I'm passing the tip along to you in case
you ever come across that issue
cuz it's horrible not this product but
that issue we're gonna go on to another
item that I feel like I have some good
progress on this is the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana white perfume I have this
as my gift item and I started the
project as a full bottle and look we're
all the way down here I'm very proud of
my progress on this I'm growing to like
this more and more as I use it but it's
still not one of my favorites it's
definitely not something I would
repurchase but I'm glad to be getting
use out of it and not hating it I
pretty confident that by the end of this
project whenever that is I will have
this finish if I keep going I'm really
happy about that but anything that I
have pictures for like from my first
update to now I will have posted in here
I'm really happy I'm trying to take
pictures for you guys I feel like that's
a really awesome way to see progress so
yeah trying here I'm just gonna move
into primers now I picked two primers
even though I only need to pick one
because I'm just hoping I can use these
up this is the Becca ever matte and I
haven't really used this I use this
maybe two times my skin is just a little
too dry right now to be using this so
I'm hoping that as the weather warms up
here in California I can use this a
little bit more and hopefully get some
good progress I just want it done I want
it done and the other one I have here is
the pure correcting primer and this is
like an illuminating primer I've been
using this on the days when I'm not like
going out and doing something because it
does leave me a little shiny throughout
the day and I just don't trust it as
much as other primers I use on a daily
basis this is nice though it's kind of
sticky it feels kind of sticky like it
feels like it's gluing to your
foundation on your face which could be a
good and bad thing it's just like a
weird feeling to me can't wait to get
this done I'm very close I probably have
like four uses left I feel like I've had
four uses left for a really long time
but I think I actually have four uses
left and I feel like I'm at a good spot
to like actually finish it you know I'm
focused this is my Urban Decay liner in
stash this I've used a couple of times
I've been just going back to my pop
Beauty one so I need to just use this on
days when I'm not like caring about my
eye look and just use it as like a
definer shade under the lash line I'm
not really worried I go through liners
pretty fast but I definitely need to use
this more and put down the bronze
bonanza for my drugstore item I picked
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
translucent powder I think this is an OK
powder I've been using it to set under
my eyes it's a little bit drying to me I
don't I don't know I just feel like you
can see it on the face it's just not my
favorite maybe I'm just using too much
of it probably but I am getting some use
out of this it's ok it's just not my
favorite I would try something else
I definitely think I can finish that I'm
going to use it a little bit more and
then I'll finally I'll
probably after next update something I
hit my goal on this is the color pop
shadow in the color Kennedy this was the
item of my own choice and there is a
little bit of pan there I feel like
hitting pan on color pop shadows isn't
that big of a deal I mean you can move
the product around and hit pan pretty
easily these are very shallow pans but
I'm really happy I still hit pan this is
a really pretty color it is a matte I
know everyone hates the mattes but I
like them so I don't know I'm just a
weirdo I guess over here one thing I
will say though is you definitely need
to be putting a clean brush into these
products I'm really bad at cleaning
brushes for my own personal use and if I
put a brush that has like powder on here
I definitely can tell that this is
getting like dried out and that really
sucks so if you have these definitely
you put clean brushes that don't have
powder in it because it's just gonna dry
out your product faster and that kind of
sucks you don't want to have that happen
poor my oldest item I picked the naked
by Urban Decay palette and I want to hit
pan on the color naked which I have been
working on I haven't I mean this is
gonna be hard I don't know if I'm gonna
do it guys but what I will say is that I
have more pan on virgin so you can
actually see the pan I did have this
pinprick of pan in the intro but I have
expanded it so I'm really happy at least
with that there is some pan in this
palette now that you can actually
visibly see but I'm still gonna be
working on naked hopefully I can make a
dip in there and and hit pan I don't
know if it's gonna be possible though
because these shadows are packed really
tightly and they don't have like a lot
of kick up or anything like that I have
three products left the next one is the
rebel BB cream and this was a repurchase
item I think I was a little bit generous
when I marked this you cannot see
through this I tried so hard up but like
flashlights I'm holding up to light I'm
trying everything but I could not find
out how far I was I definitely don't
think I have a lot left of this so this
should be gone I've been mixing this
with my hard candy glamoflauge in
porcelain because that's really light
and this is really orange I don't know
how I was making those work before I
don't know if it's oxidized over time
maybe that's it but my goodness I don't
know how I could wear this by itself
before the more I use this the more I
realize that I really do like the
covergirl BB cream better than this so
I'm excited to get this done and out of
my collection we have our pretty
packaging
my blush and I'm trying to work away at
the embossing on it this is a really
pretty light pink blush it doesn't show
up very well on my skin but it's nice
because it doesn't take too much away
from any look I do so I can wear it with
everything basically and that's what
I've been doing I can kind of pack this
on too and it you can't tell that I have
like crazy pink cheeks the pictures
should have shown and I think that I'm
doing a good job so I think that I can
get this whole picture of the lady gone
by the time we wrap this project up and
the last item I have here is the bronzer
sorry about the other shadows I was
working on a different video with these
other colors but I'm doing really well
on the bronzer I've almost hit pan on
the sides of this bronzer which is
really great I am going to be repressing
this so the next time you see it will be
in different form entirely but I am
using that I kind of use this as like my
contour in a way I use my Physicians
Formula bronzer everywhere and then I'll
just kind of like chisel that in a
little bit deeper wherever I want more
of an intense contour so Hoole is not
one of my personal favorite bronzers but
it's not bad I don't I don't mind it
okay those are my updates for this
project pan I'm excited to have a little
bit more progress I feel like then in my
last project pan I can actually see some
things being used so I'm trying to stay
focused so I can have some progress so I
can actually use some things up this
year but it has been fun to explore my
collection - that's everything I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
