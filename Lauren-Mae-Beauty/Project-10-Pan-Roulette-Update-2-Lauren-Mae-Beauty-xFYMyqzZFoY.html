learn thanks so much for watching this
is going to be an update for my project
pan roulette it's a ten pan relied I'm
clapping with love Heatherette and LS on
YouTube if you guys haven't checked out
their channels definitely do we are a
little bit into this project this is the
second update and I'm a little bit late
on it so I'm really really sorry but I
just got behind on things and I got sick
which kind of sucked so let's get into
progress I'm really excited to show you
guys I feel like I've been working
really really hard and I'm excited to
show you guys at where I'm at some
things not so much but other things are
really big win and I'm excited about
them I'm just gonna start off with a
product that I have finished up so one
of my items was a primer and I chose two
the first one here is the pure
correcting primer this is an
illuminating primer and it's finished
I'm so happy this is just a deluxe
example but I'm telling you this hung on
for dear life and I'm so glad that it's
done I don't really like this primer for
myself I could see what other people
might like it it definitely leaves a
kind of a tacky feeling on the skin and
I personally don't like that because I'm
already oily and I just feel like I'm
starting out oily so I would never
purchase this for myself but I could see
maybe other people enjoying it I didn't
hate it it just definitely didn't work
for my skin and the other product here
is the Becca ever matte poreless priming
Perfector I have a definite love-hate
relationship with this and mostly hate
and I'm actually making some good
progress so before I was right above the
sulfur line and now I'm at the silver
line so I feel happy about that I'm
definitely working on this guys I'm
trying so hard I'm wearing it today and
I'm really really trying to just force
myself to use this because it's gonna
it's the only way it's gonna get gone or
I'm just gonna have to throw it away
like I just realized I need to be real
with myself either I'm gonna throw it
away or need to actually use it so I'm
really trying to make progress on this I
don't think I'm gonna finish this by
next update which would kind of be like
our update slash finale I want to say I
might go two more times like I might do
about one more update and then my finale
but we'll see I'm really trying on this
so far that's like the only thing I've
used up but I have some really
progress next I'm gonna show you guys my
Nirvana white perfume this is my gift
item and I have four marks on here
because I actually have this in my
year-long project so I already did an
update on that this is my intro this is
my first update this is my other update
video which I'll leave it I'll leave my
seventeen and 2017 video link down below
and then this is what I got now so I've
even made more progress since that video
I'm really trying to use this up I do
spray a lot of this on me I have no
shame in my game here homie I personally
like to bring a lot of perfume one I'm
into I'm trying to use this up I don't
want this anymore it's okay but it's
definitely not something I've ever shell
out the money for again if you guys can
hear the helicopter I'm really really
sorry I don't know there's probably some
type of chase going on around me so I
apologize next is another item I have
really good progress on this is the code
early beauty elixir this is where I
started
there's definitely a situation going on
this is where I started from the intro
my first empty and now my second update
so I've made even more progress from my
last update to this update than I did
from the beginning I'm really happy
about that I'm really trying to use this
I just finished up the other toner that
I was using at night so now I use this
morning and night I also use it to try
to foil some eyeshadows like I'm really
trying to get my money's worth out of
this and finish this up you guys know
that the spout on this is broken so it
doesn't spray like a normal sprayer and
that's the reason I want to move it out
so quickly I've had this over a year now
so that's what I'm just like trying to
get it out because this was damaged I
just wasn't reaching for it because it's
just irritating to use but since putting
it in this project I have definitely
been getting my money's worth out of it
and I'm very happy about that I forgot
Kennedy is something I used up in my
last project my goal is just to hit pan
on this and I did I haven't used it
since then so there's no new progress to
show on this I'm gonna try to I'm doing
a new color pop series on my channel if
you want to check out the first look
it's this one here I'll leave it linked
down below I do like the shadow but I
just haven't been reaching for it so you
might see it more in that project I'm
gonna try to use this more but I'm not
really putting pressure on myself since
I already hit pan on it for the Urban
Decay eyeliner this is the color stash
I'm doing really well on this I'm very
proud of myself
I checked out my intro and I didn't mark
this on a piece of paper because I was
being lazy and didn't want to but from
my intro I had this and I measured it
against my finger and it went all the
way down to the bottom of my hand so
I've used up a good portion of this I'm
still just trying to truck through it
this is just a very creamy eyeliner and
I like something that's not quite this
creamy
I feel like this moves around a little
bit more than I want it to so I
definitely feel like because of the
color and because it's more creamy and
moves around I don't want to reach for
this so I'll reach for my pop beauty one
over this but I have been making a
better effort and I can definitely tell
with how much I've used of it so far the
next item is my fit me powder from
Maybelline this is the matte and
poreless and I'm making good progress on
this I'm not using it as my
as I should be I'm definitely not using
this every day I have it in my bag right
now
I like this powder but it just doesn't
keep me mad I it does not keep me matte
as much as I wanted to I don't know I've
been kind of switching out my face
routine I feel like I switch it up like
every ten or fifteen days I get tired of
whatever I'm using and try something
else so I'm going to try to like
reincorporate this see if there's a way
I can make it work with the new
foundations I've been using and I just
want to go on I just want to finish it
up and then I can go from there but
there is some progress you can tell them
the pictures so that's good at least
this is my hula bronzer and I have
repressed it so it looks a lot different
from the original intro but I'm
definitely using it it's what I'm
wearing today only and I'm just trying
to work on this I like it but I don't
love it I love just a more sheer bronzer
more than this at least until I get more
Sun in summer I feel like this would
definitely look better on me but I'm
doing pretty well only a couple more
items I'm just going to show you the one
that has like the least progress this is
my Naked palette and my goal is to hit
pan on the color naked I have not even
used this I am just focused on other
colors right now I talked about this in
my pan that palette where I'm just kind
of going with what I want to do and what
I'm inspired to do with my eyeshadow
looks and I am really focusing on using
my Z palette so I just haven't been
reaching for Naked I'm gonna count the
fact that I hit pan on virgin and kind
of expanded the pan on that I was like a
success story for this palette in this
project but for my actual original goal
I have not been doing anything on that
and I don't really think I'm going to be
working on this anymore so don't expect
this to have any progress next update
either the next item is my blush this is
like my pretty packaging item and this
is a really beautiful color it has a
embossed face on it I'm a woman and I'm
trying to work that down I've been doing
a good job this takes a lot of product
like it's pigmented but also not it's
kind of sheer so I feel like I can kind
of pack it on it is what I'm wearing
today I hope that I can make more
progress on it I just need to wear it
more often
honestly I've just been gravitating to
other things because this is so bright
pink
has like a white bass I don't feel like
it gives me as much color as I'm used to
putting on myself so I'm gonna try to
work through this any progress I make on
this so I'm gonna be happy with because
I wouldn't have used it at all if it
wasn't for throwing it on the ground
um if it wasn't for this project it's
all safe guys no worries in the last
item I decided to depart because I could
not tell where I was with this and it's
just kind of frustrating me I want to be
done with it this is the BB cream from
Rimmel it's the light shade and from the
intro I was there I thought and then the
update one I thought it was maybe there
so I just was like I'm gonna put it in a
new container I'll just keep it upside
down first of all this is the color
light this is not very light at all to
me but anyway it's kind of gone not
crazy because if it's in my basket but
that is where I am so I definitely like
it can finish this up it's just a matter
of using it I do have to mix this with a
lighter foundation to make it match my
skin tone at the moment so it will take
a little bit longer than you'd expect
for this to take even though it looks
like a little bit of product because I
have to mix it but I definitely feel
like this is one I can get out of my
collection through this project and I'm
excited to just be done with this that's
everything guys I hope you enjoyed this
update again please go support ellen
Heather I will have their channels
linked it always feels good to have
people rooting you on when you're trying
to use up some things you don't really
like but that's everything guys I hope
you're having a great day and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
