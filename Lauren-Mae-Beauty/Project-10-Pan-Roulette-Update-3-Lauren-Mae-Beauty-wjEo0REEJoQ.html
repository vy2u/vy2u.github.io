still earn thanks so much for watching
this is going to be an update on my
project ten pan roulette I'm doing this
of the collab with Heather from love
Heatherette and L from LS here on
youtube I will link both of their
channels down below I know Heather just
actually wrapped her project up but I'm
going to be doing this update and then I
will have my finale on my next update so
in about a month I'm so close on some of
these items I don't want to give up on
them yet so I just want one more month
to kind of like bring it home see what I
can really finish up but yeah definitely
go check out their channels again their
links I'm just going to be naming these
off in no particular order because I
just don't have the time and yeah I just
don't want to like deal with that so
we'll just get started it'll be a
surprise if I finished adore wearing
processes so first I want to talk about
the Elizabeth and James Nirvana perfume
we started at the top
bleuer completely full and now I'm all
the way down here so from the last
update that's quite a bit of progress
really happy about that I'm using this
quite often you guys know it's not my
favorite but I will be very happy to get
rid of this the packaging is gorgeous
and just you know really scratched off
the white paints and that's how I can
see how much is in this bottle I
sacrifice the packaging so that I could
panic another item that has pretty good
progress this is the totally do tea
elixir and from the beginning of the
project I was up here and from all the
updates I am now all the way down to
here I'm so close I've really been using
this all the time as often as I can
remember when I get out of the shower
anytime I wash my face before I put on
moisturizer in every morning before I
put on makeup so I use this very very
often my sprayer is my step sadly but I
really do like this product it smells
really good it feels very refreshing and
tingling on the face
I would definitely purchase it but not
for a while The Naked palette you guys
know I don't really have any progress on
the Naked palette I'll show the pictures
that I do have again any pictures that I
have I'll be showing my goal originally
was to hit pan on the color sin um no my
goal originally was to hit pan on the
color naked but I decided to just mix
that and not do it I did though however
a hit pan in virgin so that is
success and I'm happy about that really
starting here is the blower that just
started and is my last video to film so
we're just going to work past it
I just really have some progress on my
Maybelline fit me this is the color
transparent and I'm getting so close I
really need to repress this and I know
it would go so fast I'm wearing it today
and I've been wearing it quite often I
have found a whole new phase routine
that I'm just obsessed with that I am in
love with and I'm just I'm there with it
I do not powder my face nearly as much
as I used to I just don't even feel like
I need to I feel like my skin looks so
good so healthy looks like skin I have a
little bit of a sheen to it honestly I
never thought I wouldn't I never thought
I'd like a more glowy look on me but I
have just been preferring it so much
more to just a really matte look which
is really weird for me to say but I just
I'm in love so anyway I have been
finding a way to make this work and I'm
excited to finish this up primers I
finished up the other primer that I had
the pure one but I still am working on
the Becca I have not been using this as
much as I should because I've been using
ending please because I've been using a
new face moisturizer in this tense to
follow up with it so to keep the can't
work in conjunction I have someone asked
in the comments of my last video like
why don't you just get rid of it if you
hate it that much and I get that I do I
probably should but I'm just so dang
close on this that it's one of those
items like I just can't let go like I
need to finish it to feel satisfied even
though it's not my favorite so I just
want to finish it I'm so close and
literally like that's it that's all I
have like why can't I do it so I'm just
going to keep working on this one
hopefully I can get some more progress
with it but yeah not much from this
update from last update to this update a
really awesome one this is the bronzer
the hoola bronzer that it had and it's
all done I repress this last time and
now it is completely done there's like
fuzz on my nail this is not my favorite
bronzer I don't really enjoy it that
much I don't know I'm not saying I
wouldn't buy it again but I've just
really been enjoying well I just like
the look of a similar bronzer something
that isn't so like ashy
like something super actually like
something with a little bit of warrant
that kind of works as a bronzer / gives
definition to the face but I'm not
really into like contour contour so
anyway I'm really glad to have the
Senate has it for a really long time and
it's going to feel it just often to have
like an empty pan so I'm really happy
about that one this is something I
already finished up in the sense fitting
pan so this is my color pop eyeshadow
and Kennedy no progress on that there
probably won't be any progress and let
they use it in one of my color pop like
tutorial like revisit projects videos am
I saying on that you guys know I'm
trying to do I feel like so many videos
though right now and like behind on I
want to do more those I need you my for
lip from palette on my pastel gosh
that's like forever ago I also need to
finish my like to be palette or videos
like that when I drop the ball and quite
a bit you guys one it's like a look into
my kids I saw them on that like there's
a lot anyway three more items this is my
eyeliner from Urban Decay and it's in
the color stash and we measured it
against the top here and that's how much
I've used up it was as long as my hand
I'm using them I'm wearing it today this
is not my favorite eyeliner I don't love
the Urban Decay ones but this one in
particular I really don't like it's very
very creamy and I tend to just kind of
get everywhere so I just have to be
careful with it it is very dark which is
nice you can't tell that it's like green
what is happening seriously there's so
much crap going on on our street my car
got chose the other day because they
decided they wanted to redo the road and
didn't give us the seven charges they're
supposed to but didn't tell us and like
put things on our doors or anything to
let us know so my car watch out finally
take it over to the doctor anyway I will
alow annoyed on that and I don't know
what's going on right now
someone else getting towed maybe maybe
some poor suckers getting towed maybe
it's just lowers maybe it's just a car
look it's going away you never know with
my road anyway it's getting close to
being done I was trying to stay away
from the ramble and I could okay this is
my dupatta dremel foundation I hate this
I just think I'm going to give up on it
but I just don't want to because then I
feel like I can't put it in my like
finished up product so they technically
didn't finish it up but I really just
don't like this product I think I'm
under steering of it I decided that
right now it's going in the trash did
you hear that that's it in the trash I
had a little bit less I don't like the
color of it I don't want to wear that my
skin I don't I want to wear a pretty
foundation I want to wear something that
I feel confident in that makes me feel
good and that's not it for me it's not
doing it so it's the trash now who cares
we're with that unless this is my blush
from you know the brand I can't say
Michael honest is to try to like get rid
of the lady impression I'm doing a
really good job and I'm pretty dang
close to it I have a feeling though even
though it'll be flush with each other
that the impression is still going to be
there but it's how they meet the powder
or what so yeah I'm just happy that I've
been using this blush it's not a
favorite I am wearing it today
I don't tend to gravitate to like really
hot pink blushes like this I like these
type of blushes when my hair is purple
but when my hair is pink I like a
neutral blush or a peachy blush those
are kind of my to go to or look a
cool-toned ma be neutral it was doing my
favorite ones but like a cool tone hot
pink like this I tend to only like when
my hair is like an ashy purple does
everything I apologize if this group of
videos is kind of like all over the
place I don't know how much I'm going to
keep in and and not I it out because
they just don't have the time so we'll
see but thanks so much for sticking
around guys I will see you in my next
video have a wonderful day Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
