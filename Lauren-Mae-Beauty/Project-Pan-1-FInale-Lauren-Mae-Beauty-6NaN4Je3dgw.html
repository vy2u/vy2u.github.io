I am filming my project pan 20 pan final
finale um it's a little bit late so I
apologize but I've been really busy so
i'm going to show you guys where i'm at
what I've used up what I didn't use up
and kind of my overall thoughts again
this is my first like individual project
pan where I picked the items and overall
I'm really proud of myself I feel like I
wouldn't have finished the items in this
project or use them at all if I hadn't
done this so I am very happy with my
progress and the things that I finished
up so let's just get into it i'm going
to show you guys the things that i
finished up first oh yeah i'm in a whole
new location so sorry about that i
wanted to be a little more chill i'm
like on my couch and the Lighting's
better here and stands out of town I
just felt like changing it up and i'm
alone i ordered pizza i'm just like
chillin and talking to you guys on a
couch so anyway back to the video this
is something that i finished up really
early on this is the hems cucumber
jasmine body moisturizer i really like
the hemp products i think they soaked
into the skin really fast i have two
more I have like a I don't know it's
like a plum one I think in a pomegranate
1 i'm working on the pomegranate now so
yeah i really enjoyed this i thought it
was nice and I recommend it if you don't
like lotions this would be a good one I
finished up to mass this one is the
Fremen facial hydration math goji berry
and it was okay it was like weird when
it dried it kind of looked flaky like
flaky skin it didn't really hydrate my
skin at all I got two uses out of this
though I wouldn't repurchase it but I'm
glad it's gone I also used a sheet mask
up this was the karuna brightening
treatment mask um I like a sheet mask i
bought a couple more when i was at the
korean market so i have a couple more
now to use I don't notice that this
particularly brightened my skin but I
don't know it was an interesting
experience so it was okay this is
something I finished early on as well
this is the baby lips in the color
twinkle I think it was a limited edition
shade it's completely gone that nub is
just plastic I'm looking at my screen
over if you're wondering
where I'm looking anyway this is just a
plastic nub so it's gone i don't i'm not
into like fishing out the product that's
in the center with like a lip brush or
whatever I just I can't be bothered I
have too many products to deal with that
this is a glam glow youth mud tingle
fully tingle exfoliate treatment this is
just the mini it came with the super
clear one the white one when I bought
this it's all gone there's a little bit
dried up in there but I did my best to
get this completely used up before it
dried out this is the bath and body
works honey sweetheart little body
lotion it's a travel size i used this up
there was barely any product i mean you
can see the lines there it's not like I
even used up the whole thing but this is
gone I love that scent it's such a nice
scent it's really sweet but I love it
this josie maran black oil mascara i
also used up this is what the lawn looks
like in case you're wondering it's an
okay mascara it was nice i would use a
sample up I probably wouldn't purchase
it though now other things you guys
haven't seen that I've used up i
finished my Viva La Juicy rollerball
perfume i'm so happy that i use this up
i got this for christmas one of my goals
this year is to use up my roller balls
and never repurchase a rollerball only
because i just don't use them I mean I
maybe could purchase a rollerball if it
was a scent that I was still deciding if
I liked but honestly I just don't need
them and I'm usually the type of person
like I know if I like a scent and I know
if I don't for the most part so I don't
think roller balls need to be in my life
so it's gone I'm so happy that it's gone
and I can't wait to finish up more this
year and the one I am the most excited
about is this Stila oscar fish liner i
feel like i've been using this liner for
so long and it's finally gone i just use
this on my lower lashline and i would
smudge it out with my finger um and it's
gone it's just a brown color it was nice
I it's nothing against this liner I'm
just happy to be moving on to a
different one and see progress because I
had no idea how much product was in here
because I couldn't roll it up or I would
never be able to put it back down
and that click sound is music to my ears
i'm so happy that it's gone you have
seen this one so sorry um this is the
hourglass mineral veil primer it's just
like a mini i use this up this primer i
don't get the hype personally around it
I think it's okay but I don't find it
does anything amazing for my skin so I'm
not I would never repurchase I would
ever purchase this for money ever and
then the last thing that I used up out
of the project is this sugar rose a lip
treatment this is just a mini as well
and it's completely used up there again
I'm not going to like fish out the
product in the middle but I love this
like I love Russia's lip balms my
favorite one is just the normal one I do
have a million Mini's though because i
bought i think two different sets two
different years and so I have way too
many I'm trying to work on this year
this is probably my favorite one that
I've tried outside of the regular one I
really want to try the nude one and the
honey one but I don't have those too I
wouldn't i don't really like the way the
product is when it's in the mini form
because it's such a soft product it
easily like breaks up and by the end of
the tube it's like falling off and it's
just messy but i did like this product
and I did technically use this I think
like two days after the project was over
which was the end of may I think I used
this like June second I think
technically was gone but i don't care
i'm counting it because I film this
video late anyway so ok so those are all
the items that I finished now on to the
items that I didn't finish where I made
progress or how far I got with them and
kind of my overall wrap up this is my
pink pretty and pure body splash I am
really proud of the progress I made I
originally started here on my first
update I was here a second and then down
here for this one I'm just glad that I
got some use out of it and when I look
at the little Mark's it's not a lot of
progress but when I look at you know I
use that much product that that's a lot
it's a lot of progress I feel really
happy about that and I just want to
continue working on this I'm deaf
finishing this up by the end of the year
like that's going to happen it has to
happen so um yeah I guess overall seeing
the progress is really exciting even
though I didn't finish it I'm still
really satisfied with how far I got on
this this one's a little disappointing
I've told you a million times so this is
like maybe four uses left and I just
never finished it it's just because I
started work and I'm this product
doesn't work for me I don't enjoy using
it doesn't look good so it's not like
I'm just gonna be around the house and
like running errands all day so who
cares what my makeup looks like I want
my makeup to look nice because I work
somewhere where we sell cosmetics so it
will only help me sell um so yeah I
still have this I'm gonna finish it up
though soon hopefully and just get it
out of my life because I'm so close I
still have the corona bubble bar to use
I just haven't taken a bath I haven't
had the time nor the desire to use this
up so this is like one bath for me I
know that seems like that's so much and
you could get like two or three baths
but I like a lot of suds and a lot of
like moisturization and stuff in my bath
so I saw this and then I don't have it
with me but I used up the Phoenix bath
bomb which was also in this project so i
did use that up as well so I'm super
unorganized oh it's hard if people are
super organizing their videos you should
give them props and like thumbs up their
videos because it's not easy and it
takes a lot of work you can't just sit
down and film because then it's just
organized and crazy anyway this is a
Revlon lip butter in the color pink
lemonade I haven't used any more of this
product so I have that much left which
is pretty close to the original amount i
mean want to look in the tube you can
see I mean it looks like I've used some
but I really have only used this a
couple times so um I just I don't know
how I feel about these yeah it's
basically the same um anyway I don't
know how I feel about these I don't know
how I feel about creamy lip products in
general unless they're like a natural
color
I'm just I would just rather use a lip
balm or what rather have really
pigmented like colorful lips in a matte
formula that's gonna stay all day I just
need something that's long lasting and
they don't have to worry about so I'm
realizing that in my collection that's
something that I look for in a lip
product so i know when i go and violet
products from now on that definitely is
going to be a huge factor in to me
actually purchasing a product i think i
only have two more items to show you i
did have a lip gloss in here that I
threw away I just wasn't going to use it
I knew I wasn't gonna use it again with
the lip products they're my biggest
weakness and I just didn't want to force
myself to use it up so I didn't and I'm
happy with that decision it's not
something I regret so and I actually
have three items here oh my gosh the
disorganization my goodness this is a
mini lipstick by Kat Von D this is in
the color celebutard um I I did make
some progress overall in this project
but again it's not gone like I can't
even finish up a mini lipstick what's my
problem yeah I'm just gonna keep working
on this in my collection I want to
finish this up by the end of the year so
I'll probably again some of these things
I'm feel like that's what I'm going to
do if I don't finish it in a project and
I'm not going to put it in my next
project then I'm going to just move it
into products I want to finish up by the
end of the year and hope that at least
by December 31st they're out of my life
that's my game plan at this point anyway
I also have my Too Faced lip injection
there's barely any product it's like
down to here but it's still in there I
haven't finished it and again this is
just something i don't use daily lip
products again they're just so hard for
me everyone at work like customers at
work will be like Oh what do you have in
your lips and I'll be like like what you
have on your lips and I'm like um I
don't have anything on like not even lip
balm and nothing and they're like oh
then you just have naturally beautiful
lips I'm just like I feel so weird but
it's like I just don't I don't ever wear
lip products almost ever like I maybe
once out of the whole week I'll wear lip
product so I'm never buying a lip
product again is what that means just
kidding I will
the last product here this is benefits
what up highlighter I did my best with
this thing but there is still so much
product I don't know how the heck anyone
could use one of these suckers up I feel
like I highlighted the crap out of my
face when i was using this and I barely
made any progress and this is just a
tiny little mini product so I'm gonna
again tack this on to finish up by the
end of the year I just I was just
getting really gol de doubt i had a lot
of gold products going on and it just
wasn't feeling it so I'm I'm excited to
use this later on it's not that I don't
like the product it's just I can't I
can't do it anymore so this one didn't
really get any more progress I have a
couple lines appear I don't know if you
can see them but I haven't moved past
any of that progress and I was using it
even in the last bit and it just it's
seriously the neverending energizer
bunny of freaking makeups here whoo I
think that's everything I'm gonna start
a new project pan soon I think I really
liked Heather Warren she's someone here
on YouTube and she did like a project
pan roulette style and I really liked
that idea so I think that's what I'm
gonna do for my next project and if you
haven't seen that video i will link it
down below so you guys can check it out
if you're into project panting videos
you'll probably like it I just think it
was fun I really like the idea of it
it's kind of forcing you to use it
products that you didn't pick yourself
like you have less of a direct choice in
the products you're picking although
you're the one making the rules for it
anyway I don't know check out her video
and let me know if you wanted to see
that I mean I'm probably still gonna
film it cuz I think that's I think it
would be fun i really like the idea
anyway that is everything guys I will
see you in my next video cuz I'm gonna
be filming at Uncle Sam's out of town so
I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
