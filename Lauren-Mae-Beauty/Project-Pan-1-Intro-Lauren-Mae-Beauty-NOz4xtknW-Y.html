of project Pam video so this is going to
be my project 20 pan so this is just
kind of I set my own time I picked out
20 items in my collection of makeup and
I did put body care and just different
types of beauty products like that in
this pan I want to use them up so first
thing I guess I'll go with this hence
this is the hemp body lotion in the
flavor or scent cucumber and jasmine is
right about to hear me and Sam both uses
it use this for my hands at night before
I go to bed I am so that I can work
through it gonna be using it on my legs
just so that it can go by faster um I do
really like this lotion I just have two
other big sizes like this waiting for me
I'm not a lotion person I don't like
putting lotion on I don't like the feel
of lotion so lotions are really
difficult for me and a lot of the
lotions I have I get as gifts so yeah
I'd like to work through this so that I
can crack open another one and move
through it so well we should be left on
that I know it's not even that much
that's so sad another lotion this one is
about halfway here this is the honey
sweetheart um body lotion this was from
it's like a limited edition flavor I
love this scent this is like my favorite
scent for a really long time I'm I'm oh
it's okay now but yeah I just want to
use it up again I'm kind of using this
as hand lotion I might try to get some
body applications just to use it up
again
but yeah it'll feel good to get this one
gone as well this is a glam glow youth
mud mini mask I probably only have like
one maybe two like face applications
left on this guy I got this in a set
with the white one I don't know which
one that one is um the white one and the
full-size and this just came with it for
the same price as just the white one so
you know I just want to use it up these
dry out pretty fast and I don't want to
like miss out on any product since it's
so expensive I'm gonna treat myself
treat my skin so this will help me do
that I do have two other maths these are
just like like one use mass so this one
is
the freeman facial hydration mask goji
berry I don't really know I haven't
heard any good things this I just you
know you see these and I picked up like
five one time cuz they were like five
four five dollars so I have a couple
more I want to just move through them
and not have them sitting around
actually use these products since that
was the intentional when I bought them
so this one will be like a hydrating
mask and then this one is a corona
brightening treatment mask so it is
supposed to brighten gosh the light just
like washes it out I've had this one for
like a super super a long time um it
came in like a birch box and I haven't
gotten birch box in like two years
I don't know why I say this for so long
like coveted it it's like let's use it
up girl gonna use this one up and I've
never used a sheet mask before so
that'll be an interesting it would be
interesting I have two items from lush
that I want to use up
that's part of my project pan and swear
my neighbors are crack dealers um this
one here and you know it's kind of her
ups cuz it's in the bags but they were
drying out I didn't know what else to do
this I believe is the Phoenix bath bomb
so this is like a one-time use so in one
bath this would be gone I have this one
before
it just doesn't smell as strongly cuz
I've had it for a really long time so I
definitely want to use it up and get rid
of it and just enjoy it again and care
for myself and take a bath now that we
live here in this new apartment the
bathtub isn't like gross and scary yet
so better take advantage of that that's
so gross the other lunch item is the
karma bath bubble bar Karma bubble bar I
believe that's what this is this you can
use in multiple baths so I want to get
like three to four baths out of this I'm
a big girl
and I like a lot of like suds and
bubbles and I want it to be really
hydrating so yeah I want to use this guy
up it smells so good ha blush steps duh
it's just huge and I don't know why I
don't use them up so it's so busy behind
me there's so many cars another like
body care this is the
pretty and pure body mist I am right
here on it right now I'm gonna go back
to mark all these items but I'm right
there on it now so yeah this one I'm not
even halfway and I've had this a really
long time they don't even make them in
this packaging anymore
it's a nice scent I just I want to spray
it all over all the time to get rid of
it I've decided that body mist just
aren't my thing and I just want to only
have like three and like all in
travel-size because I just don't use
them enough and I don't know I get kind
of grossed out with body mist if I've
had him a long time I'm like even if
they send all the same I feel like
they're tainted or something it's a
weird I know it's weird so this one's
not quite there yet for me but I
definitely feel like it's going to and
I'd rather get my monies out of this so
get my monies out of it get my money's
worth out of this item this is a
rollerball perfume
this isn't Viva La Juicy I got this in a
kit from my brother and mom again I got
a lot of stuff in this like sample kit
from Sephora so I love this scent I like
the Lafleur one better because it's a
little it's less sweet a little more
floral but I still love this one and
yeah I'm gonna enjoy this using this one
up
it'll be nice I'm gonna keep it in my
purse and whenever you know I want to be
feel a little refreshed I'm coming back
from my break at work I'm gonna put this
on and yeah try to get this used up for
the rest of the items are all makeup so
this is the tenth item I'm gonna try to
use up this is the pixie flawless and
poreless face primer I got this in an
Ipsy bag a really long time ago I used
it a little bit and I didn't really like
it and but I still have it so I just
want to use it up even if I use it as
like a moisturizer instead or under
another primer or something like
doubling up but yeah I do want to get I
just want to use it up I don't want to
throw it away or give it away I want to
feel accomplished and use it so that one
I mean it shouldn't take too long it's
just a mini size and there's basically
none left
or none gone from it so this one's kind
of a cheat one not gonna lie this is the
Baby Lips um thing and twinkle it's so
light you can't see it but this item is
right here if you're not counting like
the plastic tubing so um yeah
want to use that up that should take no
time at all like a week Matt I still
feel good to kind of like blow through
so that way I like be pumped up ready to
use up these other products there's a
lot of lip products in here this is a
mini lipstick from Kat Von D I have used
barely any of this basically just to
sample it on my lips so I have from
there down to use it's in the color so
let be tired she doesn't make these
lipsticks she got rid of these and then
reformulated and made a new like a
lipstick line so yeah I think that means
that this is old and I need to use it I
think it's just a pretty neutral color
especially if I can like use other
colors with it to kind of make it not so
nude I put a row hopefully this won't be
too too hard but I've never used up a
lipstick even if it is a mini so I'm
gonna be super excited to use this guy
up another lip product I want to use up
is this many I think it's many Korres
cherry oil lip gloss in the color it's
yeah light purple which it's not a light
purple it's like a cool cool toned Mavi
pink I've really never used any of this
it's just a lip gloss it smells like
cherries I just want to use it up it's
like a hundred percent full basically
and I'm not a huge lipgloss person and
I'm pretty good at keeping my lipgloss
collection down but this one's just
getting old and I don't want it to go
bad so I'm gonna use it up this one I'm
excited to use up it's a big one this is
the Revlon lip butter in the color pink
lemonade I have basically a hundred
percent of this left to use it's like a
hundred percent I am wearing on my lips
right now it's very sheer which I'm
super excited about I just think it'll
be an easy one I just stuck it in there
I think it'll be an easy one to get
through and I like the way it looks it
kind of has like a jelly consistency on
the lips like it looks I don't know just
luscious I'm good so I I didn't realize
how much I like this until I put it on
today so I'm excited to get through this
one and enjoy it while I'm using it last
two lip products this one here is super
mini it's like a mini
maybe it is the two-faced lip injection
extreme lip plumper this is like the
most extreme look plumper I've ever
tried it pretty much I mean it doesn't
burn as much now that I'm kind of used
to it but it burns it burns a lot so I'm
excited to just use it up it's a good
one and it works but I don't really need
to plump my lip just want to use this
guy up hopefully I won't burn too bad
and it's just like a clear a little bit
of iridescence in the gloss but I mean
it's not that much product so if I use
this every day just on top of whatever
I'm wearing hopefully I can get through
it pretty fast and then it lasts lip
product um this is the fresh sugar rose
a little it's like a little mini balm
this is how much I have left of it and
again I'm gonna mark these on the cap
and stuff out of the tinted ones this is
my favorite so I will enjoy using this
especially on days when I just want a
low maintenance lip this is perfect it
gives you just that tint of like rosy
lips and then that's it and it's super
moisturizing as well I will enjoy using
this guy up I bought like a pack at
Sephora last year and I think the year
before that so I had I have none I still
have them a lot of the mini ones so I'd
like to get through some of those and
just so again I spend a lot of money
even on the minis like it's a lot of
money so I want to use use them up and
and get my money's worth there's my four
products left I promise guys this is
another liner imagine that this is the
Stila oscar fish liner I cannot roll
this up because if I roll it up I will
not be able to roll it back down I have
learned the hard way already so I have
already been trying to use this like
every day on my bottom lash line like
smudged out in the corner so hopefully I
have some good progress on it but
honestly I don't know so it's just gonna
kind of be like oh we used it it's done
now one thing I will say I cannot use
this in my waterline it mate leaves like
a film across my eyes I don't like that
scene with the urban decay ones so these
ones I just have to use on like the lash
line or the upper lid not in the tight
liner waterline this one is the Josie
Maran
or Marilyn black oil mini mascara
this is what the brush looks like I used
it in a get ready with me video which I
don't know if I'm gonna post it but it
has like balls on it like five circular
balls on the wand here kind of like the
fairy drops one I've really enjoyed
using this up I gotta happen using this
one for a while so it definitely should
be gone relatively soon hopefully
hopefully hopefully it'll be on I just
want to turn out so many mascaras I've
just been using those three for a really
long time now and I like you know like a
fresh mascara so hopefully I just I can
use those up pretty soon I have to face
products laughs that's it this is the
hourglass mineral veil primer I have
used this before so they're mine if you
can if you can see I can kind of swirl
the product around in here so I
definitely think this will go pretty
fast especially once I finish some of my
other primers I think I'm gonna try to I
don't know how I'm gonna get all of it
out but that's gonna be my goal is to
like get it all out because this is a
super expensive primer and yeah I want
to use it all this river is okay I don't
see the huge hype in it personally I
don't know maybe you got whatever you
visited all of it but and then the last
little guy this is benefit what's up I
got this as Sephora's birthday gift last
year or two years ago a little two years
ago it is a cream highlighter that is
how much I have left
it's a lot of product like so much
product I don't know how easy it's gonna
be diese stuff I'm thinking about doing
a similar thing with my chart one and
putting it underneath my makeup and then
still using a powder highlighter on top
of it but we'll see I also could use
this as like you know a lid thing
I cream eyeshadow is what I'm trying to
say I'm gonna try to find some creative
ways to use this guy up or even just
under my foundation like put it where I
want to highlight and then put
foundation on I don't know um but I want
this gone it's nice I really do like it
I like that it's like cream to powder I
think it's a great product it's just
it's cream and it's gonna go back I want
to use that guy up and those are my 20
items lots and lots of stuff again lots
of makeup I'm gonna be so happy I think
I'm gonna save all my makeup trash from
this year so you can see everything that
I went through makeup wise that'll be
like such a cool thing to see let me
