channel it's Lauren this is going to be
my project pan roulette finale I started
a project pan really early on in the
year not early on like halfway through
the year I was totally inspired by
Heather Warren's video she's the one
that started project pan roulette I will
leave her channel down below to check
her out since then I mean everyone so
many people have done project pan
roulette so it's so awesome to just see
something new I'm just glad she came up
with like a new idea to kind of spice
project panning up because it can get a
little boring if you don't switch it up
especially when you're just using
products over and over so anyway I
thought I would show you guys where I'm
at I'm calling this project done I
started with 12 items that I had picked
out randomly if you haven't seen a
project pan roulette check out my intro
video I will leave that linked down
below as well but I had 12 items when I
started and I believe i did finish the
10 or at least 10 of them up that i
wanted to it was a long project and i do
want to do a project pan roulette in the
future but I'm kind of glad this one's
over it was a long time it was a hard
one if you were doing a project pan or
light or just started when I know a lot
of people are just starting it's tough
so good luck you can totally do it but
it you know if you get a blush it can be
a little difficult so let's just get
into the products that you stopped and
all of that good stuff this will be in
no order so we'll start with my lavish
palette I decided to put orange soda
from the lavish palette in here I just
wanted to hit pan on it and as you can
tell I totally hit pan on this I've even
used it more after hitting pan and like
originally saying I'm good to go and to
stop on it I love this shade it's my
favorite neutral shade that I own it's
so good I'm really glad for this project
to really fall in love with that shadow
again and to get my use out of it so
that was my first item and I
believe this one was an item in a
palette that I had to use that's the
criteria for this one the next item was
for a bronzer I'd picked out out of the
roulette just a bronzer so I decided to
choose the Sephora soul tan no the
Sephora sold kasha can never say it like
seriously ever ever you would think
after so many videos I would know how to
save this bronzer name the Sephora is
sol de frio bronzer and I did hit pan on
it and that was my biggest goal I hit
pan around here and then moved it down
it has since cracked and so now it's
like a full quarter like evenly and
that's something that's a little
annoying about this product is that
there are like ridges underneath the
metal so once you get down and you start
hitting Pat and your product becomes
really thin it's also weak and easily
cracked and I think that's just so lame
that it's already hard to keep a powder
together once it starts getting thin but
those ridges and it don't help any and I
just feel like it's sabotaging your use
of the product like I don't know is it
malicious or not that they did that
anyway hit pan on that finished that one
in the project this was a loose powder i
think is what i picked or a product in
the form you don't normally use i'm not
sure which one but this was the
maybelline shine-free powder and it is
as gone as it's gonna get I cannot take
this little sifter out and I shook this
thing to death so I did really enjoy
this product I don't know if I'd
repurchase it but it was nice maybe I
would if I was looking for cheap loose
powder this was my blush item I had
picked a blush and this was the Laura
Geller blush and Bora Bora Michael and
this was also to just hit pan so if you
can see here I did hit pan this is a
baked product so there's like a
terracotta plate that they dig it on and
yeah hit pan on that this one took
forever but I love this blush I just do
I think it's so pretty it's shimmery but
not too shimmery it's just this perfect
peach that goes with everything
really like this and i'm glad i've used
it as much as i did cuz i did enjoy it
but at the end it was just kind of like
let's get this going like get out in my
original intro video i had picked out
something i've already hit pan on and
the original item i wanted to pick broke
on camera and it was horribly sad so
because of that i had to pick another
item and I actually picked two items for
that and I finished both of them up so
the first item that I had already hit
pan on and wanted to potentially use was
this shadow here it was just a cream
shadow this is the starlix brow cod in
the shade bs1 i had already hit pan on
the cream shade but i just wanted to
continue using it and use it up and i
have since used that up i also picked
this chocolate soleil bronzer from to
face I had this in a finished 7 by
spring I believe and I was so close to
finishing it so I threw it in here to
just completely finish it up because I
picked two I did get to finish up two
more items so now i believe so we're at
six items that I've totally used up in
regards to the challenge rules that I
set for myself I guess I'll just tell
you now sadly the baby lips left me and
I lost it I don't know where it went I
know when I went to my mom's house for
Thanksgiving I had it so I don't know if
they got lost over there I don't know
where it went so that one is out of the
project and just gone lost I feel
horrible but I do not know where it went
it's so sad and that makes me so upset
because I was so close to finishing it
up but whatever next this was a product
of a color I don't normally use
obviously this is kind of a crazy
eyeshadow and this is stila center stage
eyeshadow i have since hit quite a bit
of pan i use this on my eyebrows as you
guys know my hair has been changing
color in every video because my color
will not stay so I'm constantly dying it
and it's fading so it never looks the
same every single day as a different
for my hair which was kind of nice with
this product because I would dip between
the pink and the purple depending on
which tone I wanted and which tone my
hair was taking more of so I'm glad that
I hit pan on this it's another shadow
for the year to hit pan on so I'm just
I'm happy with this and I didn't think
that I would actually hit pan on this so
I feel great about that one early on I
had finished my cream shadow stick in
the color moon from nude sticks I loved
this I would potentially repurchase it
but it is kind of expensive so I
probably would go for milania's like
almond stick or whatever before this but
it was a really nice one if you were
thinking about it it's really nice
really like that this was my deluxe
sized item this was the Clinique
universal face primer I love this it is
great i even repurchased a full size
because i use this up this one is just
the perfect mix between a primary that's
more lotion e and silicon e so it gives
you the smoothness of a silicon primer
without too slippery of a feeling and I
really love that about this so it's a
great one I think I'll probably always
have it in my collection because it's
great I finished up this liner from
stila this is in the color lilac so glad
to be done with this I did enjoy this on
my lower lash line because it was more
of like a warm pinky type of shade it
really brought out the blue in my eyes
so I did enjoy for that but I am glad to
be done with this so those items make up
10 items that I used up so the last item
for 12 items total but i actually had 13
this is the butter london lipstick in
Free Bird Lady Bird actually just joking
that's what it looks like it's a super
pretty lipstick I threw this in here as
a challenge to just wear it more if you
can see in there I mean I did get some
use out of it but I probably only wore
this like three or maybe four times
throughout the project so not the
biggest success but I kind of knew I
wasn't going to use this one up all the
way anyway all right that is my wrap up
finally of my project pan roulette this
was such a fun project and if you are
doing one I wish you guys luck and I
hope you have fun with it that's what
it's supposed to be is just fun and I
will
you guys in my next video thanks so much
