be my project pan Rula intro video I'm
starting a new project pan this video
was inspired by Heather Warren's video
she did this idea where you pick out of
a bowl so I have my little Bowl here
basically kind of like rules for your
project pan so you're not just
willy-nilly picking your project pan
items you kind of laid out some rules
for yourself that you're gonna pick out
up and kind of force yourself to maybe
use up some items you wouldn't have if
you just had the choice to pick them
100% yourself hopefully that makes sense
a few outlines for this project for me
I'm going to be doing finishing up ten
items in this project but I am going to
be picking twelve items to choose from
so two items will kind of be in between
items or it may be something doesn't
work for me or whatever so I'm gonna
have like two kind of extra items in
case to replace other things or whatever
and then also this project pan is not
going to end until I finish those ten
items so I have done a couple project
pans so far on my channel and I haven't
I mean it's been successful in the Sun
set you use things up but I haven't
finished like everything 100% and I do
like to pick a lot of makeup items
because I think they're just the funnest
to watch people use up they feel the
best to use up so we don't want to
finish this project until I finish ten
up I want it to be successful I hope
that that can be in like three four
months or so but we'll see how it goes
so I want to finish up ten items and
some of my rules on here won't be to
finish them up completely some of the
things in here it's like a blush a
bronzer I don't necessarily need to
finish those items up but I do you want
to hit pan on them and like Heather said
in her video I would like the pan to be
big enough to fit the brush in so if
it's an eyeshadow I want to be able to
fit the eyeshadow brush in that pan same
with the blush and the bronzer so
hopefully that makes sense how I'm going
to do this video now I'm gonna pick the
12 items I'm going to show you what they
are and then I will go off-camera pick
those items and then show you which
items correspond with the matching
paper okay let's do this so I'm nervous
Oh a good one a product I'm loving now
so I get to pick any item I want that
I'm really liking so that's a good start
to the project something that I won't
feel just horrible using something I'll
actually enjoy so that's number one
and I made these all up myself I did you
know get inspiration from some of hers
but we're just kind of made my own rules
of stuff and I tried hard not to like
think of items that I would pick while I
made the rule does that make sense
so it could be a little bit more
spontaneous this one says something I've
already hit pan on so I need to pick an
item that is already showing pan and I
can hopefully use up number three and
item of my choice yeah it's going so
well for me so hard I get to pick any
item I want it could be skincare makeup
anything I can pick anything and put it
in the press pan as long I've did an
item you actually use can't fit like a
pizza in there that doesn't count a
loose powder product so anything that's
in a loose powder form I can use Oh
that'll be good that's a good one you
don't see those in projects very often
this is number five
oh I pick two so I guess I'll just do
both of them um this one says a product
I regret buying mmm so I have to pick a
product that I don't I bought but I
don't necessarily love this one says a
cream product so to pick a cream a
product in cream form so that's six okay
we're at six to four I have I'm halfway
there I have six more to go there's
about 22 or so things in there too so
this one says something fun so I wrote
this on here it's kind of a loose
interpretation one so you could pick
something or I could pick something
that's bright or sparkly or fun
packaging just something that's gonna
make me smile in the morning or
something that's just like creative and
fun with your makeup however you want to
interpret that or I want to interpret
that so that one will be fun minutes to
pick out that's number stuff
so let's do number eight this one says a
product you have a love-hate
relationship with so something that
maybe I love the color but I don't like
how it works so where I go back and
forth every day whether I like it
whether I don't so a lot of hate
relationship product that's age you
notice I'm looking straight at you guys
I'm not cheating this is as a product
that's in a palette so I have to pick
something that's in a palette to try to
use upper hip an on this is number ten
it says a deluxe sized item I'm happy
about that one that's number 10 I have
two more I'm just gonna pick them both
in now so that's one anothers to their
own oh there's three there dang it three
pick so one and let's pick number two
two this one says a bronzer and this one
says an item in a color you don't
normally wear awesome so those are my
rules I'll be right back guys I'm gonna
go pick my items and I'll show you which
ones I picked two ports on which I am
going to probably try to make it so that
I can use all these items up at the same
time when I'm doing my face so um you
know just a disclaimer I don't know I
could think that makes sense to do but I
will be back to show you what I picked
out so I am back guys I've chosen the
twelve items that I had my rules for and
yeah we'll see how long it takes me to
use up at least ten of them so the first
line of product you have a love-hate
relationship with that one was kind of
hard to decide what to do but I have
decided to do Baby Lips now why have a
love/hate relationship with these is
because the packaging is adorable I buy
them all the time I'd want to buy them
when you initially put them on they seem
like they're great but they just don't
actually moisturize your lips very well
so I don't know I love them and I hate
them
like I love baby lips so much I want to
collect all of them I still want to
collect all of them and love them but
like these cute little things but I also
hate them and I hate that I love them so
this is the one I used in my baby lip
seven day ciao
video so that is where I'm at for the
recipe items I will go back if I have
need to and mark them but that is the
product you have a love-hate
relationship with
next is a product I regret buying the
product a we got buying probably the
most in my collection or the Tarte cheek
stands not this one specifically but I
bought the huge eight pack of like every
color in the full sizes and I just
regret them entirely just because they
don't need cream blushes but I decided
to use my little mini guy that's already
been in a project man because I really
want him gone and I've already made a
little bit of progress on him so that's
the progress for my last project pan and
I thought this would be a good way to
bust him out again and just get him haul
all the way gone so that's all the
product that I have left it doesn't look
like a lot but it is a lot so that
marking and then you can't see it sorry
that marking there that's all I have
left so you know this is gonna take a
long time I'm going to try to use it
every day under my blushes so yeah we'll
see the next item is an item in a color
you don't normally wear I decided to go
with an eyeshadow this is like a Stila
pressed pigment countless color pigments
is what they're called
I bought these when they're really cheap
somewhere and I'm gonna try to hit pan
on this area over here so like the
Purple's the Pink's in like the peach
area I don't normally wear purples and
Pink's I mean I wear color sometimes
like in my brows and stuff but I thought
this would be a fun one to bust out
during the summer and yeah try to use up
some purples and pinks so I'm gonna try
to hit pan and not send that part of the
eyeshadow for a color I don't normally
wear next this is a loose powder product
I've decided to go with the face powder
I'm using right now this is a Maybelline
one this is the shine free loose powder
in zero one light so that's where I am
right now
that little arrow because sometimes when
it's in the middle you don't know which
way you were holding it I don't know
so that is where I'm at so far with it
yeah I'm like about half way I use it
every single morning to set my face so
we'll see how long it takes to use that
up I've never used up a loose like
powder I never really wear loose powder
so I've never used up like a proper
full-sized loose powder before so that
will be super exciting the next one is a
deluxe sized item I decided to go with
this primer from Clinique this is the
super primer
universal face primer and it's quite a
large deluxe sized sample I wanted to
pick something that would still be a
challenge so I'm going to be using this
I had a green product that I had to pick
so I decided to pick this one from nude
sticks this is a cream shadow in the
color moon it is just a creamy beige
color and I was very strategic when
picking this item there it is there
because you can use it all over the lid
you can use it to define the brows I can
use this a lot of ways and still use
other products so it'll just be a way to
get this out of my collection not that I
don't like it it's just why not move it
out the next one is something you have
already hit pan on and I decided to put
in can I get it I decided to put in my
Stila kitten highlighting duo that's
what it's called it's just a mini size
but I have already hit pan on this so I
want to use this up completely I know
it's hard to see you guys I'm sorry I
turn the brightness down a little I've
already hit pan on both sides so I just
want to finish it up let's finish this
up I don't think that'll be too hard
I'll probably use gosh no I just cracked
it it's all over my floor I'm so upset
right now
okay well take it Lauren why do you have
to ruin everything I think it's just a
goner guys I'm not gonna repress it that
is so upsetting guys
upsetting for you know people who drop
their lorac Pro palette and their
shadows broke I'm so sorry
okay I felt for you then but I feel for
you now like ten times that's it guys
the broken shards in my heart well I'm
really disappointed with that product um
I will pick a surprise product and show
you in the next video because it can't
be bothered to I do mourn the loss of
that product before I can move on let's
talk about the next one okay guys let's
just move on a product am loving
hopefully I don't break that one um that
is this laura geller blush in bora-bora
I've just been loving this color lately
it's just like a peachy color it looks
great on the cheeks I can also layer
this with other blushes so I don't feel
like I'm gonna feel confined to this
blush and I just want to hit pan on it
even the smallest bit of pan I'll kind
of take on this because it is a domed
product so I'm excited to try to hit pan
on that I'd never hit pan on a blush so
that would be fun next I have a product
in a palette and for that I decided to
bust out my lavish palette by Anastasia
and I am going to try this is so awkward
Lauren I'm gonna try to hit pan on this
color here called orange soda it's a
very light orange color it's gonna be
great in the crease of the transition
color so I can wear it every single day
and yeah so I'm gonna try to hit pan on
that and get some use out of the lavish
palette because I haven't busted this
one out in a long time next I have a
product of your choice I decided to go
with a liner now this is steel --is
liner in lilac and I've been wanting to
use this up for the year so I got it
throw it in here and get it used up for
sure that line is not quite right
so it's not a lot of product so this
little bow really fast but that'll be
great it'll feel good I'd be like one of
those like first products ago to keep
you motivated and I'm just gonna wear
that probably on my bottom lash line
something fun I decided it to put in my
butter LONDON lipstick in the colour
ladybird it's such a beautiful color
it's a
red orange shade that's what it looks
like it's just fun it looks great it's
matte it's a great formula so um I don't
know if you can see that's all I've used
of it so I don't know I mean I guess
I'll try to use it up I don't know I'd
be ok if I only use half of it though
but um I guess I'll try to use it up
we'll see if it's like the last product
of the 10 or something then you know
whatever or it could be one of the two
that I don't finish but I think this
will be fun to bust out and use a lot
this summer these type of colors make my
eyes look really blue so I love them and
the last product in this whole thing
except for the one that broke and I have
two reshow you in my next update is a
bronzer and I chose to go with my
Sephora Rio I always call this the wrong
thing on my Sephora soldal Rio palette
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna hit pan on
this soon you can see that X in there I
have been loving this is it's gonna be
in my dream favorites and I think it was
in my may favorites it's like I'm just
obsessed with it it looks so good it
looks so natural it's cool toned but
still amazing I don't know it's so good
I just I'm in love with this bronzer so
um I'll be excited to hit pan on it
because it is so large I'm not like
scared I'm gonna use it up plus you know
I kind of want to use it not all of it
up but I want to see it loved I want to
see the love that I have for this
product by hitting pan so before I drop
anything else I'm going to end this
video here and I'm gonna send one other
video after this um so yeah that is
everything guys I hope you're having a
good day I hope you're not dropping
products like I am let me know if you
are doing any project pans I am gonna do
the 13 fitness 13 bit Halloween as well
I just am in the mood to do project pans
I aren't I aren't doing any others oh
why do I have such horrible grammar I'm
not doing any other projects right now
except for this one and then like the
products I want to use up by the end of
the year type of thing so I think it'll
be fun to have two projects that are
going for a long time so I can see some
major progress we'll see we'll see how
it goes
but
I will see you in the next video let me
know if you're going to do a project in
if you're going to do the 13 by Dave
Halloween that one's really fun it looks
so fun I don't know why but it does and
that is everything guys I will see in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
