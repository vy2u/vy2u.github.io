channel a few things at the beginning
here I'm sorry for my voice I did get
sick recently I'm still recovering so
I'm really sorry about my voice but
that's just the way it is and I finally
had like the energy to actually film
this morning so that's what we're doing
we're filming and then I also wanted to
just say thank you so much for everyone
who's new subscribing for everyone who
has been a subscriber I truly appreciate
you guys and also all of the comments I
know I haven't written back - a lot of
comments in a while so I'm really sorry
about that I'm working on it
I'm just so busy it's really difficult
for me - it's really difficult for me to
make the time and have the energy to
respond your comments but I want you to
know that I read each and every one of
them and they bring a smile to my face
every time I do so I do appreciate your
interaction and I'm sorry that I haven't
written back but I promise you I'm
working on it and I want you to know
that I do truly appreciate it let's get
into this video this is gonna be an
update video and you can totally tell
him second this video cam this is gonna
be an update video so this is going to
be all of my project pan roulette items
that I picked out I'm gonna show you
where I'm at now it's been about a month
let me know if you guys want to see
these more often I usually do about
month updates for any of my projects but
if you want to see them more frequently
let me know and I will try to do that
for you just I don't want to bore you
guys but if you want to see them I
totally will do them if you haven't seen
the intro for this video I'm gonna link
it down below that way you can kind of
understand the whole idea behind those
other than that I'm just gonna get
straight into the video so number one a
project I am loving now for that product
I chose my laura geller blush now I have
been making some progress in there I
don't know if you can tell I have been
working on like this corner of the blush
to try and see some progress so that is
what I'm working on with this
I have 12 items in this project and I
really want to finish ten before I call
it quits on it so this is one that I
want to use so I really would like to
see even just the smallest amount of pan
that's kind of my goal on it so I'm
still working on it it's only blush I
have in my little drawer
so that way I don't get tempted to use
something else because I'm totally would
I do really love this so I'm not like
struggling with it it's really pretty
it's just a little boring but I'm
working through it
the second thing here it was a product
you've already hit pan on now in that
video I broke the product I was gonna
use so I picked two different
replacement items so to replace that
item that I had broke in my last video I
am going to pick two different items so
I have this brow quad here this is from
Star luxe and I'm focusing on this white
shade here so I've already hit tons of
pan whatever one of these this is my
other one I finished first just gonna be
like the one I call done but I'll
probably work on the other one because
they're both products I want to get
finished with so I've been using that to
set the cream shadow I've been using
every single day so I don't have any
issues with this I'll probably finish
this up hopefully pretty soon the other
option that I have though is my Too
Faced bronzer this is the chocolate
Soleil bronzer just a little mini sample
and I've been using this as an eyeshadow
not as a bronzer I need to repress it
I've said it a million times I've said
it in like my old videos on YouTube
press it but I haven't and I still need
to I've actually been using this as an
eyeshadow so I will use another item in
here and then I'll use this to like
deepen up my crease and I really like it
for that so that's how I have been using
it since I started this project pan and
yeah whichever one I use up first or it
might even count like if I finish up
both of these I can maybe like count
them as my 10 will see him I'm breaking
all the rules here so the next item is
an item of your choice and I actually
finish this one up so this is my steal a
liner in the color lilac this is I don't
know if you can see the mark on the cap
there that's about how much I had a
little less than that but it is totally
gone there's nothing that rolls up I'm
so happy to have something done so I
have one down of the 9 so far and I feel
very excited about that I knew this
wasn't going to be hard that's part of
the reason I picked it because it's one
of those things like it counts as a
whole item but it's not gonna be it's
not gonna take forever to actually use
up so I thought it'd be a fun one keep
you motivated and just be like
easier step to all the progress I want
to making so next I have a loose powder
this one is from Maybelline so as you
can see there I was at this line and now
I'm down to this line I wrote a little
arrow because I can never remember like
which way my lines are so yeah I am
getting I'm definitely making progress
and as you can see on the jar it does
get smaller and smaller actually goes
down so I've been using this to set my
face I've actually been enjoying this
powder it does definitely look like
powder on the skin but it definitely
keeps me matte all day long income in
combination with the primers and the
foundation I've been using whatever it
is it keeps me matte all day long which
is amazing and exactly what I want so I
kind of forgiven it for that so I've
been enjoying this and I am definitely
making some progress and these are items
like this I would never probably be
using if it wasn't for this project so
I'm really happy next to have a product
I regret buying I chose my tart cheek
stain and that is all I have left and I
know it's hard to see so I'll do a
close-up but it really just is like
enough that's all it is
I don't know if you can see there it's
just a knob starting for my foundation
bang on I did use it this morning but
there's like plastic that comes up so
it's not much product on the cap I'm
down to that black mark now so I'm still
just chugging through this this product
is honestly it just not one of my
favorites I don't like using it but I am
trying my hardest to remember to use it
every single day before I powder my face
so yeah we're working on it
while I'm here I'm going to show you a
close-up actually of the blush just to
see if you guys can see any of the
progress I was talking about so
hopefully you can see that I know it's
not very in focus but um it's definitely
dented in more on this area and a bigger
like oh my gosh it's so hard I'm so
sorry guys hopefully you can see that
we're gonna stop that moving on to the
next product next I have a cream product
and for the cream product I chose this
nude Stix in the color moon it's just a
matte creamy stick cream eyeshadow so
let me show you the progress I actually
did the line thing I'm so proud of
myself for remembering so at the
beginning of a project dents all the way
up and now I'm about at that line so um
not a ton of progress moving but I use
it every single day so it's definitely
just one of those ones that with
constant you notes you're going to get
through it over and over so I'm just
keeping positive about this and using it
every day so that way I can make it
through for my something fun item I
chose this butter LONDON lipstick and if
you can see in there you can definitely
see some of the black tube which I'm
really happy about but I've honestly
only worn this maybe twice this is what
it looks like they'll give you a swatch
it's so pretty it's like my type of a
red color I really like those warmer
orange ear Reds they make my eyes look
super blue so that's it there I'll show
you it on the paper although I didn't
mark another line because you can't see
anything so that's where I'm at I
haven't used enough to mark another line
so this is one of the ones I'm not
expecting to finish up out of the 12
like to be a part of my 10 so I'm just
trying to use it as much as I can
throughout this project but honestly
it's not one that I think I'll actually
finish for the product that I have a
love-hate relationship with that was my
baby lips and as you can tell I have
made quite a bit of progress so I'll
zoom in on this one for you guys so that
is wearing currently so from that black
line I made a decent amount of progress
it's definitely not as much progress as
I was making when I was trying to use
this up like throughout the week when I
was in my baby lips challenge so um you
know I was expecting that because I
haven't been using this everyday but I
want to focus in on this one to try to
get it done by the next update for you
guys because it's not much left and it's
one of those ones I still want lingering
around anymore I'm gonna try to step it
up on that one my next product is a
product in a palette I chose the Anasazi
Beverly Hills lavish palette and I am
focusing on this cream soda shade now
it's hard to see but I have been making
tons of progress I don't know if you can
see the shadow on it
when I turn it but I don't know how to I
haven't hit pan on this yet because I've
been using it seriously every single day
in my crease I've been having a really
warm crease lately which I do like so in
its very light so it's working for every
day for me but let me see if I can zoom
I don't know if you can see it you can
see some pan there and then also you can
see some pan like on the edges on this
side as well and yeah sorry these are so
horrible that's why I don't like to do
close-ups it's not fun it's not fun at
all that was that one so I'm really
hoping to have pan on this next time I
update you guys next is a deluxe sized
sample this is my clinic primer this is
the universal face primer just disregard
that line I'm down to here I was gonna
film this video a couple days ago and
then I didn't um so I am now up to here
it's changed progress and since so I
will definitely have this done by the
next update as well I've actually really
been enjoying this primer it's kind of a
mix between a silicone primer and like a
lotion primer it feels really nice and
smoothing but it also isn't quite as
like slippery feeling as those primers
has a little bit more mattifying I don't
know I really like it so I wasn't
expecting to just like like this I
thought oh I'll just use it up but I
have been really enjoying this next I
had a bronzer so I chose this big
Sephora one and as you can see I have
hit pan now my goal on some of these is
it to finish them up again if you've
seen my intro you know that but I'd like
to just hit like sizable pan and be able
to fit my brush in so I'm almost there
I'm gonna keep working on this one
because I do just like this bronzer but
yeah I'm almost done with this one I
probably could call myself done right
now but I do want just a little bit more
pan since this is such a large bronzer
I'd like to see it even bigger I will
say to that cross in the middle has made
it really hard to work on this area
because it just crumbles so I've been
kind of moving that way and it hasn't
been crumbling cuz they don't want to
waste the product so that's just
something that's annoying I guess just
bringing it up but um yeah that
that one's super happy with this so I'm
almost done I have a lot of items I feel
like that are on the verge and it's only
been about a month since I've been
starting this so I feel really good
because all this stuff really is I feel
like you know some of them are smaller
or like the deluxe size primer but a lot
of it is me just working through it um
so it's really exciting to see that
progress I hope it helps you guys if
you're stuck somewhere and last but not
least this is an item in a color I don't
normally wear now this is my Stila
pressed pigment in center stage I am
using up like this this area um like
that pinky peachy purpley side I
honestly haven't been getting as much
use out of this I've been doing like a
hot pink eye at work at least once a
week or so and I've done it in my brows
a little bit but it's just gonna take
forever to get through this so this is
another one of the ones that I feel like
it's not gonna I'm not gonna get through
so I'm just throwing that out there this
and that butter LONDON lipstick are the
two that I'm kind of like I want to use
as much as possible in this project just
to get you sad with them but I honestly
don't think I'll finish them and I have
enough products that'll still finish the
ten so but yeah that's where I am there
is no you can't see any dips or anything
at least not yet so I'm not gonna close
up on there that is everything guys for
my project pan again let me know if you
want to see updates like more frequently
and I could do that for you I also have
my finish 13 by Halloween I will be
doing an update for that I believe I'm
gonna film that tomorrow cuz I wanna
film a haul video right now so that'll
be my next one but after that I believe
it'll be my finish 13 by Halloween so
stay tuned for that one and I will see
you in my next video I hope any of you
guys out there that are doing these
project pans are doing well and are
still staying motivated you can do it
girls and guys whoever you can do it and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
