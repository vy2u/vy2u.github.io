is going to be my project pan roulette
update number two I think so i have my
intro my update it's my second update
I'm trying to do these more frequently
so a lot of you guys had said you'd want
that and I made some good progress some
things not so much some things a lot so
let's get into it let me show you where
I'm at and let's make this a fast one
the first item is a product i'm loving
now and that was my laura geller blush
and this is in Bora Bora someone had
asked it and I didn't mention it in my
last video so I'm so sorry but it's Bora
Bora I have I know you can't tell when
you just look at the pan but I have been
making some serious progress so let's
zoom in and I'll show you what's going
on so I hope you guys can see that there
is quite a bit of a dent though and it's
like kind of all in this area it's
definitely not I don't know if I mean
how focus am it's definitely not as like
rounded hope you guys can see that but
I'm really just trying to hit pan on it
I hope I hit pan soon now because I'm
getting over this blush a little bit but
you can definitely see some progress
there so that's where I am on the blush
I've been using this blush every single
day and I have been using a denser brush
with it to try to like pack on more
product as well as like break the
product down more and i feel like i have
seen more progress with it that way so
i'm just gonna keep working on it and
see what i can do just keep truckin i I
just want to be done I mean it's such a
beautiful blush and I do enjoy the look
of it on the skin but i do want to enjoy
some other blushes so it'd be nice to
hit pan soon please the next item is
something you've already hit pan on and
have two items kind of in for that
because the one I picked originally
broke on the ground in the video I was
filming first I have the two-faced one
this is the chocolate soleil bronzer
it's just a little mini I'm never gonna
repress it I don't have time maybe
tonight
no I say that every time and then I show
you and it's never repressed so um yeah
I'm just working on it and I'm basically
just using this as an eyeshadow I have
it in my crease today and I mean I have
been working on it but if I use this as
an eyeshadow it's gonna take me like
three years so I better just repress it
and use it as my normal bronzer at least
for like two weeks and see what I can do
with it but you know we'll see and then
the other item that I was putting in
there was this quad from starlix this is
the brow kit and bs one and the product
I was trying to work on was this pan
here Saul zoom in on it so add you guys
can see there I'd already hit pan but
I've definitely made the pan a lot
larger and I have already hit like all
the way through on this I'm kind of
working down this way and i set my cream
eyeshadow every single day with the
shadow and that's how i've been using
this app sometimes I'll even set a
little bit underneath my eyes and try to
use a little bit more up but I just use
a huge fluffy brush and like set my
cream shadow with this every single day
so overall I feel really good about this
item and if I only finish this one up
and not the two-faced one I would still
count that as like being that one item
and counting it as one of the 10 but I'm
trying to use up if you guys have
forgotten or if you're this is the first
video we're watching I'm doing this
project pan all the way until I finish
up 10 items and there are 12 different
items in it so yeah I am just doing it
until they're finished I just want them
finish I don't want to give myself the
time limit I have another project going
like that but this one's like no you
have to finish them it's not like you
can just let them go after a couple
months and you didn't finish him ok the
next item on the list was this Stila
liner and lilac and as you guys know I
have already finished this up super
happy about that so this is finished up
in the last update but i just wanted to
show you guys it again next on the list
was this loose powder and this was an
item in a form you don't normally use
and that's because it's loose it usually
used a pressed powder every single day
and that's my proper so I'm the third
blind down here and although it's not
even it's just hard to like get the
powder
I've been making steady progress on this
I have no problems with this I've
actually been enjoying it quite a bit
and using the fixed class kind of makes
it less powdery which is nice but I've
been enjoying this and um yeah I'm
really close to being done with it so I
don't know if I the next empty but maybe
the update after that I'll be finished
with it next I have a product I regret
buying this is my Torchic stain in the
color flush and I have not been using
this honestly it's just not something
i've been really drawn to i'm gonna try
to really step it up I say this all the
time but um that's all I have left I'll
Jam you and that's all i have left
though and as you can see there's like a
plastic lip so it's really just the
domed product there's nothing like
coming out it's just like from here it's
just don't so I really just need to step
it up and work on it and I feel like I
could finish this up in like two updates
but I don't want to yeah so I'm just
trying to work on it this is a product
ever kept buying for a reason and it's
hard to use because I just don't like it
that much but we're working on it so one
of my items is a cream product and that
was my nude sticks cream shadow in the
color moon and I've been making really
good my gosh these videos are gonna be
so bad I'm making really good progress
on this guy and I will show you on the
piece of paper so on the first update I
was all the way up to here and now i am
on this line here which is so super
exciting i cannot look at how hard this
is for me yeah i feel super good about
the progress on this and this is just
going with consistent you so I'm not
doing anything special to get rid of it
i'm not using it in any other places
besides my eyelids i just use it every
single day so i'm just gonna keep
trucking through it using it up I feel
really good about this because it's like
one of those things I feel like that
takes forever but I'm actually seeing
some really good progress on it I feel
like in the amount of time I've been
doing the project so yeah it's
good one though it's like a basic but
it's good it feels good to use up some
things fun is my next item and that is
my butter london lipstick this is in the
color ladybird it's absolutely beautiful
I've not used it at all though so there
is no progress on this this is one of
the items i don't feel like i'll
actually use up in the time so it's
probably one of the two that i won't
finish so yeah I think because I said
that in my last video to that's half the
reason I didn't use it so I probably
should have said that but hopefully I
can use it a couple times and see what I
can do sorry about all the banging I
don't know what's going on it's so loud
the next product in this project is an
item I have a love-hate relationship
with and that is my baby lips I've made
decent progress on this guy um that's
where i'm at now i'll show you guys the
close-up um yeah i was at it's hard for
me to see without my glasses how about
that line now i'll show you yeah so
that's where I'm at um steady progress a
little less than last time so I'm hoping
to finish it up maybe this time it's
just not something I want to use anymore
i really wanted to be gone i'm in the
hatred part of this relationship and I
want it gone so oh just get out of my
life this one's exciting this is my
product in a pallid and I chose my
anastacio lavish palette and as you can
see there I have totally hit pan on
orange soda I feel so good about that I
had been working so hard when I had done
my first update to hit pan on it and it
just wasn't there and then I think like
three days later I hit pan and now I've
just been working even more I absolutely
love the shout out the more i use it the
more like I don't even know what else I
use in my crease like this is all I've
been using for the past like two months
or so maybe a month and a half and I
cannot imagine using any other color
it's like all I use if I do any if I
don't want to do a big look I'll just
put that in the crease and put like
lashes not lashes but mascara on my
lashes and be done with my eyes it's
just so good and I am at the point where
I probably could call this done but i'm
just going to keep working on it this is
the face primer from cleaning
I'm a hundred percent finished with this
so it's my second item done I have eight
more to go and i loved this primer so
good it's just really nice i paired this
with my smashbox um poreless primer and
i would use this all over the face and
then the smashbox one just in the area's
I need it where I had texture issues big
pores or what I needed oil control and
they just work so well together they
don't follow up anything like that so i
will definitely repurchase this once
i've used a couple more primers up I
just need to use a couple more before I
just totally commit to this one because
I have a lot but I can't wait to
purchase that one the next one is a
bronzer and this is a Sephora one this
is in Seoul Del Rio Sol de Rio and I
have made even more progress on the pan
here I'm kind of working this way in the
pan and I could probably count this as
done as well because it is quite a large
amount of pan but i think i'm going to
just keep going until I hit the edge
here and then call it done like I can
still work on it if i want to but it's
like done for the project I've just been
using this every single day as my
contour / bronzer to warm up my face
give it some definition I absolutely
love this still it just works really
well it's just a good one it really is
and there's so much product in this
thing it's crazy I'm not tired of this
one and I'm just going to keep working
all the way to the pan there so yeah
good progress the last item for this
product oh it's so hard to say this the
last item for this project is this Stila
countless color pigment in the color
center stage to be honest again with
this one I haven't even touched it since
the last update which I feel horrible
about but it's just true this is just
hard to use and I haven't been wanting
to do like hot pink and again I only
need 10 items and if I don't use this or
my lady bird one I will be fine so I
think that's also the reason I heaven
picking it up because I know it won't
hurt me in the project because I know
what items I actually want to use up so
I'm gonna try again to use more of this
but honestly I'm just celebrating my
successes right now so if I don't get to
this or if I don't touch it anymore I
would be totally fine with that I hope
you guys enjoyed this update I hope it
wasn't too long and i hope the things
we're in focus i hope that my zooming
wasn't super freaky like it always is
but it probably was and i will see you
guys in my next video i hope you guys
enjoyed by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
