hope you guys are doing well this is
going to be an update on my project pan
roulette I don't know what update this
is but it feels like it's been a long
time I have a lot of Awesome progress as
I think I'd mentioned in another video
I'm going until the end of the year but
I hope that I'll be done before then I
have 12 items that I picked out randomly
i will link my intro video if you guys
want to check it out but I have 12 items
that I picked and I want to use up 10 of
those next year I am planning I think to
do a project panel at some time in 2016
and i am going to be picking new items
as they finish things up in that project
just because it's gotten a little steel
and a little boring at least for me so i
think it's a great way and i know a lot
of you guys have been doing that where
you pick new ones to replace products
you've used and I think it's really
smart keeps it fresh keeps it fun also a
little disclaimer there are men working
in the apartment right next door to mine
so I will try my best in editing and
everything to not get them in here but
if you hear banging or talking or
anything like that there's nothing I can
do you've probably heard them at night
last couple of videos so yeah that's
just life right now let's get into this
update I'm going to go through all the
products I've used up and then show you
some of the progress I've made on my new
ones I've made sure to actually include
all my items this time instead of
getting a little too caught up in
wanting to go fast so you will see
progress on everything this time this is
my Sephora bronzer and rio del sol i
wanted to just hit pan on this as big as
my brush and then I kind of just worked
it all the way up into the corner there
so I am finished with this for what I
was trying to do for this project so my
roms ER is done this I didn't show in
the last one but this is my Anasazi
Beverly Hills lavish palette I chose the
color orange soda and it's upside down
and as you can see there I did hit pan
on it which is my goal I almost actually
finished it so love that shade it was a
good one this was something that i added
in after my first update but anyway this
is a cream shadow for my brow quad from
star looks in bs1 i did finish using
that up a long time ago so there
is no cream left like cream shadow left
in there that's done the clinique primer
the universal face primer is done this
was my deluxe ice item i also finished
on my steel a convertible eyeliner in
the color this was in lilac I don't know
why I can never remember but I finished
that up super early on and I believe
that's everything I finished since my
last update so i will show you all the
new products i have finished as well as
my progress on some other things i don't
think i finish this in my last one this
is the Maybelline loose powder in light
it's the shine free one this is
completely done there's like nothing in
there I tried pulling off the cap but I
was not able to successfully do that to
try to use like seriously every last bit
but there is no way I can shake that
stuff out so totally used up this was a
huge item I mean I was using it for a
while but I mean this is a big
accomplishment I don't think I've ever
gone through a large loose powder I did
enjoy this I don't know if I to purchase
it again but I'm glad it's got out of my
collection because I bought it because
it was on sale not because I heard
anything great about it or really liked
it and so I'm glad I at least used it if
I was going to just randomly buy it this
I actually just used up in a get ready
with me like that was my final time
using it but I finish this Too Faced
bronzer this item was the neverending
product I swear it took me forever it
wasn't my boo my bags falling it wasn't
my finished 7 by spring which was
forever ago I hit pan on it made a lot
of progress but I didn't quite finish it
and then i repressed it and it still
took me forever forever to use this
product out so glad it's gone i had a
kind of love hate relationship with this
sometimes i loved it sometimes I hated
it so I'm glad that it's gone for now if
I'm talking weird it's cuz my lipstick
I'm scared I'm gonna have like purple
teeth but anyway I'm glad this product
is gone for now but i would consider
repurchasing it maybe at some point i do
have another little sample of it so i
will try to use it up a little later
down the road i am done with my nude
sticks this is the cream shadow from
nude sticks in moon it is so tight
me there is no way I can sharpen this
anymore I am done with the product I
can't put this on my Iowa scratch it up
major so it is done I thought I would
maybe try to show you the progress on
the paper so I started all the way up
there and then when it's all the way
finished that's where it was so a lot of
product was used up it was essentially a
full pencil when I started this so
really glad that's gone although I did
enjoy it so it wasn't something I wanted
to get rid of because I didn't like it I
did like this and I kind of miss it so
definitely would consider having
something like this in my collection I
don't think I'd spend twenty-four
dollars on this one them and the last
thing this is the best thing this is my
Laura Geller blush this is my Laura
Geller blush in Bora Bora as you can see
there you see that little pattern I did
hit pan it felt like this blush was
never gonna end it felt so long but
right after I don't even know maybe like
a week and a half ago I kind of was like
is that pan and I kept working at it and
sure enough it was so I'm going to zoom
you in just for the glory so that you
guys can see this pan in its full glory
so hold on look at it that's it they're
so beautiful definitely hit pan there's
no denying that so although it's not as
big as the brush I just wanted to hit
pan and I did so there it is he's super
happy about that I've never hit pan on a
blush before so I was really happy to
see that I have four items left so I'll
go through those with you I'm just going
to get the butter london lipstick out of
the way i haven't used this this is in
the shade ladybird really pretty but I
just haven't used it and I kind of
wasn't expecting to use this and since i
know i only have to use of 10 i haven't
really been going for it so this is
justin sitting my drawer but no progress
all the other three have some progress
so i'm really happy about that i'm going
to start with my tart cheek stain i have
been using more of this i know it looks
like it's done but there's this tiny
little dome so it's plastic and then the
dome
for you guys so there it is there it's
mostly plastic and then there's that
tiny bit of a dome that's all I have
left to use so there really isn't much
on this i have been using this with a
brush lately and I don't know why I
wasn't using it with a brush earlier I
know that that's the way you can use it
but it just looks so much better it
doesn't disturb my foundation as much I
just really almost like it that way
instead of just bearing it so that is
how I'm going to be finishing up the
rest of this i'm using like a duo fiber
brush to stipple it on after i do my
foundation and then go in with my powder
i think that this will be done and this
is kind of one I was like don't I didn't
think I'd get done or I just thought I'd
hate the whole time but I'm excited for
that new like break through with this
product so hopefully it'll be done next
update next I have this Stila countless
color pigments in the color center stage
this is getting no progress but I don't
know if you can see in that little
corner this little corner I have been
making progress on it because of my
eyebrow so since dying my hair I
basically have had these color eyebrows
the whole time since my hair has been
done even a little bit before that I was
doing my eyebrows purple I guess I'll
zoom in so you guys can see this I know
it's kind of hard to see but that is the
progress they're just that little like
black hole I've been going in with my
eyebrow brush that's why it's such a
small amount but I have been focusing it
on just this kind of you know pinky
purple area and been making a lot of
progress so I think I'll even hit ban
even if it's just the tiniest little bit
before the end of this project I'm
really happy with the progress I made on
this so far I didn't think that I was
going to use any of this up but I think
I might be able to hit pan which is
really awesome last but not least is my
baby lips I started all the way up here
hopefully you guys can see that and then
ended and right now i am here so i did
make a little bit of progress this was
something I kind of lost for a moment
there's nothing left I really just need
a again like I said in everyone buckle
down and use it I just haven't in my end
of the year project pan I have a lot of
stuff that I'm trying to use up blood
product wise so I'm going to try to
maybe just dedicate four days or five
days to this and I think that I would be
able to get it done
time if I was using it like i was in my
baby lips challenge so I'm not worried
about using this product up per se I
just need to do it but it have like a
whole month if I wanted to but I'd like
to end this project out early if I can
for sure well that's everything for this
update I hope you guys are doing well
and your projects I will see you in my
next video have a wonderful day my eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
