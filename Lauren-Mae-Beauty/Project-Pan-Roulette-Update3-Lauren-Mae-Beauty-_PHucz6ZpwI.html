is going to be a really really quick
update on my project pan roulette items
I've made some progress on some things
and yeah i just want to show you where
I'm at I'm going in no particular order
like because I'm never organized so
first thing here is my chart cheek stain
I'm in the exact same place honestly I
haven't used it at all not even give you
a close-up so I just have that little
bit left I just haven't been wanting to
use it and I've been enjoying not using
it so I'm gonna try because I do want to
get this just out of my collection I've
he's so much of it to just quit now seem
sad but I just haven't been wanting to
use it so I need to get rid of this I'll
go to like a fun thing that I finished
up this is my brow quad I've come whoa I
have completely used up the shade in
here that was like that cream shade I
used it to set the cream shadow that's
also in here and it is completely gone
so I am technically counting this as
that item I did have a second item that
I put in there though so that is the
two-faced bronzer in chocolate Soleil I
did repress it guys you should be so
proud of me I'm proud of myself I've
repressed it today it's what I'm wearing
today as my bronzer I'm not a fan of
this shade on me I don't know one of
this but I'm gonna finish it up because
i finished my the bronzer which is the
next thing this is the sephora bronzer
that I picked out this was the bronzer
in Seoul Del Rio and my goal is just to
hit pan big enough for my brush and then
once I did that I was like I'm just
gonna kind of like go all the way over
here so it is completely used up all the
way into that corner this is a huge
bronzer I I mean as much as it it didn't
take me long to hit the pan I'm gonna
haven't even used up a quarter of it and
it took me a long time so I'm calling it
quits on that I feel really happy with
the progress I made on this bronzer and
this item is now done so that's awesome
I'll just show you guys items I again
another item
haven't made any progress on that would
be this I haven't used it at all I'm so
crappy I need to start using this I
really want to start using it in my
brows again I was doing that for a while
and I liked it so I'm gonna try hard
this week and the next couple weeks to
really get some use out of this I just
want to at least see like a little bit
of ruffle powder in there at least
something geez so um yeah I'm gonna try
to use that this coming up next for the
next update hopefully something i did
use this once this is the butter london
lipstick and ladybird i'm really not
much progress though i'm not even going
to market i'm not expecting to use this
up i'll show you it twisted up though I
mean it's still like a full lipstick but
i did use this one so i feel glad that
at least busted it out that one I wasn't
expecting to really finish I just want
to throw it in here my goals use 10 and
I have 12 items these are 2 items you've
already seen empty this is the Clinique
primer I really like this primer but
it's gone I also you know used up the
steel liner in lilac I like this a lot
too but it's gone so I just marked it
but this is my loose powder for
Maybelline I am down to this line I
seriously have like no product left so
I'm gonna try to just shake all of this
into the front part of it and that way
just work out of like everything this is
almost gone that's crazy I had like
almost half of this in here but when I
started so almost done with that one
this is my blush in Bora Bora from Laura
Geller I am so done with this but I have
continued to use it I'm going to see if
you guys can see the progress without me
zooming in but i think i'll have to zoom
it so if you can see that's where i'm at
there's quite a bit of a dip in there
trying to like catch it all the
different angles I'm really focusing in
on this area here and my goal is to just
hit pan so I do have quite a bit of a
dip going in this corner I'm trying to
show you it's so hard guys um if you can
kind of see in that corner when I hold
it different ways oh that's good in the
light like in the shadow anyway I'm just
trying to use this until I hit pan even
if it's the Chinese bit of pain i'm
going to call it i'm just getting done
with the shade i want to move on to
other stuff so i'm trying my best I feel
with the progress they made on this and
I don't want to just quit but I'm just
over it I'm really over it and the last
item I'm really happy with the progress
on still not done but I'm so close this
is the cream shadow stick in moon I have
been just using this every day I've been
enjoying it I'm not tired of it i like
using this as a base for my eyeshadows i
will show you it on the on the paper so
the first line you see there is where my
last update was and now i'm all the way
down to where the tip is attending so
feel really really happy about that
that's great progress and it's just
proof of use one of these like every
single day you can get it on your
collection I feel like pretty fast so I
don't have much left on this I don't
know how long it'll be until I can't
sharpen it anymore that was like super
speed I'm sorry my camera is like
flashing red at me so I am gonna let you
guys go thank you so much for watching
this and I just wanted to mention
something really small at the end I've
seen a couple other people like say
they're gonna do this video and I've
seen them done and I didn't even realize
half the people who have already done it
so I'm trying to let go and find them
and subscribe to them and all that type
of stuff I just didn't really I think
it's really cool that so many people
think this is like a cool idea thanks to
heather for like even making this up
like I thought it was such a cool idea
when I saw hers and um it's just really
cool to see our community embrace it I
don't know I mean like it's just a
really cool thing to see so um let me
know down below if you're doing one of
these because I definitely want to
follow you and see how you're doing it's
so fun Oh something man it's so fun to
see the items that people pick and you
know watching them do stuff that's kind
of more challenging or something that
they didn't have complete control over
picking in their projects so let me know
I you know I don't I'm not very big on
like social media I really only have the
YouTube the YouTube and so I don't see
any of that stuff on like Instagram and
everything but if you have a channel
please list it down below if you're
doing a project pan roulette or any
project pants but especially project
panel let's leave it down below I'd love
to see them and subscribe to you and
watch your progress and all of that so
let me know that's everything I'll see
