channel I just filmed my finished by by
Cinco de Mayo number one or first up
deep and I am now going to be filming my
project 20 pan like personal challenge
update I don't know why but I did not
put in the other video when I wanted
this to end so this project is going to
be ending the end of may so right after
basically this England Amaya one I
thought that would give me enough time
to finish these items but not feel too
pressured since I do have quite a few
projects going on but let's just get
into the video let me show you guys what
I've used up what I have it I feel like
in this project I definitely have made
some good progress I'm happy with where
I'm at and I definitely feel like I can
hit my goals so let's get into it i'm
going to start off with the items that i
have completely finished up first those
are more exciting those are the most
exciting items for sure so let's start
with those so we can get pumped up so
the first one I have completely finished
at my hubs body lotion on the first
update I was at this line here and now
it is gone i know that's a lot of
product but i do feel like this went
faster than I thought it would be and I
will say I did enjoy being moisturised
forcing myself to use lotion I'm not a
lotion person but since I had to to
finish this up I did quite enjoy the
results at least of it this one
specifically does sink into the squint
this Quinn this one specifically does
sink into the skin quite well and easily
I do like this and i have two more big
ones to use up that's what i wanted to
get this one done with but yeah I'm god
it is so done it's done it's done and I
don't have like a squeegee or something
to like get all that product out but i
don't care i'm i'm completely content
with this thing done i have also used up
this Freeman goji facial hydration mask
in goji berry I actually got two uses
out of this mask so that was nice it was
okay it came out kind of clear and then
it dried on the skin it wasn't like a
peel-off mask but it wasn't a mud mask
either I don't think it really helped or
did anything that special but i'm glad
i'm done with it i didn't waste it I
proud I would not repurchase this but
it's done game as expected i also
finished up this lip balm when I had my
date look it's all gone I didn't dig it
out i'm not into that but am I update it
seriously had like nothing like that's
where the line was it had no product and
it was just a cheat one but it is gone
and out of my collection I also finish
up his josie maran black oil mascara
that's what the wand looks like I'm glad
this is done I felt like this was
starting to flake on me and so I just
kind of called it quits it didn't really
apply that much product to my lashes
either so that is done I'm glad I you
stood up I did enjoy it while it was I
feel like performing correctly I thought
it was nice I don't know if I would pay
the price for it but it was good and
it's gone sadly those are the only four
items I've used up but I have made some
decent progress on other things so I'm
gonna go through those things now this
was my Viva La Juicy rollerball and when
I first started I was up here at the
slide and now I am all the way down here
which is super exciting i was using this
while i was working i would figure on at
the beginning of the morning and all
these different places and then on my
break i would put it on again so who's
using this twice a day and it definitely
helped me move through it i think that
i'm going to try to focus in on this
item and finish up by the next update
this body splash i actually didn't mark
so i'm sorry but i am now right about
here whereas the other line is there so
just a little bit of progress i will say
i do not work on this item that much i
just kept forgetting i just i don't know
i just forgot about it and usually if
i'm going to wear a spray I'll just do
actual perfume with i'm going out so i'm
also going to make this a point to focus
in on it I don't really like the scent
anymore it's just a sweet kind of girly
but I don't know I'm just kind of over
the scent I feel like I get over the
Senate like every video I'm like over
the Senate over the Senate but yeah I
just don't want this one anymore and so
I'm just gonna keep pushing through this
one I'm going to try to focus in I want
to get like half way through the product
that I have left by this update to the
next update it'll be gone like by the
next update I want to be to hear and
other update done that makes sense so
hopefully I can just remember to use it
i put in the bathroom should i spray it
on after a shower also before i leave
the house like even if it's been halfway
through the day so that's how I try to
it will see how it goes I have the other
little lotion that I had in this and I
started here this is well I guess I
should tell you what it is this is the
bath and body works honey sweetheart
little travel-size body lotion it was
here and now i am about there once the
product all settles down i was using
this on my body once I finished the hems
one and I really I again lotion it's not
as bad as I thought it was wow it feels
good to be moisturized this end of this
is nice I haven't gotten tired of it but
i am going to be excited to just finish
this guy up and get him out of my life
he's so close he will definitely be
finished by the next update so that's
great I have made quite a bit of
progress on this pixie flawless and
poreless primer I started up here I
really had only used it a couple times
and now i am down here i've been using
this after my moisturizer which i'm
using quite a thin moisturizer right now
so I don't feel like it's quite enough
moisture for my skin to all use this one
after that and then put my poreless
benefit Porefessional one on top of it
and that's how i've been using it up I
mean there's really not that much
product and here i thought this would
take a little bit more time than it has
been taking their you can kind of see
how it's dented in but yeah this will
definitely be done i think by the next
update as well so that's a great
progress for the glam glow a little mini
mask I oh I still have a little bit left
I've used this one time and then I did a
spot treatment last night as well I'm
gonna try to just finish this up or have
Sam finish it up um by the next update I
will have it done just because it's
getting drier as the days go by when I
used it last night it was dry when I
used it the other time it was less drag
so I'm gonna see the progress of it
losing its moisture and I don't want the
rest of the since I was not much in
there to just dry up and and be all
crumbly and gross so I want this done by
the next update I don't know if this is
enough to do like a full face so I might
just do kind of like a spot treatment of
where and mostly breakout or something
like that but this I feel good about
definitely will be done next time i have
this mini little kat von d lipstick this
is in the color celebutard it's just a
really pretty nude color what
I first put this in my project I didn't
think I'd like the color but I have been
enjoying the color I don't know if you
can tell the progress just by like
looking at the tube itself but i have
made just a little bit you're not
probably going to be able to see it so
I'm sorry but from here just the time
you spit down i also want to focus in on
this one I want to switch off between
this one and another lip product and
just stay really bland with my lips just
so I can get through them so this one
I'm hoping to be like halfway done like
I want the tip gone in the next update
that's my goal this is the Revlon lip
butter and pink lemonade that I put in
the project I have barely used any of
this and I know I was all excited on my
last video but this one if you put too
much of this product on it makes your
lips look milky and gross and so it's
not something that I can just like pilot
on on because I'm trying to use it up I
definitely you know you just have to put
the normal amount or even less than that
just so it doesn't look scary and so
that was annoying i tried using this at
work and then I looked at myself and I
was like girl have you look like that
all day like oh my gosh you're scaring
me and so I know you scared the
customers um well I'm just gonna try to
be using this like switch it off again
with that cat 1 T 1 and do that one than
this one that one then this one I will
say for only using it as many times as I
have there's definitely a good amount of
progress going on with it um so I know
that if I'm using this like 15 days out
of the month there should be pretty
significant progress made with this one
this is the hourglass mini mineral veil
or Vail mineral primer I only use this
once but there really isn't much product
left I don't know how I'm going to get
it out um I probably if I can't scrape
it like all the way out I'm probably
only going to have maybe one use left of
this so I want to try to just use this
one day and get this done by the next
update to just so it's gone and if I
can't get that product out i'm going to
try the water trick i've heard people
talk about that like the hot water or
put up
like a light or something even though I
feel like that my like breathe bacteria
I don't know I'm gonna try and do that
and see what I can get out and if I can
I'm just gonna like give up and not cry
about it too much it's like one tier and
be done with it this two bigs mini lip
injection i did use this affair but it
probably use this like seven times since
the update um I definitely should use it
more though and I'm hoping to have this
done by the next update but I am going
to take the stopper out of this one I
think I don't know if I'm going to
always do that with everything but since
it's such a little like a little product
I feel like even taking the stopper out
it's not like adding a bunch more
product to my project pan so I I'm
hoping to take the stopper out and get
all of this completely done but the rest
of the items i have here either i've
been using that you can't tell the
difference or there isn't any
significant difference or i haven't used
really at all so first thing is this
Stila smudge stick in the color oscar
fish I've been using this quite often I
just can't tell you the progress so I'm
hoping it feels like a lot of the weight
is in the top I don't know what that
means maybe that means like all the
products of the front and it's almost
done that's what I'm hoping I've been
using this on my bottom lash line that's
just the only way i can use it i don't
like it in the water line because it
makes my eyes feel like goopy and like a
film's over them so i can't do it that
way and that's just how I'm trucking
through this I think this will be done
by May especially if I use it every day
but I am going to try focusing on using
this every day I wear makeup on the
bottom lash line even if it's just
lightly at least I'm using it the
benefit what's up little mini guy is the
exactly same way that's the line up
there and I didn't even mark it again
because there was no difference i have
been using this I've been trying to use
it it's just a dense little product and
i've been using this with a brush but
i'm just kind of over at the colors like
a Goldie color it's kind of I'm not into
gold I don't know I think I said that in
my last video so I'm just I don't want a
gold highlight anymore so I'm just
trying to work through this if you have
any suggestions for me on this product
that i can use it in a way that maybe
won't irritate me so much please let me
own or how have you used this if you
project panthous because I'm I just hate
this guy even though it's a good product
I just don't want to use it I it's like
I dread using this and I hate that so
I'm just gonna try it at least
incorporate it like half the week or
something and then the other half of the
week use something else or maybe doing
every other day like okay I use
something else so I'll use it today or I
used yesterday so I get to use something
else I don't know we'll see how that
works so this one's been hard for the
lip gloss I haven't used any of this
this is the korres lip gloss cherry lip
gloss in the color light purple I really
have only used this maybe three times i
have not used it much so i'm going to
try to top the to look part of somebody
going back and forth with with this
product every single day so i can make
some visible progress because there's
just nothing mean it's a full tube still
and we're only losing time here so that
time i try to work on that and see where
i can go this is the mini sugar rose a
lip balm i will use this also a handful
of times there's no real progress going
on um I think that I just forget about
this item I love this item I just
haven't been using it so i think this
other lip products are what I'm gonna be
working on first not that I won't use
this but I just I could use going to bed
since the moisturizing balm or I could
use this so many other ways and places
that I want to focus on the other ones
and kind of leave this for the end since
I know I can get through it I still have
the corona mask to use this one once I
do choose use it while so they just be a
one-time thing so I'm not worried about
this I might save it to the end as well
just because it's something small or a
might just finish it so that it's one
less thing to do I don't know I strategy
on that yet but um yeah nothing to say
about it and then the last two items
here are my lush bath bomb and bubble
bar I have not used these yet I don't
have a plug like a bath plug in my tub
to stop the water from leaving so to
actually fill my tub up so I haven't
been able to
use these I need to go get one of those
that's going to be my goal my mom's
coming into town so we'll probably go
and try to find something to do that
with because I do want to take baths and
I just need to use these up there just
drawing out there so drive so that I
need to get that before it can use you
so once I get that then we'll see what
it sees that come up with then right
just kidding um but yeah these are the
last two items and I have not obviously
used any of them so those are my 20
items I feel really good i kind of have
three sections going on the used up
almost used up and then the kind of
stragglers will call them but I'm
excited I feel good I feel like the
progress in this one is definitely
moving forward and yeah I put my goals
in as I was talking about him so those
are going to be my goals to finish those
specific items or be working on making
some good progress in those items and
we'll see at the next update where I'm
at let me know if you guys have any
updates or how you guys are doing more
anything like that in the comments down
below I will see you guys in my next
video which will probably be just like a
warning will probably be something with
my mom and it she's coming into town and
I'm super excited and heard my little
brother and make from a video with them
because they want to be in it and it'd
be fun so I will see you guys then or in
my next video I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
