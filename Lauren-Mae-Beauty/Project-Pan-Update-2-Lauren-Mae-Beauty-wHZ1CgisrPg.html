my channel I am doing my project 20 pan
like personal challenge update number
two today it's been like over a month
since i've updated you guys on where my
progress stands with these items now
this project started I don't even know
when it started I want to say the
beginning of like februari or so and
then it is ending the end of may so I
have about a month left let me show you
guys my progress I feel good about
wearing ads I'm at the halfway point in
my products of using like what I've use
what I still have left to use up so
let's get into the products that I've
already used up last time these are not
like new used it up these are just like
kind of going over what I already have
so sorry guys so the first item I used
up last time was this hemp's body
moisturizer in cucumber and Jasmine this
is all used up I'm glad it's gone I
enjoyed it even though i don't like
lotion while i was using it so that's
good i also used up this goji berry mask
by Freeman this is ok I got two uses out
of this packet and OH Krusty's nasty it
was ok i probably wouldn't repurchase
this specific one again because they
don't feel like it did anything that
great it's supposed to hydrate and I
didn't feel like it did that so but I
used it up so that's gone I kind of gave
myself a cheat item in this project this
is the baby lips and when I hat I
started I had like nothing left and it
is completely gone and rolled up that's
just like the plastic tubing part so
that's done again I really hope I'm in
focus i'm sitting further back from the
camera just because the light if I'm to
close it like blows me out and I don't
want that so I'm sorry hopefully it is
oh I can't I can't do your that
that's what it's like to live here it's
every day all day and then the last
thing the last thing I used up with this
josie maran argan black oil mascara
we're just gonna have to go over guys
I'm so sorry this I used up and I don't
really ever know when a mascara is used
up I'm like how do people know that but
it just started to flake on me and the
product is hard to apply I'm guessing
that's how everyone else guesses but so
it is time for this one to go now this
time i used up one tooth i used five
items up since that update so that's
really awesome let's get into those
things i used up the glam glow mask now
that's inside there there is I mean it
looks like there's some product but
there really isn't I will say this did
dry out I had to like revived it with
water which was really weird and
definitely changed the consistency of it
so that kind of sucked but I'm glad at
least you know tried I tried really hard
to get all the views I could out of this
thing so I like the glowing blue masks I
think the only one that's worth the
money is the white one I've only trade
the black one and the white one like my
mouth haven't tried any of the new ones
that have come out I really like the one
I think it actually works and I think
it's worth the price but this one I just
don't know why I would get this one I
just get the white one I used up this
bath and body works honey sweetheart
little travel-size body lotion and I
like the smell of this a lot this is
like a like limited edition but it came
out with a collection and they don't
have it anymore I wish they did but they
don't and I'm glad I used it out before
like went bad or anything and it's gone
so like how annoying living here is just
I can't wait to move is all i can today
I can't wait I don't have like the
actual product with me because I used it
up but i did use up my lush Phoenix bath
bomb and it was like a purple little
bath bomb you put it in there and it
fizzes in the water I will say that the
lush stuff is all like more natural
product so i think it is really
important to use them up in a timely
manner when you get them because I will
I don't think that it performed as well
as it would have if I had used it in the
proper amount of time it didn't just
like fizz up and do a thing like I've
seen it do before so that was kind of
disappointing I just hate them I did use
a path of the Karma bubble bar so I
still have half of that to go but wanted
to show you that then another thing I
used up this is the crew in a sheet mask
it's in the bits of brightening
treatment mask I've never used a sheet
mask before and this was like a weird
experience it was super saturated so
that was kind of nice it was really fast
to apply like I can see why people like
these in the sounds like you don't sit
there and like rub it all over your face
you just like slap it on and you're good
to go for 20 minutes or however long I
don't think it did anything for my skin
I don't know it was interesting it was
okay i didn't notice anything special
it's just like one mask so but that's
used up so that's great and then the
last thing that i finished up is this
hourglass mineral mineral mail mm-hmm
mineral veil primer it's just like the
mini size and i got in there and I
scraped out as much as I could there is
a little bit of product on the top just
like barely coating that outside but I
got everything I could out of this and
it is done for me so that's done so
those are the 10 items that I've
actually like used up and then I have 10
items that I'm still working on and I'll
go through and show you the progress i
already showed you the bubble bar so i
still have half of that to go this is
the Viva La Juicy rollerball so at the
last update I was up here and now i am
down here i thought i was going to
finish this off last time it's just
something i forget about it's not that I
don't like it or I hate using it I just
forget to use it so I don't have any
problems I don't think I'll have any
problems finishing this up
but I definitely just need to use it
just the tiniest bit left so I will be
happy when that is gone this is the
pixie primer flawless and poreless one I
am I was there in my last update now I'm
down here this really only have maybe
like four uses left on it I just haven't
been using it because I've been going to
a lot of interviews or places i need my
makeup to last a long time and i find
that this makes me greasy faster so i
haven't been using this probably in the
last week and a half or so but i don't
think I'll have any problems finishing
this up so that one should be gone by
the end of May this is the pink body
splash and the pretty and pure sent I
was up here and now I'm like down here
there isn't a ton of progress I have
been making I have been trying really
hard to use this it's just a lot of
product like how much can you spray
yourself you know and I honestly the Sun
is just ok it's just a very I would say
like Childish it just reminds me being
young like if you're in eighth grade you
love this scent so that's been difficult
for me to use up but I have been trying
really hard and I'm just going to keep
going and see how far can get by the end
of May on that one another item is this
one here by to face this is the extreme
lip injections just a minute I have
taken a stopper out of this and there
isn't a ton of product left and so I am
hoping to finish this one by the end of
May this is something that i am going to
work really hard on to make sure i get
finished up same with this fresh sugar
rose a lip balm I honestly haven't made
that much progress again I'll do a
close-up so you guys can see but um I
haven't done that much progress on this
one but I think that I can finish this
one hub so I'm going to be focusing on
this one and getting this one done by
the end of May so that I can have
another finished product I have this
steel liner again I can't roll this up
you guys all know that because it won't
roll back down I'm still I've been using
this like everyday I do my makeup on my
bottom lash line so I really think that
this will be done by the end of May I
really hope so i mean i have been using
this really religiously so hopefully
this one will be gone by then I I think
will but again I cannot tell how much
products left in there so the last four
items I have our products that I think
I'm probably won't actually finish up by
the time three of them are lip products
and as I was expressing in my lip
product declutter it's just really hard
for me to use lip products up I really
only like to wear lip products when I'm
like specifically going for a look and
lately that has been like matte liquid
lipsticks and things and I'm not trying
to like uses up I'm just trying to use
them because i like them and they look
good and I just do not lip gloss person
really I have like a few that I like and
that's it so this is just a learning
lesson for me to not put flip products
in my project pans I don't know or give
myself like I need to give myself like a
whole year to use of anything but anyway
one of the lip products that I'm trying
to use up is the kat von d 1 this is in
the color celebutard it's just like a
nude and I really haven't used any since
the last update this is one of the
products I might be able to finish by me
so I might try to like focus on this one
and see what i can do to it and see if i
can get it finish it's because i really
want that extra item in my like makeup
I've used up type of thing and just get
it done so I think I might try to focus
on this one the other two this is the
korres lip gloss in the color like
purple I honestly just don't like it I
think I might just get rid of it I'm
just not going to use it like I know I'm
not going to use it and I don't want to
force myself to use this one I'd rather
again I mentioned this in my lip product
video used my buxom ones because those
are glasses I actually like and I'd
rather be using if I'm going to use a
gloss and like force myself to use it up
i draw the bees and what I like so i
think i'm just going to get rid of this
one and then this is my Revlon lip
butter in the color pink lemonade I
really haven't made that much more
progress on it so you can see I mean I'm
not going to give this one away i'm
going to finish it up but i just don't
think that will happen during this
project so that's it there really no
progress made I think I used it maybe
three times since the last update I've
tried but I'm just not very good at it
and then the last item here is the
benefit what's up highlighter I did make
some progress on it so there's the cap
but it's just a lot of product I mean
you don't go through that much
highlighter
and it doesn't matter what I do plus
I've had so much gold type of items in
my project pans like to finish by
placing good a mile that I can't just
like multi-purpose this item like I
would want to because then I would be
neglecting something else from another
project and then just getting behind in
that one so this one I think I mean I'm
just still going to try to use what a
can of it and get as much progress down
as I I possibly can by the end of May
but this is something I'll probably just
end unlike tacking on tonight prod
Tony's on by the end of the year type of
thing those are all my items guys I hope
you enjoyed this video let me know if
you guys have any project pan so I can
check them out or if you have any tips
for me let me know down in the comments
I would appreciate it and I will see you
in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
