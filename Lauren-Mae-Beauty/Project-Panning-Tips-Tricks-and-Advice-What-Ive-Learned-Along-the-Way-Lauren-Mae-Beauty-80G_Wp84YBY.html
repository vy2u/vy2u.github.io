learned thank you so much for watching
today I have quite a few talking videos
planned I'm just in the mood to talk
about things so today's video I want it
to be about project panning and these
are kind of my tips and tricks now
you've seen the make of addiction video
and I also did a project panning like
introduction just like what is project
panning but today's video is going to be
like tips and tricks and just like my
advice if you're actually panning and
like kind of what to look out for things
to avoid things that should help you be
successful in your project so if you
have started project panning because of
those videos I hope this will help you
navigate how you want a project pan
these are all things I've learned from
project panning myself so I definitely
think that like with practicing you kind
of learn what products work for you what
don't what you never use what you're
really good at using it so let's just
get into it and I have my paper as
always and let's start with number one
so first you got to start a challenge so
you have to pick something I suggest
doing something that has a time limit on
it for your first project pan that way
you have a for-sure ending date I always
found that when I did projects that were
just like I want to use up these ten
items if I wasn't super pumped the
entire time I was using those items the
project just kept dragging on and on and
on there was never an end date in sight
and it can kind of just be a little
discouraging when you're like four
months in and you still have so many
things and then you just have to kind of
give up on your project so if you give
yourself like three months or if you do
a seasonal project pan I find that you
have three months you know you have
three months and so you can kind of keep
yourself gauged and hopefully excited
the entire three months and see where
you get at the end of that project and
with this tip I want to link on that you
should try to use the community whether
it's here on YouTube or Instagram as a
source of encouragement and support for
you while you're in your project pan now
I'm not someone who personally is super
into commenting and things like that so
I still think that watching people do
seasonal challenges doing seasonal
challenges with other youtubers or
people on Instagram can keep you excited
can keep you motivated to see their
progress and hopefully you can have a
our amount of progress or more I
definitely think the community factor
helps keep people motivated because it
definitely can be tough there are some
tough things to use up and that is one
of the big learning curves I feel like
with project panning is that you learn
how long your makeup actually lasts and
that you have a lot of it so definitely
take advantage of that I know a lot of
people have Instagram accounts that are
just for project panning and showing
empties in progress so you could always
start one of those two which goes into
my next step I definitely think that
taking pictures of your progress or
marking your progress on paper is
definitely a great way to stay excited
about your progress if you're not doing
YouTube videos you don't have a video to
look back on and it can seem like oh my
gosh it's never-ending
but when you look at an item and you see
where you started and you see that you
had a full lipstick and now you're
halfway through even though it can feel
so daunting and like oh my gosh you
still have half you can see where you
started and where you've come and it's
definitely exciting and a boost of
motivation next I suggest starting off
with a smaller project so I personally
wouldn't start with something over ten
products at the beginning it's okay you
don't have to pan 20 things 50 things
just panning five six seven items is a
lot of items especially if you're still
bringing in some new makeup or you want
to be using some new makeup in your
collection you can feel like you're
making progress in some items but also
having the freedom to use of other items
in your collection and that can help
make your makeup application not feel so
monotonous and keep you excited about
putting on makeup every single day next
I suggest picking items that you can pan
every single day so these are items that
no matter what you can always wear a
brown eyeliner or it's a nude lipstick
or if you're gonna commit to something a
little bit brighter or darker or red
that you're gonna wear that item every
single day and that's where you're gonna
see the progress it feels great to see a
lot of progress especially at the
beginning or really fast and the only
way that you're gonna get that is if
you're using it consistently so
definitely make sure some of the items
in your project are things that you
really can make progress on every single
day and so you can be excited about
using those up and
doesn't get stale and stagnant I find
that when I'm only using an item once a
week it can just be just so discouraging
and then I just want to give up entirely
on that item another thing that helps
your products go by even faster is
multitasking your items so let's say
you're panning a champagne eyeshadow you
can also use that eyeshadow as a
highlighter on the face which is going
to use up a lot of products if you're
using like a matte Brown depending on
the shade you can maybe use it as a
contour or a bronzer you can also maybe
use it in your brows so finding ways to
use products other than what they're
initially intended for is definitely
gonna help you make some progress faster
some of the blushes that I have pan on I
hit pan on because I was using them as
eyeshadows as well so that is definitely
a way for you to make more progress
faster my next tip is to vary your items
now you can vary your items in a ton of
different ways so I have some examples
so I would suggest picking a mix of
deluxe sized samples and full sized
items you can also pick a mix of newer
items in your collection as well as
older items that you want to move out
and you can also even throw in some
items that maybe aren't straight up
makeup I know a lot of people do that
where they'll have some skincare items
in there they'll have some body stuff
whatever it's gonna take to keep things
fresh and for you to be moving through
items is definitely like worth it you
can also pick things that are almost
used up as opposed to stuff that is like
really full so that way you have some
give me items that are like you know
success markers along the way those
definitely helped me sometimes when I
feel like I'm using nothing up it's so
great to be like okay well I always got
this one guy Gahan also very the types
of makeup you put in don't do all lip
products I'm telling you you probably
won't be successful unless you're
someone who just uses lip products up
really easily or if that's like the
theme of your project pan maybe that
would work but I found through painting
that picking different makeup items and
varying what I'm using in my project pan
helps me to use things up because I can
use multiple things at the same time
back to the lipstick example if you do
all lipsticks you can only use one
lipstick a day unless you're reapplying
totally different colors whereas if you
have an eyeshadow and an eyeliner of
blush a foundation and a concealer you
can use all of those items every single
day and make progress on all of them at
the same time so I definitely suggest
varying your items have all been there
where we
like too many things we think it's gonna
be easier to hit pan on something or to
do I don't know use something else up
and it's not and then we're stuck with
feeling like our project wasn't
successful I have two more kind of like
advice things here but if something is
not working for you I definitely at the
beginning of my panning journey would
throw in items that I didn't wanted to
clutter that I didn't like though and it
was sucky its I hated using them it was
definitely a challenge in a chore and I
will say there's something about using
items that are really difficult that
feels so awesome it does like if you
actually finished it that it feels great
um
but there are also items that just you
hate they're the bane of your existence
they make you hate makeup and make you
hate getting ready in the morning and
for those items I tell you now just to
clutter them and let them go if you have
a huge collection it's not worth it and
you should be using up the items that
you absolutely love and getting the
money's worth out of those the money you
spend is already gone so just let that
item go and don't kill yourself over it
don't beat yourself up over it I feel
like getting an item out buy declutter
it because you know it doesn't work for
you is just as good as using it up then
last I want to throw out there that
progress is still progress you do not
have to completely use up a product for
it to be project panned you set the
rules and also any progress in an item
is better than none so even if you
didn't quite hit pan on something or you
only hit pan and didn't use it up it's
still a success it's still getting use
out of that item and you're learning to
love your collection and learning what
you like about your makeup and that's
what project panning to me is all about
it's about using the makeup that you
already haven't have already purchased
and figuring out if it actually works
for you you will find that so many items
you thought you loved to death you don't
and you will also find that maybe items
you didn't think work for you you can
make work you really start to get to
know your makeup self and what you
actually like so if you don't end up
using something all the way up or you
don't hit your original goal it's still
a success that you're using your makeup
and loving what you have in your
collection I hope you guys enjoyed these
tips and tricks and advice for project
panning
