i have a video that is another project
and it's 1 i've been considering doing
for a long time it is the project polish
not tag but that project that's been
going on I've been wanting to do it and
considering it for quite a while but the
reason I haven't is just because it was
so intimidating to me that you would be
trying to finish up a nail polish like
that seems so difficult because it's a
whole nail polish I've never finished up
a nail polish and I didn't want to like
do it and then fail like that would suck
but recently I've been um I used a nail
polish twice them and I never do that I
always my habits when it comes to nail
polish I usually will use a bottle and
then go to a different color and like
I'll never revisit that bottle for like
a whole year and a half because I have a
lot of nail polish if you want to know
exactly how much I will leave my makeup
inventory down below but it's way too
much so I recently did though use a nail
polish twice in a row and I saw so much
progress and I thought oh my gosh it's
not not that is not difficult because it
will be difficult but it's just not
impossible I mean it can happen I've
seen pretty pistol 86 cherish use up
like so much nail polish and I thought
you know what I can at least get rid of
some of my nail polish this way so I've
decided to take on this challenge on
this project and how I am doing it is
I'm going and focusing on one brand only
I have a ton of these julep polishes and
I got these I got started on these
because you got the box for like I said
and I got some that way that i bought
some because oprah's greatest or
favorite things like all 12 of them
we're on sale for super cheap and then
they had a bigger salen so i'm not i
bought a lot of their polishes and i
really haven't used any of them and
honestly i don't find them to be
anything spectacular I don't think
they're like horrible but they're not
amazing so I want to focus on all my
polishes this year I have 16 polishes
right now and I'm going to be picking
six at the beginning of this challenge
to be using up and then once I like
finish one up or so on i can add in
they're polish to replace that from the
16 that I have now another thing that is
exciting for me at least for these
polishes is that julep polishes their
bottle one is quite different than
others but in this bottle there's only
point 27 ounces of nail polish whereas
in like a regular OPI bottle there's
point five fluid ounces so these only
contain about half of the product at a
normal bottle would and I think that's
why I've seen so much progress so fast
and how I think I can potentially get
through quite a few of them this year
obviously be amazingly after all 16 but
let's just take it as weak as we go
don't get too excited so um i'm going to
show you guys the six polishes that have
been using up as well as the top coat
that i use with them not that I need to
like use that up because I'll just be
using it as I normally would and it'll
get you stuff that way we'll go into
this first on this first ones like a hot
pink but it is quite sure I just painted
this on my toenails this is the color of
Lauren it's probably why I bought it um
and so I have them marked all on this
side so I have a mark there I did use
this one to my toes last night i was
gonna film last night and it was just it
was just horrible yesterday just like a
bad day like one of those days it's just
like nothing's working out this is
horrible makes you question like your
life and all of that and and now I'm
back to normal so anyway that's I marked
all this stuff I like tried to film it
was so bad anyway anyway I am I haven't
marked there I did paint it on my toes
last night and it's a pretty color
nothing that special I hate that its
sheer because you have to use so much of
it but I guess that's good for trying to
use it up so that's where I'm starting
with this polish this is the polish that
inspired this whole thing and it's what
i'm wearing on my nails now this is in
the color Penelope and it is like a
cream pink but it turns out more peachy
on the actual nails um that is where i'm
at right now and that's only with two
uses that's me pay anyone else twice so
I really feel like I maybe only have
like six to eight more applications I do
have to put this on kind of heavy
because it
is shir and i'm also perfectionist so I
do about three potentially four coats
and that's just my style so that is
where not with that one I feel really
good to have at least progress on one of
them the rest I've really never used so
this is the color Susie I did mark this
one just because it looked like there
was some air in there but I think that's
just it being full and you could just
see the glass three through the glass I
don't think it because I've used it
again this is Susie it's like a mint a
baby mint not a baby pink a baby like a
pastel mint color really pretty i
thought for spring this one's kind of
interesting this is their rock candy
nail glaze and this is in the color
marie i think that this is supposed to
be really sheer and like jelly looking
on purpose but I've never opened it like
it still has the plastic on it and
everything so we'll see how it goes i
don't know what this one's gonna be like
but i have like three other ones of this
cuz I thought they'd be cool and they
were like two dollars p so i thought yay
and i've never used them for like a year
and a half now awesome this color is the
color char this is a dark blue color and
it kind of yeah it's just a dark blue it
looks a little purple like a hint of
purple in it I think this will be really
fun to wear it even though it is spring
and we're going into summer um I just
think it's nice i still like to wear
darker colors and it's still it's like a
color don't like dark brown or something
so i thought this would be a good one to
like switch up the colors that kind of
have going and like in my project and
then and those are all cream finishes
this is the only one that's not this is
the color maya mayaa and this is just a
really pretty pinky peach shimmer color
it's kind of a chalice thought this
would be really nice if I just wanted
something really sheer really simple but
um that had a little bit of shine
something different to it but yeah those
are going to be all my polishes guys for
the top coat I am going to be using my
session beat I have like two backups of
this because they were only we get them
up me and my mom get them at the beauty
supply and they're like four dollars or
something
so um yeah for Christmas she gave me
like you too and my stalking so um yeah
this is where I'm at I don't know if you
can see the pink line there but not that
it matters because i know i'll use this
up without like having to try to use it
up but i'll be using the sesh should be
top coat on that and those are my
polishes guys I'm really excited to do
this project and if you guys were
wanting to do it but we're intimidated
like I am because it is intimidating a
whole bottle of nail polish things in
st. ease up to me but if you just want
like just try using the same you know
plush for maybe two weeks straight and
see how much progress you can make it's
pretty crazy especially if it is a sheer
polish and you can kind of build that
color up and use more coats on it it's
crazy um but yeah I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope you're having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
