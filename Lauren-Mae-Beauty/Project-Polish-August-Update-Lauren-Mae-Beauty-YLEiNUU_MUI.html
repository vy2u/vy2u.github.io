thing this is going to be a project
polish now I know it's been a really
long time so I'm so sorry guys it just
was not inspired I'm really busy if you
guys are new to my channel or you don't
know I work full time like I work 40
hours a week so that means I get two
days off and those two days I go to
school for from 10 to five so I don't
even get a day off at all so it's like
monday work Tuesday school wednesday
work thursday school friday work
saturday works sunday work starts all
over I just didn't have time to paint my
nails I was kind of adjusting to my
schedule and I'm kind of more inspired
lately to continue using my stuff up so
i thought i'd update you on the progress
of where I'm at with these polishes and
let you know where I'm at while my goals
are how I'm doing all of that type of
stuff because I have been painting my
nails more recently oh I'm sure you guys
can maybe have seen in my videos to my
cold stuff up I'm not just bare nailed I
think a lot of this also came with when
Deborah Lippmann trained me I felt like
oh my gosh I need to paint my nails I
happen and so long and it kind of pushed
me a little bit more also to paint my
nails let's get into the progress so i
can show you guys right now with my
polishes now if you guys remember i
chose to do my julep polishes because
they are smaller than regular Pasha's
these only have point 27 ounces in them
and most polishes have double that i
thought i would try to move through a
lot of these in my collection and I
could move through them faster I would
be like more fulfilling to see more
bottles God even though that doesn't add
up to the same amount of product in
regular ones hopefully that makes sense
these two I haven't used it all still so
I still haven't even opened them I have
six polishes going right now i'll link
all my previous videos i think i'll have
to download the other four bottles i
have made progress on each of them so um
i was at this line now i am down one
more little notch that's only with one
use so i know that if i had used this
polish you know three times let's say
you would definitely see the progress go
down so I'm excited to again continue
working on these polishes I am getting a
little tired of the colors but you know
the more we're going to
I'll have to use them later so I just
want to kind of suck that part up and
just work through them same with this
one I'm at this new mark now instead of
the previous one and again this is one
use so about the same amount of polish
each time is being used up with one use
so it's kind of nice to see that being
systematic and like seeing the progress
systematically I can kind of calculate
how long it'll take me to use a polish
up again here's my mid one a little less
because this is a bit more opaque I
don't feel like I need as many coats
with this polish I do about two
sometimes three coats that's just me I
like a really opaque kind of like almost
looks bubbled like gel nail I know that
sounds weird but that's all you like it
to look on my nails and that's how I I
do my nails the last polish here this
definitely has a lot more progress on it
and that's because this is a jelly
formula so it's a sheer formula I need a
lot more polish to build this up on the
nails to even like kind of see that it
might be a tint of purple so I also just
trying to work through it so that's why
I'm also layering it a little bit more
instead of just being okay with it being
like really sheer I'm building up the
color to see it better but also work
through the Polish faster I also like
just throwing it out since this is so
sheer I've been pairing this with
another polish it's called on a silver
platter by FC and that's what i have on
top of it here i really like that
combination and that's it for like
polishes in my last videos i was marking
my seche vite top coach I stopped
marking it just because it doesn't
matter where I'm at and I've also kind
of stopped using this and I've been
using this deborah lippmann like tester
one that i got from work because it was
like over halfway empty or like a little
actually a little lesson halfway a
little more than halfway whatever i got
mr. mark and i've just been using that
because of the fact that it has like
treatment in it and my nails get kind of
disgusting why don't you paint them a
lot or just in general so i've been
using those back and forth but mostly
the deborah lippmann lately and then
another routine or step it added to my
routine more so is this deborah lippmann
base coat and this is their all about
that base base coat I really like the
way this helps my nails I kind of like
having that base coat that's treating my
nail while I'm wearing polish and I'm
not a base coat person I've never
we use done before but I've really been
enjoying this one and I got this in my
gratis you saw me holiday my gratis all
I've been just trying to use this and
see if it really works you know see if
it really is helping my nails stop from
spilling that's the issue i have my
nails will peel so hardcore anyway just
showing you guys what else I've been
using hopefully these videos will be
more frequently uploaded now that i've
been using polishes a lot more again i
hope you enjoy this video let me know if
you're doing these videos too or if
you're on this project polish with me
and I really would like to see your
progress and kind of keep myself
motivated in this one because this one's
a hard one I hope you guys enjoy I will
see in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
