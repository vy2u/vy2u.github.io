is going to be my project polish and
it's kind of like my first empty but
we're just gonna call it April project
polish April update because I'm gonna
try to do it like once a month or so but
I don't want to call the update number
four or five it's like let's just call
it by month I hope the Lighting's okay
I'm gonna be filming at weird time so
the lighting might be a little off so
forgive me until I can figure that out
my hair looks really icy in the
viewfinder so we'll see how that turns
out once i get it into editing but
anyway let's get into the polishes i
feel really good I was a little nervous
going into project polish this is a kind
of like project pan challenge help you
use up some of your nail polishes i
started this challenge late because I
was really intimidated by it because
I've never used up a whole nail polish
before but I was inspired while doing my
declutter video to use up some of my
nail polishes instead of just getting
rid of some of them so for me personally
I'm taking this challenge I'm going to
be trying to use up all my julep
polishes this is like a year-long
challenge I think like how many you can
use up in the air but again we'll just
see I have 16 polishes but in this
project I've picked out six and then as
I use them up I will replace those with
new polishes the reason I picked my
Chula posh is one I just want to use
them up this is what they look like in
the bottle I want to use them up but
they also only have point 27 fluid
ounces in them where normal nail
plushies have about point five ounces so
they are about half the size so I
figured these are going to be ones that
are going to help me feel like I'm doing
more work than maybe I actually am so
really there's 16 bottles it's only like
eight bottles of regular nail polish
hopefully that makes sense I want to go
through showcase the polishes um show
you the progress I mad and kind of my
game plan for this next month or so I
think that's it I think that's all I
have to say I'm gonna mark them as I
show you them so the first one I have
here this is one of their rock candy
glazes and this is in the color marine I
used this one probably two or three
times I did build it up quite a bit and
this started from the top
it is down quite farm in a market right
now so it started full it was wrapped
and now I am down to where that line is
I'll do close-ups of everything I've
used quite a bit of this product I'm
really happy that I've used so much of
this this is a very sure polish so I do
have to build it up a lot and it is one
that if I'm going to build it up that
much I have to be very patient because
every layer has to dry or it can easily
be messed up and then your whole thing's
ruined and it's a horrible time I'm
hoping to use this a couple more times
this month and hopefully I don't know if
I'm going to finish it up in the next
month or so but maybe only have like a
couple more uses out of it because I
used up enough this one that doesn't
even make sense it doesn't make sense
Lori this is another nail polish it
started where that line is and now we
are down to that link so some progress
is made this one is more opaque so you
only need probably two maybe three coats
this is in the color Lauren and it's a
nice hot pink color I painted this on my
toes I painted this on my nails twice I
think overall used it three times and it
made that much progress so this one's
going to take a little bit longer just
because you don't build it up a ton but
I really like this color I like the type
of color for spring and then also summer
so this is a fun one to wear on the
nails and I'm definitely going to be
using that one a couple more times in
this next month but i don't think i'll
finish that one either in the next month
this is the one that started all this is
Penelope my julep and this is what made
me want to use it so I started that far
down and that was me using it twice and
then I did use it I think either once or
twice this time and now I am down to
there so about half way on this polish
same as kind of the purple one we're in
the same area I also have this on my
nails now this is a nice color I go back
and forth with liking it sometimes i
really like it sometimes I think it's
hideous so uh huh I want to get through
this polish hopefully in this next one
just to be done with it i don't i just
don't want it anymore i think at least
right now i'm on the like it's not cute
train so but yeah I made some good
progress on that one I feel really good
about all the progress I've made on the
ones i've used it's crazy how much
progress you can make if you stick to
like four or five or six i have six nail
polishes you can
you know actually see you using the
product instead of you know using your
all your polishes once and it looks like
they're all brand-new it's crazy this
one is a mint color in the color Susie
that's the name of it and I am down here
i use this one I think twice this is a
really nice color gotten lots of
compliments on it but again this one is
more opaque so I don't need as much of
it I want to make some more progress on
this one I'm probably going to focus on
this one Penelope and Lauren just to see
what progress i can make in them and now
that I have a job I actually have to
change my nail polish like I can't not
have a good manicure at work so that'll
help me hopefully use some stuff up so
those four are the only ones that have
actually used the other two that I put
in here and i have not cracked open yet
so this one here is like a dark blue
color this is in the color char ch AR I
just haven't been inspired to wear it
and i've also been like wanting to see
progress so i've already started for and
I just wanted to use those ones and see
more progress than start a whole new one
so I don't think I'm even gonna bust
that one out and even in this next one
yeah I don't think I will and then this
one is the only like shimmer one that I
have the rest are all cream or like
jelly finish this is in the color Maya
and I really like this color I think
it's pretty I think it's a good one to
where you're not going to see it being
like a busted manager if you don't get
the chance to change it so potentially
I'm i crack this open only for like
practical use we'll see that's all my
progress on the actual nail polishes i
did also mark on my setia b which is the
top coat i'm using this is like one of
my favorite top coats ever it's
wonderful I started you can't even
really see the line I guess I'll market
with black instead of pink I started on
the line there again I'm gonna do
close-ups but um that's where I started
and now I've used I'm in a decent amount
I don't really care if I'm using this up
because it's like I'm going to naturally
use this up it's just going to be
naturally i just thought i would track
the progress and kind of see this you
can tell this just has more product and
it's just a bigger bottle because you
can't see it move down as fast as those
julep polishes that's my quick update
hopefully this video is quick at least
i'm gonna stop filming because
I don't like the lighting it just to me
looks really hideous um we'll see how
that is and i will see you guys in my
next video let me know if you're doing
this so i can check out your videos and
see your progress i will see you in my
next video guys by leave any requests
