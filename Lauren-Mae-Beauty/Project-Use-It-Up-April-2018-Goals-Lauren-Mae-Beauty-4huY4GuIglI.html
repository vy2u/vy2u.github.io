Lauren thank you so much for watching
please don't mind that I am a bit more
casual today I'm like in a sports bra
it's like super cash I'm going to be
updating you guys on my project use it
up
I have not updated in a while my last
video is for February goals and I think
the reason I've been avoiding this video
is because I don't think I did that well
like I did okay but I kept being like oh
well I'll just wait a little bit longer
and get more progress and it doesn't
really necessarily work that way so I'm
gonna show you guys where I was with the
items I was trying to use up from my
last video and then I'm gonna show you
guys what I'm gonna be working on this
is a monthly project pan that I do that
is focusing on things other than makeup
because I usually only put makeup in my
like other project pan so I'm focusing
on just different aspects of my beauty
collection other than makeup and just
giving myself a kick in the butt to try
to use these products up because some of
them are just a little bit more
difficult for me it's not that I don't
like them it's just that I just I don't
know it's not a part of my routine it's
not a part of what I normally do and
sometimes it's really hard to form new
habits if it's not something you
normally do because it's not your have
it mm-hmm anyway so let's just get into
it before I talk for a long time because
I'll talk all day I only had four
products in my last update I was only
trying to work on four which I'm like
thank God girl like you really did a
great job knowing yourself but I did
finish up the new do gel cleanser and I
am so excited about this because through
this project use it up I have formed a
new habit which is washing my face at
night with a real cleanser I know it
shouldn't be a big deal but it's like a
huge deal for me I'm very much like I
take off my makeup but it's usually with
a wipe or micellar water and I have been
going in with the cleanser this one
wasn't that great like I'm glad I
finished it up and it didn't go to waste
but I would never purchase this again I
did get this sent to me it's not like
it's bad but it just wasn't very good
and I'm using one now that I like so
much better but I kind of feel like the
cleanser world is opening up to me maybe
at one point I'll use a cleansing balm
like I know crazy because I don't like
greasy stuff but like who knows the
gates are open I don't know where I'm
gonna go now like I'm ready to fly when
it comes to cleansers anyway I use this
one up I'm really proud of that if you
can't tell and I'm really proud of my
new formed habit when it come
to my skincare I really do enjoy feeling
so fresh face it's like it's like
another level of clean that I was never
experiencing before and I'm just happy I
went there so that's the first item I
think this is the next best progress
this is my pink body spray in the warm
and cozy scent so last time we were here
and now we are down to the next line so
that's pretty good I'm pretty happy with
that progress although that is for two
months worth and usually I can get about
that much in a month if I'm really
trying so I don't think I'm gonna like
roll this over into next month I'm just
gonna yeah I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna
still use it but I kinda want to have a
break on this and then kind of like you
know punch it in for the last bit I'm so
close though I think I only have like
one other body's right after this
besides the sol de janeiro one that I
love so I feel great about that but I do
love the scent of this still and I want
to keep it that way
the next item that I have here is a face
mask this is from Lancome and it's the
energy de vie this is an illuminating
and purifying exfoliating mask I haven't
talked about how I didn't like this and
like it's kind of okay and that's how I
feel I feel like this is an okay product
I do think it exfoliates
because it is kind of like tingly and
itchy on my face but it's not a physical
exfoliant which is what I originally
thought my goal is to use this I think
like two times or four times just as
much as possible I think I did use this
like two times and it's fine it's a very
quick mask it's only like a three minute
thing I'm just so bad I'm so bad but I'm
trying to get better so hopefully I can
get in the habit with this project like
I got the face cleaning down like we can
do the mask we can do this so look at
this guy's oh yeah check it out in there
oh focus come on ah there we go look at
that this is the fanciest thing hello
you guys don't know how bad like how
much I bug to say I'm like I can't even
show my products like I can't even do
that it doesn't focus is the worst my
life is forever changed that's all I
have to say the last product I was
trying to use up is from Laura Mercier
and it's the tea mint citron body cream
it's just a mini I only use this like
once body lotion is the hardest it's the
hardest for me so that's what I have in
there yeah I do enjoy this the smell of
it's really nice it's
send it a skin really fast so I'm gonna
try to work on this I am carrying this
one over I think we can do it if we
really really put her back into it
anyway I want to try to use that up
because it is just older and I don't
want it to spoil I want to actually use
it moving on to the items that I'm going
to be throwing in that are new I'm gonna
be putting in this candle this is from
Yankee Candle and it's the coconut beach
scent I'm very close to being done I've
been burning this quite often it has a
decent scent throw which is surprising
because I have some experiences with the
Yankee candle that haven't been very
good but this one's not bad I wouldn't
repurchase it but I'm gonna finish it up
I have some new scent bird ones I bought
some because they were on a really good
deal and I really can't wait to use
those up but I know I want to go through
a couple of other candles so I need to
get through this one first work through
the other ones and then it can burn for
my reward the scent bird ones I'm
throwing in a new cleanser this one is
from pur Lisse and this is the one I've
been using since I finished up the new
do one I really love this it feels so
great on the skin they call it a
cleansing milk and it really does remove
makeup like I can go in even with like a
full face and makeup and I will do my
face twice but I mean without trying to
get anything off it does an amazing job
of getting my makeup off while still
feeling moisturized and not like super
stripped or anything so I've been really
enjoying this product and I just want to
see how much I can use it and basically
I'm just using this project as an
accountability tracker from me and
cleansing my face so I'm throwing this
one in there I have a few other skincare
type of products I have different masks
so this one is a sheet mask it's the
white rose 15-minute mask pack from
nature I don't know this is so old I've
had this for quite a while and I just
want to get it out of my collection use
it up not have them sitting around that
is a goal and it's just like a one-time
thing 15 minutes out of like the whole
next month like I can do that right I
can do that and with that I'm kind of
like counting this as one item these are
the South Maine gel eye packs we got
these in our boxycharm
last month and I have used one of them
up because I used it in that video a lot
of you guys told me that you're supposed
to use these like three times in a row
like consecutive days but obviously I
didn't do so I can't give you like the
best review whether that is really true
if they work really well when you use
them consecutively but I'm still gonna
use these up and yeah just because I
like messed up doesn't mean like it's
it's all for nothing for
me I use these type of masks to really
just deep puff and add moisture so I'm
gonna enjoy those I'm going on a plane
so I think that these will help for
after or before I don't know you know
how everyone says that I'm like who has
the time for that vomit right I'm gonna
try to be bougie
I have two more things that I'm going to
be working on this one I'm throwing in
here because it is on its last legs like
I probably have maybe five uses out of
this left and I just want it out of my
collection but I don't want it to go to
waste because it's it's almost there
this is from Bioderma and it's the pore
refiner skin with blemishes tightens the
pores and refines the skin texture it's
like a lotion so I like using this
before I put on makeup I don't really
feel like this controls my oils that
well but I'm gonna use it I'm gonna use
it up and laughs I wanted to throw a
perfume in here because I am down to
like I have some favorites and then I
just have some other ones that I've had
like this one and two other ones that I
just have had for a really long time and
I don't want to get rid of them but I
honestly don't ever use them so I
thought that I would see if I like this
scent this is the misty or sherry
low and I got this because at my beauty
store I was it was Halloween I remember
it was Halloween and a guy called and he
was like can you do makeup and I was
like it like I don't know if I can fit
you in and he was like please please so
I was like fine come in I'll do your
sugar skull makeup and he worked for
Dior so he brought me this perfume as
like thank you so much so yeah that's a
cute little story right anyway it smells
really nice it's very fresh and floral
it's definitely a scent that I enjoy so
I'm thinking for like the spring and
whatever I'm gonna try it out see if I
like it on my body I haven't used it
really at all because I was working on
other perfumes and obviously this is
like a full bottle so you really got to
work hard to see some progress in it but
I'm gonna see how far I can get with
this more than anything I really just
want to make a decision on if I like
this if it's something I want to
continue to use or if it's something
that just doesn't go with my chemistry
and I want to pass on so that is in
there as well alright guys so that is
everything thank you so much for
watching I will have an update for you
this is gonna be in April but I'll
probably have my update close to the end
of May right before I leave for Italy so
yeah that's everything thanks so much
for watching I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
