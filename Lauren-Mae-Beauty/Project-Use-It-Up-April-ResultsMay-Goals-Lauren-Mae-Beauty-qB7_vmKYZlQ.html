like starts well first because I'm sick
like there's like a trigger in my nose
that happens and then this eye starts to
water and it's horrible what's happening
all day yesterday it makes me look like
so pathetic and sad but I'm not
my body is forcing me to have like a
lone tear it's horrible let's see if we
can recover let's just forget about the
tear because I want to film hi guys
welcome back to my channel this is going
to be my project use it up April
results May goals I was kind of
disappointed with where I was last month
and I kind of like talked about that
frustration in my video and I'm happy to
report that I am a lot more motivated in
this project there's a lot more progress
this month in this project and there's
gonna be a lot of new things because I
actually lived some things out super
exciting
still a cheer so let's get into my
progress and then I will show you guys
I'm gonna show you the things I've
finished up first then like where I got
with other things and then my goals for
me let's do this
probably one of my like happiest
happiest things to finish up is my
ghillie Hix perfume so as you can see
this was in there quite a few times
there's a lot of lines and it looks like
there's stuff in there there's a little
bit of liquid it's impossible to get out
it would take me like pushing this thing
10 years and maybe it would come all the
way out but the bottom of this sprayer
doesn't quite reach the bottom of the
jar so it's just like impossible it's
not worth trying to spray it I mean this
morning I tried spraying it like so many
times just like get the rest of it gone
impossible so totally done with this and
I'm really happy I think this bottle the
more I look at it it looks so cute maybe
I just like going my makeup looks and
stuff but I really like this bottle and
I did enjoy this I'm glad it's gone I
won't repurchase it's kind of like
girly cologne kind of scent definitely
very like Abercrombie or like American
Eagle or something like that like kind
of like a preppy Colonna type of scent
so that's something that I want in like
my arsenal of perfumes but I'm glad that
I used it up and I didn't like hate it
the whole time I used it but it's gone
guys it's gone it's gone party let's go
to another awesome success I was able to
finish up the pink beach summer Krush
body spray that's all I had left it was
seriously nothing so I knew for sure I'd
finish this up so then I threw it
another body spray and boom baby it is
gone all of its gone it's kind of gross
at the bottom which I did not realize
that I liked I'd finish it up so we
really got to use this up I did start
really enjoying the scent of this it's
really strong but it's still coconutty
and I'm a sucker for coconut we know
this so I thought this would take longer
to use up so I was scared I wouldn't be
able to use all this up and I was able
to so super happy so now I have two more
completely out of my collection
hallelujah I do not like body splashes I
just don't like them but that's not it
guys
oh no it's not it so then because I
finished up the one of my project I was
like you know what I might as well keep
working right so I threw in another one
and I started up here and I've only done
hair I don't know it was like a beast
with body sprays and I'm not gonna lie
I'm not like I'm not gonna never like
oops let's pray it's not like they're
all gone no I sprayed the crap out of
these I'm like why can't I count as I
spray around my bathroom and that's how
they get gone and I'm totally okay with
that I'm like I'm pouring I suggest it
if you want to get rid of yours oh this
is gonna be in my like what I want to
finish up but we'll get to that in a
second I just I was so excited I had to
show you another thing I used up was the
Bath and Body Works wild Madagascar
vanilla vanilla bean body scrub I really
like the packaging of this in the sense
that it's in a tube to squeeze out it
just is easy for me I do get the
complaint though you can't get every
last bit out whereas like the tub you
can like scrape the whole tub because
your hand can sit in it the thing I
don't like about this packaging though
is as you can see it's like mr. flaky
and I just that's gross it's tacky I
hate it so that's something that's just
irritating like this is meant to be in
showers so it needs to be able to
withstand the environment of a shower
anyway I just finish this up I did enjoy
it I'm not sure if I would repurchase it
because the flakiness it was good though
I don't know it's gone I think this is
my last item that I used up this is the
cooling cucumber a face mask by Nestor
I'm not sure I got this at like a Korean
store supermarket or something I don't
like sheet masks we know I used this up
while we were watching the Bourne
Identity as we did like all the Bourne
Identity is this month because we had
them and we're working through our DVDs
I haven't done a DVD moving a long time
I'm sorry it's just it's been hard just
to get these videos out honestly so
anyway I used it during a movie that we
were watching and it was ok
I just are you just feel slimy I don't
feel like they're penetrating my skin I
just I'm just not that big of a fan of
sheep masks so yeah I feel like you look
like Jason like you look like you should
go kill someone not relaxing now let's
move on to the items I just made
progress in I was debating if I should
throw this in here but I thought I'd
just show you this is the LMS soothing
apricot toner I had it in the month
before this month and then I just
mentioned I might try it and that's
where I got I was not really focusing on
this as much obviously you can tell the
difference in progress on the two months
I do want to continue to work on this I
don't think I'm gonna put it in a
project and why I don't think I mean I'm
not so you won't see this in a project
again but I do want to focus on this
just like in my life this was the shower
gel I threw in this one is from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works it's the wild peach poppies
and I just kind of wanted to see how
long it would take me to use one of
these up and it's about a month
I don't shower every single day so I
know if I had showered a couple more
times I could definitely use this up I
do really enjoy bath and Bodyworks body
gels I have a ton of shower gels to work
through so I'm glad that it takes me
about a month but thinking about it that
way
I have like definitely way over a year's
worth of body gels in my in my like
collection so I just want to keep
working on this one I'm not throwing in
a new one but I just wanted to kind of
like see how long it took me to use one
up another item that I only made
progress on this is the bumble and
bumble thickening dry sponge finishing
spray I start
about here and I basically use up half
of the product it had left I don't
really like this product and I realizing
more and more I just don't like it it
doesn't smell good like there's just no
benefits to this product to me I just
feel like my hair gets tingly
so I'm gonna keep working on it
hopefully this next month I can get
through it but I just don't like this
and the last item I believe looking over
there my stuff the last item that I was
trying to make progress in as the
Moroccan oil Moroccan oil treatment and
I started here and honestly I'm like a
tick down
I used this basically every time I got
into the shower one two three pumps each
time and it just takes forever so this
is something I'm not gonna be throwing
in the project again but I definitely
need to make sure I'm using it's just
gonna take forever and I have this
another whole big bottle of this and I
have I have an argan oil chariot from
nuuma and I found a detangling spray I
thought I had one more and I did from
nuuma so I have a lot of products that
are similar so I really need to like
work on getting this one out so I can
kind of move on and start moving other
things out so now let's get on to the
items that I want to use up in May or
work on in May we already know I'm gonna
be working on the Gila Hicks blue camden
body spray but because I know I'm gonna
finish it I'm also throwing in another
ghillie Hickson this is Apple work it
and it's brand new but it doesn't like
fill up all the way to the line so I
just marked it where it started oshi I
forgot to show you this I did actually
have my goal in this but it's not all
the way finished this is the ginseng
refreshing eye cream to brighten into
puffs I did a really good job you
couldn't see pan before and now you can
there's barely anything left I really
have been enjoying using this I'm glad I
forced myself to use this on the project
so I'm just gonna work on finishing this
up this will not be a problem I'm not
gonna like put it in the project I don't
think though I'm just gonna you'll see
it in my empties or something back onto
the things that I am going to be working
on I am throwing this in here even
though I don't want to because I need
the motivation to just finish this up
and get it out of my collection so again
the bumble and bumble thickening dry
sponge finishing spray for perfumes and
throwing in two different things this is
the my NY DKNY perfume rollerball it's a
supermini and I you
up half of it or over half of it in my
March mini madness and I just want to
finish it off and since I know that's
gonna be kind of easy I decided to throw
in another rollerball I just am NOT
ready to get into like a full-size
perfume yet so I thought if I could
finish up a rollerball in a month that'd
be like it just would feel good to keep
things you know moving and rotating so
this is Daisy by Marc Jacobs but it's
the oh so fresh version I love Daisy as
a scent it's one of my favorites this is
again slightly different than the
original Daisy I still like this one
this one's a nice one for spring and
summer so it's perfect
I just wanna use it up I feel like
sometimes you keep your favorite perfume
because you don't want to use it but
it's like that's why you should use it
it's because you love it so much
so I'm use it I guess I'm going a little
bit light on this one this month because
I only have two more items I'm throwing
in these are both actually sk2 items I
got these from an influenster voxbox I
will leave my like friend referral link
for Influenster down below actually it's
in all my videos now I'm trying really
hard to like keep the description box
like updated as much as possible for you
guys so anyway you guys know about
Influenster they send you stuff for free
to test out and I got these probably a
month or so ago and I've used a little
bit of the essence but I do a like
normal skincare routine every night I
just haven't incorporated these yet so I
just want to finish them up anyway this
is the facial treatment mask and it's
another sheet mask but hopefully I'll
like really like it I know these are
really expensive products so I'm that's
part of the reason I want to use them is
to just like get the money's worth out
of them and like know if I like them and
I find that if I throw things in
projects and I use them consistently
it's a great way to figure out if I
actually like something so I want to
finish this up
that's just like a one-time thing but
this skin essence or facial treatment
essence you don't need much of it it's
just kind of a weird thing
hold on simple yeah sorry about that
anyway I'm sk2 facial treatment essence
I just want to use this up I want to
make sure I'm using it again it's
expensive and I just want to know if I
like it I don't know or if I can see any
results and like you know share my
thoughts on it that's why they gave it
to me in the first place not to hoard it
but to use it so I'd like to do that and
those are the items I'm going to focus
on not a ton of things but just enough
to kind of move those out I feel like I
can probably if I really you know focus
I can really finish all of those items
for next month
and start a whole new rotation so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I hope if
you're doing any projects I know Julia
is also like in the same boat we were
kind of talking and she mentioned it in
her video too so um I'll leave your link
down below if you haven't checked out
any her videos I hope that if you're in
a project and you're kind of feeling
just like down
I don't maybe verbalize it I feel like
me verbalizing it in my last video kind
of helped me get back on track I think
sometimes if I'm just in my head and
just like thinking all these things it
just is nice to kind of talk talk them
out so and also it's normal to just go
on waves people like I'm human
yeah like human to Yahoo and I know that
I go through a lot of products and I
feel like I do a really good job of
showing my progress and videos and all
the stuff but I'm also just normal like
I'm still a person I'm not a robot and
sometimes I just like get down on like
I'm not feeling the panning vibe as much
one week or something and so that's
normal to that's totally normal so just
like move past it or like do we gotta do
get past it and like get excited again
so anyway that's everything I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
