my channel this is going to be my
project use it up December results and
then my January goals this video is
getting up a little late so I apologize
but I did my best so yeah let's get into
what I used up I used up everything but
three items last month or for the month
of December which I thought was really
really awesome and for January I'm gonna
roll over those products and I have a
few more to add so let's get into the
details I did entirely use up the gold
canyon candle I think it was in citrus
and spruce or something and this is as
far as it burnt down I did have to de
Pape that there's a whole story about it
I'll leave that link down below if you
want to watch that video if you haven't
yet but that's as far as it burnt down
so I will be cleaning this out and
having this glass for future use I was
also able to use up the other candle I
threw in here this is tis the season
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this smell is
really nice
it's not my favorite scent so I don't
know if I'd repurchase it just because
of that cinnamon but I'm glad it burnt
down that's as far as it burnt so again
that's really common with bath and
Bodyworks Kindle so I'm not surprised
but I'm glad this one's done I went
through both of the little realistic
samples quite fast I do really like this
lotion for the face I don't think I'd
purchase it but I did really enjoy it
and I kind of missed it once I used it
up this is the Oscar blondie texture and
volume spray I also was really fond of
this as I used it more I think as I'm
learning to style my hair I do kind of
like stuff with a little more texture
even if it's a little bit naughty
because I really like that full
voluminous look at the front of my like
head so this definitely gives you that
it just smelt really nasty another hair
item that I used up this is the bumble
and bumble full potential booster spray
I thought this is okay it's not like a
man I didn't notice anything that
different so I'll probably just go
through the other samples because I just
want to get them out of my collection so
yeah I didn't nothing special though I
finished this perfume I'm so happy about
that this is the with love perfume by
Hilary Duff and there's nothing left I'm
so glad this is done I'm definitely not
one of my favorite perfumes but I worked
through it I worked my way out of that
one and it's done so I'm excited to have
one more perfume kind of out of my
collection right now
and work on more I was able to use up
both of the masks in this project so
this was the juicy pomegranate this
isn't a sheet mask and I just don't like
sheet masks I get really anxious putting
them on I like holding my breath and
it's not a like not a good thing so I
don't think I'll be buying really any
more sheet masks in the future I just
it's not relaxing to me and it just
reminds me of when I got my face life
casted and that was really scary and I
don't know I just I didn't realize that
that was a thing until I put this on and
realized wow that was not relaxing or
fun so I won't be doing that again this
is the facial enzyme pineapple mask this
is from Freeman I only used like enough
for one mask and there is a little bit
more in here but I'm not gonna use it
spend too long this was okay I didn't
notice anything special I didn't really
like the smell so I would definitely not
repurchase that mask either now on to
the three things that I didn't finish
this is the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works lotion in
autumn and I got down to this line here
if it's upside down like this so it's
kind of shaking up so I'm sorry about
that but I did my best with this product
lotions are really hard for me and I'm
happy with the progress I made so I'm
gonna roll this over and really hope I
can get it done in January it's kind of
hard to put lotion on when it's cold I
just feel like it makes me more cold at
night when I put it on before get into
bed and I don't really like that so I
found like that was one of the reasons
that I was like I don't want to be
freezing so I am gonna try to just get
this done in January this is the
philosophy bubble bath / shower gel or
whatever in almonds and cream I am down
to here again when the product is upside
down so definitely made amazing progress
I'm really happy that I don't have much
left that's the whole reason I put it in
here was just so I didn't have a holiday
scent way after the holidays and I
definitely will be able to finish this
up this month so I'm not worried about
that but I wish I began so close but
didn't finish it that was a scary noise
I don't know what that was and the last
thing I did finish with the bath bomb
from lush I didn't even use it at all so
hopefully I can use it this month now on
to the new items I want to add so I have
those three I want to finish entirely
the
and then these are new things that I
want to finish by the end of January I
have decided to throw two more candles
into the mix this one here is like half
use from Bath and Body Works a little
more than half used actually this is
Sunset Beach this is a very summery
scent but I just want to get it out
since it's half way done I'm the type of
person that burns a candle all the way
through and then gets a new one I don't
like to switch them off so I just want
to get this one done with and then I
decided to throw in a mini candle this
is the only mini like one whit candle
1/2 a bath and Bodyworks
this is in mahogany teak wood this
smells really nice it's a nice scent to
burn in the summer or winter honestly
and I thought since it was tiny they
together would be kind of like one
candle so but two candles out of my
collection I thought I would use up this
travel size from Bath and Body Works in
Japanese cherry blossom this is not one
of my favorite scents I don't really
like it and on top of that it's in the
old old packaging so I just want to get
this out and only have like newer things
in my collection so I thought since I'm
working halfway on that I could finish
this one up in the same month still I
have to perfume type of items since I
finished up the other perfume I want to
work on this Gilley Hicks Darlinghurst
perfume I kind of want to make it to
halfway or so I just really want to
focus in on this so I'm not setting like
a real goal goal but half would be nice
we'll see it is a bigger bottle than the
last one so we'll see how that goes I
also have a body mist in here this is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is French
lavender and honey I absolutely love
this scent I think it smells so good and
I'm gonna use this in the bathroom so
any time I'm in the bathroom I'm just
gonna spray it a couple times enjoy the
scent and see how far I can get on this
I'm thinking about half way as well but
maybe by a miraculous thing I can finish
all of it we'll see how that goes and
Anna last item that I want to finish up
this is a sugar scrub from Ulta this is
the coconut cream one and I've had this
for a long time and I want to just
continue to work on getting my sugar
scrubs out of my collection and only
have a couple on hand there's no reason
to have like seven that's crazy so this
will just help me make that number go
down okay guys that's everything thanks
so much for watching sorry this was kind
of rushed my battery is like flashing
rad and it's about to overheat and Sam
just got home we're gonna make dinner
now and there's a creep
you know he's happening over and over
again so there are a lot of issues I'm
gonna go I hope you're having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video
