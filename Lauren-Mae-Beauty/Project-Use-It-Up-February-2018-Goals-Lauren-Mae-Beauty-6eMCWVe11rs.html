Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to update you on my
project use it up this is a project pan
that I do monthly and this has to do
with other beauty products besides
makeup that I want to use up in my
collection I find that it's a bit easier
for me to go through makeup because it's
something I use everyday it's something
I'm really passionate about and although
I love my other beauty products
sometimes I feel like I can hoard them
up and then I have a lot of stuff and
I'm never going through it so this gives
me a little bit more accountability and
makes me actually want to push through
and use up some of these products so
with that let's just get into my
progress and the items I want to work on
for the next month or so I use that my
candle this is my favorite candle that I
have at the moment this is the x Fraser
Fir candle and I love it so so much this
is exactly what it sounds like a furch
Christmas tree or like a balsam I know
everyone's like balsam you say it's so
weird
that's just how I say it I'm sure it's
wrong I don't pronounce things right I'm
just not very good at it I have I talked
about that in a different video but I
don't know like pinned which it's not
pin tits pint but I always want to call
it a pinch because it looks like mint
and but it's a pint and anyway that's
just one of them it doesn't matter like
I don't know I just like the weight
balsams sounds anyway back to the candle
though I love this candle I used it up
and I enjoyed it so much I had this for
basically three years it's a super
expensive candle I mean like
ridiculously priced but honestly I would
potentially buy it again I think the
fresh balsamic candle from Bath and Body
Works is a nice like dupe or like a
similar scent if you want something
that's more affordable but honestly this
lasted me so long the scent throw was so
nice to me it was worth it I don't know
when I'll have the money to like
purchase this expensive of a candle
again I got this one originally on
discount it was like 30 percent off so
that's why I was able to do it but at
some point in the future I can't see
myself repurchasing this I'm glad I used
it up and enjoyed it before it went bad
it has great memories and it was a great
product I really enjoyed it
I have updates on two products that I
don't have with me so one of the items
that
in the project last month was a law of
Anila little baby deodorant a lot of you
guys in the comments we're saying get
rid of it since you don't like it like
why are you forcing yourself to use it
and yeah I should just get rid of that
if you guys saw my declutter video which
I'll leave link down below then you guys
know that I got rid of the other two
that I had that weren't open so yeah I
decided just to like it's not worth it
I'd rather just smell good and not have
to worry about using that up it's a
mistake I won't make again in purchasing
those so yeah and then the other product
that I had to throw away was from derma
e it was there two in one charcoal mask
I wanted to use that up and it probably
had about two more uses in it I went to
use it and it just was like separated
and weird the expiration date wasn't off
yet but I just didn't feel comfortable
using it so I just threw it away and
honestly I must have forgot it was in
this project and was just gonna use it
because I just threw it in the trash
instead of like putting it with my other
products so that is long gone and I
wasn't able to use it but it's not in my
collection anymore either
two more products to update you guys on
I have the new do gel cleanser with this
product I really wanted to focus on
actually cleaning my skin at night with
like water and soap imagine it I have to
admit that I can be a little bit lazy
when it comes to taking off my makeup at
night I always take it off but I don't
normally get in there with water and
like splash it all over myself and
splash it on the sink and get it on my
clothes like it feels like it's going to
be this big deal but I have done an
amazing job so I only have this much
left I will say this didn't have a ton
of product in it to begin with I would
say it maybe was up here but that's like
half the product gone I probably washed
my face half of the month like at night
probably half of the nights I actually
washed it in the sink I'm so proud I
know that may seem lame to some of you
but for me it's a step in the right
direction so I'm going to be throwing
this into next month and hopefully I can
finish it up I have quite a few
different cleansers most of them are
more travel size and then I have like
one full size one that I can use up
still so I'm excited to actually be
moving through these and taking care of
my skin that's something I'm really folk
lately for a mini review of this
cleanser though this has a nice like
refreshing kind of citrusy smell but I
find that there's nothing special about
this cleanser I don't think it does
anything bad but it definitely doesn't
do anything amazing so I kind of just
can't wait to move it out of my
collection in the last item to show you
guys is the pink warm and cozy body mist
from the last video I started here and
now I'm down to here my goal was to use
up like half the product that I had that
didn't happen but I did end up making
some good progress on it which I'm happy
about
I still enjoy the smell of this so much
I'm really happy about that because I
find that sometimes when I use a body
spray over and over and over I can just
start getting really like sick of the
scent but this one I still love it every
time I sprayed I'm like mmm it smells so
good I'm going to also keep this one in
the project and just continue to make
more progress on it but this is actually
something I wouldn't mind having in my
collection I really have been enjoying
it so moving on to the two items I'm
going to put into the project so I'll
only have four items total for the next
month going forward I want to put in a
body lotion this one is from Laura
Mercier and it's the tea mint citron I
have the matching perfume to this and I
love that scent and I just want to use
this without it going bad I've almost
finished up that perfume so I know this
needs to go this is a very small size so
I think I can use it up and yeah my goal
is to finish it by the next update and
then last I wanted to throw in this
Lancome energy de vie mask I did a mask
in a movie I think on this and I do give
this that great of a review or maybe it
was a collector skincare video I don't
remember I had tried this a couple times
and I didn't think it was anything
special and it's still not my favorite
mask but in place of the derma e one I
was like okay I guess I'll use this one
and I will say that although I don't
think this is very good when it comes to
physical exfoliating which I thought it
would be because there are like little
particles in it it does tend to kind of
burn my skin a little bit so I do think
it's doing something when it comes to
like a chemical exfoliation so I want to
use this consistently like twice a week
and see how my skin reacts to it I don't
I mean I
say that I have probably 1/4 of it gone
so I think I can I don't know make a
dent in it I don't think I can use it up
in a month plus I wouldn't really want
to this is a very expensive product I
did get it sent to me but it wouldn't be
worth it if you could use this up in a
month's time so that is something I want
to do I just want to continue to focus
on my skin and I think forcing myself to
do masks for whatever reason I just
think the mask is gonna take forever
and it doesn't it takes like 2 seconds
you put it on you can do a million other
things do the dishes put away this
whatever and then rub it off and that's
it it's not a big deal all right so
that's my project use it up update I
hope you guys enjoyed and that's
everything I will see you in my next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
