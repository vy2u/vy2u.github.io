Lauren thank you so much for watching I
thought I would start up my project use
it up series for this year this is a
project pan that I do monthly and I like
to include things other than makeup in
here so this is gonna be like haircare
skincare things that are just harder for
me to use up I find that it's just
easier for me to use that makeup than it
is some of the other beauty products in
my collection so this is the kick in the
pants that I need to use these items up
I'm just starting off with 5 items so
let's get into them and I'll show you
where I'm at and telling my goals into
next month when I update first off I
want to put a candle in here I was doing
really well with the candles last year
when I was putting them in here so I
want to continue that this is one of my
all-time favorite candles ever it smells
absolutely amazing it is the Fraser for
a candle from thymes I suggest this a
million times over this is an expensive
candle this was $50 I did get 30% off of
it but it's expensive it's lasted me I
think this is the third year I've had it
so I want to finish it up it's not gonna
be hard to use it up I just don't want
to have it and it to go bad it's one of
my favorites it's one of Sam's favorites
I highly suggest it it's absolutely
amazing and I can't wait to finish using
this up I guess I'll keep on with scent
this is from pink and I had this in my
last month's before I totally stopped
and went into this new year's project
but I want to just keep making progress
on it this is where I'm starting at and
I'm hoping to make it like about halfway
through the product that I have left I
like using this in deep bathroom I just
spray it every time I go to the bathroom
I also do like spraying it on myself
when I'm just like going to the movies
or it's already like halfway through the
day and I'm just kind of refreshing I
really like the scent of this as well
which has been so nice I feel like I've
tried in the past to use of sense that I
just don't like and it's so difficult so
I think I needed just a clutter sense
that it's just not working and just
enjoy the ones that I do actually like
imagine it but anyway I do want to make
some decent progress on this item next
is a weird one this is the healthy
deodorant from la vanilla and vanilla
coconut it's just a mini but I do not
like this deodorant that much so I want
to use it up I should have returned it I
didn't return it on what I was thinking
but I just want to use this product up
if you don't use this up in enough time
this starts to dry out and it's really
hard to use but I can't use this on days
when I'm doing like a ton of stuff
because it just doesn't hold up and if
I'm gonna be doing people's makeup and
my armpits like in their face you know I
want to have nice smelling armpits so
I'm gonna use this on days when I'm just
at home filming or editing or whatever
it is so I want to try to make good
progress on this i find that when i use
this consistently it does use up pretty
fast so hopefully they can get through
this i think i have two other ones too
so yeh the last two items i'm going to
be talking about are both skin care the
next one is a cleanser and this is the
gel cleanser from new do i've had this
for a while i haven't used it until
recently and I've decided that i want to
actually try to wash my face at night i
usually use like a makeup wipe or i'll
use like a micellar water and like
really rinse my skin but i usually don't
use like water in an actual soap at
night when i clean my face i just i'm
lazy guys then i kind of feel like i'm
able to get away with it I don't like
break out a ton so I just haven't but I
love the way my skin feels when I
actually take the time to do it so I'm
going to be trying to make some good
progress on this this is a very small
cleanser and if I'm using it every night
I think I can use up quite a bit of it I
think it could probably use up half of
it I've used it about three times so far
it's nice it's not my favorite but I'm
just happy to be taking better steps
when it comes to my skin and better care
of my skin so I'm excited to see how
well I can do on this and then going
along with that I do want to finish up
this mask this is from derma e and it's
the purifying tool and charcoal mask
I believe the packaging has changed on
this it's just an older product and this
is already a small tube so I feel like
if I use this twice I probably could get
it gone and I would also be taking care
of my skin more so I do want to use this
up entirely alright so those are the
items I want to work on between and now
and
probably the middle of February's when
i'll update you guys yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this I know it's just like
a short sweet little project pan video
but I hope it inspires you to use up
some of your products and I will see you
in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
