it's Lauren this is going to be my
project use it up January results and
February goals I'm gonna just start this
video out and be truthful I don't think
I did as well as I normally do in my
project use it ups this month I was
incredibly busy this month and I think
that had a lot to do with it
not that it's an excuse it's just a
reason why some of the things didn't get
any use but considering how busy I was I
also feel like I did a pretty good job
at the same time so let's get into what
I used up and I will then give you kind
of my goals going into February with
what I want to do I'm gonna get the
biggest fail out of the way at the
beginning of this video this is the bath
&amp;amp; Bodyworks pair and cashmere woods
autumn body lotion I didn't even use
this one time like not even once
you guys know lotion is a struggle and I
just didn't want to use it like I just
didn't and a lot of the times I was
coming home after working like 12 13
hour days I didn't want to put this on
and I am like No so I didn't I just
didn't do that so I'm not gonna add this
into my February goals I've just carried
it over too many times I don't think
I've ever carried something over three
times
we're like twice and so it's in three
projects so I'm just going to put this
on the backburner give myself a break
and then hopefully I can come back to
this a little later so I'm not going to
force myself to use this right now I'm
just gonna give myself a break this is
my Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle and this is
in this sunset beach scent I did burn
this quite a bit it's almost done I
think we started around here and now
it's down here so I am glad I burnt it
but I definitely could have done a
better job
I just didn't there were many times I
was home and I just didn't burn it and I
should have so I'm going to roll this
over definitely can finish this next
month no problem but I need to finish it
next month something that was completely
surprising this is my French lavender
and honey Bath &amp;amp; Body Works fragrance
mist this is in the travel size and I
did not know how I was going to do on
this I started basically at the top and
now I'm completely done with this
product and I use this in my bathroom
every time I went to the bathroom I
would spray this ten times which I know
that's like weird
and I'm just being truthful that's like
what I did and it it totally got used up
I thought that was a really good method
for me now I know some of you might
think that's wasting the product because
I'm spraying it like 10 times or
whatever but honestly I have so much
body splash that I am not using and if I
am using it even if it's 10 sprays at a
time to me that is a better use of this
product than its seriously wasting away
and sitting in my drawers so that is how
I'm going to continue to use these up
its just have them in my bathroom and
like any time I'm in there or anytime I
go to the bathroom I'm just gonna spray
it and get rid of them so yeah I know
yeah let's just that's how I use this up
and it totally worked and I'm gonna keep
doing it so this is completely gone I
mean completely gone in a month that's
amazing I cannot wait to like try to get
through as many body sprays as I
possibly can this year I also did use up
the philosophy almonds and cream body
gel shower gel this smells okay I think
the packaging is really hard to squeeze
I don't enjoy that it's also quite a bit
of product and it's nice chicken I
switch it out sometimes so I probably
will not purchase any more of the
philosophy bath gels just because I like
my bath and Bodyworks ones or drugstore
ones or just other ones better and I
don't think they're worth the extra
price so I used it up but I won't
repurchase this was the other shower gel
I had in there this is the Bath and Body
Works Japanese cherry blossom and it's
just a travel size I am almost done I
seriously have one more used to this so
I'm obviously gonna roll it over but
it's gonna be done I could completely
use up the Ulta sugar scrub in the
coconut scent I did not enjoy this
product it went really fast I really
only get if I do my whole body maybe
five applications with this the
consistency of this is just like weird
the sugar settles to the bottom and then
there's this top like slimy I don't know
it's weird Jessica and I'll leave her
link down below if you haven't checked
out her channel she commented on my
video and it was like it's not good and
use it up really fast and that's exactly
what happened it's not good and I'm you
stood up super fast so I would
definitely not purchase these I just
think there are better scrubs out there
for like the same price if not less so
yeah it's just weird consistency it felt
I just don't like the smell I don't like
the way it feels and then I don't know
you wouldn't think it'd be so unpleasant
but I really just did not like this so
yeah no no I hate this this was my
perfume from Gilly Hicks this is in the
scent darling Hurst and I started up
where that line is and as you can see I
am way farther I didn't quite use up
half of this product but I'm really
happy with the progress I made because I
didn't wear this everyday if I was going
to an event or something I would use a
perfume again that I really wanted to
represent myself and this is not
something that I don't hate it but it's
just if I'm meeting people for the first
time I just want to you know put the
best foot forward really put myself into
that introduction and this scent isn't
necessarily me so anyway I am really
happy with that progress I'm going to
continue it and see how long it'll take
me to use this guy up
I didn't even burn this candle this is
the mahogany teak wood from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works so no progress still not burnt it
does smell amazing though
but not done and the last item from that
project from January that I wanted to
use up was this bath bomb that still
hanging out it's not gone it's still
here I believe this is called the
cinders bath bomb so yeah I didn't take
a bath I don't have time for about I
know Mary Graham remark anyway so let's
get into my goals for February I kind of
did like a half and a half there some
more like amazing progress somewhere
like nothing like just completely
neglected so going into February I think
I'm gonna go a little lighter this month
I'm not going to put too much in here
just to kinda give myself a break I feel
like I go pretty dang hard all the time
and although I love that I just kind of
want to take a break on my project use
it up this month so it's not gonna be as
heavy with products as it normally is
but I just have so many things going on
and have project pans I've two of those
going on I'm trying to do my
to use it up on top of just having
regular empties that you guys haven't
seen before it's just a lot of products
I'm constantly using products and I just
want to not feel guilty if I don't use
something this month so obviously I want
to just finish this up and once I finish
this I'm probably just going to yeah
I'll just show it in my project use it
up for February I want to also finish
this candle and get it done I am
continuing to use this so I kind of want
to make like another third like you know
get it where it has like a third left so
I could finish this up in the next month
after that if that makes sense so I'd
like to continue using this I am also
going to try to use my mahogany teak
wood candle and actually burn this down
that's everything for products I'm
rolling over I want to use this up this
month I don't know if I'm going to be
able to use it but this is the pink
beach summer crush it's like an old
packaging it's an old body spray it's
one of my oldest ones I have
I broke the line up here I'm a little
bit further down from that because I
have used it a couple times but I mean
if I could use this all up I feel really
happy I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to use all of this up but if I could get
just like really good progress almost
all of it gone I feel like that would be
amazing progress on this item so I'd
like to just start cutting into this guy
two more things I want to finish up the
last of the Ulta body scrubs that I have
this is upside down but this is the
vanilla sugar scrub I have already
started using it I don't think this will
be a problem but it's just something I
want to get out because I do not enjoy
it and I don't want to hang it around
any longer than next month
and then next last this is the nature
bus a CC vitamins souffle mask I do
really enjoy this mask but I just don't
do masks very often so I'm using this
project as a way to use this I just want
to use it twice so once every two weeks
and just enjoy it give myself a pamper
night and I think in my head I build up
masks to be like oh my gosh the whole
production like I like to put a mask on
same with my nails I haven't painted my
nails and so long and it's not that big
of a production seriously it takes like
10 15 minutes but in my head it's like
this big thing so I just want to use
this twice and just continue to treat my
skin
treat myself and also use this up in the
process so that is everything from my
project use it up for January and then
my goals for February I hope you guys
enjoyed this video sorry it's a little I
don't know I feel like this one's a
little boring and I apologize but yeah
some rollover items some new items and
we'll see how February goes with using
these up I hope you guys enjoyed this
video
I will see you in the next one and I
hope you're having a wonderful day
thanks for all of your support and love
I'll see you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
