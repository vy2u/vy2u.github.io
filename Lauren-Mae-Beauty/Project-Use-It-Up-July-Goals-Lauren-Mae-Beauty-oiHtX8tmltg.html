learn thanks so much for watching I've
decided that I want to bring back the
project used adepts that I used to do on
my channel this is like a monthly series
where I talk about about like five
products that I really want to make some
progress in that I need a little bit of
an extra push to use up I like using a
makeup and that's what they use my
project pants for but I don't usually
throw in like skincare body care other
type of beauty products and this is a
way for me to kind of single out those
videos in case you don't want to see me
use those products outside it also keeps
me accountable which is really important
because some things are just a chore to
use and you really need to like have
some fire under your booty to use them
up so yeah I'm excited to do these again
we'll see how long they last these are
going to be my goals for July I have
five products here that I want to make
progress in hopefully use some of them
up if not we can roll them into maximum
so let's get into it the first item here
is a candle this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and it's the scent drench apple
flower this one is one of my favorite
scents it does smell so good it's very
fresh and floral but then it have that
Apple crispness to it if you guys don't
know Apple is one of my favorite times I
love apple coconut and cig those are
probably my favorite scents I love them
so much
so I really do like this this is
definitely more of like a there we go
this is definitely more of like a spring
candle but I do want to use this up I've
had this for a long time it used to be
white it's turning yellow still smells
great I haven't seen them bring it back
which makes me really sad but I need to
just like learn to enjoy the sense that
I love even if they're not bringing them
back you know I can't just let it go bad
in my collection so I want to get
through this candle I definitely think I
can get through this in a month next I
have a scrub I got this through obsolete
it came with three of them I have sense
too cluttered one of them so I have two
of these huge scrubs they're for your
hands to be in body and they're from
Orly
I do like them they work really nice
this one smells really good it's the
passion the passion scent I don't know
the other words are hard to say so I
won't I swear I sound so stupid every
time I try pronouncing yeah it's just a
very light scent it's nothing too
overpowering I'm actually going to use
this as a hand scrub and see how far I
can get through it I'm going to leave it
by my sink and just see how it goes so
hopefully I can make some good
I will be marking everything although
this is essentially new I've used it
like probably four times maybe so
there's a lot of product in here another
bath and Bodyworks item this is the
malibu heat spray and it's just a
fragrance mist
I don't like fragrance myths I want to
get maybe the Sol de Janeiro one because
it just seems like it smells good but I
need to work through what I have and I
figured this was a very summery sense
it's basically full there's a little bit
gone we'll see how much progress I can
get on this guy in a month this
definitely seems like one that will roll
over just because it's a lot of product
and probably not going to be using it as
like a body spray I'll probably be using
it as more of like a home fragrance mist
or bathroom missed or something like
that so we'll see how this guy goes and
when I was doing this project before if
you've been with me that long I felt
like the best way for me to get through
fragrance mist was putting them in this
project to just made me use them nice to
have a hand cream from Deborah Lippmann
this is deep rich girl hand cream it has
SPF 25 in it but I didn't use it at
night by my bed again if you guys don't
know I do not like body lotions I just
don't like feeling greasing you so I
find that at night I can handle it
because I'm just going to go to bed this
is a nice hand cream know if you're
looking for one I love it a happy SPF in
there and as you can tell I have making
good progress on this I just want to
continue that because I have a couple of
our lotions I want to get through so I
will be marking progress on that and I
do think that I can get through this in
the month of July and last is the
product by adult face beauty I do have a
beauty brand spotlight on this brand if
you want to check it out I'll leave it
in the description box this is a face
toner to help clarify I just want to get
through this at least make some progress
so I don't think again I will be able to
get through this in a month but I think
it can make some good progress if I'm
actually forcing myself to use it it
smells nice at first but then it kind of
gets a sulfur scent on it I did go back
and like read the directions and you're
supposed to wash it off so I do not
leave this on my skin anymore because it
just gets this disgusting smell as it
sits on my skin so we'll see if I can
get service maybe with more u''s I'll
like it it definitely does kind of sting
my face though I don't remember that
before but it definitely does so I'm
excited to hopefully make it through
this it's a really pretty
product I like having it on my like
vanity area in the bathroom but it's not
necessarily my favorite product for use
okay that's everything guys is just like
a quick little thing I'm hoping these
can be quick updates as we move forward
every month I'm excited to hopefully
move some other items out besides just
makeup this year and just kind of
refocus on that and just kind of move
out the old stuff that's really what
this is about for me I have some old
stuff and man time gets away from you
you realize you've had something for
like a year and a half that you feel
like you just bought thank you so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next video
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
