Lauren thank you so much for watching
we're going to do if you update today
I'm filming a couple videos Sam's moms
in town so I want to be able to film
these and be able to edit them
throughout the time she's here / after
and not have to worry about filming
anyway you guys don't even need to know
that but that's just how I am I just
like to tell everyone every little
detail so let's get into an update why
don't we I'm going to start off with my
project use it up update for July I
decided to restart the series on my
channel because I really wanted to work
through some products that weren't
makeup and actually just have some focus
on them I only choose about five or six
products that I want to work through
that way I can kind of you know give
myself a break on other things I don't
have too many things going on I don't
feel too pressured to you know just
constantly be using stuff I just maybe
don't want to use I want to show you
guys my results for July and show you
what product I'm going to be switching
them out for for August are you joking
Wow so weird August yes I'm going to
start off with the biggest success first
this is my Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle in
drenched apple flower
I used to absolutely love this candle
and although I do like it still it
definitely isn't something that I am
just obsessed with like I used to be so
I'm really happy I was able to use this
up it was a brand new candle at the
beginning of July
I started up here and obviously it is
all the way finished there is wax in the
bottom but I cannot burn any more of
that out and I'm not going to mess
around with a wax burner or anything
really happy to get this out of my
collection I have so many old candles
and that is the reason I'm going to be
replacing that item with another candle
this one is also from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
they have like my absolute favorite
candles except for the times Fraser Fir
candle that one is so good if you love
Christmas tree scents or pine scent that
one is the best but other than that I
really only like to buy Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works candles they just actually fill
your house with smell which is what is
most important to me the candle I'm
going to be working on in obvious is
pineapple palm grass and I mentioned
before that I'm not really into
pineapple scents but this one does have
a bit
a softer pineapple and maybe a little
bit of coconut in it so I think it won't
be too bad to go through I marked it
here so we have a full candle and
hopefully I can get through this one
it's still summer it's still tropical
it's still relevant so I'm trying to
burn through some of these really old
ones as fast as I can while I'm still
like pumped and motivated the next item
that I have here is my spray now this is
Malibu heat again from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
and I wanted to work through this as
much as possible I use my body sprays as
a bathroom spray because honestly I just
don't want to smell like this I feel
like these smell cheap and also leave
almost like this alcohol remnants on me
I don't really like it it usually gives
me a headache so I just find that they
work best as like health splash room /
bathroom sprays but as you can tell I
did not make a ton of progress I was a
little bit disappointed on that because
I really did feel like I tried to use it
as often as I could remember I really
kind of force myself to use this item
and that's not a lot of progress when
you compare it to how big this item is
um yeah so I'm actually going to be
switching this one out and I'm going to
be putting in another body spray this
one is from Victoria's Secret I'm
starting here this is sexy little things
new are since this is tiny I'm hoping
that I can get through the whole thing
because it might be about the same
amount of product that was in the first
top bit of this that's what I'm thinking
anyway I kind of just want a little
victory so I figured if I switch this
out and use it more maybe continue the
habit of spraying a body spray after I
get out of the bathroom or whatever I'm
hoping that when I return back to that
body spray I can make more progress than
I did this month
that's just my method and theory we'll
see if it works
next I have the orderly return new
Explorer eating scrub I was using this
strictly on my hands and it was actually
a really nice treat I never really
scrubbed my hands I don't only think
about it I like to describe my body I
like to scrub my face and I feel like I
just let my hands kind of
I don't know who cares about him but
this felt so refreshing to put on dry
hands and just kind of give myself a
minute to feel this on my hands I don't
know I just felt so relaxing so I
actually enjoyed this I started July up
here and I am all the way down here I
feel like that is quite a bit of
progress especially considering again it
was just on my hands I'm going to
continue and roll this product into next
month so hopefully I can use it up I
think that's kind of a bit of a stretch
I'm not trying to waste this product but
we'll see how far I can get
in August another item that I put in a
project is this doll face
clarifying balancing tonic and this is
basically a toner I started up here and
now I am down here so I feel like that's
pretty decent progress especially for a
toner you don't need a lot of it and I
actually was enjoying this a bit I feel
like it does kind of almost leave a
stinging sensation on my skin so I do
think it's working I just can't stand
the smell as it turns on my skin but I
do find since I now wash this product
off after I apply it that that really
does help with the growth kind of sulfur
scent and makes this way more enjoyable
to use I will also be rolling this
product into next month just because I
want to make more progress on this this
is definitely something that is not a
part of my regular routine I really
don't feel like I need this product so I
have to kind of force myself to use it
up and the last item for July was this
deborah lippmann rich girl hand cream no
it was very confident I was going to
finish this up and I did not exactly
this is where I started and I ended up
here so I definitely did use this but I
should have used it way more if I wanted
to actually get this item out I just
didn't want to put hand cream on like
sometimes when you're going to bed at
2:00 in the morning you don't want to
when I am cream on like that's just real
although this fell off my bedside table
and I just didn't pick it back up so it
wasn't even readily accessible for
probably a good week and a half because
I'm just lazy and didn't want to
find it so yeah I'm rolling it over as
well I really think I think you
we'll see if that actually happens but I
do want to get this gone the SP evidence
expires in August of 2017 so I really do
need to use this up next month we can do
it and I decided I do want to throw
another item in here because a lot of
those are rollovers and I feel like it's
kind of boring plus this is something
I've been wanting to kind of force
myself to use but I really haven't had
the motivation or the desire so I
figured this project was perfect
this is this cos erm smart neck cream
now I will talk more about this probably
in my top 5 favorites and like a little
bit into August just because I'm
starting a kind of weight loss journey
I'm very very excited
I feel very mentally prepared for it and
I'm just I'm just ready I'm at that
point and it's very exciting
so with that along with knowing that I
should moisturize my neck I think that
this cream will really come in handy and
I really do think I should use it plus I
just want to use it out there's like a
lot of things going into why I want to
use this product so this smells nice I
don't mind the product again it's just
me being lazy and not really wanting to
use it but I want to make this area nice
so I'm going to be using this neck cream
I cannot mark this product I don't know
how much I'd have so my goal is to use
it at least every other night but
hopefully every night that's my my
stretch goal is every night but if I use
it every other night I would be really
happy with that ok guys that's
everything thank you so so much for
watching I hope you're having a great
day and I will see you in my next video
