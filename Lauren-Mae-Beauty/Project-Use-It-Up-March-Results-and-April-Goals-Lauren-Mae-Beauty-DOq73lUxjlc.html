Lauren this is going to be my project
use it up for March results in April
goals I'm really late on this so I'm
sorry but I'm kind of like all the time
I might start making these updates kind
of mid month so like it's just too it's
too much at the beginning of the month
maybe I'll do that so um don't be
surprised if you start seeing these like
kind of mid month instead of at the
beginning of the month okay so let's get
into the five items i was working on it
was kind of a minimal amount of products
i was working on for the month of march
just because I kind of just felt
overwhelmed a little bit and I still
feel that way a little bit i'm gonna
throw some just brand new products in
here just absolutely new ones because I
just think I need that just push of
newness because some of these things I
feel like I've worked on for so long and
I just over it so I'm gonna give it
another month and then kind of
reevaluate what's going on I don't know
anyway let's get into the products first
item I want to update you on is the LMS
soothing apricot toner now I just wanted
to I was hoping to get I think to about
here I used this just normally I used it
to foil shadows I used it after i wash
my face after I got off the out of the
shower before I put moisturizer on so I
didn't like try to use this extra times
or wash my face extra to use this that
is just like normal use and I'm okay
with that my biggest thing was just
actually making myself use it at least
in the areas and the ways that I could
so I am happy with this progress at this
rate it'll probably take me like two
more months to use it so we'll see I
just really want to get to my code only
one that I just have waiting for me and
I don't want it to be a year before i
get there so i just want to continue
using this I don't know if that i'll
show you guys the progress of this next
month i don't i don't think i'm gonna
like throw it into the project fuse it
up but i do want to continue using it
this is my Tiki Beach candle from Bath
and Body Works as you can see it was
burned one time and that's it because I
was sick last month it I mean the days i
was home sick I couldn't smell it so
there was no reason to burnet I didn't
want to just waste this candle just to
get progress and not be able to enjoy it
that's the reason i picked this one
because i really wanted to enjoy it this
month so it's kind of disappointing that
I
couldn't but I am NOT going to be
throwing this into the next project
because I actually I haven't told you
guys yet but i'm i'm making candles so I
don't I want to burn those candles and
yeah so I'm gonna like sell them on Etsy
and stuff I'm really excited about it
and so I'm just not going to throw this
in I'm not saying I won't burn this at
all but I just don't want to have
pressure to burn this in a project the
next item is also from Bath and Body
Works this is the wild Madagascar
vanilla vanilla bean body scrub I really
do like this scrub this is a great in
between scrub almost it's not to course
it's not to like sparse and it also
doesn't leave like an oily residue but
it also moisturizes the skin still I do
really like it and it is one that kind
of dissolves as you use it so you you
know rub rub rub and then by the time
you kind of rub it all into your skin
it's just this like frothy kind of milky
consistency I don't know I've really
been enjoying it I'm about here on it um
although the top of it does is thinner
and it's going to get bigger here I
think I can finish it next month though
so i am going to just kind of carry it
over and try to finish up this was just
with like normal use and most the time
neglecting it which is normally use for
me so I do think if I you know try to
use this all I'll be able to get through
it in a month because my body just
putting it all over my body it takes up
quite a bit the fourth item I had in
here was a skilly Hicks darlinghurst
perfume I basically made once again
steady progress so from the beginning or
down here this is probably only a true
two weeks worth of use because again I
was sick and I wasn't spraying perfume
or anything plus there were just a
couple days they used a different one so
I'm going to try to use this next month
I don't know if I'm going to throw it in
the project I kind of want to i'm sure
you guys want to see the progress I
guess I think I can finish it this month
though if I just I just believe no if I
just try to use it so maybe I will I'll
just throw this in try to finish it up
this month and just I just spray the
crap out of myself with this I just want
it gone and the
last item I was so so close on this is
my pink beach summer crush body mist and
those are the product marks so I started
here for this month of March and I
almost finish it I was so so close if
I'd only sprayed it a couple more times
right so I definitely want to kind of
like roll this over so you guys can see
the progress for a next month so close
on this and I'm really happy with this
progress because this container last
year I had a different one but it's like
in the same container from pink took me
like all year to use so for this only
take like about two months to use really
happy now on to the things that I'm
going to be adding into this project
that are new that you haven't seen in
this project before again you already
know about the ones I'm rolling over cuz
i mentioned it i've decided that i do
want to throw in another body mist it's
working really well this is from cincy
and this is the layers skinny dipping
body spray this is only about half the
product of the pink one so I'm hoping I
can maybe get this gone although I will
say this is a heavier sent than the
other one I'm not sure if this is
discolored or not I don't remember it
being so dark I thought it was more
light but it doesn't smell off so I'm
just going to try to use this up I would
love to be able to use it up in one
month but again i don't think i'm going
to be able to spray it quite the same
way i sprayed the other one so this one
could almost be like a two-month ER just
because it's more potent this is my
moroccan oil and this is just the
regular treatment not the light
treatment i am about here on the bottle
and i just want to make a conscious
effort to make sure i'm using this every
time i get out of the shower i am back
to kind of not liking my hair and i
don't know if it's because i haven't cut
it in a while so it's a little bit
longer than normal or if it's because i
don't have my bumble and bumble full
like thickening film which is like my
favorite product ever i'm going to buy
it in the vib sale for if it's weighing
my hair down too much because i was
using spray leave in conditioners I just
want to force myself to use this up
because I already have a backup waiting
of this and this is an older bottle I've
had this definitely like a year and a
half at least so I just want to finish
it up it's almost there just kind of
make myself use it i use about two to
three pumps every single time i get out
shower this is the bumble and bumble dry
spun finishing spray I don't know how
much I like this I know a lot of people
really love this product but I just it's
not my favorite I like other products
better there's a product from unite that
is like a thick of I for a thickening
spray and I like that better than this
so I don't really like it too much I'm
about like here on it so I just want to
use it this month sprayed in my hair for
texture just spray it every day
basically and get it gone just so it's
not in my cabinet anymore I am starting
a brand new body wash i just finished
the one that I was working on in my
shower so I just want to throw this one
in this is the wild peach poppies I
cannot remember how long it took me to
use one of these up before it's been a
while since I've used it bath and body
works one and I tried to choose an older
one just to get it out even though I was
so tempted by newer ones that have this
one is a nice like spring scent I'm just
so excited to tease bath and body works
body wash again these just performed so
well and I am really excited to use this
two more things I want to use up this is
an eye cream from the brand origins and
it is the ginseng one i have used quite
a bit of this product i would say i'm
about half done and i would like to use
basically half of what's in here for the
next month I really like applying this
when i'm applying my makeup so I
definitely can be using it daily I just
sometimes in lazy or I forget so I just
want to push myself to just continue
using this my mom had one of these and
she didn't like it so she brought it
over when she came from my graduation so
now i have two of them and i just want
to get through this one so that i can
get to that one the shelf life on these
are kind of small it's only six months
and I've had it a little bit so I just
want to kind of work on these so they
don't go bad i'm ok with going past the
shelf life as long as they don't smell
weird or anything but i just want to be
working on them and know that i'm trying
to get them out last item this is a mask
and it is a sheet mask I don't really
like sheet masks because they just
terrify me know uh they don't terrify me
they just give me a little anxiety
they're not as like relaxing as I feel
like a mask really should be but this
one isn't cooling cucumber it's not so
scary that it's like I wouldn't use it
so I do want to use it up but I just
definitely definitely have 24
myself so I want to use at it those are
all the items that I used up or the
progress I made on them in March and the
new items I want to be focusing on for
the month of April I really do like this
project because it's things other than
makeup that I really want to focus on
and kind of need to be accountable to
you guys to actually be able to use but
I just don't want it to get boring for
you that's my biggest thing because I'm
kind of getting bored of like the same
freaking products in it and like not
actually being able to like finish
things off and kind of rotate things out
so hopefully this month will kind of get
me back on track with like bringing in
new products and actually finishing
things up so we shall see hopefully it
goes well I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day i'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
