channel first off I have a few things I
want to say thank you so much to
everyone who commented down on my like
eyeshadow pan that palette discussion I
had basically thank you so much I've
read all your comments and it's
definitely helped me I'll talk about it
more in my next video which I'll be
filming today as well but I just wanted
to say thank you to that there were like
50-something common so it's a lot of
comments to get back to so thank you so
much for any of your input I truly
appreciate it and then another thing I
wanted to say - I did get an Instagram
so I will link it down below its lawn my
beauty exactly how it's spelled here on
YouTube I'm new to Instagram so if you
guys have an Instagram leave me your
Instagram down below so I can follow you
because seriously I've like followed
like four people and it's like boring
like there's no post to look at I don't
know so I'm really fresh to Instagram I
really don't do social media like I only
do YouTube even my Facebook I don't I
just have it to like watch other people
I don't really post myself on it that
often so I'm excited to kind of delve
into that I really like the idea of it
being like a visual thing so it's all
pictures and kind of having a really
cool aesthetic and all of that so again
since I haven't been on Instagram I
don't really know how to do stuff so if
I don't write back to you or if I I
don't even know how so they're with me
but yeah there's cool people that I
should follow link them down below too
so I can follow them and if you guys
want to follow me of course you guys can
my name will be down below I think
that's it with the Instagram it's just
mostly gonna be like beauty related
mostly because my life is just beauty
related but like pictures from school
selfies of course product just different
things also just my life so it won't
just be beauty it's kind of like
everything rolled into one I'm gonna try
to post a picture a day that's my like
goal just because I think it'd be fun
and a way for me to kind of get used to
Instagram faster anyway that's it enough
about Instagram let's get into this
video this is my project use it up video
so this is my November recap and then my
December goals so let's get into the
products that I wanted to use up in
November and see how
did I did do really well so yeah it's
exciting let's get into those products
and then I will go into what I want to
use up for December if you guys haven't
watched these videos from me before I
started this project from watching other
people but to kind of use up products in
my collection that weren't makeup I do
only makeup in my project pan so this is
a way to get out other items in my
collection that I kind of needed that
extra push to use and filming it and
doing this kind of keeps me more
accountable and helps me use those
products up and not let them sit in my
collection anyway let's do this these
are the products first we'll start off
with the candle this was the autumn
candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is
one of my favorite scents ever so I
didn't mind burning this all month it
didn't take me quite a month I don't
work right now so I can burn this for
like hours and hours while I'm at home
and it's really been nice to enjoy the
centum candle so that is gone I thought
this candle burnt really well and as we
all know Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candles don't
burn all the way down so that's all the
way used up next to have the josie maran
argan oil light I finished this up I
didn't really like this I think I like
the original josie maran argan oil as
opposed to the light one which is
surprising to me because i have oily
skin but something about this it's just
too light it just feels more greasy I'd
rather have the thicker one that's more
oily than the thinner one that's the
same amount of oil that's just how I
think of it anyway so I would not
repurchase this but I do have a few
other samples I don't know if they're
light or regular but of josie maran oil
to get through I did finish up my lil of
rollerball from Marc Jacobs this is not
my favorite scent I only got this
because it came in like a three pack of
roller balls when I bought it I am glad
it's gone although I started only here
because they're just it's just not a
scent eyes like it was difficult to go
through but I'm really glad it's gone I
started this this year so it took me all
year off and on to get through it but
I'm really glad it's gone just because
it's not something I like and I'm glad
it doesn't have to sit there in my
collection anymore this one is a really
big accomplishment for me personally
this was the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works honey
sweetheart lotion this is just the
travel size but as we all know lotions
are so hard for me to go through and I'm
just glad to have this done this took me
about
tene applications and I used it on like
both my legs and then on my arms and a
little on my chest as well I thought it
was good that I didn't have to use it
every single day so I kind of you know
would use it three days in a row and
then not for a couple days or whatever
so it wasn't too hard to get through but
I loved the smell of this and personally
I didn't really mind bath and Bodyworks
lotion formula I think they probably
reformulated it since this like cap and
stuff since this bottle but I don't mind
it it was thinner which I know is it
moisturizing but it's also not greasy
which is kind of my issue with lotion so
I didn't mind this I think it dried
pretty fast on me and I after using it
multiple days in a row I got kind of
used to it so it wasn't as horrible as I
thought it was gonna be and it's gone so
yeah this is the Tony moly hand cream I
used this up me and Sam both kind of
used it but there isn't much product in
here anyway I really like the texture
and feel of this hand cream I also love
the smell i potentially repurchase this
it's just expensive this is ten dollars
and this would take me and say I'm like
a month maybe even less to get through
and that's like a hundred $120 of hand
cream that's crazy so I don't know if I
would repurchase it but I do really love
it it's a great gift or something to
like treat yourself I really like it
this is the Clinique Moisture Surge
little tiny sample this is the first
thing that we went through see him use
this a little bit but at the end it was
just me using it I don't find anything
that special with this so I wouldn't
repurchase this this is the fleur de
france face and body mist this is the
lavender scent this is the lavender
scent I did like this product it smelled
nice I like the smell of lavender but I
think something with it having that
lavender oil in it just burnt my eyes a
little if it happened to get in there
and also if I got it on my lips when I
was like spraying it it tasted really
really bitter so just like little things
I would still potentially get this for
free I got this for free originally I
don't know if I'd pay for it because I
think it is expensive but it was nice
they did enjoy using it once I figured
out those little things this was the
delicious brown sugar and vanilla body
scrub this is completely gone I cleaned
it out while I was in the shower too
with just that little bit
that was in there I might keep the
packaging for some reason just in case I
need to like do something with the tub I
don't know that's what I was thinking
anyway but I did like this I would
repurchase this I just have to use all
my other body scrubs out before I do
because this is very expensive but I did
really enjoy it this is the not your
mother's deja voodoo style extender I
did not think this did anything really
at all for my hair but I did just use it
up I just put it in my damp hair and
then sometimes when my hair was dry and
I wanted to kind of like tame my crazies
and I would use this too it was ok I
wouldn't probably go out and repurchase
it it was just ok
this was the lush bath bomb I don't know
the scent of what it was because I've
had it for so long but I did take one
back this month which I'm happy about it
also made me again
cleaning my tub which was nice this did
not studs as well as I think it should
have I think that's just because it was
older so I'm excited to only have two
more lush things left in my collection
just kind of work through them now but I
don't like lush I do love lush products
but I just haven't been taking bath this
as much as I used to and so they just
kind of sit around and go bad and
they're way too expensive to just like
have as I don't even know not even as
decor just in my cavern cavern that's a
cupboard and a cabinet I think but
anyway glad to get through them glad to
get through one I think there's only two
things left so this is the Hilary Duff
with love perfume I started at the first
line up there and my goal is just use
half of it I did successfully do that
and I think he's tiny bit more than half
this I will be rolling over like I'd
mentioned in my last video so I only
have half of the original amount from
the last month left yeah it's so awkward
to say I just want to finish this up for
them with the December so I have just a
little bit of product left not much
don't like this but I've been just
working through it just wanted out so
everything I hit my goal on the only
thing I didn't was this guy this is the
almond and cream body wash it's a bunch
of things from philosophy and I my goal
was to hit halfway and I didn't quite
hit halfway to hit here
I think that if I hadn't had another
shower gel in my bathroom when I started
this project and started with this one
first from the beginning of the month I
probably could have hit that goal but I
didn't so I have a lot left I want to
try to finish this up by the end of the
month I know it seems like a lot I don't
want to waste the product but I do maybe
want to have two baths and use this in
it and that type of stuff I just don't
want this hanging around after the
holidays too long and so it's just kind
of a push for me to try to get it done
by the end of December so this is
rolling over as well I wish I had just
gotten a little bit farther but that's
the way things are I didn't so but one
thing that's great that's the best I've
done so far since starting this project
so I'm happy about that so now for the
other items that I'm going to be trying
to use up in the month of December I
have those two that I will be but these
are ones that you haven't seen yet and
that I'm hoping to get done this month
I'm going a little ambitious I am going
to try to use up the pear and cashmere
woods autumn body butter body lotion
from Bath and Body Works I like this
scent a lot I think it smells really
nice and since it's a body lotion I'm
hoping I can get through it
since it's not like a body butter and
thicker I can use more of this I want to
try to use it every single night and
just see how far I can get but I mean
the goals should try to finish it so
we'll see this one will just make a
bigger dent in my collection than a
small one so I'm just gonna try to push
myself I want to try to use up to face
masks this month I haven't been doing
really that many great things with my
skin as in like extra things so I
thought this would be a good way to use
some of these up this is the Fremen
enzyme mask pineapple I thought this
would be nice since it's winter and like
kind of get the dead dull skin off my
face since it's colder out I don't know
that was my thought and the other one is
a sheet mask so this will be easier to
use this is the juicy pomegranate from
the brand nice chair I have no idea I
don't know what this is supposed to do
it just says collagen on it
and yeah I thought it might be
moisturizing and maybe smell beds so I I
want to get two of these done I have a
couple masks right now like sheet masks
and one-time use masks and I just don't
go through them very much so I want to
just pair that down a little bit this
looks gross oh sorry but this is a bath
bomb from lush again I only have two so
this after this one I'll only have one
but this is one with like pop rocks in
it and so I think cinnamon tea and stuff
so I'm excited to try this hopefully
it's not irritating is that a weird
thing that's a way yeah I'm excited to
use this up and kind of get through my
lush stuff and hopefully it'll be nice
this is a newer one so hopefully it'll
sets up and be awesome I have a few hair
things this is the Oscar blondie texture
and volume spray I don't like this it's
just a little mini but I'm gonna try to
use this on my second day hair even my
first day here to give me some texture
this just kind of tangles your hair and
hurts I like when you try to brush it
and put your fingers through it and
stuff so I'm gonna just try to get
through this I might even have Sam help
me get through this too because he's
been doing his hair more and this is a
product she could probably use so it's
just closer to a hair spray I feel like
then like a dry shampoo texturizer if
that makes sense so yeah I'm gonna try
to get through this this month it
doesn't even have a cap it's just ugly
looking I don't want to throw it away
but I don't want to use it so I guess
I'll just use it this is a small little
thing this is the bumble and bumble full
potential booster spray I think this is
supposed to help you keep your hair
longer it goes with their new line of
products that are for keeping hair or
hair loss so I just want to use this I
might have me and Sam again use this one
as well I have so many of these little
samples that I took from work because
when they got it in we were trying to
promote it and everything this smells
like a guy though that's the only thing
I don't like like it smells like a guy
product and I'm putting in my hair but
it does have like a water consistency I
put this in my hair after I get out of
the shower I've only used it once but I
put it in after I get out of the shower
and just kind of put it in the roots of
my hair and massage it in a little bit
so hopefully it'll help keep some of my
hair and I just want to use them up I
don't want them to go to waste two more
little sample guys these are the realest
I'll micro fluid it's a moisturizing
fluid this is a lighter weight
moisturizer so I'm go
using these in the morning before I do
my makeup and just try to get these out
these are just clutter in my collection
I do like this product but there's just
so many of them and I just want to get
them gone so that there aren't like a
bunch of these little tubes lying around
so this one I've already started I don't
think there's much left and this one's
brand new so I want to use these up this
December just to be done with them and
again I'd rather have like five
full-sized big products and like you
know ten minis all around because it
just looks better it doesn't feel like
so many products and the last two
products are candles this is a candle
it's in a bath and body works like
cleaned out thing but this is from Gold
Canyon I bought this on Black Friday
because my aunt sells gold caning
candles and she has like a whole like
little room where we went shopping me
and my mom this is called spruce and
citrus it smells super great I love
those types of cents that clean tree
scent I was so happy to get this it was
$10 so it's like yeah I'll take this
home so I took it home it was in my
purse and Sam dropped it and so the
whole thing cracked and there's glass
everywhere so we depotted it and put it
in this little since it has like shards
of glass in it and all that type of
stuff I kind of just want to get through
this I wasn't expecting to use this up
the same month I got it but I kind of
don't want to keep it around like it's
not safe so I just want to get it done
with use it and throw it away so that
way I still got my money's worth and
used it but it's not just hanging around
I don't know there's something about it
I almost wanted to like abandon it
because it was broken I know that's
weird but it just felt like a whole lost
cause but I'm saving it and trying to
get my money's worth so I want to use
this candle oh and then I also want to
use up this candle this is from Bath and
Body Works this is tis the season and
this is in their mason jar I bought like
four of these or six of these and I have
I just used a marshmallow fireside I
have this one and then I have fresh
balsam and then the other two have
already gone through so this is brand
new
I haven't burnt it at all I like fresh
balsamic this one as much I just want to
get through it I'd rather have ones left
that I like then have been burned those
up first and then have the ones I don't
like left over not that this is bad
smelling
does smell good it's just out of the
tomb it's very cinnamony but it still
has that fruity apple like at the end I
like this but it's perfect time of year
to burn it so I will be trying to burn
this up these don't take long since it's
just a one wick little mason jar and I
figure I can have these in separate
parts of the house potentially and burn
them we'll see how that goes
those are all the items that I've used
up that I want to use up I hope you guys
enjoyed this video again if you want to
see more about my life or things on
Instagram I guess follow me there and
again let me know who you are so I can
watch other people on there and it's not
boring alright that's everything bye
