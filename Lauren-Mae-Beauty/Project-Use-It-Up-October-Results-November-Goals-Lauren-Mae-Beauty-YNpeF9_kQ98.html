learn thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing an update
to my project use it up in most I
project pans I use up make up items but
this one I like to use up just other
beauty products things that I need kind
of a push to use up and get consistent
use out of so I'm gonna leave the
playlist linked down below if you want
to catch up on like past months that
I've been on but let's get into the
items that I had for October and how I
did and what I'm gonna be using up in
November one of the things I wanted to
use up in October were these scrubs so I
had this one from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this
is the French lavender and honey this is
used up for me I can't get the rest of
this out I don't even want to I didn't
really like this product I just wasn't
good guys it was just greasy and nasty
so glad it's gone I didn't like the
smell of it like just nothing about this
and I've used Bath and Body Works scrubs
before and I liked him so I think it was
just this specific kind it just wasn't
good for me so I'm glad it's gone and
I'm ready to move on to something else
and the other scrip I wanted to use up
was not in this packaging originally it
was the body blood scrub and I decided
to put it in this container because it
was in a bag it was just like weird to
use I have not used this yet in the
month of October at all but I want to
roll this over into next month so my
goal is just to finish this up in
November it's just a coffee bean scrub
it smells really nice this is just way
easier to get into than it was in the
original bag it came in so that's why I
transferred it like spinning all over
the place another success I had to be
Candle sweater weather in here I believe
it was already like partially used by
the time I put this in so I finished
this candle up I really did like this
whatever purchased this again probably
not I think I like other scents better
but it was nice I didn't like disliked
it I just I think there are just other
since I like more and you can only burn
so many in a season so I'm glad I got
through it and then the other candle
that I had a goal on for October was
this one this is the caramel pumpkin
swirl and I wanted to use up half of it
and I basically did that this line is a
little bit deceiving I was a little bit
higher than this this was after I was
burning it for a while but
this is just intense when the lid is off
of this you can smell it in my whole
apartment so I can't burn it for long
periods of time but I do want to roll
this over I want to try to maybe use
this up this month this is just not a
scent that I would probably pick up
again maybe like I'd have one that like
lasted me three years or something but
these like food scents aren't
necessarily my favorite so yeah I just
want to kind of get this one gone this
one I've had for a really long time I
think it's going on at least three years
now we're getting into like some repeat
products that are just annoying the crap
out of me this is this Qader me neck
cream I am using this guys I will say I
was a little bit lazy this month in
October I have talked about it a million
times but I was just really busy with
work and I find that when it comes to
projects and like burning candles and
just different things that are kind of
like extra I definitely don't do that
when I'm really really busy I just like
put them off and do other things I'm
just I'm too busy to do that or too
frazzled even so um I did not use this
as much as I should've but I am gonna
roll it over I just want us to like get
there with this guy's like I want us to
see this have nothing left in it so
we'll see if I can get it gone in
November in a way I guess it's good if
it lasts a long time for your money but
when you're trying to use it up it's
kind of like can you just leave now like
can you leave next is something that I
am considering done I have like one use
left I'll use it tonight and then it'll
be done this is the doll face toner I
didn't love this but I'm glad it's gone
I'm glad I used it up this took a long
time toners can last you for forever
this took about like five months to use
it's a long time so I'm glad you get
your money's worth out of it and I'm
glad it's gone I didn't love this one
though another item that I'm going to be
rolling over into November is the
coconut water hydrating face mist I'm
pretty close so that's where I started I
used about half of what I had left I
don't think I'll have a problem
finishing this up in November I just
need to use it more
was like the biggest issue and the last
thing that I was trying to use up in
October was this viva la juicy Lafleur
perfume and I think it had a pretty good
job guys I'm considering this one done
as well I have just a few more sprays on
it so I'll finish it up and it'll go in
my ear empties I'm really happy to get
this gone I think this is a nice scent
it's nice I do like it it's just a
little sweet for me a little basic for
like every single day I wouldn't mind
having this in my collection especially
in like a small size but I do like more
intricate sense now so yeah it's not
like my number one like favorite so you
guys already know what I'm rolling into
November but let me talk about the items
that I'm going to be adding in that are
like fresh and new that you haven't seen
the first one here is a candle from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works this is leaves and I know I
have the other one in here but I thought
that I would throw this one in too and
try to use it up I've had this for
forever this was manufactured in July
10th of 2012 so it's an old old candle
it's five years old it's time to get
gone because it smells really good still
there's like nothing wrong with it but
it's definitely time for it to go leaves
is not my favorite scent I know some
people would really love this scent it's
definitely not my favorite I don't like
something too spicy this has a lot of
cinnamon in it but I think it'll
definitely get me into the mood of like
Thanksgiving and November getting into
Christmas and everything so yeah I'm
gonna try to use it up I am
reintroducing a body spray this one is
from pink and it is the warm and cozy
scent I just thought this would be a
nice one I feel like recently I've been
trying to like use up since I don't like
and that's an issue because like I don't
like them and so when you're trying to
use them up over and over it's kind of
difficult but I think this one might be
easier to use up one since it's getting
a little colder out and it is called
warm and cozy as well as the fact that
it does smell really nice so I'm going
to see how much I can get gone of this
and then last is probably the hardest
one for me these are a bunch of
different masks that I'm throwing in so
this one's like a one-time-use little
thing it's a bio peel gauze peeling
lemon from neo gen I want to use that I
so want to use this facial exfoliating
scrub and pink grapefruit from Freeman
this is a mask I got from pathology and
it is the illuminate flash mask facial
sheet so I want to use that up and I
also want to use this snail jelly mass
from skitter yeah I don't really like
sheet masks if you guys don't know I
just feel kind of claustrophobic in them
but I want to give these ones ago I
don't have many in my collection I want
to use them up it's one of my goals for
my like year-long project which I need
to do an update on so I thought I would
you know try to make some progress since
we're almost at the end of the year and
that is everything guys thank you so so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this update I know I've had like a lot
of project panning stuff at the
beginning of this a month so I hope
you've enjoyed that and that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
