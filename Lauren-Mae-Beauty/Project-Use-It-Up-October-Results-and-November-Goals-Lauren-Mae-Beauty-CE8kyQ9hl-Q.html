are on to more project panning things
this is my project you stood up I'm
gonna show you guys how I did for
October what my goals are for November
and let's just get into it I will say in
my project use it up I don't put any
makeup it's all like bath stuff body
stuff skincare things that I really need
to kind of push myself to use or else I
probably wouldn't use them up or it's
lack on them so this is my way of like
making myself accountable to use some
things up and move things on my
collection that I wouldn't be using up
otherwise that aren't makeup I think I
did really well for October considering
I was like out of the country for 10
days so yeah I used up most of the items
there were I believe 3 items that I
didn't finish up for the candle I
finished up the coconut leaves from Bath
and Body Works candle so I started here
for the month of October and then this
is as far as they go
I know that you can like put this in a
wax melt or something but I'm not gonna
do that I'm just not going to but it is
finished it doesn't burn anymore I did
enjoy that candle I love coconut scents
but I'm happy to be moving on to my fall
scents I finished it I finished my
freaking at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works or
Victoria's Secret pink body splash and
pretty and pure it's gone it's so gone I
did end up using this as a room spray us
I wanted had suggest it in the comments
only a couple times but I just had to
get it gone like it needed to leave my
sight so I'm so glad this year I think I
started up here or something at one
point and I made it all the way down all
the way down to nothing so this is gone
I so so so so happy about that next year
I really want to focus on a lot of my
body splashes so yeah it'll be a
struggle for sure I also finished up
this one from Victoria's Secret this was
the pink warm and cozy body lotion
totally gone super light all I had left
was like two body uses from the roll
over from the month before so I did get
those two uses out of it I think I
actually was able to get three uses like
body applications out of what was left
in here so glad that's gone I took a
little longer than I wanted
but it's gone now which is a wonderful
lotions a really hard one for me to get
through I did finish one of the little
perfumes up this was like halfway like
even more than halfway done so it didn't
take long it was just more of like
remembering thing for me so glad that's
gone and I this was sitting around my
collection for a really long time like
it was just hanging out like without a
cap for like years I moved to California
with that like who does that three more
things that I finished up I did end up
finishing up the shower oil from
L'Occitane this is the almond one I was
using this incorrectly I thought of this
as like it was kind of like a shower
moisturizer not like an actual shower
gel but it's like it oil but a shower
gel which someone had told me in the
comments I didn't like this I didn't
like it I didn't like it in the last
application I put it on and it felt so
good so I don't know what's up with that
I don't think I'm gonna go out and like
repurchase it but if I bought another
sample I'd be interested to see how I
felt about it I just thought that was
weird like seriously every single time I
didn't like it or I just thought nothing
of it and then the last little bit I put
on I was like oh that felt so nice and
I'm like wait a minute what's going on
so so weird but um if I got another
little size of it I would definitely try
it out but I'm not gonna purchase it
these two were kind of the matching set
this was the body shops coconut shower
cream this guy was so hard to squeeze
like you had to be like strong man to
like seriously get this out the bottle
is just so hard and I don't know if it's
like that in the large size or just the
travel size but impossible so I would
not be repurchasing any of the mini
sizes in this ever again just because of
that and how hard it was to get out this
smell is nice it's not your traditional
coconut like not super sweet and super
like fake smelling it's nice but it's
definitely different um anyway it's also
personally I didn't like the formulation
of this so yeah in always I would not
repurchase this um it just doesn't start
and I keep from I keep realizing that as
I use other things I've used bath and
Bodyworks one so long when I just think
all of them perform that way that
they're just
really sudsy and velvety and luxurious
feeling and so when I go and use another
one I'm like what is this crap and this
one just did not suds like no matter how
much you put on my loofah the suds was
not there and I just didn't feel like
like I just loved that I've told you
guys before I wanted to be like a suds
party in my bathroom like I'm like
watching myself and their suds flying
here and suds flying there like that's
what I like I like it like that and so
this just doesn't do it for me oh so
much on that little tiny travel-size and
then this was a shower scrubber in the
same scent the coconut one I did enjoy
this it was kind of a creamy scrub with
like particles in it and what I liked
about this is that the particles were
not like sugar or salt so they didn't
dissolve so you could scrub and scrub
and scrub away like if you wanted to
scrub for 20 minutes you could do that
and it wouldn't like dissolve on you
which is is nice you know depending on
what you want and also was moisturizing
without being like leaving a film or
like any crease on you which I thought
was interesting as well and nice so if
you had dry skin and you didn't want
like an oily film left on your skin I
think this would be a good one so yeah I
finished those two up now for the things
that I didn't finish this is the not
your mother's day job new style extender
I used this maybe two times I just
didn't use it I wish I had but I didn't
so I'm rolling this over and it'll be in
the next project so this is one of the
things I want to ease up for November
this is the with love by Hilary Duff I
did use this a couple times I don't know
if you're gonna be able to tell by the
mark this just doesn't smell good to me
anymore on me as it's wearing all day it
just annoys me it annoys me that I still
smelling it so I'm still gonna work
through it I know that sounds psycho and
I think it's psycho too but I really
just want to use it it's not that much
product so I just want it gone but it's
I'm hoping it'll grow on me in a good
way and I just won't hate it forever but
my goal is to at least use half of it
this month
than half of it in December so basically
I want to finish them at the end of the
year so for this project if I could make
a halfway dent point in it I would feel
good so that way I don't have to wear it
every single day but I don't I'm still
making progress yeah
disappointing you know it's little thank
goodness it's half an ounce in the last
product that I didn't use up but then
I'm also rolling over I'm basically
gonna always roll over this stuff I
don't finish because I mean at one point
I wanted to finish it so I still want to
finish it this is the honey sweetheart
body lotion it's a travel size I didn't
even crack this thing open I didn't use
it at all I brought it to Peru with me
but I did not use it and I'm glad
because um there were no mosquitoes
anywhere at all except for Machu Picchu
and I put on so much mosquito repellent
I was so I tried to be vigilant I tried
to like you know totally gear up for it
and they totally demolished my legs like
there was only a sliver of my like leg
from my ankle to like my like up my leg
showing like this much that's it on each
side demolished totally demolished I
don't know I must be I must taste very
sweet or something because they totally
got me so I can't imagine like
especially after that I was like there's
no way in hell I'm gonna be wearing this
on my body and only attracting more bugs
like they already love me I don't need
to be like an invitation mat come on in
guys so I didn't use this at all and now
I'm I I just didn't it enough of the
stories I didn't use it so I'm hoping to
use that up this next month so yeah oh I
just coughed in my eyes are watering
let's get this finished so I can stop
talking for a little bit for the new
items that I want to use up for November
this is one of them this is from
philosophy this is the almonds and cream
shower gel it's like a shower gel
shampoo bath gel I want to finish this
half way or like right half way I want
to finish it by the end of the year
because it is a holiday scent I got the
scent Marshalls for seven dollars which
I thought was really good it smells
really nice and festive and I just don't
want hanging around longer than when
it's appropriate because I just don't
want it to so I I'm
gonna finish up the little bit of shower
gel I have left in my shower for what
I'm using and then I think I can get
this halfway though I'm gonna take a
couple baths because I did quit my job
so anyway it's kind of a long story if
you really want me to go like just talk
to you guys or I might do like it get
ready with me
chitchat video since I'll have more time
to film now just talking about that then
I will but anyway I'll be able to take
bath so ultimately what I was saying and
so I can use some of it up that way as
well the baths were also the inspiration
for this guy this is a bath bomb from
lush I don't know the scent it's kind of
like a clean scent it just smells so
good so I can't wait to use this this is
also going to motivate me to clean my
actual shower so I'm just so excited to
be normal it's gonna be great I can't
wait ah so anyway I want to use this up
in my bath in my clean bath cuz I
cleaned it another shower product I want
to use up this is from malicious this is
the brown sugar vanilla body scrub ooh
kind of looks a little scary in there um
looks a little scary so definitely want
to use that up but um this is just been
hanging around my shower and it's not
that I don't like it I put this in a
favorites video and I do really love
this product I just I haven't reached
for it in a while I've just been lazy in
the shower like just trying to like get
stuff done and not take time on myself
so I want to take that extra time on
myself and really use this up I spend a
lot of money on it and I should be using
it if I bought it so I have a million
other shower scrubs body scrubs to get
through you guys know that so definitely
need to work on this one I decided since
I finished up that last handle to put
this one in I am currently burning a
fall candle it's from like last year's
collection it was like a three layered
one and I bought it just for the novelty
of it but I'm almost I'm at that like it
has like this much left I've been doing
a great job burning it and since I'll be
able to be home more I definitely think
that I'll be able to get through a whole
candle like no problem plus autumn is my
absolute favorite bath and Bodyworks
like fall scent maybe even my favorite
scent ever oh it smells so so good I
just love this candle
so it definitely will just be fun and
like a good time burning this it's gonna
smell so just great and remind me of
like the holidays and then I'm just
gonna be in such a happy mood I'm just
so excited I'm so excited if you can't
tell it's just it's crazy how some
things will just like suck stuff like
you suck the energy and the life out of
you even and sometimes you gotta say no
to that
you gotta say uh-uh-uh stop that just a
few more things I haven't talked to you
guys in a long time so that's why I'm
like really chatty I'm sorry let's just
run through them I will mark all these
afterwards but this is a josie maran
argan oil in the light I was using this
really frequently and again I just got
lazy and I haven't been adding it to my
moisturizer or using it on its own so I
just want to make sure it gets out of
there and doesn't like stay half-used
for like ever so I want to use it up
this month this is another item I think
that was in a project or I'm just really
close to using so I just want to get it
over with
seriously I'm down to here on this
roller ball so not that much project not
that much product definitely think I can
move through it and again for my like
makeup empties for the year another
thing that's kind of included in there
are like perfume empties I included that
with my makeup so this will help me
reach that goal this is a deluxe sized
sample of skincare this is the Clinique
Moisture Surge it doesn't have much in
it it has like half not even but again
this is something that I was using then
just stopped and started using other
things and I just don't want it to sit
half open for forever because then I
start getting grossed out like how long
has it been there and if you thought of
the Emperor's New Groove I know anyway I
just want to use it up this is my tony
moly hand cream in the peach scent I
don't have much left I've been using
this quite consistently but again I've
just been lazy and haven't been using
hand cream so it's a way for me to use
this up and it just smells so good this
one also smells so so good if you like
peaches you would love this and I really
like the texture of this hand cream it
just feels so smooth and soft without
being greasy and the last item I promise
the last item here this is the fleur de
france pure lavender face and body mist
again
just I've been lazy with all my stuff
which could just be me being exhausted
it's not even a lazy it's just I'm just
I've been so exhausted lately like with
my school finals and then the trip and
then be getting sick now and then
finishing work and I've just been so
exhausted it's just six months of it
I've finally taken a toll me and so I
think I think that's why maybe it's not
laziness but I am here on it not much
but I just haven't even been using this
at night and I have two other sprays
after this to use up so I definitely
just want to move through this I can
start working on those that is
everything guys I'm gonna give my voice
a break give you guys a break from this
face and I will see you in my next video
I just wanted to get these up because
they are time-sensitive it's like you
know the beginning of the month all this
stuff should be up so if you if you see
these posted like one right now for the
other like maybe even on like the same
day that's why I will see you guys in
the next video let me know if you have
any suggestions for videos or anything
like that down below I would love to
know what you guys want to see I'll see
you in my next one
