to be a project use it up video now I've
seen men's make up a do these videos
every single month and it's just
products it's kind of like a year-long
or however long you want to do it
project pan that just kind of continues
from one month to the next month and you
update your progress and it's just kind
of like think of it like a diet is
something you do just for a certain
period of time and then you're kind of
over it this is like a lifestyle that's
how I think of it anyway so I thought I
would do a project use it up on items
that are are not makeup now in my
project pans I usually only pick makeup
because that's just what I like to see
project panned and that's what I feel
the most awesome using up so I feel like
they're just more interesting and more
exciting if I'm only using makeup but
there's a lot of other products around
my house that I'd like to use up so this
is gonna be I'm gonna do it monthly and
it's gonna be my video showing you like
bathroom body hair stuff anything else
in my life that I'd like to use up about
like 5 to 10 items every month and like
what my goals are on them where I'd like
to be and then every month I'll update
you in the last month and show you what
I'm going to use up the next month man
I'm out of breath trying to talk to you
guys and explain that so hopefully that
makes sense I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know if you think this is a
good idea down below I just I think
it'll be nice
so I'm also not doing like a ton and
like everything I ever want to use up in
the month because I don't show you guys
in my empties things that you've already
seen emptied in those videos cuz I just
don't want to repeat a ton of product so
these are products that won't be in my
empties once I use them up and I still
want to have an empties video every
single month - so it's just products I
just have to keep using things up to
have all these videos which is good
because I have so many products so many
products anyway enough rambling let's
get into the video the first thing I
want to use up is this pink hand and
body cream and this isn't a scent cozy
up and toasted vanilla and peony now if
you guys have follow me for a long time
you know I do not like lotion and I've
been going through my cabinets which I
think I'm gonna take you guys along and
do a little too
and like do it like vlog style but I was
going through and I saw this in there
I'm like gosh I've had this for a while
I've almost like this Christmas will be
two years and it wasn't open I took this
sticker off and I was like now that the
stickers off I gotta use it or it's
gonna go bad so I actually made a mark
on it um last Thursday night and it's
Wednesday night and I don't know if you
can see through it but product-wise I'm
down to here and I maybe used it I throw
my whole body before I went to bed maybe
three or four times and I made so much
progress on it so I definitely just want
to finish this up in the month of this
is gonna be the month of September I
want to finish this up I'll probably
work on another one after I finish this
but for the sake of this project I just
want to at least get through this for
sure I definitely think it will be
doable even just a couple body
applications and I'd probably get
through this so this is something I want
to work on and just in general work on
my body lotions because I'm not buying
them I just have a lot stocked up from
before or like people would get them to
me as gifts so I really need to work
through them this product is like the
saddest little thing because there's
barely anything left and this is the
body clear body spray this is like
something that I use on Sam
and I'm gonna force him to use it it's
not even for me but um again part of the
reason that I picking these products is
because I wouldn't use them if I didn't
put them in a project pan I guess yeah
let's make that clear another reason
that I'm putting these items in this
like project use it up instead of just
using them up throughout the month like
in putting them in Manties is these are
products that I probably wouldn't use up
unless I kind of force myself or had
something weighing on my conscience to
use them so they're items that I've had
for a long time I'm not working through
them they're not in my everyday routine
so I kind of need a kick on the butt to
make me use them and that's why our this
video and series comes in so this is for
Sam I'm gonna spray it on him every
single night til it's gone and this
stupid little bottle can get out of her
cabinet like I moved to California with
this like seriously maybe up to here I'm
done it's going in the trash another
item I wanna use up this is the Evian
facial spray water I'm not really a big
fan of this because it's just water it
doesn't have any like it's just water so
I'm Dover
and I just I'm gonna spray it on my face
before like after I do my makeup before
I leave for work I'm just gonna spray it
every day and try to look through this
by the end of September I just don't
want to in my clutch anymore and I
wouldn't repurchase that specific facial
spray I like facial Springs that I like
ones that like have hyaluronic acid or
like essential oils are just something
else in them that makes them different
than literally Springs like water on
your face I have two little travel-size
items I want to use up these are both
body washes this is the Bulgari
um Ameena coral and this is one of my
favorite scents in perfume and I got it
with my perfume and I just want to use
it up I'm going to enjoy the scent it's
small so I definitely can work through
it I just don't need the bottle hanging
around anymore so it's a way to get
through it the other one I got from a
hotel this is the tan aromatic wood
aromatherapy shower gel I've heard about
tan from like Florida force and stuff
here on YouTube so I thought like when I
was in hotel like oh I'm gonna snatch it
up oh my gosh but it's okay it just
smells kind of like a man it's one of
those things like looking back on it
right now I'm like I didn't really need
to take it since I haven't used it but
I'm gonna try to use it up this month as
well I have only a little bit left of
the shower gel currently using so then I
will work on these two and I definitely
think I can get them done by the end of
September but again I wouldn't use them
if I wasn't forcing myself to this is an
argan oil from josie maran and i just
want to use this up I am like currently
about right there and I finished the
night moisturizer I was using and I
really don't have anything else and I
have a ton of these little samples and I
just don't want them to go bad and I'm
not a facial oil type of girl I've used
this last three nights or so and it's
been okay but again it's just not
something I would use in listen forcing
myself to so I'm doing that with this
I'm gonna try to use it up I have
another one after this that I'll
probably start using after I finish that
so yeah this is just giving me time to
research the night cream I want to use
yes this is the almond shower oil from
lots of tongue I have a little mini
sample of this I got in a little kit we
mare in France and I just want to try
and use it and and see what it's like
one because I thought the nooks one was
gonna be like this and it wasn't so I
thought why don't I actually try it and
use it up and know if I like it or not
that's or imagine I'm gonna actually use
it since I own it and see if I like it
and it also get it out less less clutter
in my dough clip last that's a nice try
insane I'm gonna put this body splash in
Here I am
look you've seen fill these lines I was
trying to use this up in a project so I
am here about I'll put a mark on and
after this video I just want to use this
up in September I definitely think it's
doable I'm just gonna try to spray this
every single time I'm on a break at work
and I get three breaks every single day
at work so hopefully it'll be doable
it's just like I'm done with this pink
bottle I'm doing the scent but I don't
want to throw it away like I've come so
far I can't turn back now so well I want
to finish this up and get it out staying
with perfumes I have two little mini
roller balls this one is in Daisy and
I'm kind of like halfway done with it
it's really small roller balls go really
fast for me so this probably isn't even
that many uses like probably not even
ten and then I thought since that one
was so tiny I would do this one too this
is Killer Queen by Katy Perry and I just
want to use it up as well
perfume is something that I'm trying to
go through this year I'm trying to work
on a lot of it and I probably will do
like maybe a perfume collection video
and show you guys what I have let me
know if you'd want to even see that I
don't know like guys know what my
favorite scents are I just want only the
suns I truly love in my collection and I
have a lot that aren't my favorite but I
don't really want to get rid of either
so I really need to work on working
through them before I can purchase
anything else these little roller balls
are one way I'm trying to work toward
that as I try to drop it and break it
why are all my project pan videos I'm
breaking everything okay in the last
item that I want to try to use up during
the month of September is this candle
but I got the body works this is coconut
leaves this candle smells super good I
really like the way it smells it's just
I started burning it when we first moved
here over like way over a month ago so I
just haven't burnt it and
time I just want to get it out keep
moving through my candle collection I
kind of put the hold on that plus with
all the fall Suns I have so many that I
want to start burning and they already
have like a lot of the fall sense that I
love so I just want to work through it
like everything that's this video again
let me know if you think this is
something you would like to see I'm
pretty sure you guys will like it plus
it's kind of focusing on other things
besides makeup but still moving stuff
out of my house out of my collection
decluttering my life and getting my
money's worth out of products so I will
see you in my next video I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
