to be a project use it up video now I've
seen meds make up a do these videos
every single month and it's just
products it's kind of like a year-long
or however long you want to do it
project pan that just kind of continues
from one month to the next month and you
update your progress and it's just kind
of like think of it like a diet is
something you do just for a certain
period of time and then you're kind of
over it this is like a lifestyle that's
how I think of it anyway so I thought I
would do a project use it up on items
that are are not make up now in my
project pans i usually only pick makeup
because that's just what I like to see
project panned and that's what I feel
the most awesome using up so I feel like
they're just more interesting and more
exciting if I'm only using makeup but
there's a lot of other products around
my house that I'd like to use up so this
is going to be I'm gonna do it monthly
and it's gonna be my video showing you
like bath and body hair stuff anything
else in my life that I'd like to use up
about like five to ten items every month
and like what my goals are on them where
I'd like to be and then every month I'll
update you on the last month and show
you what I'm going to use up the next
month man I'm out of breath trying to
talk to you guys and explain that so
hopefully that makes sense I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know if
you think this is a good idea down below
I just I think it'll be nice so I'm also
not doing like a ton and like everything
I ever want to use up in the month
because I don't show you guys in my
empties things that you've already seen
emptied in those videos because I just
don't want to repeat a ton of products
so these are products that won't be my
empties once a use them up and I still
want to have an empties video every
single month too so it's just products I
just have to keep using things up to
have all these videos which is good
because i have so many products some new
products anyway enough rambling let's
get into the video the first thing i
want to use up is this pink hand and
body cream and this isn't accent cozy up
in toasted vanilla and peony now if you
guys have follow me for a long time you
know i do not like lotion and I've been
going through my cabinets which i think
i'm going to take you guys along and do
a little declutter
like do it like vlog style but I was
going through and I saw this in there
and like gosh I've had this for a while
I've almost like this Christmas will be
two years and it wasn't open i took the
sticker off and i was like now that the
stickers off i gotta use it or it's
gonna go bad so i actually made a mark
on it um last Thursday night and it's
Wednesday night and I don't know if you
can see through it but product wise i'm
down to here and i may be used it i used
over my whole body before i went to bed
maybe three or four times and i made so
much progress on it so i definitely just
want to finish this up in the month of
this is going to be the month of
September I want to finish this up I'll
probably work on another one after i
finish this but for the sake of this
project i just want to at least get
through this for sure I definitely think
it will be doable even just a couple
body applications and I'd probably get
through this so this is something I want
to work on and just in general work on
my body lotions because i'm not buying
them I just have a lot stocked up from
before or like people would get them to
me his gifts so I really need to work
through them this product is like the
saddest little thing because there's
barely anything left and this is the
body clear body spray this is like
something that i use on Sam and I'm
gonna force him to use it it's not even
for me but um again part of the reason
that I picking these products is because
I wouldn't use them if I didn't put them
in a project pan I guess yeah let's make
that clear another reason that I'm
putting these items in this like project
used it up instead of just using them up
throughout the month like in putting
them in my empties is these are products
that I probably wouldn't use up unless I
kind of force myself or had something
weighing on my conscious to use them so
um their items that I've had for a long
time I'm not working through them
they're not in my everyday routine so I
kind of need a kick in the butt to make
me use them and that's why our this
video and series comes in so this is for
Sam I'm gonna spray it on him every
single night till it's gone and this
stupid little bottle can get out of her
cabinet like I moved to California with
this like seriously maybe up to here I'm
done it's going in the trash another
item I want ease up this is the Evian um
facial spray water I'm not really a big
fan of this because it's just water it
doesn't have any like it's just water so
I'm Dover it and I
I'm going to spray it on my face before
like after I do my makeup before i leave
for work I'm just gonna spray it every
day and try to work through this by
vanna September I just don't want to in
my clutch anymore and I wouldn't
repurchase that specific facial spray I
like facial Springs but I like ones that
like have hyaluronic acid or like
essential oils are just something else
in them that makes them different than
literally Springs like water on your
face I have two little travel-size items
I want to use up these are both body
washes this is the Bulgari um Oh Mina
coral and this is one of my favorite
scents and perfume and I got it with my
perfume and I just want to use it up I'm
going to enjoy the scent it's small so I
definitely can work through it I just
don't need the bottle hanging around
anymore so it's a way to get through it
the other one I got from a hotel this is
the tan aromatic wood aromatherapy
shower gel I've heard about tan from
like fleurdeforce and stuff here on
YouTube say that like when I was in
hotel like oh I'm gonna snatch it up oh
my gosh but it's okay it just smells
kind of like a man it's one of those
things like looking back on it right now
I'm like I didn't really need to take it
since i haven't used it um but i'm gonna
try to use it up this month as well i
have only a little bit left of the
shower dog currently using so then i'll
work on these two and i definitely think
i can get them done by the end of sep
tember but again i wouldn't use them if
i wasn't forcing myself to this is an
argan oil from josie maran and i just
want to use this up i am like currently
about right there and i finished the
night moisturizer i was using and i
really don't have anything else and have
a ton of these little samples and I just
don't want them to go bad and I'm not a
facial oil type of girl I've used this
last three nights or so and it's been
okay but again it's just not something i
would use in listen forcing myself to so
i'm doing that with this and i'm going
to try to use it up have another one
after this it'll probably start using
after i finished that so yeah this is
just giving me time to research the
night cream i want to use
yes this is the almond shower oil from
lots of tongue I have a little mini
sample of this I got in a little kit
when they're in France and I just want
to try and use it and and see what it's
like one because i thought the nukes one
was going to be like this and it wasn't
so i thought why don't I actually try it
and use it up and know if I like it or
not that's our mind you I'm gonna
actually use it since I own it and see
if I like it and um it also get it out
less less clutter in my diploma last
quarter in my collection that's a nice
try anything I'm gonna put this body
splash in here I am look you've seen
seal these lines I was trying to use
this up in a project so i am here about
i'll put a mark on and after this video
i just want to use this up in September
I definitely think it's doable I'm just
gonna try to spray this every single
time I'm out a break at work and I get
three breaks every single day at work so
hopefully it'll be doable it's just like
I'm done with this pink bottle i'm done
with the scent but i don't want to throw
it away like I've come so far I can't
turn back now so well I want to finish
this up and get it out staying with
perfumes I have two little mini roller
balls this one is in Daisy and I'm kind
of like halfway done with it it's really
small roller balls go really fast for me
so this probably isn't even that many
uses like probably not even 10 and then
I thought since that one was so tiny i
would do this one too this is killer
queen by katy perry and i just want to
use it up as well perfume is something
that I'm trying to go through this here
I'm trying to work on a lot of it and I
probably will do like maybe a perfume
collection video and show you guys what
I have let me know if you'd want to even
see that I don't know like guys know
what my favorite scents are I just want
only the sense i truly love in my
collection and i have a lot that aren't
my favorite but i don't really want to
get rid of either so i really need to
work on working through them before i
can purchase anything else these little
roller balls are one way I'm trying to
work toward that as I try to drop it and
break it why are all my project pan
videos i'm breaking everything ok in the
last item that i want to
up during the month of September is this
candle by Gotham body works this is
coconut leaves this candle smells super
good i really like the way it smells
it's just i started burning it when we
first moved here over like way over a
month ago so i just haven't burnt it in
a long time i just want to get it out
keep moving through my candle collection
I kind of put the hold on that plus with
all the false ends I have so many that i
want to start burning and they already
have like a lot of the fall scents that
i love so i just want to work through it
like everything that's this video again
let me know if you think this is
something you would like to see i'm
pretty sure you guys will like it plus
it's kind of focusing on other things
besides makeup but still moving stuff
out of my house out of my collection
decluttering my life and getting my
money's worth out of products so i will
see you in my next video i hope you guys
are having a wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
