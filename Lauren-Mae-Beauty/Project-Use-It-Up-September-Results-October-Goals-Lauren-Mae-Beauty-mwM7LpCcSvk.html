Lauren thank you so much for watching a
few things really fast if you haven't
seen my get ready with me that's where I
did this look you also know that there
are a few issues so forgive me if I know
it looks a little weird or cakey or
whatever also I did put glasses on these
will be linked down below in case you're
wondering I had a lot of people ask in
the last video I wore them so just so
you know it's down there if I can find
it but they're from firm ooh and they
have a ton of great glasses anyway I
think that's everything they might be a
little dirty - I don't know it's late
guys
we're just trying to make it today ok
today's video is going to be my project
use it up update this is a project that
I do monthly and I put in about like
five or six products and then I rotate
them out and I try to use up some stuff
that isn't makeup stuff that I
definitely need a little bit of a push
to get through yeah so let me show you
the progress on September's items and
then I will show you what I'm gonna be
using up in October first off I did use
up the candle I'm really happy about
that I've also been just like burning
candles I've been really into the
candles lately so it's been actually fun
to use these up this one was the scent
sunset beach from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it
was nice but it was definitely summery
so I'm excited to be moving on to fall
scent I have quite a few in my back
stock so it's been fun burning those and
sadly as always that is the only thing I
used up guys OH
anyway let's get onto progress this is
the body scrub I have in from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works it's in the scent French
lavender and honey and this was full
when I started and I am down to here so
I mean it's kind of nice that a scrub
didn't get used up in an entire month
because when you think about
repurchasing it that much but I did
really want to get this gone I like this
scent but I do not like it in this and I
don't know if that's because this is old
I don't know what this is it does smell
like the scent like it doesn't smell
necessarily off there's just something
about it this specific sugar scrub from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works also was like flaky
sugar like it's almost like margarita
salt sugar like that's the type of
flakes it is and that's not my favorite
I like just a regular sugar but just a
lot of it that's like my favorite type
of scrub and so I don't know I don't
know
that it's just too big of granules and
then this leaves a really thick like
moisturizing oily coat on my skin like I
can go like this afterward and there's
like stuff under my nails and that's not
my favorite so anyway I can't wait to
use this up it's not like so horrible
that I don't want to finish it because
I'm so close but I definitely wouldn't
repurchase this and I tried other scrubs
from Bath and Body Works that I do like
so I don't know if it's just this
specific kind
it says honey body scrub I don't know if
that means anything so for that scrub I
am gonna be throwing it into October and
then I'm also going to be throwing in
this body blends oats oats baby scrub I
did a review on this I'll leave it link
down below I did get sent this and yeah
I've had it for a while I want to use it
up but this smells like coffee which is
nice I think I am going to put it into a
different container that's like the one
thing about this scrub I don't like is
that I just feel like my wet hand
getting in here is just gonna like leave
a lot of bacteria and the potential for
like things to grow in here and since
you can't see through the bag like
freaked me out so I'm probably gonna put
this in like Tupperware and keep it in
my shower that way we'll see how that
works out I'll let you guys know but I
would like to finish this up and enjoy
it I don't know I think kind of like
coffee scrubs in the shower and fall
would be nice right like kind of cozy
next is an item that we cannot measure
sadly this is the skin erm SmartNet
cream I have been using this guys I'm
trying so hard I have had a few times
where I've been trying to get this out
and it skipped and then more came out so
maybe we're close I will be throwing
this in next month because I know if
it's not in this project I will probably
be a slacker and not use it so this is
just gonna keep going and we can all
just like rejoice when it's finally used
up same with the doll face toner I got
this from Oxley as well as that neck
cream to see you guys now also so you
guys know because they film so many
videos and I you know film all in one
day and whatnot I'm not always telling
you that things are from octoly because
in my head I think like oh they already
know that because I talked about it like
700 times and other videos but if you're
ever wondering any of the links that say
oculi that means I got sent to me from a
flea just wanted to let you guys know
verbally here and then in my head I feel
like I won't have to tell you because I
told you in this video but I'll try to
bring it up and try to say it as much as
possible because you know not ever
watches every single video anyway I am
making steady progress so it's been just
consistent you know trucking along but
what that means to me is that there's a
definite possibility that this will be
gone by the end of October which I'll be
proud of this made me realize how slow
toners go like you think you're gonna go
through it a lot faster than you are so
I'm happy to get through with this I
don't hate it as much as I did when I
first started but it's definitely not a
favorite and I don't necessarily suggest
it I did throw in a perfume last time
this is the Viva La Juicy Lafleur
perfume this is where I started and now
I'm down to here so made some definite
progress on it I thought I could finish
this up but honestly the reason I didn't
is because I did go to Bloomingdale's I
went to the mall I had to get some
blotting papers for a wedding and so I
was in the mall and they had a
Bloomingdale's so I was like I'm gonna
check out those jo Malone fragrances
that I talked about in my wish list I
knew I would probably like them the it's
like the red currant and English oak
wood or something and then they have
another one that's very similar but it
have a little bit more of a masculine
scent to it so I thought I would go in
there and check them out and smell them
and they smell divine the one that I
thought I would like the red currant one
is so good they were really nice and
they gave me a sample of the blackberry
in bay and they also gave me a sample of
the cucumber and great Earl Grey tea or
something that one smells pretty nice
too they were out of the samples of the
other ones so I will try to go get a
sample at some point or if I'd like
happen to be in a mall of the other
scent because I want to smell it on my
body but I'm probably gonna buy that
during the div Rouge anyway that's the
reason I didn't get as much progress on
that that's why I told you that story
but I am going to be rolling this over
into next month and hopefully I can use
it up I do enjoy this scent it's just a
little sweet for me
I just like something a little bit more
complex and a little bit more
interesting I definitely find that
that's what I gravitate to that's what I
feel the sexiest in and that's important
to me and the last thing that I had in
my project for September was this
cosmetics restore moisture-rich mask I
wanted to use this four times and I only
ended up using it twice I do really like
this though there's something about it
that although it's moisturizing it
definitely has properties in it that
feel like it's moisturizing your face
but also getting rid of like dead skin
it also
here that like please wear sunscreen
when using this product as it contains
ingredients that may increase your skin
sensitivity to Sun so I don't know if
this has like retinol or retinol it but
I do really like it and I'm not going to
be throwing this in for October but I am
going to be trying to still use it just
won't be officially in this project so
you guys know what I'm rolling over from
the things that I've already mentioned
so new items that I'm adding in one is
going to be this coconut water spray
this is from pearl essence and I got
this at t.j.maxx I really like this the
bottle of this is glass the sprayer on
it is so nice I love the way it just
looks aesthetically I want to try to use
it up and I probably will save this
bottle like I'll probably take all of
the stuff off and save it in case
there's something that I don't like the
sprayer on cuz it's that nice and I love
that it's glass like I want to reuse
that I think it's a nice thing to
recycle this is where I'm at and I
definitely think if I use everyday I can
get it done by the end of October and
last I am throwing in candles because
like I'm doing the best at the candle so
I'm keeping it going I am switching it
up though I'm going to be throwing in
two different candles one is sweater
weather I want to finish this up
entirely I've already started on it I've
already finished up another candle
besides that sunset beach 1/2 like I'm
telling you candles are like where it's
at right now for me so that one I want
to finish up and then this caramel
pumpkin swirl candle this is very
intense so intense like I can only burn
this for like about an hour and then I
have to take it like blow it out and it
still smells up the house so much if I
could get this halfway done I would be
very happy if I could finish this up in
fall time or at least by the end of the
year I would be like estatic but I don't
know if that's going to be the case and
if not I'm fine with keeping this until
next year and then burning the other
half until then umm but yeah if I could
burn up half of this I would be really
happy about that and that is everything
guys for my project use it up thank you
so so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video bye ice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
