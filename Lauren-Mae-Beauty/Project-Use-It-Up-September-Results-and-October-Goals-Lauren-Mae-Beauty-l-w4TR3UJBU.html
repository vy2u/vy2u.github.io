I'm gonna try to actually film a couple
videos today so let's get into it this
is going to be my September results for
my project use it up and then my October
goals I did about like 50/50 so I didn't
do the best on this project but I am
happy everything that I put in my
projects use it up our items that are
not makeup because I do project pans and
in my project pans I only choose makeup
so this is a way for me to get other
types of items out of my collection and
it's also a way for me to choose items
that I that aren't in my daily routine
or aren't things that I'm using every
single day to try to focus on and use
them up because I kind of need that kick
in the butt or like accountability
through the video to actually use it so
as no surprise I did end up using this
this is the body clear body spray from
Neutrogena this is like an acting kind
of body spray I sprayed this on same
until it was all gone it looks like
there's a little bit left foot there's
nothing left this is something I just
wanted out but I mean I had the tiniest
bit left like let's just ease it up so
that's why I threw it in this project
and it is now gone another item that I
used up this month was this Evian water
spray now this is a little disappointing
because I put this in here cuz I
probably won't repurchase this one but
the like aerosol can ran out of air to
spray the product out before there's
actually product so if you can hear that
there's still like water in the can but
it just like I don't know if you can see
it just trickles out I mean it doesn't
spray any can there's no air to spray it
out with so that's disappointing but I
can't use it anymore so this is done I
finish up these two shower type of
products this first one here this is the
tan aromatic wood aromatherapy shower
gel I use this up in a couple showers
it's okay nothing special definitely
wouldn't seek this out and then the
other item that I finished up for the
shower was this Bulgari omena coral and
I thought this is a body wash but it was
actually a body scrub so it had little
scrubby bits in it I used it on my
loofah like I would a shower gel but it
did have that like extra scrubbing power
this melt really nice and I could tell
that this sound like kind of lingered
with me throughout the day like
throughout the day I get little whiffs
of it so I did enjoy that I wouldn't
purchase or try to find it out though
wasn't anything that special I had too
little perfume mini roller balls in here
that I used up this one is Daisy and
there's nothing left I started about
halfway on this one so it wasn't
completely full and it is now gone and
that's one of my favorite scents ever so
it was funny whatever awards Sam would
always be like what are you wearing or
do you smell good and it's because this
scent just has so many memories of us
we've been together eight years now and
I've worn this for a long time
so he like recognizes this scent and I
know he really likes this scent on me
and then the other one I finished up was
the Katy Perry Killer Queen and this one
was full this little mini was full so I
finished up both of those really happy
I'm trying to work on my perfumes get
some roller balls out get some smaller
perfumes out just so that I really have
a collection that I really enjoy and by
the time this video is up I believe my
perfume collection video will be up for
you guys you already know all the ones
that I have not counting my roller balls
and the last thing that I did finish up
was this josie maran argan oil this is
just like a deluxe sized sample I did
enjoy this I don't know I go back and
forth the facial oils are not my
favorite they are messy they feel greasy
but they do work well I didn't break out
from it and it was just nice to have
some type of moisturizer at night I
really like using these too and how I
think I'm gonna use a lot of the other
ones up that I have is like putting a
couple drops in a night moisturizer just
to kind of enhance it and give it a
little bit more moisturization for the
night time and I'll probably be using a
lot of mine up that way though these are
the items of of where I got for the rest
of them and then I will be transferring
those items into October's use it up you
know I will be continuing to try to use
these items up I just did not get to
using them entirely this month
everything that has pretty good progress
so I feel good about that again these
are things I wouldn't have used had I
not put them in this project anyway so
first off this and I thought for sure I
was gonna totally knock out of the park
but I didn't this is the pink warm and
cozy body lotion now I do have a mark
here I did start this high up I probably
started around here and I am down here
so I did make some good progress
I probably
only have like two not quite two full
body applications left on it so not much
I definitely can finish this up this is
just one of those things that I knew
would be kind of easier to use so I
think that made me like put it on the
back burner and like be lazy about it
till the end and then we got to the end
and I still had just that tiny bit left
so I will be focusing on this and I
really want to focus on using this up
before I leave for Peru ideally for Peru
this month and I'll be gone about 10
days so yeah I just want to have this
done before it leaves another pink item
that I did not finish up this one is the
pink pretty and pure oliver body mist
now for this project I did start here
and I got all the way down to this line
I have been working like a freaking dog
trying to use this up I've been doing so
well so I only have a little bit left if
I make the same type of progress I did
as last month I should be able to finish
this I keep this in my purse I spray
this as often as I can remember all my
breaks I spray it before I clock in it's
kind of part of my routine I'll put like
do turn on spray this put a piece of gum
in and then go clock in and so hopefully
I will be done with this soon
I'm tired of the Sun I'm sure my
co-workers are trying to the central
we're so tired we're throwing this scent
so anyway I just want to get down with
it so again rolling this over into
October and I do feel confident that I
can finish it up hopefully right
hopefully this item I only used once
this is the shower oil from L'Occitane I
did think this was nice when I did use
it but again it's not like an actual oil
in the shower that what yours is you
like I thought it would be so I'm going
to continue to try to use this this is
another one I'm gonna try to use up
before I head out for Peru
just because I'm gonna have my own stuff
for Peru that'll be in this project as
well I'm just gonna try to use this up I
don't know I thought this would be
something I could combine with the
shower gel like you my shower gel and
then put the song afterward as more of
like a moisturizing type of product that
when I got out and leave my skin a
little bit not greasy but moisturized
and it's not it's not like that so I
thought I could use this in conjunction
with the shower gel and I
there's really no need I feel like it's
kind of wasteful so I mean I've only
used it once so we'll see and I'll keep
going but yeah this is going to roll
over that was probably the item I did
the worst on not probably it was the
worst and the last item from my
September project was this coconut
leaves candle from Bath and Body Works I
have the markings here so I started up
here I hid down here I could have burned
this a couple more times but honestly as
you guys know I work full-time and then
my two days I'm off I go to school so
there really isn't a day when I'm just
at home doing laundry or you know just
hanging out where I can burn this all
day and enjoy it instead it's like I
came home from work and I burned it and
you know for not as long a period of
time I guess and also a lot of times I'm
just so tired when I get home from work
that I don't think to light a candle and
I'm like falling asleep so I don't
really like to have candles like burning
where I'll forget and all that type of
stuff so I am going to try to finish
this up again before I leave for Peru
just to get it out of the way I'm gonna
go burn it like after this video after I
film today so I can hopefully get it
done but this one kind of burned strange
I know we should trim the wicks I never
do though and usually they burn fine but
this one's been burning a little weird
which is a little annoying I hate when
they do that like I don't understand
what makes that happen I try to burn
them when I first start them for like
the two hours like you're supposed to
and some just our little bad eggs and
this one I think it's getting back on
track but for a while it was burning
very strange okay now for the new items
I'm adding into the October project so
I'm again repeating 7 million times but
I am going to be using up and rolling
over the items I didn't use up in
September into my October project use it
up and then these are some additional
items that I'd like to use up in the
month of October you will notice a trend
with these items they are a lot of like
smaller items travel sized items and
again that is because I'm going to Peru
I I don't want to like stick myself with
something that's really large and then
for like 10 days or a third of the month
I can't even use it and then I don't
finish it so I'm trying to use this trip
as a way to get rid of some of those
smaller items in my collection that I
can bring with me and that can be useful
on my trip but that can also serve as a
way
like get rid of stuff so yeah that's
what I'm trying to do well start with
perfumes and since I finished up
perfumes last time I'm going to continue
on this this month this is a small like
0.5 ounce perfume this is Hilary Duff's
with love and this is a very warm scent
not something I'm used to having in my
collection but I thought since it's
getting a little cooler that this would
be a good one to just try to get out of
my collection so that way I can enjoy
other perfumes I really bought this just
for a nostalgic reasons and I'm ready to
move it out I'm glad I got it but I'm
ready to move it out so I think this
month would be a good time to do that
another tiny little perfume I'm just
kind of tacking on this is from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works it's the forever red perfume
and like this mini sized thing I got
this when it was first coming out they
were selling these for like $5 I am like
less than halfway here I just want it
gone and again this project is just
gonna make me use it it's not like it's
gonna take that much time or energy to
use it I just need to actually do it and
this is gonna force me to do that so
this one will be gone this month too
which I'm really happy just to get this
gone I only have four more products that
I'm like wanting to use up because I
don't want to overload myself I want
this to be successful so that I can
start over with new products and know
about her so for kind of like a travel
bag I put together a few items I want to
use this one here is a travel sized body
lotion this is the honey sweetheart
it's from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is one
of my oldest travel sized body lotions
so I thought it'd be a good time to use
this on the trip and also well I might
not even be able to use it on the trip
because of the mosquitoes they might
like bite me to dust hisses smells so
good so I'm I don't know I might bring
it but I don't know how much I'll use it
on the trip but it's small anyway I just
thought of that well I filmed like wait
I'm going to get bitten by mosquitoes
like crazy if I wear this so anyway it's
small at least I'll have some time
before I leave after I get home to kind
of use this item up so that was my idea
originally now it's changed but I still
want to try to use it another smaller
like travel type of item is this not
your mother's deja voodoo style extender
to use this kind of as like a cream in
my room
so at the ends of my hair I get kind of
frizzy I don't know it's just kind of
like my baby hairs go a little crazy so
on second day here I like to use this
but I also like to use this when my hair
is wet so there's really not much left
like if I had to guess I'd say like
maybe here but I'm just not very good at
using hair products and I thought this
is something I could bring to Peru with
me put it in my hair air-dry and I think
it looked nice and also I can use when
I'm here at home before I leave and the
last two items kind of go together these
are like a shower type of set this is
the body shops coconut shower cream this
is just gonna be my shower gel that I
bring to Peru with me and then when I
get home I'm just going to finish it up
throughout the month and then be done
with it so and then I thought why not
use a scrub while I'm there or while I
get back home so this is the matching
scrub it's a coconut one I love the body
shops coconut smell when I first got it
I thought it smelled kind of weak and
not very good but as I used the body
butter because I had a small body butter
that came with this set I just fell in
love and I absolutely loved it so I
thought using them together would be fun
and how they're meant to be and really
enhance the smell while also getting
them out simultaneously those are all my
items that I'm going to be using up
those items I did use up for September I
really am liking the fact that I'm
focusing on things other than makeup in
my collection because as you guys saw I
might like to cut our videos which I'm
like oh my gosh Lauren stop decluttering
your stuff like oh my gosh all we're
doing is looking at your crap I'm ready
to like film something else for like two
seconds but I'm just excited to kind of
move out some of those things to see
what I have to Windell down and not just
Windell down because I'm getting rid of
stuff but because I'm actually putting
those items to use so this project
definitely kind of fills that and makes
me feel satisfied in that way I am
enjoying it I'm excited to see what I
can get done this month and see what I
can pick for November so I hope you guys
enjoyed I will see you in the next one
and there'll be a couple more videos
with me in this like gray tank top and I
will see you done bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
