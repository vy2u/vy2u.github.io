it's Lauren this is going to be my
project use it up this is my February
result in my March goals I have a lot
going on in March I'm doing March mini
madness so I only picked five items to
kind of like bring forward and work on
in March but let me first show you the
progress I made and what I finished up
in February and then we'll get into that
I feel pretty good about this month it's
just been crazy I haven't been as
focused on my this project as much as I
have my like finished seven by spring
and those ones and just other things in
general but I still feel like even with
that I definitely set myself up for
success last month and kind of knew I
would be in a crazy state of mind so it
worked out in that sense but anyway
enough rambling let's get into it
I completely finished up my sunset beach
candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and I have
since cleaned it out and I'm using it
for other things so yeah that's it was a
pretty pretty frosted glass candle I
thought the smell of this was nice but I
probably wouldn't purchase it again it's
nothing that special to me it's just a
general tropical scent so yeah you can't
smell it anymore
I was also able to finish up my mahogany
teak wood little mini candle or small
candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I really
do like the smell of this I definitely
will probably repurchase this in the
future but I don't think I would ever
purchase this sized candle it just
doesn't give off enough scent to me and
I would just rather spend a couple extra
dollars get the bigger one and have a
better result so I'm glad this is done
and I don't have any more small into my
collection as we knew I would I finished
up the bath and Bodyworks Japanese
cherry blossom a little travel there's
nothing left
it had like one wash left this was such
a gimme product and it's done I finished
up the sugar scrub from Ulta this is in
the vanilla sugar scent you guys know I
don't like this product so glad to have
them out of my collection and to know
that I will never purchase these again I
don't like them I don't recommend them
go with the tree hut Shea sugar scrubs
or whatever those are over this
definitely not my favorite but I'm so
glad to have them done and to know that
I don't like them those are all the
items that I finished this month so I'm
gonna go into the ones that have
and I am carrying those over so first
off I have my body spray from pink this
is in the scent summer Krush and I got
about halfway with this I'm really happy
with that progress I didn't use it as
much as I could have I know that if I
had seriously sprayed it every single
time I was in the bathroom I would have
gone a little farther but I am happy
with it and I'm going to try to finish
it up this month to get it out and I'm
not too sick of the scent yet which is
exciting because it is a bigger it's a
lot of product I'm just excited to get
this gone it'll feel so rewarding to see
this out of my collection similar to
that one I have my ghillie
Hix darlinghurst perfume that's what
it's called as you can see I've just
made steady progress with this this is
also another one I did not use as much
as I could have this month and I know
that if I had it would have made more
progress so I'm just hoping to kind of
meet again halfway on this perfume
because I am going to be working on a
rollerball in my March mini madness so
if I could just make the same amount of
progress while still finishing up the
mini rollerball I would feel really
happy with that
I'm just getting closer and closer to
using this this is the reason I love
this project because I know that if I
had not put this in the project at the
beginning of the year this would still
be a full bottle sitting on my shelf and
right now it's halfway done I'm so close
and I just love seeing that progress so
I'm excited to get even farther with
this I really want this out and I'm glad
that I'm really making a good dent every
single month at making that goal so I'm
only gonna add three more items to those
two so only five items in total this
month to really be working on since I
have so many other projects going on I'm
throwing in yet another candle it seems
like it's been working really well to
move my candles out of my collection
this year by putting them in this
project so I'm gonna be working on Tiki
Beach it's a little early for this scent
but I just love the scent and it's
already hot here so I don't care it just
smells so good I really like this
coconut scent and I just wanted a candle
I really did thoroughly enjoy to burn
this month and so I went with Tiki Beach
and I am excited to burn it and just be
ready for just hot weather and Beach and
summer so yeah
the next item I'm working on this is
from LMS this is a facial spray it's
just like a toner spray and I did use
this pretty consistently at first and
then I've just gotten lazy and haven't
been using it and I want to work through
this because I do have the coda leaf
spray and I also have like a makeup
setting spray from Kula that I haven't
been using so if I get this one out I
feel like I'll be at a better place at
least I'll just have like two sprays
instead of three I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to like completely finish
this in a month but I do want to make
sure I'm using this after I get out of
the shower before I put lotion on as
well as every single night when I clean
my face and before I put lotion on in my
serum on to spray this so I think that
if I just I just want to add this to my
routine again and really be focusing on
moving this product down and out of my
collection I think that I can you know
hopefully get at least two to here on it
for the month and the last item that I'm
going to be putting my energy toward and
focusing on is this wild Madagascar
vanilla vanilla bean body scrub I love
that this is in the squeezy tube it's so
easy I used it this morning actually and
it smells so good I really like this
scrub it's more fine than like a sea
salt scrub but the only bad thing is it
does seem like if you don't use it
really fast it will dissolve easily but
I just think this is really gonna be
easy to use I hope I don't use it up in
the month just because I feel like
that's kind of expensive to be using up
one of these a month in the shower but
if I do I just want to be making sure
I'm using it every time in the shower so
I will see kind of test how long this
takes to use up if it takes a month or a
little bit longer or whatnot I hope you
guys enjoyed this update on the products
that I kind of keep rotating through for
the month I love this project because
it's just it's an easy monthly project
where I can really focus on items that
aren't makeup but that aren't getting
enough love for me and that really need
to just have that push to get out of my
collection I hope you guys enjoyed I
will see you in my next video have a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
