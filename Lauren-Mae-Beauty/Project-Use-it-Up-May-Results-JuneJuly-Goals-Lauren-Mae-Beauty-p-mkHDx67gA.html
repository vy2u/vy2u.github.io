Lauren this is going to be my project
ease it up update this is going to be
main results and then kind of June and
July goals I kind of got this started
later than normal so let's get into my
results for May and then the things that
I have been working on and then want to
continue working on into the end of July
first things I did finish this I'm so
happy this is the bumble and bumble dry
sponge finishing spray this is supposed
to give you like texture and like kind
of this like windblown look I didn't
really enjoy this product and I really
didn't enjoy it I mean I really kind of
despised it I just not enjoy using this
there is a little bit of product in
there but there is no more air in the
can and I don't know if that's because I
didn't shake it up enough when I used it
or what not I'm not complaining cuz I'm
glad I got this done it felt like it was
about here when I started with it and
again it's probably like it feels like
there's that much product in it but it
just won't spray out I am glad to get
this out I would never repurchase this I
think there are other types of products
like this that I like better on the
market and I'd rather try them let's
talk about some body sprays I did finish
the Gila Hicks blue Camden spray and I
started from last update and I've used
up all of that much product and then I
threw in another one from Gila Hicks to
use and I I have a mark here but that's
the mark I made anyone so that you could
see them in comparison but I started up
here and got all the way down to here so
between the two of them I did finish up
basically a whole nother bottle anyway
that's how far I got on this one I just
thought I'd show them together and the
last item that I finished up 100% was
this little rollerball from DKNY this is
my and why we all knew I was gonna use
this up this was like kind of a really
give me product but this is done and now
onto the progress I threw in another
rollerball this one's from Daisy by Marc
Jacobs and this is the oh so fresh so
it's slightly different than the
original
I started about here and I got down to
here so I feel like that's really good
progress I really like this song and I'm
glad I brought it out for spring /summer
it's just a nice one and I forgot how
much I liked Daisy this is the sk2
facial treatment essence and I started
up here and I got down to here
I'm kind of happy this didn't get used
up really fast and that
you could basically get like two months
or so out of this little sample only
because this is so expensive personally
I'm not finding that it's doing anything
like miraculous for my skin and I'm kind
of wondering if it's breaking me out I
went off and on with using this
throughout the month
I used it pretty consistently but I felt
like the times I didn't use it I
wouldn't use it for like four days
straight and the times I would I would
use it again like a week and a half
straight and I just been breaking out
more like little breakouts like little
tiny irritations and breakouts than ever
before so I'm not sure if it's this I'm
gonna try to finish it up and kind of
just see because I'm not a hundred
percent sure but this is like one of the
only new things in my routine and I'm
thinking it might be this so I'm gonna
just kind of track that if it is
breaking me out I'm not gonna finish it
and the last thing I was working on in
May is this face mask from sk2 and I
wanted to use it and obviously it's
sealed and I haven't used it I don't
know why it's so hard for me to use
these types of masks and just masks in
general it's just something I don't give
myself time to do and I just I don't
know I'm like lazy about so yeah I
didn't use this at all obviously let's
get into my goals and the things I've
been working on / wanna work on into
July I'm gonna be rolling over this
roller ball from RJ cups and just finish
this out there's barely any product and
I used over double that last month so I
think that I can definitely get through
this like I mentioned I am going to be
doing the sk2 facial treatment essence
I'm gonna try to finish that up and then
I want to finish up the sk2 face mask
this is a one-time use thing it
shouldn't I mean Lauren get over it like
use this I want to use this up and then
I have a few new items to bring in
let me grab them all over here I have a
body wash I just want to get through
another item and just see another empty
so I'm when I get through this this
shouldn't be a problem and let me tell
you what it is this is the fresh Brazil
citrus and it's a shower gel from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I thought since it was kind
of tropical it makes sense to use it up
right now I want to use up this hand
spray this is like a antibacterial hand
spray and I'm right here on it I've had
this for forever I don't think they even
sell anything like this about them Body
Works anymore cuz I got this during a
semi-annual
so this is probably way too old I just
want to get through this this is a nice
way to use the product I like that you
just like spray it and just easy but
it's too smelly to use on set like I
just don't feel comfortable like in case
someone doesn't like this side door is
sensitive so I just want to get this out
oh I just breathe it in yeah another
perfume I want to get through this is
the Elizabeth and James Nirvana white
and because it's a small rollerball I
was thinking I could maybe get through
this one too this is a really nice
summery scent it's like a light
refreshing scent I personally like this
one better than the black one that one's
just too musky I'm not really into sense
like that so I want to work through this
because I also have it in the full-size
so I don't need the whole for sure
because I'm not even using the whole
size one as much as I should I have a
face mask here this is the one edge I
think that's how you say it water
sleeping mask I basically just use it as
a moisturizer over top my other
moisturizer for whatever reason my skin
is just been really dry and I just have
not been liking the way anything sitting
on it I'm just irritated by my skin so
I've been using it the last two nights
and it really has helped so I figured I
would just give myself a push to use
this and get it out of my collection but
also just taking more steps to keep my
face moisturize and hopefully in the
best condition possible so that my
makeup can look the best it possibly can
laughs item it's another moisturizing
type of product this is an eye cream
from origins I put the other one I had
of this in here last time and it really
helped me is it up and so I figured I
would just do the same thing with this
one I'm about halfway done with this
product and I think I can definitely
like hit pan on this in this next month
if not use up even more than that I
really like the way this looks on the
under eye I use it before I put makeup
on and it just helps my concealer not
look as cakey I'm just having issues
with how things are sitting I'm really
trying to work through what I have
instead of buying new stuff so I'm
really really really hoping I can find a
way to make these products work for me
and not hate them at the same time
that's everything for my project use it
up I hope you guys enjoyed I'm sorry
these are coming out a little bit late
what are you gonna do that's life I'm
trying to make us so I hope you guys are
doing well in your projects and your
and that you're having a great day and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
