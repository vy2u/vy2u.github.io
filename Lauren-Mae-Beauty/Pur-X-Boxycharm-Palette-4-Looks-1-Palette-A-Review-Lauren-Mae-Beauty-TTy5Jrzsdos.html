Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a 4 looks 1 palette
and we are going to be using the pure
and boxy charm this look is not with
this palette I forgot to film an intro
but if you want to see how I created the
looks on the thumbnail I did that using
this palette and they're all in here I
was able to use every single color in
the palette at least somewhere in one of
the tutorials so I really hope you guys
enjoy I have some like thoughts on the
palette at the end as well and kind of
throughout so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
I hope it gives you a little bit of
inspiration or something if you got this
palette and you kind of didn't know what
to do with it and that is everything so
let's get into the tutorials alright
what's up guys we're going into the
first look I already have my face done
like normal with these so I'm going to
be going in and setting my entire lid
down since this has a creamy matte I
might as well use this one I have used
this palette one other time since doing
the boxycharm unboxing and it's yeah
we'll see yeah I definitely have a full
review after using it in this you know
setting doing 4 different looks and also
trying it out other ways but yeah I mean
overall it's not bad especially getting
it in the boxycharm I just don't think
it's worth the retail value crusty old
lips needs some lip balm I'm using this
one from pathology and I'm just gonna
let that sit and soak in I feel like my
lips and my like cuticles have been
insanely dry something with these
palettes that we're gonna come into is
the fact that you know I mean how many
looks can you really create so I'm gonna
do my best to create creative looks but
I'm also just trying to create looks
like I mean this is just how I would
wear them so these might not be
spectacular guys like I'm not saying
that every one of these is like
revolutionary or you know just
absolutely different this is just how I
would wear this palette in my style I
mean I'm gonna try to go out of my
comfort zone some of the times but yeah
some of the times like dude that's how I
wear my eyeshadow so just letting you
know that today though my kind of plan
is do the opposite of what I did in my
boxycharm so I feel like we usually put
the blue as a pop of color on the lower
lash
we're going to switch it up I'm going to
be putting the blue on the lid and then
I'm going to be doing this orange kind
of like copper on the lower lash line
blue and orange complement each other
really well so I think they'll go nicely
together but yeah we're just gonna make
the blue a bit of a focal point and I
think that'll be fun so I'm just putting
in a transition nothing too too heavy
because I don't sometimes it can be
difficult to blend a blue and orange
together but um yeah we're just gonna
blend this into the crease I'll stop
talking because this video will get way
too long
so yeah just blend a transition with the
orange shade called nakey which I'll say
there's a typo on the website if you go
to the pure website I think they call it
naked and the swatches like nah dog it's
called Mickey not naked anyway yeah
blend so the next kind of color I mean
is really just this brown and we're
gonna be working this into the outer
corner I'm using something that's like
fluffy should kind of build up the color
slowly since it is so deep and dark I'm
just trying to lay down a base and then
we can always go in and deepen it up and
we'll probably switch between this shade
and the orange just so we can get the
best blend possible so just keeping this
on the outer corner so that we have the
depth there
so this is where I am after I've blended
those two it really didn't take long to
get there this color is so pigmented so
this is kind of like one dip into the
product I think I just want to move into
the blue shadow so that way we can yeah
just keep going I am going to be foiling
the shadow so just using a setting spray
I wet my brush first and then go into
the shadow hopefully we don't get too
much fallout that is what I pray but
yeah we're just gonna go straight in
it's a very pigmented blue and so I'm
just gonna put this all over both of my
eyelids and then we'll work on blending
it into the brown in the outer corner
so that's the blue on the lid it's very
very bright and a little bit deeper than
I thought that could be because of me
foiling it I did get some fallout so I'm
just gonna try to sweep that away now so
it doesn't like set in and I'm using
powder to sweep it away on my brush so
now what I want to do is work on this
inner portion I don't want it to be such
like a cut crease or anything so I'm
gonna be going into the blue with a
small this is the elf crease brush and
I'm just going to be blending this area
out I probably will get quite a bit of
fallout from this but this is just a
nice small blending brush so hopefully
we won't take that color too high we
just want it blended so that's kind of
the difference we're still gonna put
some of that orange in but we just want
to blend it and we'll probably have to
deepen up the lid a little bit but this
is just going to give a little bit more
of the look that I want I like the way
that looks I'm just going to be going
back in and putting the blue on the lid
so we don't lose any of that
pigmentation I feel pretty happy with
where we're at for that I'm gonna just
sweep any more powder out from
underneath my eyes this shade is very
chunky lots of glitter I don't love that
about it I wish it was just a really
pretty like shimmer foiled shade now
we're gonna get to work on deepening up
the outer corner with the brow I don't
want to go into the black for this look
so we're just going to deepen this up
and blend into the blue and then we will
probably go back over the outside edge
with that orange shade that we used
earlier to blend out
I just scratched my lid and you can see
how much fallout is in this inner corner
oh my gosh all right let's just move on
to the lower lash line because I'm done
um I'm gonna move on to this orange The
Naked color and I'm going to be putting
this all on the lower lash line and
smudging it into the outer part of the
eye where that Brown is I brought out
this liner pencil from Clarins because I
wanted to just really accentuate the
orange down here so I'm gonna be putting
this down and smudging it out with this
much around the other end of this pencil
I think that's really pretty I feel like
this is a look I would have done but
again the copper would have been on the
top and the blue would have been on the
bottom so I think it's kind of fun to do
something different or just I mean make
it the opposite I'm gonna try to remove
as much as I can of this blue with just
a q-tip I mean the blue is just
everywhere and I'm gonna use a little
bit of concealer to try to just brighten
up that area before we go in with the
inner corner because I want to give it
the best chance possible to look as good
as possible
that helped only the littlest bit but
we're gonna go in with the last part of
the shadow I'm going in with the shade
charmer and we're gonna be putting that
on the inner corner as the highlight to
finish off the eye look I'm gonna go in
and I'm going to put white on my
waterline I'm going to put Mac's coaster
each on my top waterline which is called
the tight line and then I'm gonna go in
with a mascara from Urban Decay and
perversion and then I'll be back and
I'll let you know what I have on my face
and we'll finish up this look with the
lips all right so here's a look at the
finished eye look I did have a little
bit of issues with my mascara getting on
my eyelid so I tried fixing that so
hopefully that's not too messed up
yeah let's zoom out and I will show you
the rest of the face and the finish
face and put all right so we're zoomed
out let me show you what I use on my
face for bronzer I use the Estee Lauder
bronze goddess bronzer I'm a little tan
today I do really love that for blush I
use the ijen minerals because it's a
peachy blush and that's what I'm gonna
go with the lip as well so I thought
that would work nice with the oranges
and the blues and then for highlight I
went in with the Becca cosmetics
moonstone because I want to try to wear
this and the golden undertones of this I
thought would work nice with the warmth
of the orange for my lip today I'm going
in with a liquid lipstick from covergirl
I was lucky enough to get such an insane
PR package from them so I have a lot of
these and if you guys want me to do I
was thinking about doing like a swatch
video because it's just so many I don't
think it's possible to like review them
all but at least I can get out swatches
since I think I have all the colors yeah
so let me know if you would like that
I'm thinking about like if I ever happen
to get PR where it's a lot of the
collection or all of the collection at
least doing swatches if I can't get a
full on review will give out information
so you guys can make decisions let me
know we think anyway this is the shade
champagne showers and it's a nudie warm
nude color and I thought it would look
nice with this lip
all right so that is the final look with
the lift done and everything so far it's
not my favorite pallet like you know
we'll see though as we keep creating
looks I don't think I'm gonna do
anything more at that blue though cuz I
just it gets everywhere and I think I'm
gonna film my second look today as well
and we'll see if it's going to stain I
have a feeling it might but fingers
crossed it doesn't if it does I'll let
you know but let's move on to look
number two
all right guys what's up we are moving
on to look at number Q just so you guys
know I did not have staining with this
like nothing notable so that was good I
really was scared about it but we were a
okay so starting out today I'm gonna be
setting my lid like normal something I'm
realizing as I'm trying to create looks
with this is that I don't know it's just
a very orange look like no matter what
you do I feel like you're gonna probably
get some version of an orange look which
is fine it's just you know something
that makes it difficult if you're just
trying to use this palette and not work
from anything else so for a transition
this is really the only transition for
my skin tone in here so we're going in
with the orange shade which again is
Nike and we're just going to be laying
down a light transition I'm doing a look
using this pink all over the lid I might
use this in the outer V black just smoke
out the lash line and then I'm gonna be
using us in the crease as well so I love
pink so I'm excited for this look I
think it'll look cool I kind of thought
about doing this with a piece of tape
but I forgot that you don't want to do
your makeup and then put the tape down
so we have to scratch the tape portion
of this but that would be a really cool
idea we're just gonna go a little bit
more grungy with the pink I think today
to try to switch it up from some of the
other pink looks that I do we'll see
what we come up with for the next color
we're going in with the magenta this is
the shade BFF that blue is kind of like
all over the place but we're just gonna
be buffing this into the crease and just
starting to work in that pink color this
one although in the pan it looks pretty
deep I've learned is not nearly as you
as you think or you can definitely build
it up a little bit so we're going to put
that a little bit lower than that orange
shade
I really wish there was like a mid-tone
brown shade in here something lighter
than this but not nearly as warm as that
so you could do some more neutral looks
but I didn't create this so I guess I
can't really complain I think we're
gonna move on to the lid already I'm
gonna be using the NYX glitter glue I
just want to give this pallet the best
chance it can to really pack a punch on
the lid so I'm going to be putting this
all over the entire lid space in
preparation for the shimmer shades are
going to be using on each half of the
lid I'm going to be taking a flat shader
brush this one's like from the Naked 2
palette I'm gonna be spraying it with my
spray and I'm gonna go into the lighter
shade first so this one here which is
the shade Bay we're gonna be putting
that on the inner portion of the eye and
I'm carrying that over 2/3 of the lid
and even a little bit farther because we
can always blend that other shade on top
of here so there isn't any like weird
pickup between the colors and by weird
pickup between the colors I'm talking
about you know a line of demarcation
because we've put down that base I don't
want it to pick up more pigmented in one
area and not in another so I'm going to
kind of cover all the glue with this
first pink shade and this I feel like
looks so much more pink on than it does
in the pan for whatever reason at least
to me what you're not mad about but I
definitely think I don't know it just
looks more pink to me I'm gonna switch
over to the other side of this brush and
I'm gonna go in with the BFF shade and
we're just going to blend this front
portion a little bit I have to say I
don't wanna leave this I don't like
these shades I'm gonna put this on my
lid with my finger next I'm gonna go in
with the darker shade this is the shade
ATL and I'm just going to be putting
this in the outer portion of the eye and
just building up some depth in that area
I don't know how well this is gonna work
since it is a shimmer but hopefully we
can at least get a little bit of a
change over I'm getting a ton of Fallout
though okay I swept it away but what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna add quite a bit of
powder under my
I to help with fallout I don't normally
do this but we're gonna try it out back
to blending we're gonna take a Stamper
kind of brush and see if we can stamp
this color in that outer corner I'm just
gonna blend out a little bit between
that darker shade and this one we're
kind of mixing them just so we can get a
nice transition out here there's
definitely a difference between the
inside and the outside though which is
what I was looking for and I'm going to
use my finger just to bring home as much
pigmentation in that outer corner as I
can this is like one of my favorite
textures of the palette so far I think
this one would look really pretty all
over the lid so maybe I'll do a look
with that because it is really it seems
the most like buttery and metallic
without being like flaky and weird next
I'm going to be taking a liner and
smudging it all on my top lashline and
we're gonna smudge it out with the black
and the palette so um yeah you can go
kind of messy
all that's still not set quite I'm gonna
smudge it out with a brush and I did not
bring that liner too far in on the inner
corner I'm gonna try to sweep away this
powder whoa kind of worked y'all I
realized I probably should have added
the black before I did that but I did it
so we're gonna take the black in this
like smudger brush and we're just going
to really work that into the lash line
and just smudge out any black color this
has so much black glitter in it and I
hate it okay
so the line there's really intense but
there's like glitter getting into my
eyes and it's really irritating them so
it'd be really really careful guys I
honored the Chinese like wing but not
really I'm looking very like hunk rug
for under the eye today I'm just gonna
smudge some of this darker color on the
outer portion and keep it out there
and then I'm also gonna smudge a little
bit of that black on that same smudger
brush we use just on that seriously the
outer portion guys I want to add a
little bit more of this pink punch so
I'm going to go in with this color BAE
sorry my voice is cracking and just kind
of punch it in in that outer corner I'm
Joe I did extend the wing a little bit
just with the shadow I hope I'm in focus
this whole time I just realized I just
want it pretty minimal like especially
for me I tend to go like along with the
wing so I'm kind of keeping it short and
stubby instead of making it too long out
there and then I'm just gonna buff out
the lower lash line with a mix of these
two just wear that black is I'm gonna go
in and tightline on my top lash line I'm
gonna put some white on my bottom lash
line especially on the inner portion but
probably a little bit on the outer
portion too we'll see and then for
mascara I'm using my perversion and then
I will be back and we'll finish up the
lips and finish off this look alright so
this is the final I look the liner got a
bit more like thick and smudgy than I
thought it was gonna get but I still
really like this look definitely a
little bit out of my comfort zone if you
like a little rocker but I think it
looks really pretty it really brings out
my blue eyes so but I'm gonna zoom it
out so I can finish up the lip and tell
you guys what I'm wearing on the rest of
my face so for my face for bronzer today
I'm using the Wet n Wild photo focus
pressed powder but this is in the shade
golden tan and I just have it on my
perimeter I don't have any cream bronze
or anything else on for my cheeks I'm
using my Clinique cheek pop in the shade
nude I just wanted something pretty
neutral since I knew I was gonna go a
little bit darker with this look and
then for my highlight I'm using the
laura geller baked highlighter in golden
rose I knew this had like a rosy
undertone I knew I was gonna try to work
with the Pink's but yeah I mean it's
just kind of subtle it's not anything
too stark or anything I'm actually gonna
add this to the inner corner of my eye
just to add the tiniest bit I'm not
gonna like foil it or anything and you
know what I'm gonna add a little under
the brow to for a lips today didn't know
what I wanted to do I
add some like darker colors but since my
eye like so Drecker I really don't want
to go dark so I'm gonna try the
covergirl katie-cat gloss and this is in
the shade cantaloupe it's like a nude
with a golden sheen to it this is a
pretty thick gloss but yeah guys that's
the final look I hope you guys enjoyed
this one I think this is my favorite so
far out of the two that I've done it's
more me I like the cat eye I like that
it's a little bit more chunky and like
closer into my eye than my normal like
really long ones I think it really suits
my eye shape a little bit more than I
normally do so I might have to play
around with that a little bit more but
I'm really enjoying it I hope you guys
liked it and I will see you in the next
one
hi guys what's up we're moving on to
look number three I do want to say I
went back and looked at footage from the
first look the blue one well I don't
know I just that look is not my favorite
for sure out of all the looks I've done
so I just don't like that blue pillar at
all so anyway for today's look I'm going
to be setting my lid like normal and I'm
gonna go with a more classic look
because I want to use this shade we
haven't used that yet I'm gonna use this
one that one maybe a little bit of black
but then I think we're pretty close to
using all the colors except for these
two and those will be in my final look
so yeah I'm happy to have used
everything in here I feel like
everything's kind of gotten into
spotlight so now that that's set again
we're going into Nicki for our
transition I want to do this lightly cuz
I don't really want too much of the
orange just a little bit of warmth if
that makes sense coming through so I'm
just blending this lightly into the
crease
and I want to make sure that I do have
like a transition here I just have such
hooded eyes I think I've realized that I
do like having product here because if
not you just see no color on my lid and
I think that's one of the reasons I
don't like that blue look so much is
because like seriously if my eyes are
open you cannot see the blue at all that
none of it comes above my natural crease
and so when I actually put product here
you can see it with my eyes closed and
that's something I like I want people to
see oh my I shadow that I work really
hard to put on my eyeballs I'm gonna try
to gently buff some of the brown color
which is called duet into the crease as
well and we're gonna keep this on the
outer crease and just kind of build up
this as a transition as well and this
will be the main color on the outside
but I'm trying to put it in as lightly
as possible because again we don't
really have any other colors to work
with in the crease besides more bright
colors and I'm trying to keep this
neutral today
I can't tell and decide if I think this
color blends nicely or I don't like
sometimes I'm like oh it blends really
nice and other times I'm like no it
doesn't so I feel good about the
transition now I think I'm gonna go over
though with the orange just to buff out
anything the reason that I haven't
really been using this shade is because
I did use that in my boxycharm unboxing
and I just don't really love it so I
don't really want to put it all over the
lid again just I guess if you are
wondering but anyway now we're going
into the dark color again but we're
going to be keeping this on the outer
portion of the eye and deepening up that
area
I definitely won't say this color
definitely depends up so that's nice you
know you can get the actual depth from
it I feel pretty good about that so I'm
gonna go in with my finger I've been
using a lot of like wet brushes and
whatnot and I kind of just want to see
what putting this shade on with my
fingers gonna look like and it's just
like II I feel like that's like the
theme of all of these I do like the way
this looks so I think it's really pretty
I have decided though that I'm going to
wet my brush and just see if we can get
a bit more of a metallic sheen going
with that color so that's it with a
little bit of build up I went in with my
brush and then I went back in with my
finger after I already have laid stuff
down with the brush and I think that
gave the best outcome like I think it
looks pretty I'm just rubbing away any
fallout I'm gonna go back in with this
brush and the brown which is do it and
just kind of make sure we have a nice
blend but I think it looks pretty good I
don't want to mess with it too too much
under the eyes I'm going in with the
other side of that brush and I'm going
to take naked or Nicki and I'm just
going to smudge that underneath and I'm
kind of bringing it into the brown back
here and smudging that if I can and then
I'm going to take the tiniest amount of
duet and just kind of smudge it on the
back corner just so they meld into each
other so this is the look so far I'm
gonna go in with mascara I'm going to
line my tight line and then I think I
might line my waterline of white I'm not
sure I might keep it more grungy we'll
see and I will be back and we'll finish
up the lip all right Kay so this is a
look so far with mascara and liner and
everything I did go in with the white
liner on the waterline just a little bit
but let's move on to lips and then I'll
show you guys when I'm wearing on the
rest of my face this this is the color
dolly I guess I should tell you I just
wanted to do something neutral and that
I know I love and then just let you guys
know what I'm wearing on the rest of my
face it's actually all from one palette
this is from Laura Geller and it's the
sunset glow contour bronze highlight and
blush palette I use the bronzer the
blush and the highlighter in this and I
like it's nice just like a one and done
it's all kind of shimmery and summery
but it's pretty nice this is one of my
favorite looks that I've done I really
like the last look the pink one I think
it's kind of rocker and fun and
something a little bit out of my comfort
zone and so is this this is definitely a
little bit deeper than I normally go and
I think that's something I'm realizing
with this palette you see there you can
go like colorful or for me deeper there
isn't just like you know cuz the orange
is the lightest shade in here and so if
you use that and really build it up then
you have an orange eye shadow you know
which isn't bad I'm just saying for
versatility with this palette to me it's
becoming a little bit difficult to
create different looks but I think this
one's super pretty
I wish the quality of this shade the
bronze one or golden one Alliance is
what it's called was a little bit nicer
like quality wise but I think the look
overall is really beautiful I feel
really pretty and it makes me want to
film a video
in this look so I think I'm gonna try to
do that and then I'm gonna come at you
with the fourth look so I hope you guys
enjoy it's gonna be a little bit more
simple but maybe a bold lip I don't
really know where I'm going with it
we'll see and I'll see you and look
number four all right hi guys we're onto
the final look and really excited that
we're almost done okay so I am going to
be focusing on these two colors today I
might throw in some of these on the
bottom I don't know more than anything I
want to use these two shades because I
haven't in this set of video so I'm
going to be setting my primer with the
cream shade which is called perfect to
start out I'm going to be going in with
the shade Belle and we're going to be
putting that into the crease area I just
want to build up a fun pink look I guess
I don't know this is gonna be kind of
similar to the look I did where I have
the peach on the lid and I had kind of
like a darker more purpley pink on the
bottom I feel like it's gonna look kind
of similar to that so I guess it works
out since I deleted that freaking
tutorial on accident I guess we'll get a
similar look here and I am being a bit
messy with this since we're going in
with the shade nuts which is like the
same freakin color I'm being kind of
messy and blending it down a bit now I'm
gonna go in with my finger and just put
the shade squad all over my lid just
with my finger it's fine it's a little
powdery I honestly don't think there's
gonna be much of like a metallic sheen
if I wet the brush and use that shadow
so I'm just going to stick with the way
that it is using it with my finger on
the lid and then I'm just going to make
sure I have a nice peach going up pretty
high I do have some fallout here from
these shadows which I am NOT surprised
at they're super powdery
I'm gonna sweep away some of that powder
and I think that's all I'm gonna do for
the lids this one's gonna be pretty
simple I just wanted to do also a
variation when it comes to depth like I
wanted something that was just a little
bit more everyday and not so dark or
smoky or like a look you know what I
mean although it's going to be like
pinky tone so it's still gonna be a bit
of a look underneath I'm gonna go back
in with Belle and I'm gonna put that
underneath the eyes I don't know I might
not even I might just keep it this light
honestly I know this isn't like a big
deal but this is a way I potentially
would wear this palette I think I'm
gonna take a little bit of this shade
which is a TL and I'm gonna put that on
the bottom outer edge and I'm gonna take
a little bit of that and just put it on
the outer corner just the tiniest bit
and don't worry it's hard to build up so
you'll only put a little bit and this is
completely rubbing off the lid shape
that we have so we'll have to reapply
that I just I really hate this bow once
again I'm brushing away fall out and I'm
gonna try to fix the lid with my finger
I'm basically just gonna cover the whole
lid again I mean I can't see this even
staying for a long period of time so
keep that in mind but there is just so
much betting fallout I hate this path so
much I really just like this palette
it's just like really patchy over here
so I don't know really how to fix it
I'm scared to add more stuff on I added
this pink I didn't even tell you guys
this is the shade BFF to the outer
corners just to try to save my eye look
but I just kind of feel like nothing can
save this that's like a mix of Fallout I
don't even know I don't even know what
that is okay
I'm stop complaining and just fix it and
move on I'm going in with powder to try
to clean up the fallout because there's
just so much everywhere and I'm hoping
it'll sweep away and also just brighten
up the under-eye area and I think it
helped quite a bit I don't want to touch
it too much more I feel like I fix some
of the weirdness going on so we're just
going to I'm just going to deepen up the
underneath my eye with that BFF just to
kind of try that color in a little more
and then I'm bringing some of the orange
into the inner part of the eye just so
you guys know I did deep enough the pink
a little bit and I'm going in and just
fixing the lid and making sure that
still pops I am going to add a little
bit of the shade charmer under my brow
bone just the Chinese bit it just has a
bit of a sheen and I thought that'd be
nice I'm also gonna add it to the inner
corner just for some brightness even
though it's a little bit dark from my
inner court we're gonna try I think for
this look today I'm gonna keep it really
soft so I'm just going in with a white
liner on the tight line and then I'm
just gonna put mascara on and I will be
back to show you trying to look and
we'll do lips so this is the final look
I wanna show you guys a close-up I
forgot to do that on the last one but
let's zoom out though so I can put my
lip on and finish this look to finish
this look off for lips I'm going in with
the Becca this is part of that light
chasers it came out with those
highlighters it's champagne dream
flashes Bellini oh I just wanted to keep
it again kind of light just kind of like
a nudie type of situation for my face
I'm wearing the same laura geller thing
because it's the same day I realized
that if I want to film these videos more
often for you guys I have to film
multiple looks in a day so that's what
I've been trying to do overall I thought
I'd give a few thoughts on this look and
also just the palette in general I like
the way this look ended up turning out
and that's how I feel like most of my
looks have been
I hated the process but in the end like
it looks pretty I would say my favorite
look and the one that was easiest to do
when I got performed the best was the
third look with the like gold antique
gold and the brown I thought that one
was really pretty and I didn't have very
many issues when it came to fallout and
all of these other things this palette
is just insanely powdery I just don't I
don't like it I don't like this palette
at all it's very disappointing to me I
think the cream shade is fine naked is
fine all of the metallo
shades and the shimmer shaped in here I
feel like you have to use your fingers
or a setting spray and a glitter glue
and even then they still don't have that
shine that so many other powders do the
shade that I have on my lit today it's
just so powdery and it won't stay on
when you blend anything around it I find
that because these are powdery and also
a lot of them have like chunks in them
they're very chunky and glittery that
irritated my eyes as I did my makeup and
that is not something that I'm used to
and something that is just not worth it
to me another thing I found interesting
is that BFF is not powdery like the rest
of them and I find that you can't get
the pigmentation out of that you still
fall out though so don't worry about
that I just hate this palette like this
is one that I feel like color wise
inspires me and maybe was put together
with the colors in mind but quality wise
it doesn't work and even practicality of
these colors in the palette don't work
to make a bunch of different looks I
really feel like it's the same look over
and over because so many of the shades
are so similar I wish they had
differentiated them a little bit I find
all three of these look very similar on
the eye even this one is just like
slightly more pink but honestly very
very similar and so there was definitely
some room to play with some different
color variations I hate that this black
has shimmer in it like there are just so
many issues this I mean it should have
been great it wasn't I'm really
disappointed I really wanted this
palette to work it was something I was
super excited about in my boxycharm but
overall I feel like I have colors in my
collection that I could get the looks
that I created and I just think this is
great for color inspiration not for the
palette itself so yeah few thoughts
there after using it I hate that blue in
it too I freaking hate that color it's
chunky it hurt my eyes it just isn't
pretty it's not pretty so I hope you
guys enjoyed though let me know if you
like the palette has it been working out
for you do you enjoy the look so you've
been creating with it I would love to
know if you've had a different
experience with it also let me know your
favorite look was down below but other
than that I will see you in the next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
