random stuff that I've been buying
recently so it's gonna be a haul video I
have some candles they have some like
home goods I have some shoes just really
random just stuff that I thought you
guys I enjoy looking at and that I'm
excited that I bought so we're gonna
start off with candles this one here I
got at target this is the parent mint
candle from pure natural and Chesapeake
Bay it smells really good I'm usually
just a bath and bodyworks candle girl so
I was surprised that I liked this so
much at the store and we had a lot of
gift cards so even though I don't need
any more candles and I'm gonna have a
candle collection video coming up I
thought I have to get this one it just
smells so so good and I'm excited to try
out something that is about the body
works because I was looking at the
candles there and they have ones that
are like five dollars not only about the
body works as good I guess but on that
note I have three bath and bodyworks
candles this one is the Copacabana beach
I love this candle is in my februari
favorites it smells so good it's my
favorite candle that I have here it's
the best I love it it's perfect for
summer it's just beautiful go and smell
this it's you will love it if you love
coconut and you love a good man said
this combines both of them and it just
smells so absolutely wonderful love that
camera i also got Tiki Beach this one's
one of my favorites I've burnt through a
couple of these I also have it in the
wallflower this one is also just a very
kokanee it smells like a pina colada
like exactly like a pina colada it says
ascent as warm as sunrise a luxurious
blend of vanilla musk orchids and
toasted coconut it's wonderful to so I
mean if you like coconut both of these
candles this one I Copacabana beach
would be perfect for you definitely go
check those out and then i also got
papaya sunrise i had a coupon for 10 off
of 30 and so I needed one more to get up
to 30 because they were 24 24 and so
this is the other one I picked out this
melz really nice again this is kind of
just a fruity fun summer scent I'm I
don't recommend this one as much as
I think it still smells wonderful do not
get me wrong obviously I bought it but
the ones i really recommend our Tiki
Beach in Copacabana but this one just
smells good if you like papaya if you
like that just really nice fruity
summary tropical scent this one would be
perfect for you while at target I got
this thing this is just like a candle
holder and it is metal and then these
are like little pin holes that have been
poked through it I thought the design on
this was just so beautiful and it looks
great once you put I've been burning my
big like my big bath and bodyworks
candles they fit in here which is
wonderful and I've been burning my
candles in here and at night it just
illuminates through the design and it's
just beautiful I really like this this I
think was fifteen dollars but I bought
it again with our wedding gift card so I
think it's just wonderful I'm really got
I got this i've been trying not to buy
too many just random things for the
house and i think this one was a good
purchase instead of like a wine i'll
regret later i just i think it's really
beautiful it just kind of live-ins up
the space and i like that it it makes
the light look different than if it's
just burning so definitely check that
out at target that's from target if you
can hear that I mean I like that the
plans look nice around my house but I
also want to be so mad at these people
the rest of the stuff I all got from
Ross which is just like a discount store
like a TJ maxx but it's kind of a little
bit cheaper than that this I got there
it is so cute it's a little makeup bag
and it's adorable it says love on it it
is from kenneth cole reaction and this
was i think it was 12 99 I don't see the
rosslyn I'm pretty sure this is 1299
originally 25 I love how big this is
it's great for traveling
like I can see him walking go away go
away no one likes you this is great for
traveling and I would also put this in
my person to spit everything in it I
just love the size of it I love the size
of it and I just think it's super cute
it's so cute I had to get it I had to
get it and then I was like cute little
pink detailing to with the zipper and
stuff mmm adorable love it I got to kind
of like home decor ones I had to like
barely fit this in my video but this is
just like a box that says box number one
it's just has handles and stuff really
cute and I wanted to use this for so I
do have quite a bit of empty so
hopefully I'll film that soon it's just
a cute way to store them and doesn't
look so trashy and I think it's really
cute and if I don't want to use for
empties I can use it for something else
back there we have like all ikea storage
little squares so i can put it in there
or whatever if i decide not to use it
for empties at any point but i think
that's just so cute it was on clearance
for 999 and I thought that was a good
deal for storage especially since it
wasn't just generic I had a cute print
on it and there's like detailing at the
bottom this is similar to the other one
this is actually like a metal container
and it has like little handles with rope
and stuff it says flowers on it flowers
in garden this i just got for the same
purpose as that one down that's done for
empties but just to store stuff and just
make it cute so if we put like a bunch
of cables or electronic stuff in here
it's gonna look cuter than if it was
just in a cardboard box or all sprawled
out everywhere I just really wanted to
kind of get our storage better and on
top of that those we'll both look really
cute in our house and I just I really
couldn't resist swimmer in the store I
think that I was 11 99 I just thought
they were gonna both be really durable
as well since their wood and metal and
that they're gonna last us a long time
like an investment for future storage I
got two pairs of shoes now that I'm
starting makeup school I have to work
closed toed shoes which is like the
worst thing ever for me I'm a sandal
girl my feet need space they need to
spread out it's definitely been a
struggle for me but we
Ross and I left in the shoe section and
I found two pairs of shoes I think will
work really well for me so this pair
here this is a cynic is the cynic brand
and these are just super cute they're
kind of like a brown with polka dot and
I just really like them this part right
here is like stretchy it has like an
elastic thing here there's nothing to
like tie them with I just think they're
adorable and I thought I can maybe where
these ones these closed toed shoes these
might work for me these came out to 1799
there originally I don't know originally
they say sixty dollars which we went
into the next door and I believe it
these are really lightweight if they
have like the gushy bottom so hopefully
my feet will just feel nice and
comfortable and what I love most about
them is they are really wide here I have
wide feet and part of the reason I don't
like to wear closed toed shoes is
because I just they just are so tight on
them and they just hurt them but I'm
have a feeling these are going to be
really great and wide and also adorable
like how adorable are those like some
shorts on the beach I'm or at makeup
school but they're so cute i really like
these the other pair of shoes are these
ones these were also at Ross these are
1299 they are from the brand dirty
laundry they're really cute really basic
just grey tennis shoes they kind of come
up compared to like I feel like other
tennis shoes I've seen not as far and
they have a really wide mouth again here
so I thought they'd be really
comfortable I did wear them yesterday to
school and they felt really great i was
actually really surprised how much my
feet enjoyed wearing these and that they
didn't hurt I guess I think that's great
too good finds for shoes all at both
under twenty dollars a piece like can't
beat that and when we were on target i
was looking at the shoes i didn't find
anything I really loved there so I was
glad that I found some things that these
are just lighter they just don't have as
much material and they're just kind of a
good transition shoe from sandals oh let
me show you the other ones I got I got
other shoes hello I almost I almost
forgot I got these I love them they are
like birkenstock Arizona's but instead
they're from Target and they were only
twenty-five dollars they're so cute
they're so cute like it's um ah I can't
believe I almost forgot
then um but yeah I've been wearing these
not at school but um they're just cute I
kind of look like I have Hobbit feet
because I do have a big shoe but
definitely check these out if you've
been looking for Birkenstocks they have
them in other colors and yeah they just
look so cute I'm into these these are
like a love it or hate it you might not
like them but check him out and i think
that's it guys it's not a ton of stuff
but I thought it was enough to show you
guys and just let you know what I've
been buying but I will see you guys in
my next video it all sounds the same
every time I say bye it sounds the same
peace out homies I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
