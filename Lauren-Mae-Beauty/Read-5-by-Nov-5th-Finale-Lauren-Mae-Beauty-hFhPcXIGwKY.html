Lauren this is going to be my finale
video for my read 5 by November fifth
this was a clap here with a couple other
women on youtube so i will leave them
all listed down below it was started by
lorraine and i just want to say thank
you so much lorraine for contacting me
and asking me to be a part of this club
i'm really grateful to you for getting
me kick started in reading and
rediscovering my love of reading which
has been really fun and awesome Plus
this is my first club ever so it just
felt really nice to be included and to
be asked by you to be in this so thank
you so much but let's get into it i am
wearing my glasses today I just need to
be able to see I'm just really chilled
out today my hair is like crazy and so I
put this thing on it I wanted to be cold
enough to wear this but it's definitely
not cold enough to wear this it looks
really cute in the video and it is super
cute so anyway that has nothing to do
with this let's talk about my finished
five so i did finish five books i read
five books in the about five months i
think that we had to finish them we
started this project way back in july i
think this is a lot of project and I'm
grateful for that because I was able to
kind of like slack off at the beginning
and really find out what works for me
toward the end and actually completed
but I will say that the five books i
finished are entirely different than the
original books i showed in my intro so
i'll leave all my original videos down
below in the description definitely
check them out if you want so let's get
into the books i finish you guys all
know i finished this book this is report
by myself by gregory boulier i did not
enjoy this again that video will be
listed down below where i kind of review
it in that video i gave it three stars I
kind of retract that and give it like
two and a half or even two I did create
a goodreads account and on there a three
star is like it was good and I'm like
mmm I don't know if I think this was
good and I was reading a lot of the
other reviews on Goodreads just because
I felt kind of crazy for not liking it
and a lot of other people share very
similar complaints of me so I feel like
okay I'm not like crazy yeah i kinda I
kind of give it two stars cuz I did not
I did not enjoy it I don't think it's a
bad book but I personally did not enjoy
it and I don't really recommend
to anyone so this is like a memoir about
this man's life he's French he has like
a suicidal mom but his mom and dad are
kind of like swingers like it seems like
really interesting and like it'd be
super good and kind of juicy and kind of
whatever but no it wasn't so the rest of
the books that I actually finished are
all on audible I've discovered that i
really enjoyed audible and that is one
of the easiest ways for me to actually
get reading done although I'm not
physically reading I'm still enjoying a
story how it was written and you know I
have to do what works for me so one of
the books they finish was the girl on
the train I really enjoyed this book me
in xamarin together which was another
thing I've mentioned throughout this and
it's just nice to have a shared
enjoyment of a book through an audiobook
so we really enjoyed that it's really
great murder mystery whodunit you're
questioning everything it's really good
I did see the movie and it's not nearly
as good like I was very disappointed in
the movie so I really enjoyed that book
two of the other books that I read our
part of the 50 shades of grey trilogy so
I read Fifty Shades of Grey and then
fifty shades darker i think is what it's
called I really am enjoying that I'm on
the third book now I'm on like chapter
19 I really have enjoyed this series to
me it's just kind of it's hard because
it's like I just like the story I want
to know more I like their relationship
and I totally bought into that but I
don't think the writing's good I feel
like a lot of a super repetitive like
literally the same phrases like I almost
want to like keyword find if I had the
Buckeye link in a word document and
keyword find i'm telling you you would
find like the exact same phrases
throughout the trilogy so many times but
i still enjoyed it there's something
about it that I do really like oh sorry
about my phone so I do suggest it but
it's definitely not for everyone
obviously but I've been enjoying that so
that's four books down so that's four
and then the fifth book that I did
finish sadly was not a wolf at the table
but I did finish fear and loathing in
las vegas with Sam we took a couple
different road trips this last month and
we were able to read it in the car and
that was really enjoyable I really liked
that book i feel like the narrator's on
that book also did just like such a
great job and there's something about
out the way it's written that is just
hilarious like hunters Thompson will say
phrases that you almost think don't make
sense but when you hear them they you
totally get the idea of what's happening
even though it almost doesn't make sense
I don't have an example so I'm sorry but
I definitely suggest the book I have
seen the movie but it was so long ago
that I think I want to watch it again
and then recently me and Sam we took
like a day trip to Vegas even though the
biggest was like four hours away we just
drove to Vegas for a couple hours and
then came back and we kind of like took
a tour of the different places like went
to the Flamingo we went to Circus Circus
and that was just kind of fun I don't
know Vegas is on our mind probably
because of that book i did enjoy that I
would give that book I'd probably give
it four stars I really did enjoy it so
technically again I did read the five
books I feel like seriously all those
books are read in October like almost
all of them were read at the end of
September through October so I really
wish that I had read more cuz i just
would have had more bucks done i thought
i would mention though i did read more
of a wolf at the table by Agustin
burrows and i am on page 114 right now
so I definitely have read more I need to
finish this it's just easier for me to
be in the car listening to a book or
walking around doing stuff while I'm
listening to a bug whereas I have to
like sit down and read this and I find
that I just get distracted easily by
YouTube or all these other things that's
something I need to work on is like
trying to just like not be as distracted
it's kind of hard though because I post
on YouTube and I post on Instagram often
um so I feel like I'm kind of consumed
in social media a lot and I find that
that is really what to tracks me away
from reading so I need to work on that
anyway I really enjoyed this and in
general just enjoyed the project I've
definitely learned a few things about me
so these are just some thoughts like
overall on myself and reading and
whatnot I do want to continue reading
projects on my channel so i am
participating in nonfiction november
which is started by a book all of here
on youtube and so if you haven't seen
that video i'll leave a link down below
so you guys can check out my new project
i don't know i just really been enjoying
books and being immersed in that world
which is very similar to movies but
different i don't know it's something
different about it there's just
much more detail I can go into a book
then can go into a movie I feel like I
will probably try to finish this in
nonfiction November again it is a memoir
about his life so it is nonfiction
because this will be a nice compliment
to nonfiction november and i just
learned so much about myself and really
reflected back on like what i enjoy and
i cannot pick books beforehand obviously
I straight so much from the original
list if you watch that first video I
only read two of the books and really
only finished one and got in to like
halfway into another one I'm definitely
someone that like I want to read what i
want to read what i want to read it i'm
very almost impulsive like I just if I
wanted I want to watch it right now I
want to see it right now I want to read
it right now if I want to watch The
Blair Witch like I want to watch in the
next three days and then you know I'm
over it we watched the little rich for
halloween so yeah I just learned a lot
about myself and just good habit to have
bad habit to have things i want to
change and I really like that so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
gonna film just a couple videos today
not as many as normal just because like
I really look kind of crazy and like
it's kind of cute crazy but it's still a
little crazy so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I hope that if you guys
joined on in this challenge at you did
well and that you've read more and
that's everything i'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
