Lauren I'm really excited to be bringing
you this video because this is a collab
video I was asked by lorraine to
basically do a project pan but for books
so we are trying to read five books by
the fifth of november which is bonfire
night in the UK you guys know that one
of my goals this year was to read more
books I wanted to originally read six
and then I got all excited and was like
I'm doubling it and I want to go for 12
and I have already read four books this
year which I'm very proud of but I gotta
step it up if I want to hit 12 by the
end of the year so I thought this was
such a great way to stay motivated
myself to read to help keep other people
motivated to read and just kind of have
community and clubs so I will leave
everyone link down below i'm so excited
there are six other women besides me
including Lorraine there's amber a free
to be was Julia there are also two
channels that are new to me Jessica and
Kelly so please check them out down
below go show them some love and help
support us on reading these books and I
also challenge you guys to kind of join
in or if reading is something that
you've wanted to do more this year maybe
kind of read along side with us and
challenge yourself to read some books
set aside some time for yourself each
day or each week to just have something
other than screens and all these are
their distractions in your life and sit
down and read a book so I think that's
everything so let's get into the books
that I chose I'm not gonna lie I kind of
cheated I picked more than five because
I just couldn't decide and I didn't want
to be stuck with like only five books so
I picked a couple more than five and
then out of those books I want to read
five of them by the fifth so holy out to
Kayla Rayne sorry I was going through my
books and I just couldn't only pick five
so i decided to throw a few more in and
justify it that way hopefully that's
okay the first book i want to read in
this project is the lumen a or the
illuminate files i believe it's the
first book out of a trilogy i want to
say and this is by
me kaufman and jay kristoff I did
already start reading this I'm on page
like 50 which is nothing compared to how
big this is I need to like here let's
make this a little more centered maybe I
picked out this book because I just
started watching booktube and i heard a
couple people mention this and the thing
that really drew me into it was the fact
that this is all comprised of like case
files on if you can see that there but
it's not like a normal book it's like a
case file that you're reading through so
i just thought that sounded so
interesting and so fun and different I
didn't realize that this is like a young
adult book which I'm personally if I'm
gonna go young adult I like to go a
little more like dramatic they're
suicidal they're doing drugs there on
the streets that's just what I like to
read if I'm gonna go ahead and young
adult and um this is not like that this
is kind of like sci-fi adventure ii like
in space so i want to get through this
definitely not what I was expecting when
I like just first ordered it it's just
cuz I didn't do enough research but not
saying anything bad about it I'd like to
get through it and then kind of for my
thoughts on it baby I'll really like it
cuz i do i like i like a lot of
different stuff you know I'm the girl
that loves you know 2001 a Space Odyssey
but also watched all gossip girls so I
like a lot of stuff but this is the
first one let's just move on this is the
first one I don't have the cover on it
because I hate like dust sleeves or
whatever they're called adjust I just am
going to ruin them so anyway that is the
first book illuminate I've started a few
of these books so yeah that's part of
the reason i also picked a couple
because that one I am already 50 pages
in and this one I'm a little bit into
I'm about I would say a little less than
a third in so this is the book snoop I
halt this in a book haul that I've done
I've only done one book haul I'll leave
a link down below but I got this at a
thrift store and I just thought it was
so interesting it was written by Sam
Gosling who has a PhD and basically like
snooping the book talks about how you
can look at peoples items and kind of
determine things about them things
they'd like things they don't their
political beliefs just a bunch of things
I'm just by looking at let's say their
office or their deaths we're just
personal spaces of theirs I have enjoyed
this so far i will say that girl i must
be pretty good Snoop because all of this
is like yeah duh yeah if you're reading
a bumper sticker and it's very liberal
than they might you know be a Democrat
but they also could have got that car
second hand and it's stuck on there from
someone else and they didn't change it
which what does that say about them if
they will keep a political view on their
car that isn't theirs or that was just
someone else's so I don't know I feel
like I already think that way so it
wasn't like so far it hasn't been like
mind-blowing it's just been like okay I
can dig that okay I believe that I got
you but I want to finish this and get
all the way through it and pass it on to
my mom I know she kind of wanted to read
this one too so this is one that I want
to finish up I don't mention real fast
here to the other book that I almost
finished with that I want to add in here
and I know for sure I'll finish up so it
might not even be a part of here but I
thought I'd just bring it up hate the
way this footage looks ok so I totally
readjusted the camera right now because
I just like this better so hopefully you
guys okay that I'm so sorry I'm like
super hyper right now I don't know
what's going on anyway the other book
that I've started and i'm almost done if
i have like a hundred and something
pages left is the Scarlet Pimpernel I
don't know offhand who wrote it I am
actually reading out on my iPad so I
want to finish that up I know for sure i
will i'm just kind of adding it in here
to give me extra motivation and try to
read it every single night until it's
done I've really been enjoying it I
really love classics that's a lot of
what i read i feel like a lot of the
books i own i would say or half classics
have liked more modern classics or
popular fiction and nonfiction so anyway
I want to finish that up as well so
those are three books that I want to get
through the Scarlet Pimpernel I'm not
really counting I'm just putting in here
so I have someone be accountable that's
two books and now I have five more books
to choose from for my last three books
to make up the five lots of math so I'm
sorry hopefully that makes sense I
picked out about three men more type of
books I really do like memoirs so
without these would be reads that were
easier and interesting and that I
thought I could work through the first
one here is factory girls by Leslie
teach aang I picked this up in that book
haul as well and I really don't know
much about this i believe it's just
about a girl who worked in a factory in
china and just her experience and also
probably more about factories and that
whole system in china so I'm excited to
read this I think it'll be really good
and my mom does also want to read this
one so I want to be able to pass it
along to her relatively soon the next
book was also in the hall i'm telling
you i'm really excited about those books
this is a wolf at the table by Agustin
burrows I just finished a book by him
called possible side effects and so I
thought I would read this one which is a
lot more i guess i would say sad it's a
memoir about his dad and i kind of want
to see a different side and in just kind
of since i read that and know a lot
about him because it's personal stories
this is just like a different side of
him and I really want to read this so
this is one on my list I think this one
will be a little bit of a downer and
just kind of more just sad i guess but i
do want to read this i think it'll be
really good and the last book in like
the memoir category is report on myself
and this is a memoir by gregory boulier
I think it's how you might be able to
say that I don't know i got it for a
dollar on sale at a bookstore I don't
know like anything about it basically
this was like the cover so pretty I like
the way it feels in my hands it's a
memoir I'm gonna get it and I'd like to
just read it I know a dollars and a lot
of money but I kind of want to like be
like Oh at least I've read this thing I
randomly picked up and I just want to
read it and see what it's about so this
one's pretty dang short it's only let's
see 161 pages I feel like it'll be
really fast read and maybe i can even
slip it in here and finish more than
five bucks but anyway I know absolutely
nothing about this book so I can't
really tell you it's just about this
guy's life so i'm hoping i can get to
this book on top of the five that i read
and there's only two more books i'm so
sorry guys
but I'm just so indecisive I feel like I
have to be in certain moods to read
things so I at least have some options
for myself the last two books that i
have here are classics I love I just
love classic books so the first one I
picked here is the painted veil this is
by somerset maugham I love this book
I've already read this book I've watched
the movie I just love this story I made
my mom read this book and she really
liked it she loves to read like Auto
biographies &amp;amp; memoirs and those types of
books so she's not really into this type
of literature she really enjoyed this as
well so I just wanted to put this in
here something like a classic a favorite
one of my favorite authors just one of
my favorite stories of all time whoa
hitting myself I'm seriously so psycho
in this video I'm so sorry everyone I
feel horrible too because it's like a
collab I'm like reflecting on them
anyway I just really wanted to have
something familiar and something i knew
i would enjoy in here and even though
i've read it before I think it would be
a great story to read again and the
other caustic I put in here was the
curious case of benjamin button by f
scott fitzgerald I've read a lot of
Fitzgerald stuff but I have not read
this one I really like Fitzgerald's work
I love the great gatsby I love the last
tycoon Tender is the night I think is
another owned by him that I really like
so yeah i thought i would enjoy this
I've seen the movie but I wanted to read
the book I didn't even know it was a
book before the movie came out when I
saw it so ok whoo those are all my
choices of books that i want to read by
November fifth and then for sure I want
to hit five and if I could hit more than
that that would be absolutely amazing I
will have all the books listed down
below with the name and the author and i
will also leave a link to them in case
you want to pick it up and read it with
me or you were interested in it in any
way also again make sure you check out
the other ladies in this collab i'm
really excited and i hope some of you
will join in if reading is something
that you want to do this year or do more
of AI think it's just a really positive
thing for us to all kind of encourage
each other to do so that's everything
for this video guys I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
