lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my finished 5 by November
fifth update and these are books they're
not make vitamins which is a little bit
different for me but super fun this is a
collab with other people here on YouTube
i will link them all down below please
go check them out a few things before we
get started if you hear any like noises
in the background from people doing yard
work I'm so sorry but they're
unpredictable and they like stop and
then start so I hope you guys can't hear
it and I hope it's not distracting also
if I'm a little look a little tired
little weathered it's because i am i've
been working so much lately and no
complaints I think I've had maybe like
two days off this whole month but I
wasn't doing a good guy than that I've
been working every single day if not
multiple like eggs a day so it's just
been a lot and um it's been great but
it's been exhausting at the same time
anyway let's get into books I'm gonna
start off with the books that I've read
the most on after i finished my update
last time i did go down and i decided to
write down all of the books that i want
to read and then the page number i'm
starting on and where I get you I just
thought I kind of figured I wouldn't be
the person that's like I finished three
books this update next update i finished
two more books like I kind of wanted to
dabble in different books and I just
didn't know how much I'd be able to read
so I thought to keep me motivated
knowing how many pages i've read would
be a way for me to still be excited and
see progress the book that i made the
most progress on is this one this is
report on myself by gregory bully a i
believe is how you say that this is a
memoir I hadn't started this book at all
when I started this project and I am on
page 72 about that far into the book I
brought the sunset with me because I
knew that I would have a little bit of
time and I was able to read about 50
pages there I picked this book because I
knew it was a fast read and also it's
just small and tiny and fits in my purse
well whereas the other ones are a little
bit bigger I'm enjoying this it's a
memoir and it's similar in some ways to
Agustin burrows but it's also just
heavier in a more haunting way it's not
like this really funny story that kind
of brings heavier topics into it but
then in the
and it's still comical it kind of gets
tied up in a really awesome bow that
circles around to other things that he's
brought up in other stories or just in
that in that whole story this is more
like really small vignettes some stories
are a little bit longer some are smaller
it doesn't necessarily have like a ton
of chapters and you can't sometimes
quite like hit it on the nose why these
doors are connected it's just an overall
feeling after the end of it that you get
someone describe this on the back is
like more existential and I definitely
can see that but it's like a memoir and
about his life so I am enjoying it
definitely a little bit different
different than I thought it was gonna be
for sure but it is pretty good and I'm
excited to finish reading this I'd
really like to finish that one too
before next update and the other book I
was reading was the Scarlet Pimpernel
and reading this on just like not
audiobook but just like book on my
tablet I started out on page 209 and I'm
on page 222 I tend to read this book
when I am in bed and it's just easy to
see it without having the lights on
because of the screen and so Sam can go
to sleep and if i'm still up i can be
reading it i really want to finish this
book too i really enjoy this book i love
classics and this story is just fun I
just really like this story so I do want
to finish this book and that's all i've
read I'm so sorry guys I feel like my
updates across the board and makeup and
just in my life in general it's just
been hard to juggle everything and get
used to everything I still and finding
it difficult to find a good routine to
get the things that I want done like
YouTube and reading and just different
things like that on top of working so
that's everything for the update i'm not
going to show the rest of the books
actually so i will refer you to the
intro video if you want to see what
other books are in this project i will
also have them listed down below I just
feel like let's keep this short and
simple there's no reason to just talk
about the same information as the first
one so I hope you guys enjoyed this
update thank you so much to everyone
who's joined in on
is I think it's just a really fun way
for us to encourage each other to read
and hold ourselves a little more
accountable so hopefully I'll come back
next month and have a little bit more
progress a couple books finish so i can
give you some more thoughts on how I
felt about the overall books until then
I will see you guys in my next video bye
