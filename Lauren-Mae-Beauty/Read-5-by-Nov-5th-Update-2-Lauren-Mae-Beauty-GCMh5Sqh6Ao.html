Lauren today is going to be my update on
my finished by by November fifth book
challenge this was started by lorraine
and i'm climbing with a bunch of other
women here on youtube it will all be
listed down below definitely go check
them out and subscribe as you guys know
from the intro which will be linked down
below this was a challenge to get us to
read more obviously five bucks by fall i
was really excited to join this because
i want to read i love reading or at
least did in the past they still do it's
just hard for me to pick up a book I
find that I am just totally more
attracted and it's just easier to
consume other types of content so you
know I feel like as much as I enjoy when
I'm actually reading getting myself to
the point of reading is hard for me and
I realized that through this challenge
but anyway I'm definitely check out the
intro that is where i show like all the
books that I'm like potentially wanting
to read during this challenge let's just
get into my progress i started to talk
so much so i have good news guys i did
finish this book thank you Jesus I'm so
happy that it's done this is report on
myself it's by Gregory bully a i think
is how you pronounce that this is a
memoir and um let's just start off I
give this like I think like three stars
maybe just like three yeah I personally
did not enjoy this the reason I give it
three stars is because I feel like there
are people that could enjoy this I feel
like I could totally see why other
people would it's just not my type of
book I've kind of my head compared it to
the fact that like I got my degree or
one of my degrees in religion and
applied ethics because i love religion i
love like studying it the
anthropological side of it like i love
that and studying people and why they do
what they do in the context of religion
the ethics part is just not my favorite
because it was a lot of philosophy i'm
personally just not into that i I think
you can spend a lot of time just
wondering about this or that and then
you know you're kind of stuck in this
head thought and headspace and um I just
it's just not my thing and I feel like
this was kind of
that but in a memoir the best thing also
i compared to is boyhood the movie
boyhood I believe that's what it's
called it just felt like that to me and
I understand why people like that movie
I just personally didn't connect with it
and it's probably because I'm not a guy
I feel like more intellectual guys maybe
would connect with us a lot um but I'm
not a guy so I feel like as you grow up
and like different sexual awakenings and
just different things that I feel like
our big parts of getting older and
discovering the world and discovering
yourself um it's just not the same for
me like I don't connect to that so
anyway I give it three stars but I just
I didn't enjoy it and I kind of like am
I being too hard on this book and I
being too hard on this book no I'm not
because I pepped up this book um and I i
love it and so good already and i'm
seriously like three chapters in i just
love the way that I guess tainbros
rights I love this is different than
possible side effects that one's like so
far more funny and it's just like short
little vignettes and little stories this
is more of like it gives you those
vignettes but in a different way I just
I love this so far and it's just easier
to read easier to stay connected to but
it's still not just like unintelligent
there's still like a lot of good things
to it I don't know how to explain it
anyway I've really been enjoying this so
before page numbers i'll just get into
that really fast cuz I was tracking it
by page number a little bit just to keep
myself positive if I wasn't finishing a
whole book let me check here in my
little notebook so when we last left off
I was on page 72 and I finished it so
that means that i read to page I think
it's like 160 161 so yeah I definitely
got a good portion done a little less
than a hundred pages and then for this
one I hadn't started it at all and I am
now on page 23 so the title of this book
is a wolf at the table again it was in
my intro so that's why I'm like talking
to you guys like you know what's up
other than that
really haven't read too much the only
other thing that I can I kinda want to
put in here is me and sam went to dinner
and I actually got annual passes which
I'm so excited for and we did listen to
a book on the way back there was like
this crazy standoff inside a like
warehouse so they shut the freeway down
we were in traffic for forever so we put
on an audio book and it's the book a
girl on the train I've got this book a
long time ago had it in my audible and
then I just never got to it and then I
keep seeing billboards all around town
with a girl in train a girl and trainer
the girl in the train whatever and I was
like I want to read it before it comes
out because with gone girl I didn't read
the book and I saw the read the book but
i watch the movie and I really enjoyed
it but I just feel like they're in a
similar vein or that's like the
impression I get and I just thought it'd
be nice to actually read a book before
the movie so anyway um I think we're on
chapter let me look in here right now
we're on chapter 16 on that so I haven't
listened to it since but I thought I
would just talk about that a little bit
that I kind of started that so I'm going
to add that to this as like potential
books to finish up obviously I'm a
little bit behind and not only with
uploading this video but just like
finishing the books on time it doesn't
mean that I can't do it because a lot of
people read five books in one month it's
like not impossible but I definitely
want to continue reading I'm kind of
surprised at how much that short little
book like I picked it up because it was
short and small I thought it'd be a fast
to read and it just wasn't because of
what was inside the book and I mean I
could read the pages fast it just wasn't
as enjoyable as I really wanted it to be
so I'm just excited that I'm like into
this book that's for sure okay guys I
think I'm just gonna end up date there I
will try to update you guys more toward
the actual beginning of next month and
I'm really hoping i can get a little bit
more progress to show you guys try to
make reading more of a focus obviously
that's like every month I'm going to try
to do that but um yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you guys in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
