lauren i'm chilling out tonight and i
thought i would film an update on my
finish 5 by November fifth which is like
a book project pan i will link my intro
down below as well as my other videos if
you want to like see my progress so far
in this project this collaboration was
started by lorraine she will be listed
down below as well as all the other
people that are in this club definitely
go check them out and support them
starting off I do have better news this
month which is amazing I finished two
books so i'm at a total of three books
finished i need to finish two more by
November fifth so you guys already know
that I finished report on myself didn't
really like it it's all in my last
update if you want to see my review of
that but the other two books that i have
finished one is the girl in the train
both of the books that i finished this
like month or from this update were on
audible so i've had an audible account
for a long time like a couple years now
and i go back and forth I'm like into it
I'm not in right now I am into it me and
Sam read the girl in the train together
we were listening to it on different
trips I have a like a mini little vlog
that will be posted hopefully sometime
this week or next week where we're like
listening to it when we drove up to
Mount Baldy and then even when we were
like hiking we were like listening to it
and stuff so we spent a lot of time this
last month really listening to that book
and finished it I'm really happy too
because we finished it right before the
movies gonna come out which is like this
weekend coming up I really enjoyed the
book I thought it was really good
there's definitely a difference in
having a book read to you through
audible than just reading the book
yourself I I don't know if I prefer one
way or the other I like that I can get
other things done while i'm listening to
about and it just like it takes the work
out of it which i know sounds so lazy
but I'm kind of like it's just a
situation where i'm at right now so I'm
like whatever I read a book it was just
nice so review girl the trying super
great I don't want to get too into it
because it's like a thriller and
suspenseful and I don't want to give
anything away but I really enjoyed it I
thought it was really good i'd give it
like four and a half stars I like the
way was written i like that you got to
hear different peoples perspective as
you're trying to piece together this
mystery Sam called it like from the
beginning which I'm like how
how did you know that so yeah that's all
I'm going to say on it just so I don't
spoil anything I will say though that
the voice actors in it we're pretty dang
good and definitely memorable me and Sam
like definitely well like repeat the way
that they say things like in their
accents and different things because we
listened to so much of it anyway it was
really enjoyable I liked it the other
book that I read no shame Fifty Shades
of Grey and I am enjoying it I'm gonna
say it it's I feel like it's an
enjoyable book I listened to that book
super fast like I just like whipped
through it and so I'm on the second book
now obviously it's like adult content in
it I don't think it's like entirely well
written i think it's kind of remedial
the actual like writing style but i will
say that i do think it's like it's
entertaining it's quick it's fun um and
i like that so I was in gross i listened
to the first one enjoyed it enough i
definitely wanted to pick up the second
book i'm gonna finish out the trilogy so
yeah i recommend it i don't i know
there's like controversy around it I
don't know I'm like secure in myself and
all of that business so I'm I don't know
I enjoyed it so if you were thinking of
picking it up and thought you might
enjoy it you probably will and I suggest
it I'm like the person though that's
like glass on the bandwagon I'm like oh
with something popular like five years
ago I'll try it now Oh someone like Game
of Thrones I think I'll start watching
it now that it's on its fifth season
that's just my style is to always like
go away after the curve so those are the
three books that I've read so far i'm
happy to like hit over the halfway point
which is exciting in the second book
which is like 50 shades darker I'm on
like chapter 10 or 11 or something I
think there's like 20 something chapters
so I definitely feel like I'll be done
with that one by the next update which
will be my finale video and then the
other book that I was reading is the
Augustan burrows book a wolf at the
table I was on page like 23 or something
now I'm on 59 so i have read more of
this i do enjoy this and this is the
other book i want to count as with my
fifth book i guess finishing so i want
to finish fifty shades darker and then
this one i just want to give up on like
paper books entirely i do want to finish
this I was really enjoying it i just
kind of have been just listening to
audiobooks basically this whole month
yeah I that's my update it's just kind
of quick and short I just wanted to
this film so you guys could see where i
pad i'm really happy i signed up again
for my audible membership so that way i
can get credits and i'm excited to pick
my next book I mean obviously I'm going
to get the last book like fifty shades
freed or something I think it is but I'm
excited too i'll have another credit
after that to pick something else out or
just read something that's already in my
library it's just been working so well
for me like sitting through traffic or
going on a trip i also like that me and
Sam can listen to the book together and
it's kind of like watching a show where
you have like a shared experience and
you can kind of talk about the book and
you can talk about like what's happening
what you think and it's not just like
just you going through it it's like
you're sharing that experience and
that's why I love TV shows and movies so
that's why I've really been enjoying
audible when we can listen to a book
together alright that's everything guys
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
