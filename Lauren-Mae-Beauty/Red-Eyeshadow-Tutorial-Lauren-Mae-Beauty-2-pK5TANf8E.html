Lauren this is going to be my tutorial
on how to get this look with red
eyeshadow to me this is more wearable I
know won't be for everyone so I
definitely feel like this method is a
great way to wear any color and I think
that it looks really nice even with red
and it doesn't make you look sick so I
hope you guys enjoy the tutorial and I
will see you in a second okays I'm
starting out with a blank face all I
have on is moisturizer and now I'm going
to go in with a primer I'm actually
going to only use one primer today and
this is the Smashbox pore minimizing
primary this is the one I use every
single day and then I usually pair it
with something else but we're going solo
I like to focus on the areas where my
pores of the largest and then kind of
smooth out to the other areas in my face
and I thought today I would show you how
I've been doing my face lately and do
like a full face tutorial instead of
just a I look so I'm going to go in with
this concealer i'm actually using it
though as a base foundation this is the
by terry touché veloute and number two
and it has a little brush here so I'm
just going to click out product and put
it all over my face and I'm going to
blend that out with a Beauty Blender my
favorite tool ever I love this I
actually like the pink one better than
the black one but unit and that's in the
cover of everything which I didn't
expect it to so I'm going to go on to
find me blame fit me and conceal under
my eyes and also conceal just any
redness I have throughout my face in any
spots lately I've been enjoying going a
little bit lighter and not doing a whole
foundation I'm just using powder
foundation and I've
join a lot and again blend it out with
the Beauty Blender even though
everything is not just like a hundred
percent completely covered that's okay
because I'm going in with a powder
foundation this is the pure foreign one
mineral pressed foundation this is in
the color light and I barely have
anything left it's what I've been using
lately because it matches my skin tone a
lot better than it did when I got it
back in February so I'm going to take
the brush that came with it this is just
like a flat top mineral foundation brush
it's a little bit rough but I find that
it just does a good job of buffing the
product and still so even though the
softness isn't there it works so I'm
going to use that to just buff this all
into my skin and just kind of set my
foundation give it a little bit more
coverage and just kind of finish it off
for bronzer i'm going in with the tart
off-the-cuff holiday palette for 2014 i
think and i'm going in with that bronzer
injure the last couple of days i've been
using the elf complexion brush to bronze
up my face in contour a little bit and
I've really been enjoying it so I'm
going to use that brush I am sweating a
little bit so I feel like it went a
little patchy on my forehead so I'm
gonna go back in with my powder
foundation and just kind of try to buff
out mostly just this spot here and make
it not look so crazy for a blush i'm
just using a really neutral blush since
we are doing red on the eyes and this is
neapolitan lane from tarina tarantino
i'm just using a duo fiber brush to
apply this and last for face i'm going
to go into highlight I've been really
enjoying the Marc Jacobs highlighter
this is the glow stick in spotlight and
I'm going to apply it with a brush this
is like a dense tapered foundation type
brush and I just run out on the product
and then run out on my cheekbones it
just gives a really nice glow I tried to
tap off the product like it was a powder
and there we go that's the rest of my
highlighter and for this look I do want
to be kind of glowy I feel like with the
red how I'm gonna do it today I want it
to be more just like light and summery
and not like dark and sickly so I want
to keep it as glowy as possible so
that's my face down I'm gonna go in now
and do my eyebrows first thing I like to
do is just go through and use a spoolie
and run through
then just to kind of work out any
product that might have gone in them and
then today I'm going to try to only use
this pencil from ebay this is the fairy
girl i did this look yesterday and i
used only this pencil and my eyebrows
looked really good I really enjoyed the
way they look so I'm going to try to
recreate that we will see how that goes
shape-wise are looking ok a little
uneven but I'm gonna go with it we're
going to brush through with a spoolie
and just make sure any of that extra
product gets distributed better
especially in the tail and I'm i sent my
brows in place using the Anasazi a clear
brow gel we're finally on to the eyes
i'm going to be using the Too Faced
shadow insurance to prime my eyelids and
then I like to set my eyelid so I'm just
using a matte cream shadow you can use
anything you have and sometimes i go in
around the tiniest bit the first thing
i'm going to do is going with makeup
geek creme brulee which is that shade
right there and i'm going to be putting
that into the crease and just buffing it
all in the cream and then now i'm going
to go in with a lighter shade on the lid
i'm using this shape here from NARS and
this is the Andromeda single shadow I
have it in a palette that I believe you
can get it singularly but i would use
any type of light bright shade so
anything like steel is kitten anything
really bright keeps this look lighter
and more fun and more purposeful and not
sickly to me at least so I just go in
with my finger I find I get the best
pigmentation that way and I just put
this on basically the first two thirds
of my lid and I just pack it on once
you've built it up you're gonna go in
with your red shadow the star of the
show is ready to enter the stage this
shadow is from the California roll from
one wild but there are tons of different
red type shadows out there I like to use
this type of brush this is the Sigma
blending a 25 and I'm going to pack it
on to my brush and make sure you tap off
the extra because it will fall on your
face and that's not what you want and
then we're just going to be blending
this on the basically outer two-thirds
to one-third really focus it on the
word and then kind of blend into the
white on the to third area hopefully
that makes sense and I want to
concentrate the most color on the lash
line that's really where I want to see
the most red is like right here and then
from there it should blend out and I
kind of use like a dabbing motion not
necessarily a super sleepy motion help
build that color up and then with really
light pressure I'll go out and just kind
of blend into creme brulee with the red
as well to me that's looking pretty good
so I'm gonna do that to the other eye
I'm gonna go back in with that NARS
color and just kind of Pat it and kind
of blend it onto the odd and I'm just
using my finger to blend and then I'm
gonna go back in with creme brulee and
just kind of buff out anything i have
actually i'm just gonna go on with this
brush first with no product or no extra
product i'm really liking that so we're
gonna move on i'm going to tightline and
also put a little bit of liner on my
lower lash line I think that roach looks
really nice it's just a bronze color
from urban decay and it just not as
harsh as black I think it just keeps it
more like a warm sunset smokey it's not
smoke because it's not dark but it just
keeps it warm toned instead of more
harsh and black so I'm gonna use that to
tight line and put on my lower lash line
for my lower lash line I'm just gonna go
on with creme brulee and that's it i
really want to keep it simple on the
bottom you could add a little bit of red
i did yesterday and I just think it
looks a little bit better when you keep
it more simple and not that this is
graphic in any way because it's not like
harsh lines or anything but I just feel
like it keeps the red like the main
focus point and sometimes right on the
lower lash line can make you look a
little more sick you definitely can
still do it and I definitely sometimes
do I just want to keep this more bright
and clean for this specific look so yeah
creme brulee on the lower lash line and
for my inner corner I'm gonna go in with
whimsical from makeup geek and it is a
light pink shadow it's that one there
although it looks pink by the time
kind of put it on the inner corner I
feel like it just looks like a really
bright metallic shade and now I'm just
going to throw some mascara on this is
urban Kay's perversion it's like my
favorite mascara love this mascara now
I'm just gonna do my lips make sure you
don't have any foundation on your lips
and I'm gonna go in with a lip liner and
then a lip pencil this is the by Terry
lip liner in Rose contour yes Rose
contour and then if you guys have
watched me a long time you guys know I
lost this and I found it it was in my
kit and I somehow at school must have
put this in my kit instead of like in my
purse cuz it's my personal one I found
it a little bit ago I just haven't told
you guys so I'm gonna put tarts
lipsurgence in exposed on my lips
afterward and that's the final look guys
I know this is kind of simple I feel
like you could look really good with any
color like you could do blue purple pink
orange anything like this just use that
like brighter inner lid shade and then
do whatever color you want on the end
and I think I would still look really
good you guys know that to me this is
totally wearable but if you wanted to
make it more wearable more neutrally you
definitely could add on top of this just
like a darker shade and just blend out
with the red or if you already did this
step just add a little bit of darker in
the outer corner and just let the red
peek through and that would definitely
tone it down make it more wearable and
just make it more of like a warmer I
part of me wanted to do like two ways to
wear red eyeshadow and do this and then
that look but I didn't want to end up
with that look today I want to wear this
look so I'm sorry hopefully you guys are
okay with that potentially in the future
I'll be doing more tutorials and stuff
so I can try to incorporate a more
wearable wearable look I really like
this I think this look looks really good
and I don't think you look sick I
definitely feel like it looks like it's
on purpose the biggest thing i think
just making sure that your red is
impaired too dark basically too dark and
that you also have a couple things
though to grab the look like if I didn't
tight line that would be really really
bad
and then if your eyes are looking a
little red going in with a little bit of
a white eyeliner on your waterline it's
going to help tremendously as well so
anyway that's everything I hope you guys
enjoyed the look and I will see you guys
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
