Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a full face
tutorial I was kind of inspired by a
couple different products in my
collection to do something kind of red
and smoky maybe something with a little
pink and Valentine's Day inspired I
don't really know this product from
colour-pop the supernova shadow and UFO
is what I was inspired to do I haven't
used this yet and I got it like right
before Christmas or no right after
Christmas
so yeah I want to use this and that's
like the main inspiration in my head I
thought this is a lot more red and it's
kind of more copper Orange so we'll see
how that works out I was kind of
inspired I okay you know in Aladdin when
and jasmine isn't like the red outfit
and she's inside the sand timer I don't
know what those are called
anyway kind of like Jafar and like that
black kind of smoky look I don't know
and then I was like who what if I blew
it out with like pink on the lower lash
line then I was like oh that's kind of
like a Valentine's Day look so yeah my
inspirations all over the place so this
is the main focus another thing I want
to mention before we get into it
obviously I'm doing my full face and
nothing on my face right now except for
like the moisturizer but I'm pulling
from a lot of different pallets so if
you have a color similar just use that
in your collection I am gonna do a
tutorial based off of like one palette
soon just so that way if you happen to
have that palette but again if you don't
have that palette and you still have to
just do things that are similar but I
was thinking of doing something with
like this I don't know I don't know what
I want to do we're just gonna get into
it I'm also gonna be doing the tape
method like we're playing around today
and we're playing around before any of
that happens though I am gonna do my
brows I I was thinking about doing my
brows off-camera but I'm just gonna do
them on camera so I'm gonna be using my
color pop brow pencil and the front half
of my brows my elf brow pencil in taupe
in the last half and then I'm gonna set
them in place with my ELF clear brow gel
and fingers crossed I stay and frame
all right now that I have the brows on
I'm gonna place the tape so I don't know
I feel like I don't have a ton of luck
with the whole tape method but it just
seemed right for this look so I'm gonna
put it on my hand first and then take it
off so that way it's not as sticky and
won't rip my eyes to shreds once I take
the tape off I'm doing my eyes first too
so that's not like super normal for me I
just like my face once I have a full
face of makeup and then I go into the
eyes it just makes me feel more
confident about my look but I don't want
to get glitter all over my eyes so all
right we're gonna pray that those are
kind of similar and we're gonna zoom in
so you guys can see what I'm doing
oh I didn't wanna put primer on probably
should put that on for a shoot well I
guess we'll just primer this tape isn't
you just feel a little ridiculous with
the tape okay I'm gonna actually Zuma
sit now first thing I'm gonna do is go
in with like a matte cream shade this
one actually has a little bit of sparkle
in it but I'm just going to use it like
a matte and that's gonna set our primer
and give us a nice base to work on
next I'm gonna go in with a medium tone
brown this one is from colour-pop it's
the shade Bellaire and I'm just going to
be laying down a transition and this is
just gonna be a base rest to work off of
I really want this outer have to be
really black and smoky and in this inner
part to be really glittery and red
copper looking so that's kind of the
focus but this is gonna make that Brown
and the Reds kind of transition into
each other nicely as we move away from
color and into the brow and because we
have the tape we can be a little bit
messy even if you don't have the tape
you can be messy because we are going to
clean up any fallout or anything that
happens because we're doing our face
last so you don't have to have the tape
it's hopefully just gonna give us a
sharper look although I feel like my
shape is gonna be off with this
now that I have that blended I'm gonna
move on to another Brown this one is in
the same palette and it's a matte it's
the color my type I believe and we're
going to be just deepening out this
outer edge basically the outer half of
the eye and we're just continuing to
build up shadow so we can add that black
in a little later
and now I'm just taking our original
blending brush and you can add a little
bit more product if you need it but I'm
blending out anywhere that I need to
this one doesn't seem to be taking the
color as well at least in my monitor
when I look so I'm trying to just even
out any shadow differences so far I
really like the look of that so I'm
going into the electro-pop palette from
Kevin a Quan and I'm gonna be taking
this kind of red copper shade and I'm
just using my finger I find that that's
kind of the best way to use these
shadows and I'm going to be applying it
onto the lid into the brown and then
we're gonna work from there with the
black and then we'll go in with that
cream shadow this is kind of a lot of
layers obviously again use what you have
in your collection I just want to play
around with stuff and this look is kind
of extra I'm just taking it there
so that went on pretty nicely I'm just
taking a little wipe and trying to get
away anything from the inner corner
because I don't want the red on the very
inner corner I'm gonna go in with just a
blank blending brush and just blend out
the edges of the red and I'm gonna add a
little bit of that Brown just to kind of
bring in some depth there so that it's
evened out and not too light here when
we have such darkness going on
eventually with the black and again
we're layering another color on top of
this so I think it'll be good okay now
we're gonna go in with black I'm going
into that same color pop palette I'm
gonna be taking this matte black and I'm
just going to be working this in I want
the most intensity to be at the wing and
then I kind of wanted to fade into the
rest of the colors
I'm really liking the way that looks I'm
going to go back in with the one of the
blending brushes you can probably use
whichever one and just kind of blending
out edges once again before we go in
with the cream shadow I'm gonna go back
in with that same red shade we have on
the lid and a flat shader brush and I'm
just going to be kind of dragging it out
into the black so hopefully we can have
a nice seamless transition from the
cream shadow into the red shadow that is
the hope at least it's something that I
just thought of that I want to do I'm
gonna go in with a matte red shadow this
one's from Wet n Wild from a limited
edition quad or 6 p.m. sext and I'm
going to run this from that red shadow I
just I want that fire we're going to a
movie tonight so I'll be looking hella
intense movies you guys know that's just
how I like my placement of color I
almost feel like my lid is like really
clear if I don't have color on this
portion of my eye I know it looks pretty
intense now but I think it'll look good
once my face isn't as pink once my
foundation on so now is the moment we've
all been waiting for we're going on with
the shadow and I think I'm just going to
place the most intensity here and then
blend out with my brush I have it in the
other hand I'm like ready to go I have
not used this yet like I've mentioned so
we'll see how it works
I think it looks kind of cool let's do
the other
I think that looks pretty good I'm going
to now go in with the matte black shadow
and just continue to kind of work that
in because I want it to be just a little
more intense and I'm not going to be
adding any winged liner or anything
and now we're gonna blend I hate this
stuff because I feel like it always look
so messy so I'm just going to rip off my
tape we got some definite wings going
I'm going to also clean up any fallout
I might have under my eyes I'm gonna let
that dry and then I'm gonna actually
prime my face so I'm gonna zoom out
really fast so you don't want so zoomed
it right now all right so this is what
we're working with at the moment I know
it looks really really scary because I'm
so red um but I think it's gonna look
pretty dang cool these definitely give
you like again that kind of like creepy
lid I don't know I haven't found one
product that goes on your lid and looks
like smoothes when it's like really
glittery I think that's just how they
look so it's like very textured but it's
kind of cool I'm kind of into it again I
think once we have some foundation on it
won't look so chaotic I'm just gonna use
my Cokie primer today this is going to
add some moisture and then I'm gonna add
illuminizer this one is from one over
one
for foundation today I'm going to be
mixing my makeup forever and I'm using
the Sonia Kashuk I'm really just trying
to use up foundations at the moment and
this one's just a little too yellow for
me I feel like when I'm this pale I'm
just gonna mix in one pump of each and
then a brush have really been liking
actually is this one from Sigma I did
receive some PR from them which was
really cool and they sent this and I was
like oh no this is gonna be super
gimmicky but it's actually really nice
and I have been enjoying it this is the
3d HD max kabuki brush it's so weird
because I used to really hate applying
my foundation with brushes and now I'm
into it again I still really enjoy my
concealer with a Beauty Blender though I
just need something more delicate around
my eye area and this is a little bit
more difficult to maneuver now that I
have my brows done first usually I go in
with foundation first but I'm just
trying to even out my skin tone and not
trying to like cover everything I just
like at least a nice base to not how my
face looks a red
so I have my base down and I still have
some places that I can conceal so I'm
going to obviously go under my eyes with
some concealer this is Maybelline fit me
and I'm gonna put a little on my nose I
have some redness there I have a bit on
my chin and then just anywhere that I
feel like I have some extra spots I like
to let concealer kind of do more of the
main job than the foundation
all right so if anything changes Kassam
got home so I did see this in the mirror
and I really liked the sparkle it
doesn't look as like creepy as I feel
like it did when I was looking here it
looks pretty definitely a little
textured but not anything like that so
just a little update I'm now going to
set my under eye so I'm using my ELF
under eye setting powder and I'm going
to put that all under my eyes I set
pretty heavily with this under my eyes
and I like to tap out if there's any
like concealer creasing so I don't set
it like that
and then for the rest of my face I'm
using my Revlon powder and I did repress
this and I made a video on it I just
it's like so boring so I haven't been
wanting to edit it I will get that up at
some point soon though so you guys can
see it'll probably up by the time this
video's up so I will leave it late
I feel like I look more pasty white on
camera than I do in real life so it's
definitely time to get that bronzer oh
I'm using my laura geller baked bronzer
in light and I'm gonna be using this
brush from ELF this is the pointed
powder brush and I use this to kind of
like do everything so like warms up my
face like a bronzer would but this isn't
too too warm toned so I kind of put it
in the hollows of my cheeks as well
biggest thing I try not to go too
overboard I want to give myself life but
I don't want to look orange or have just
like splotches of bronzer it's always a
struggle for me
and just make sure there's no like
weirdness going on with my forehead I'm
gonna go back in with my powder and just
buff over any thing and I might think
what was weird
for blush today I guess I wanted to go
bold cuz this is what I picked out I am
going to be buffing a hot pink
underneath the lash line so I think this
is me trying to like incorporate that a
little bit so just gently so gently I'm
adding this blush to my cheeks for
highlighters today I'm using two
different Becca ones this is moonstone
and this is the champagne dream flashes
Bellini I think I'm gonna put this on
first this is definitely a different
formula than the original highlighters
and so I don't know how well this will
apply on top of the moonstone so I'm
gonna go kind of heavy
looks like a pink shift to it or like
kind of like a Bellini shift I might
just use this actually I don't know
I decided I'm just gonna go with that
actually but I am gonna be spraying my
face with a setting spray so I'm gonna
do that really fast and then we're just
gonna let that dry so the face is dry
I'm going to be going in now and
something I really want to do is just
kind of like buff out the harshness of
this line that's not like my favorite
like I want it to be kind of crispy but
not like you know crispy crispy so I'm
just gonna blend that out a little bit
I'm also gonna try to make sure that
these match well or at least better than
they are as best I can
I think that's the best we're gonna do
with getting rid of that crispy line so
next okay
we're gonna go in guys I'm making this
so intense I'm gonna take the black
shade and I'm gonna go in with it kind
of fluffier brush and I'm just gonna be
kind of bringing that wing to the lower
lash line and connecting it and I'm only
bringing it halfway though cuz I really
don't want to get too dark
and then I'm going to take the pink from
this huda beauty palette and I'm going
to buff that in on top of the black
and I'm blowing at it out kind of far
and I'm bringing it into the wing a
little bit
I'm also going to bring a tiny bit of
this pink into the red we already have
going on up here just to try to kind of
make it make a little bit more sense for
an inner corner highlight I'm going in
with my Beckham in step so laughs for
eyes I'm going to go in with some
mascara this is the monster pick from
Lancome I'm gonna put a little bit of
this brown liner in my tight line I'm
going to put a little bit of this in the
waterline it's a white and we'll see how
that looks I might add a little bit of
the brown on the bottom lash line just
to kind of tie everything in together
laughs what I'm going to do is there
still is kind of a sharp edge on my wing
so I'm gonna bring some black shadow in
and try to kind of buff that out more
than just blending so I'm gonna take
black on this fluffy blending brush and
just try to soften it and then last for
this look I kind I just want to keep it
neutral with the lips I was thinking
about going like vampy but I feel like
this will just get too dark for me for
it's already a lot for me so I'm going
to use this from Revlon it's in the
shade dawn it's the HD dawn lipstick I
even think just like a really pretty
gloss it'd be awesome but whatever you
want to do alright so this is the final
look this was a little bit more
experimental than I felt I was gonna be
I really like the glitter on the lid I
think it'll look really pretty if it was
a little bit less intense but I'm glad I
tried something a little bit different
doing something this dark is definitely
not in my comfort zone doing something
this structured I mean even though I
still have it a little blown out I'm
with the wing is definitely not
something I usually do so I'm happy with
it
I wish I had left out the brows just
because I feel like it's adding a bit of
heaviness because it's not light and
bright it's pretty dark on top of the
dark and anyway if I could go back
that's what I would change but other
than that I hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial let me know what you think of
the look down below and I will see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
