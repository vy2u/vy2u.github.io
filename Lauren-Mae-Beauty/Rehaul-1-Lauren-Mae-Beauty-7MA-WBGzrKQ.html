Lauren this is going to be a review on
stuff that I hauled about a year ago now
that my channel is a year old I am able
to go back and look at my purchases and
there are a ton of people on here on
YouTube that do this Heather from Love
Heatherette as well as Laura friend
peachy-keen those are the two that I
know that I personally watch and I love
watching them sometimes things that you
buy get in haul and you never see them
again and I think it's a fun way to
really reflect on your purchases
especially being in the project panning
community I think it's really
interesting how I feel about these
products now that I'm going back about a
year later so let's get into the hall I
will leave that original video link down
below if you want a good laugh it's such
yeah I definitely was a little
embarrassed watching it myself but I
will leave a link if you guys want to
check it out and let's get into the
items that I bought and what I think
about them now so the first things that
I showed in that hall were two different
types of concealers I got two of the
Maybelline Dream Lumi concealers in the
color ivory I believe I used both of
those up I really liked that concealer I
would definitely repurchase it I just
haven't because I think it's quite
expensive for how much product you get
but it is a really good one and the
other one is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in fair
I actually just repurchased that to day
like I walked to CVS and picked up a
prescription and got two different
concealers and that was one of them so I
love that concealer everything that I
got in this haul was from all cosmetics
wholesale and I think I got an amazing
deal on those concealers specifically I
know that if you look online there are
people saying that some of the stuff
they sell it's fake especially like Mac
stuff I don't know I'm not a Mac girl I
really don't know much about Mac so I
don't really know what to say about that
stuff but if you can find stuff that
isn't fraudulent or stuff that doesn't
usually get fraud it out
I'd already used those concealers before
so I knew getting them that one it was a
great deal but to that I would use them
and love them so I think if you're just
smart about your purchases on there then
you should be fine anyway whole get off
of that tangent but I did use up all
four of those concealers already they
were in my empties for last year and I
really enjoyed them I would
we purchase both of them I thought those
were great purchases especially for the
price I think I definitely saved money
next I had two of the Maybelline matte
lipsticks the first one was in touch of
spice I'll swatch it for you guys that's
what it looks like I honestly have not
used this that much it has made it
through my de clutters because it is
like a matte lipstick and I find that
those are the ones I reach for the most
so there's that one and the other one
was last for blush and that's what it
looks like in the tube and that's it
swatch next to touch of spice that is
lust for blush I'm excited to get more
wear out of these lipsticks I have
condensed my lipstick collection down
quite a bit and these ones did make it
through I'm excited to kind of wear
these more see how I like them I
honestly have only worn these each maybe
one or two times which is crazy so I
don't have a bunch to say on it I don't
regret this purchase but I definitely
didn't need it so it wasn't something
that like if I didn't have these in my
collection I wouldn't miss them but I
don't regret them because they do feel
like they are something that I'm going
to use and now that my collection isn't
as cluttered I feel like I can reach for
these more next I had even more
lipsticks in that video I talked about
how I was on like a lipstick kick and
yeah I guess I was because there were a
lot in there I got four of the wet and
wild furry lipsticks but I only have two
left I have too cluttered the other two
so the two I have left are Fergie daily
and that is what that looks like I'll
swatch it on my hand and that's it there
and the other one was in bebot love
which is a little bit darker of a nude
and that's it swatch there so these are
nice lipsticks um if I could go back I
probably wouldn't buy these at all I did
have Fergie daily before I had any of
them and I do enjoy this color these are
not matte but they're not well you can
see a little bit of a shine there
they're not like too slippery plus
they're nudes to their colors I feel
like if I were to wear a non matte lip
formula I would do it in a nude so I'm
glad to have these two I wouldn't pick
them up again but if you love lipsticks
that's just because of me personally I'm
not a lipstick person I have a few that
I love and then
I really really don't need more than
that at one time I just I really don't I
will probably still by lip products
because I want to enjoy lip products but
especially just like traditional
lipstick bullets and stuff I just don't
I don't wear them so these are nice
colors I think the formula is nice but
again I just don't I haven't really
reached for them plus I talked about
this in my packaging pet peeves tag
video which I'll leave that link down
below as well that I hate this packaging
because yeah you just like Nick the
lipstick all the time I don't know what
kind of a review that was on those
products but I feel like basically
everything besides to concealer so all
the luck products are things I
definitely could have lived without I
wouldn't have missed if I hadn't bought
them but for the ones that I have kept I
don't hate them either where I want to
like get them out of my collection so I
kind of wish I had saved that money and
bought something I really loved or put
it towards something else when I look
back but it's not like a hundred percent
like big regret type of thing hopefully
that makes sense
next in that video I talked about some
lashes that I had some fancy ideas to do
I will either I might post that picture
on my Instagram of when I used them but
I did use them in a drag look for
theater so I got my use out of them I
really enjoyed them I think they made
the look really awesome so I'm really
happy that I bought those I thought they
were a really good deal they're like
three dollars honest a which for feather
lashes is a pretty good pretty good deal
so either I will have that linked like I
will either have that on my Instagram if
you want to check it out I'll have that
linked and if I don't have it on there I
will insert a picture now so yeah but
that was really fun and really awesome
it'll probably be on Instagram so yeah
check my experience the next item in the
hall was a blush from Australis this is
the blush and hotties and secrets and it
is a very pretty nude blush I think it's
the packaging is kind of bulky it's a
really pretty nude blush very similar to
tarts exposed or milania's romantic rose
or any of those types of like nudie
blushes I do really like this honest
I've just used this in the last couple
of days I'm gonna swatch it oh you can't
really see it because my light so I'm
sorry but that's it there it's just a
beautiful color I am also wearing it on
my cheeks today and I do like this this
is why I could have lived without but I
think it's a beautiful color I
definitely am going to keep it in my
collection and it's nice I really do
like it I think the formulas in eyes
I think the consistency is nice I think
the color payoffs nice and it's it's a
good blush it was like ten dollars if
that was the price in story I don't
think I would have bought it I think
just being online mostly I need to stay
away from shopping online because I just
add things to my cart and go insane but
I do like this blush I think it's a
really pretty color and I'm glad to get
a couple wares out of it finally and I
know that I do really like it
next I have a ton of the maybelline eye
studio quads right before I moved out to
California I was on a really big kick
with these I went crazy I purchased a
ton off of Amazon and then when I saw
that all cosmetics wholesale had a bunch
that I hadn't already purchased I was
like obsessed and got a bunch of them
they were on a really good deal they
were half off the in-store price which I
thought was pretty good these have an
amazing formula for the drugstore I
really do like it I wish there were more
mats they are almost all shimmery but
they are really nice I definitely need
to use them more but I don't regret
these as a purchase I think they're
really nice so go through the colors
again this one is new romance which this
is one that has the closest to matte
finish I think their I called them like
a satin and they're definitely like a
satin but they're at least closer to a
matte finish next this one is in
virtually violet I actually did hit pan
on this shade here because of using it
on my eyebrows when my hair is purple so
I did I feel like get a good use out of
this quad so far but I definitely could
use the other shades more this one is in
all of martini this one has that
beautiful duochrome shade I'll swatch it
for you guys
that's it there it has that like blue
with that ready brown undertone really
pretty I have used this before and I do
really like that color specifically
although I feel like a lot of brands do
have that color now it's not as you know
impressive as it used to be but I do
think this is an amazing
quad this one's called take it off this
one's nice I haven't used it I've only
ever swatched it I have so many of these
if you guys want a specific video
dedicated to these and swatches let me
know but I am thinking about starting up
my makeup basket like monthly makeup
basket and starting to put these back in
there I was doing that for a little bit
to try to get more use out of these I
put like one or two in a month and then
try to at least use them a couple times
do a couple looks with them and last
this one is Barrett buff and this one's
very nude the colors are quite light
which I personally like those types of
colors but that one's there and I have
not used that one either it's just been
swatched I forgot to talk about
something that I've already gotten rid
of I did purchase in that video some of
the Marke beauty products there was let
me see I wrote it down a Wonder glow
blushing glow and then an exotic beauty
face powder mosaic I got rid of those
probably thinking one of my first
declutter videos that I ever did on my
channel in that video you can kind of
tell that I bought them because they're
pretty I didn't know how I was gonna use
them but try to say like positive about
it
and yeah I never used them and out of
all the stuff I owned I just wasn't
gravitating or trying to reach for those
so I did declutter those I regret that
purchase I definitely am trying harder
you guys know but to not buy stuff just
because it looks pretty or just because
it's only six dollars for both of them
or whatever it's like it's not worth it
save your six dollars put it towards
something else save it for lunch like
save it for anything else but just
buying something to buy it especially
when it comes to makeup and you already
have like seven hundred blushes so I did
get rid of those those are gone I
regretted buying those I think I
regretted buying them like I can tell in
that video next for Maybelline I had a
Maybelline Color tattoo this is in the
color lavish lavender I have used this a
couple times right when I first got it
but I really haven't used it since then
you guys know I'm not a fan of the color
tattoos I think that they're okay but
they honestly just I feel like are a
little dry and if you have more aged
eyelids or just like dry eyelids I don't
think these have worked for you I think
they dry out really fast and I don't
know um there's a swatch of this but I
don't know if you can see but I just
feel like
it's kind of patchy and I don't know I'm
gonna keep this so I can use it a little
bit more and tell it dries it up but
once it dries up I'm just gonna get rid
of it I will not purchase any more color
tattoos like I just don't think they're
worth it I'd rather have a high-end
cream shadow that I love over these so
and I prefer stick forms too as opposed
to this if I had to pick something so
yeah I do regret this
now but I feel like I came up with that
decision of not liking the color tattoos
from having so many of them so I don't
know if I would have been able to say
that I don't like them if I hadn't
purchased this so yeah I I wouldn't
rebuy this for sure if I went back I
only have a couple more things to talk
about the next things in that hall were
these shadows these are by SM H yes s MH
witches stars make a Pavin and I did end
up getting 7 but I cannot find one of
the shadows it's driving me crazy I
cannot find Fifi for the life of me I am
trying I I would never have gotten rid
of it so I don't know where where it is
or what happened to it but it was this
purple color with kind of a bluish
reflex it's kind of similar to tonic
which is one my favorite eyeshadows ever
but just not as duo come--and is
iridescent but i really liked it and i
don't know where it is that's super
annoying but let's go through the colors
I would have to say that out of that
whole haul these are probably my
favorite purchases from it um I do have
a lot of single shadows but I think
these are amazing quality for the $2.99
I paid for them and I still wouldn't
want to get rid of them and I I think
they're beautiful so this one here is
just like a matte white or cream color
more like and it's in the color cracker
that's a swatch of it there this next
one is a shimmery color and it is like I
think it's really similar to Mac shroom
honestly it's below it if you can see
I'm so sorry about my lights it's in the
color squeak I like it next I have the
color periwink it's a really pretty blue
but it kind of leans purple in that
video I had mentioned that they are a
little powdery
you can see that the powder there they
are a little powdery which this one is a
little surprising like I can blend it
out it's just when you dip your finger
in there you get a lot of kick up
and it's not like it's not like the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows you know
it doesn't oh my I feel like my
descriptions in this video are kind of
bad so I apologize for it now next is
flaming Oh or flamingo I thought about
that later it's just like an orange
shade again it kinda has that powdery
pickup but I feel like it's still so
workable and yeah if you were just used
to Mac shadows this look like bother you
so much but really pigmented I feel like
the color payoff is still really good it
doesn't look chalky it's just a lot of
pickup pickup you know this one was like
my favorite one from the whole bunch
which is fireflies I still have yet to
do a look with it though which is the
saddest thing like that pigmentation I
think is so amazing I just love this
like acid green acid yellow kind of
chartreuse e color so pretty I
definitely think it looks so pretty on
the inner corner like just like blown
out on your inner corner oh so pretty so
I really like that one
and protegÃ© is the last one that I have
here again because I don't have that
other one and this isn't really pretty
like mommy color there it is on the side
here this video is so messed up I am so
sorry everyone so um that's it there
it's really pretty again I like those
types of colors on my eyes I think they
really bring out the blue I have not
used these a ton but you guys know
eyeshadow is like my thing it's my
favorite thing so I'm kind of used to
not using them but still loving them if
that makes sense so I am excited to
since I'm panning eyeshadows maybe kind
of now that I went back and saw that
video and remembered I had these just
kind of like put these in the rotation
to try to hit pan on some of those this
year I think they'd be really fun I'm
wiping my hand off with a tissue that's
what I'm looking down at but yeah so
those ones are really nice out of the
whole hull probably my favorite thing
besides a concealers because I use those
up obviously those were not a waste of
money
in any sort of way the last things that
I purchased during a haul were a ton of
the clean colored colored lipsticks I
did a whole review on those it was early
on in my channel I will also leave that
link down below though I'm not really
sure I haven't looked back at that one
I'm sure it's scary too but they sucked
I don't know if they were bad when I got
them if they just are that way but the
consistencies between them were they
were just overall so bad I hated them I
hated them I hated the smell of them
they smell and tasted like a grandma but
like like a grandma had gone rotten and
sour and they were just not good I think
I got all of them for like less than $14
and I regret that so much I mean it's a
good price to get that many lipsticks
for $14 but not when they're all crappy
and I didn't even use them I basically
just threw them away so I basically took
my fortune dollars ripped it up and
threw it in the trash and I wish I
didn't do that like looking back I
definitely wouldn't have purchased those
but you live and you learn so that's
like everything that I actually bought
during that haul just a few notes and
like thoughts on it I really can see
such a difference in myself from a year
ago on like what I thought was me being
like a good buyer and what I think of
myself being a good buyer now is so
different honestly if I could go back I
would have just got the Maybelline
concealers maybe a couple of the
Maybelline quads and then the eyeshadows
and then that's it I wouldn't have got
anything else I really don't need any of
that other stuff I don't even need that
those things but if I had to like edit
down my cart again which I'm sure that
was a super edited down card I'm sure I
had a ton of like so many more things in
that cart before I actually purchased
those things but I definitely wouldn't
have purchased like half of the items
and I'm really proud of this journey and
like how far I've come looking back at
that haul I
I wish I had that money back and I'm
just glad that I am trying to change my
habits and to really just make more
meaningful purchases when it comes to
makeup and to not just buy everything
because it's cheap and not just like
want to try every last thing just to try
it like part of me wants to but part of
me is like the life is so much bigger
than this and if you're gonna buy so
many things like you also have to like
be able to let things go and I don't
have it it's not like a free-flowing
thing right now it's like you get get
get get toward hoard hoard and I don't
want to do that so anyway going off on
another tangent that is everything I
bought during that haul my thoughts on
them now how I feel and again I'm just
really happy that I have really tried to
take up project panning and take this
kind of more minimalistic approach to
makeup although I love makeup and I will
always love makeup and I need makeup to
you know be a makeup artist I don't want
to just be so sucked in that I'm just
like this consumer and not really loving
my products and and really cherishing
what I have but anyway I'll stop talking
about it I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I'm excited to do more of
these in the future because I know I
have a lot of hauls that I had last year
including my gratis hauls and stuff so I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
