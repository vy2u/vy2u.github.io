is going to be my second rehal that I've
ever done so this is me looking back at
items I hauled about a year ago and just
kind of reminiscing about them looking
back thinking whether they were a good
purchase or not if I've been used um if
I've enjoyed them if they're gone um and
declutter it out of my collection I
think this is a really great way to kind
of just check yourself check yourself
and I think it helps me now when I look
back at these to not buy stuff in the
present so um I hope you guys enjoy this
video tons of people do these videos and
I think that they're just really helpful
and even just in a selfish way just for
me they're helpful so I'm gonna get into
it this is a hole i did in i posted at
march seven it's just called makeup haul
and all the stuff were things that my
mother-in-law had brought to california
from arizona for me from my mom's house
and I was super excited when I got all
this stuff and I can even see it in
again that video how excited I was and
I've just changed so much I've just
changed a lot in a year so let's get
into the items and I will go in order
i'll also have that video linked down
below if you want to check it out the
first item that I halt in that video was
the vice ltd from urban decay I had told
a whole story about how I didn't really
want this but I didn't think I'd be able
to get it but then I woke up and
happened to be online still so I thought
that was a sign from the makeup God's
that I needed to buy it and it wasn't
that was just me making an excuse to buy
this this crap um I'm not trying to say
this is some good quality I just
definitely did not need this and I just
enjoy my vice 3 advice for so much more
than this palette I really like this
color I solve the brush in it I really
like this color which is called I can't
even road stripe I really like to color
road stripe and junks show probably the
most out of here I actually just use
these in my last look that you guys saw
me wearing just because I don't have
anything quite like them but honestly I
didn't
didn't meet this palette and I could
have been totally a hundred percent fine
without it now that I do have it I mean
I'm going to try to like get use out of
it and use it but definitely could have
been like sixty dollars i didn't spend
and i kind of wish it was sixty dollars
that was in my bank account right now
the next thing that i showed in that
hall was a palette that i bought off of
etsy so this has nothing to do with the
shadows inside but instead has
everything to do with the palette itself
it's a double-sided palette and i really
like it i love that i got to pick the
like print on the outside ice really me
I just think it's so pretty definitely
something that I think looks nice in my
kit it's like shows a little bit of
personality but it's still really
functional the shadows fit really nicely
in here I know it doesn't really look
like it but a lot of these shadows were
broke when I went to my mom's house my
little brother somehow they like fell
off some of them fell into the toilet he
was like so scared to tell me that my
makeup like fell off the wall and
cracked him into the toilet um which
he's so cute I was like it's fine they
were like luckily the only ones i fell
into the toilet were like two coastal
scents once i was like yes you can have
a toilet out of everything you know but
anyway um going into a story but they
fit really nicely in here I think that
the magnitude magnetization however you
would say that works really well in this
palette although I do think sometimes
you need like a really strong magnet to
just make sure it stays on there like if
something isn't magnetized really well
without a magnet i would add it just to
make sure they're not going to be
falling on each other but i do really
like this palette definitely don't
regret it um and it's something that's
just really nice travel friendly i
really like it for my kid just for
everything so just something unique in
my collection and i am happy with this
purchase the next thing that I hauled
were four different colors of the LA
girl lip glazes I had bought them
because people had told me they're
really good i had seen a lot of hype
about them and that they were dupes for
the two-faced one
like the liquid what do they call
meltage for the two face melted liquid
lipsticks I hated them they were like
more glossy for sure I just did not like
them so in a couple different ways i
declared them and they are now gone out
of my collection I'm really happy about
that I don't need them in my life I
don't want them I wish I didn't buy them
I know I think I I mean I can't imagine
them being less than like three dollars
a piece so when I think about that in
price it's like I don't know I think
that's like a lot of money twelve
dollars and I just hated it it's
annoying but I definitely don't feel
like I would do something like that now
I definitely wouldn't buy for of
something without knowing if I liked the
product first which i think is a big you
know step in the right direction and I
definitely don't buy lip products nearly
as much as I used to because I just kind
of know what I like no more and so I
don't I wouldn't have bought those so
anyway I am glad those are gone but I
wish I didn't purchase them obviously
because they are no longer with me the
next thing in the hall was also another
set of lip products they were from the
Maybelline rebel bloom collection I
can't remember the names but again those
are also declutter doubt of my
collection I never wore them at all I
don't even think one time I bought those
products when i was living in winnetka
and when I was I don't know going to the
Rite Aid bias and probably felt lonely
or something and bought them and I
shouldn't have bought them and I wish I
didn't end they're gone now again
another learning lesson for me but
they're not in my collection anymore and
obviously I regret purchasing them the
next product I actually have this is
kind of a short haul there's only this
in one other product but the next
product is from kate moss or Rimmel kate
moss it is in the color rose gold and
honestly I have not worn this i don't
think at all so pretty I've definitely
swatched it a couple times and it's just
one of those like eye shadow sticks I do
want to keep this I don't completely
regret buying this because it is such a
beautiful color and as you can tell i
could not get that swatch off like i
couldn't get it out
so just state like I scrubbed that and
it still looks like that anyway I do
really like the color of this and
although i haven't used it i know'd 100%
like totally regret the purchase i just
wish i have used this so i think this
will look really good with that red
shadow in my finish six by summer so I
think that's how I'm going to try to at
least get a couple uses out of this see
if I even liked it because again when
you buy new products and you just stick
them in your drawer and then you have
like an attachment to them and you don't
want to get rid of them it's like you
don't even know if you like them so I at
least want to use everything my
collection and no I actually like the
way it performs or the way it works or
the way it looks on my skin so I would
like to get a couple uses out of this
and make sure I like it before I either
keep it or get rid of it so um yeah
there's that one and the last thing in
that hall was a maybelline color show
nail polish this polish is beautiful it
really is i have used this a couple of
times in the year that i hold it and i
will not be getting rid of it it's so
beautiful it's just me it's like a warm
purple it's purple with like a gold
green reflex and there's different like
layers and like sizes of glitters it's
so pretty i love it i love this one to
death really glad that i bought this
like I wouldn't nowadays probably won't
go online and try to find it and buy it
but I am glad that I have it in my
collection now so this is something I
really really like so truly out of all
the things that I hold of that video
there are two things I really like the
palette and the nail polish other than
that I probably could have lived without
everything else in that hall but if you
had asked me then I would have been like
no I needed it I loved it girl no you
did it I hope you guys enjoyed this
rehal I'm happy that I get to kind of
look back at myself and I have video
footage of how crazy I was and it's just
helping me to just be better at buying
stuff now in the future just a little
note here at the end I'm thinking about
starting a new series on my channel
called like each month the different
like makeup temptations that I have so
just items that I either I'm just
intrigued about I'm not sure if I want
to buy them there's pros and cons and
just talking to you guys about them let
me know if that's something you would
like to see I just think I talk a lot
about project panning and I don't haul a
ton of stuff on my channel anymore or
really haven't a ton I guess ever but
there are still things I still human
that I want and I just think it'd be
nice to have an open dialogue about it
because yeah there's literally new
things every single day I feel like you
know launching so I was just thinking
about doing like maybe my top five like
temptations and just like we can kind of
talk about it and know before buying or
if we are gonna buy if it's good or bad
or just a place we can talk about it I
think that's it also another little note
I can tell also that I'm getting so much
better at project panning and just in a
better state of mind because I just
watched like two different do well one
was a declutter video I've like a bigger
youtuber and one was a collection video
for really big youtuber and before I was
really excited about those videos
because I couldn't wait to see what they
had i was so excited I was like slightly
jealous wish I had all that stuff and
now watching them it gives me so much
anxiety I just in thinking like do just
throw it in the trash this is crazy you
have so much stuff like when you have
like so many drawers for one category
it's I know it's their job i'm not
hating on them i'm just thinking of
myself you know and I just couldn't do
that right now like I just need to get
rid of stuff so I'm just really happy
again wearing out with my collection
just little side notes here at the end
you know how I do anyway I hope that you
guys are having a wonderful day and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
