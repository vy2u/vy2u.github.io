Lauren this is going to be a rehal video
this is my third rehal that I've done I
will leave a playlist link down below if
you want to check the other ones I've
done out I really have tried to work on
my playlist so there are a couple there
if you're interested in looking at
different videos I also made a project
pan inspiration type of one which i
think is really nice if you're feeling
in the mood or you just want to be
reinspect upon your collection and not
buy stuff I really think that playlist
will help you anyway if you've never
seen a rehal video before this is where
you look back at something you hauled in
the past and I like to look at it and
see if it's something that I like if
it's something I use if it's something I
regret purchasing and just kind of
reflect back on those purchases because
I'm a project painter I really think
this is important because I really am
able to see what worked and what didn't
and just get a better idea of my buying
patterns my weaknesses and just things
like that so let's just get into it this
is a friend's beauty haul I believe the
original haul video link down below I
went to friends with my school it's so
weird when I watch back that video
because I was so new I'm so new to LA
and just like going into those stores
and just like freak to my mind out
because I got a discount and bought
entirely way too much stuff so let's
just get into the first thing that I
showed you first items I talked about in
the hall are some steel arazi eyeshadows
I think that's how you say them again
these are at friends beauty you can also
get them in IMATS because friends is
that I mats at least in the LA area this
is what they look like I picked out some
really pretty colors I don't have all of
them I did declutter a few of them so
this is what I have left I think these
shadows are really good the biggest
thing that brought me and made me get
these is because of the deal I believe
the mats or three dollars and then the
shimmers of 350 plus i think i got forty
percent off so in my little brain i
freaked out and got a ton of them for
the price i do think they're really good
quality i haven't used these in a while
i would say i use these maybe a couple
months ago and i do i really like them
especially um this color here and i do
like this like pinky coral shade here
too as a transition i picked some really
great ones but i think the biggest thing
I learned from these shadows is I didn't
need as many as I picked up it's like
pick up a few of the shades that are
really different or really catching your
eye but just because something is
inexpensive doesn't mean you have to get
all of them or a lot more shadows than
you would have before if that makes
sense I find that when a price is really
good and I can get a lot of stuff I'll
just get a lot of stuff to get a lot of
stuff instead of wow that's awesome
they're only three dollars i'm still
only going to take the three that i
really like these don't have like color
names they're just numbers i'm not going
to bore you with that they will all be
down below i think i can link them on
the friends website if i can they'll be
linked but overall i do you think
they're good and i am happy with the
ones that I have left i just wish i
didn't buy all the ones i did originally
i think i declared about three of them
and there are a few that i could have
lived without too i still like this I
don't entirely regret it but that's my
first item in the hall the next items in
that Hall were these tarina tarina
tarantino blushes I picked up to and I
did get these on discount because they
are i'm pretty sure discontinued maybe
they were only ten dollars when they're
originally 25 i believe the first color
i have here is charm it's just a really
basic pink color it's a mat and then my
absolute favorite this is Neapolitan
Lane I've talked about this on my
channel before this is a mat as well
it's kind of like a satin no it's a mat
and it's like a very much like a tart
exposed kind of color very beautiful
these are some of my favorite types of
blushes that nude color I'm really happy
with these purchases I think that
they're good quality blushes I don't
entirely regret buying either of these
but if I could go back I would only
purchase Neapolitan lane and I would
have just left charm there it's a great
color it's really pigmented and it feels
great but again I just don't use this
enough and I don't love it as much as
the other one I just feel like there's
no need for me to have both of them I'd
rather just have the one I love so this
kind of falls into that first one we're
just because it's cheap or just because
there's two different shades doesn't
mean I need both I can still just pick
the one and that's what I'm trying to
work on this year's just being more
selective with what I bye but still I
think good purchases overall I do like
them next in the hall I had a beauty so
clean brush cleaner I meant to get
beauty so clean which sanitizes your
products but I
so I picked up the brush cleaner instead
I have no idea where that is i am almost
positive i did not use it up so I must
have left it at school or left it
somewhere and someone else picked it up
or something I don't know where that's
at but I don't have it any longer and I
can't even give it a review because I
don't even really remember using it so
yeah that is just lost there are a
couple things in here that are just lost
the rest of my purchases are all stila
items I freaked out even more once I
found out that we got a forty percent
off discount on stila so I bought quite
a few things that i was looking at and
really wanted to try i went a little ham
in the Stila section the first item I no
longer have it was the steel of
magnificent metals I shadow and it was
in courts rose quartz I think I have a
first impressions on that i will leave a
link down below it's the only first
impressions I've really ever done I
don't buy a ton of new products so it's
kind of hard to have first impressions
on things you've had a new story I not
enjoy that eyeshadow i did not think it
looked good I'm just not a fan again I
I'm will refer you to look at that if
you really want to know how I feel cuz
I'm just like not having it in that
video it just wasn't my favorite so I
did get rid of that and passed it on and
no and for the price i think it's like
$32 originally that's insane insane for
a chunky little eye shadow now i wish i
didn't purchase it although i am glad i
got to try it because i was interested
in it in the beginning the next item
that I got is the mind palette this is
the all matte palette and that's what it
looks like in the video I'm like
obsessing over this rust color and I do
really like the rest color but I feel
like I have so many of these mattress
colors because I like all of them and
it's my like justification for buying
every palate and at this point I just
don't feel like it's as unique of a
color as it used to be as you can tell i
have hit pan on that and that is because
i worked on this and focused on it one
month this year and just made sure to
hit pan on this matte cream shade i
think this is overall a good palate i
think it's good quality and i did get it
for thirty dollars instead of 50 which
is nice but i didn't need this palette
and it's nice to have it's good to have
a mic it because it's
and I can use it but overall I wouldn't
go back and repurchase it that's just
kinda how I feel about it I think that's
a lot of the things that I'm realizing
you feel like you need it oh I have to
have it and when you go back a year
later you're like I didn't need that and
if i were to repurchase or had the
chance to repurchase i wouldn't so but
that's that one it is good and if you
don't have a lot of eyeshadows it would
be a good addition but if you have a lot
of stuff i just don't feel like it's
unique enough the next item that I got
the Stila counter was the liquid
lipstick in the color patina everyone
was talking about this when I've got
this had to have it right I do really
like this I think the color is really
pretty I think it's very on trend I do
like the Stila formula for the lips it's
definitely more of a tacky formula and
it is more comfortable though because of
that personally you guys know I don't
wear a lot of lip products I I like a
matte lip but I do like a cream that lip
in like a pencil form like the buxom
ones i know i've talked your ear off
about the buxom ones but they're my
favorite so i just prefer that for every
day i do like a liquid lipstick like I'm
wearing now for fun or for different
looks and I do think they can be useful
plus you can use them in other ways this
isn't what I regret by any means because
I do like the color and if I'm gonna
have a liquid lipstick I'd want it in
this color but I'm definitely not a
super big liquid lipstick girl I feel
like they're very high maintenance you
have to work really hard to get a really
nice lip line with them at the beginning
and then throughout the day obviously
they're going to stay on longer that's
just a regular lipstick but if you eat
something and they're oi it's oily it's
gonna take it off in the middle but then
how do you touch up you have to take off
the whole liquid lipstick or just starts
getting dry and cakey and flaky and just
gross i've just never found a liquid
lipstick i feel like that looks just
amazing all day with like touch-ups i
personally don't like using these on set
I'd rather just touch up someone's lip
anyway I digress I do like this I don't
regret it but I don't think i'll be
purchasing more from stila and the last
thing in my hall was an eyeliner from
stila in the color mint julep such a
pretty color and I have no idea where
when I
know how I lost it I know it was in my
kit for a really long time I'm hoping at
some point I'll just like it'll just
turn up at this point it is lost I do
really like the steel liners in those
like more fun and different colors but I
do think that color pop has those liners
and everyone's giving them good review I
haven't tried them myself but for five
dollars I feel like that's a better deal
so if I were to go back I'd want to
repurchase that color and have it in my
collection but i think i would go with
color pop instead of spending twenty
dollars on the Stila formula okay guys
that's a revisit of the items that i
bought it friends about a year ago a
little over a year ago I hope you guys
enjoyed I really do think it's an
important thing to look back at your
purchases and just see if you like the
stuff that you bought and I think it
helps you when you're in the mood to buy
or you're in a store to really weed out
what you're picking up and hopefully
it'll help you weed out the things that
you're gonna buy so that you can look
back and only love and be so happy with
the purchases you make all right that's
everything guys I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
