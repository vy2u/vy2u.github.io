learn thank you so much for watching I
have quite a few videos to film today so
let's get into it this is going to be
the writer dive tag but this is the
color Edition there are no news allowed
and this was a collab creation tag from
Alex from one beauty attic she tagged me
on Instagram to do this and then also
Dre Sen I will have both of their
channels link down below so go check out
their videos go check out their channels
I cannot remember if I've done the
original record I tagged if I have I
will leave that link down below I want
to say I have liked if I had to bet
money I'd say I had but now that I'm
trying to think about it I can't
remember so anyway like I said the
biggest role with this is that there are
no news allowed not allowed to talk
about anything new it's all about color
and talking about the products that you
absolutely love that are colorful and
bright and don't get usually enough love
around the beauty community a lot of
people like neutrals which I get
neutrals are great I also love them but
I also love me some color so my
collection is not nearly as big as
Alex's I feel like because I don't have
a lot of stuff like I'm realizing more
and more how much I really have to
clutter my collection and honestly I
feel like a lot of my stuff is older I
haven't bought a ton of stuff I haven't
kept up with the ton of new releases but
these are products that I really do
enjoy that are colorful and I hope yours
will enjoy this video I don't know I'm
sure some of you can get some of the
products that will be coming up though
so Alex started with lips and I am going
to start there too
she broke it down like with lipsticks at
her drugstore and high-end and then
liquid lipsticks at her dresser and
high-end is like I do not have enough
categories for that so I'm sorry if you
won't like some in-depth stuff go to her
video but I'm going to talk about some
of my favorite colors of lip products
these are also some my favorite formulas
and just some of my favorite types of
product when it comes to going bold on
my lips I usually go with like a red
orange maybe like a hot pink or more
fancy color that's kind of it I don't do
a lot of like purples or stuff in
between in my everyday life I just like
lip balm
usually the exactly see me rocking
some of my favorite formulas are the
NARS lip pencils I love the satin
I love the velvet max so this one here
is from NARS and this is in the color
it's buraco and I think this might be
limited edition but if anything I hope
this gives you an idea of the type of
color I like this is a nice red orange
it's definitely warm it's not cool toned
and I love those types of colors they
really bring out the blue in my eyes I
just feel really cute and then I like
them with a wing I like them with a
really simple eyes this is just my
favorite red to wear I think everyone
has their like preferred tone of red and
this is mine but I also do like pink so
the other one I have here is let's go
crazy this is also in the velvet formula
so both of these are going to show up
matte and this is a really pretty bright
pink I worn both of these in more recent
videos so I will leave links to those
videos if you want to check out what
they look like on my list obviously my
hair is pink so pink has a special place
in my heart and recently I've been
liking a more simple eye I know it
doesn't look like it here but when I
have a more simple eyes sometimes it's
just fun to bring that pop of color on
the lips instead of elsewhere so I've
really been enjoying this one my
all-time favorite pink that I've just
had again I haven't tested everything so
I'm not saying these are the best these
are the best for me and what I enjoy
wearing and what I wouldn't want to get
rid of in my collection anyway this is
the Too Faced melted fuchsia color and
this is a hot pink see how different
that is from the NARS one this one's
such a fun color to wear out of
everything I have this is the brightest
think I have and I love it I think it's
so so pretty I do tend to like the Too
Faced melted lipsticks I haven't tried
their liquid lipsticks that dry down I'm
not a super big fan of like drying
drying what products so that's why this
one works well for me and last is
something that I feel like is kind of on
the fence when it comes to colorful and
neutral things these are by no means
neutrals but they aren't insane pops of
color positions and a little different
about them these are the Kevin of Kwan
the molten lip colors now you don't have
to have these exact ones but anything in
this type of
realm is going to work these are kind of
like duochrome shifty lip glosses I am
wearing the pink today on top of my lip
color and it does it just looks kind of
like a neutrally pink it's nothing too
big but you can put these on top of any
color you want and you're going to come
out with a different look every single
time this one here is the blue one it's
called cyber blue and if you put that
over a dark color the blues really going
to pop out again with the pink would do
the same and then next to it is the pink
one I think that do chrome or shifting
lip glosses are such a fun way to add
color to your look without feeling too
out there I know that Becca came out
with some I know that Sigma has like
that really cool holographic ones I
think Jessie's Girl has some I think
bare minerals or buxom has one there are
a lot out there so I just suggest if you
want to try something a little fun
nothing too crazy but something a little
different these are really cool and
they're kind of like spaceship e alien
vibes and I like that so I like these
why did I not bring wipes out here what
I'll be back I guess I'll move on to
cheek products I can't remember what she
moved on to next but we're going to do
cheek products we're going to start off
with highlighters because this one seems
like there's not that much besides to a
crimson really there aren't that many
options besides duochrome so when it
comes to colorful highlights and I do
own the anasazi moonchild palette I also
own the Kat Von D Alchemist palette I
have some single shadows sometimes that
are used as highlights but out of all of
those options I wanted to pick the one
that I felt like was the best the one
that I use everything from and I had to
go with my Kat Von D Alchemist I really
like the formula one of these I feel
like you can build them up or share them
out however you want to work them there
are four different colors you can use
them on the eyes on the lips on the
cheeks whatever you want to do with them
they have a green duochrome
a blue of purple and also a pink and the
reason I chose is over the Anastasio one
is because this formula isn't as heavy
and dimethicone E as the other one the
anasazi one also has glitter throughout
some of the shades and on top of that it
does have more shades and it has six
shades in total but the two that are in
there or actually three of them I really
don't
they're little too dark on my skin I
mean I just don't tend to gravitate to
them so I feel like for my money this is
the palette that I can actually get use
out of all the colors and do enjoy all
the colors on my skin on my eyes so I
highly suggest this palette I think it's
really really beautiful and I write that
it's small and compact is something
different
I wish the pans were a little bit bigger
but I'd also go through these even
though they're small and last when it
comes to fade products have some blushes
here so first I want to talk about this
Clinique one this is just like a nice
hot pink blush in plum pop I love these
Clinique cheek pops blushes I have about
six azan five of them a lot of them I
got a lot and I just think this is such
a pretty color the formula of these is
beautiful it shares out so nice this
leaves a nice sheen on the skin it
definitely doesn't have any like glitter
or shine to it but it just looks like
skin and that's what I love about it you
don't with powdery they're just a great
formula I highly suggest these I love
the packaging too that's just a bonus
and the last two that I have are both in
the peachy orange family so first off
this is a longtime favorite this is
mucho mango from amazing cosmetics and
it's a bright orange this seems kind of
scary in the pan but it's so pretty on
the skin something to note about me and
blushes I don't like anything that's too
full pigment I don't want it to be an
eye shadow I want it to be a blush and
something that is easy to deal with
something that I can maybe build up so I
can get the desired intensity that I
want and I don't start off with like
crazy cheeks when I'm not intending that
so I really like this color the finish
of this is matte which is really nice
and I just love this for a really long
time if I'm not picking out like a nude
blush in my collection I tend to go
toward a peachy kind of orange blush and
the last one here this is the one I'm
wearing today on my cheeks this is
Illamasqua Glover and it's so pretty it
is a pastel but it's definitely not a
nude it has a lot of color to it this is
one of the softest blushes I own look
it's the most pigmented out of all of
them isn't that crazy
compared to my swatch of Mitchell mango
this one definitely you can build up if
you really wanted this just looks so
good on the cheek
eeks I love it I love this color I
really wish that Sephora is still sold
illamasqua products because they're kind
of hard to get or you just have to go to
their website and it would just be easy
if you could you know get them with all
your other stuff anyway these blushes
are amazing this is also matte just so
you guys know I'd really recommend all
those blushes will we're going towards
the end is mine I only have a couple
more products to talk about and they all
have to do with eye shadow you guys know
from my less stupid theory than just
different things that I do like a lot of
colorful shadows have a lot of different
single shadows and a bunch of different
brands but I really didn't want to
dissect them I feel like there's a whole
video on its own of like separate brands
and that's my favorite colorful shadows
or maybe a color series I don't know
talking about quads I'm not sure what I
want to do but it was just way too much
for this tag specifically so I tried to
just boil it down to my favorite
colorful eyeshadows that I feel like
overall the quality of every single one
of them is really really good I highly
enjoy them I've used them for a long
time and I feel really safe recommending
like the whole line to guys and when I
look through my collection it has to be
my makeup geek foiled eyeshadows this is
just a selection of some of the ones
that I have I just picked the colorful
ones because this is a colorful tag duh
these just have so much pigment to them
they swatch so beautifully and I love
how reflective they are on the eye I
feel like you guys have seen me swatch
these a million times because they're in
my let's dip it all the time just so
beautiful they are a bit expensive
they're ten dollars apiece but I do
really like the ones that I have I feel
like they're a really good quality this
one I believe is called dreamer so
pretty oh I love them I also really love
the color masquerade
this one's Caitlin rose that one's not
that good it's okay it don't get me
wrong it's not the worst but masquerade
is my favorite because it's a warmer
purple has definitely some like pink in
it and I love that another point if
you're wondering is one of their pressed
duochrome
pigments and they don't have these they
just had them at same expo like a year
ago not this famous well but last name
Expo and I went there to pick them up
specifically and they never come
they never promoted them on their
website they just sold them there and
that's it so that one is called wildfire
I have a whole video on those I'll leave
a link down below if you want to check
it out you can't just get their pigments
loose if you really like that color I
just highly suggest these I don't know
why people don't talk about make a peak
anymore they're ecstatic they're still
amazing even though they're not coming
out with like a ton of new releases when
it comes to shadows the quality of them
is still so nice and they stand the test
of time even as new things come out I
forgot that I did have a couple single
shadows so this is urban decay's tonic
I love the shadow I've hit pan on it you
guys now to do a chrome purple blue
color I love it it's so pretty I love it
I've talked about that so much on my
channel so I don't want to really go
into it too much I will leave the dupes
that I know of down below for this if
you want them but I just highly suggest
that shadows specifically I just love it
and the last English Anna that I have
here is from Illamasqua this is the
color Anya I know nikkietutorials did a
tutorial with this like a long time ago
and then I was sent this from autumn I
will leave a channel down below this is
such a beautiful color I think that they
do their powders just so well they're so
soft they're so pigmented even though
these colors could tend to look really
choppy I feel like because they are a
bit more pastel and the pigmentation
just might be weird they're beautiful I
don't know how to deal with what they do
an amazing job and they definitely
deserve a little more credit I have one
more item guys and I'm sure you will
have no idea what it is it's a brand new
item to my channel and I'm excited to
share with you guys the new love and
that's the Urban Decay electric toilet
oh wait just kidding you guys now this
is one of my absolute favorite palettes
I love it i'm so so heartbroken that
they discontinued this product as you
can see this color savage is like my
favorite if you've looked back at some
of my other videos i tend to do like
kind of like a pink inner brow type of
situation and i use this every single
time when i do that i love it it's the
perfect hot pink it's just the perfect
topping it's not too dark but it's super
pigmented and shows up it's not like
pastel is perfect anyway but all the
other shadows in here are also really
amazing they're so pigmented the only
downside with this is that they do tend
to stay
so even when I take my makeup off at
night and I do my pink brow if I do that
multiple days in a row especially it's
just kind of think there is a little bit
stains I don't tend to mind but I think
that's something to note so and that is
everything for the writers eye colorful
edition tag I hope you enjoyed this I
will be trying to do the another palette
tag soon so stay tuned to that but
that's everything for today thank you so
much for watching guys and I'll see you
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
