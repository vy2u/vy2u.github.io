a look using the lorac pro 2 palette I
bought this palette as soon as it came
out before any reviews happened before
anything and I haven't used it as much
as I thought I would this is what the
shadows it's really dirty I'm sorry this
is what the shadows look like they're
very beautiful but for some reason I
find myself reaching for the one over
this one so I wanted to use this today
and this is the look that I've gone to
the most with it so this look is super
simple to do but it does look like it's
a little bit harder so I hope you enjoy
and if you want to know how to get this
look just keep watching I've already
primed my lids using my Tarte creme
eyeshadow and shimmering golden beige
now for this again I'm going to be using
the lorac pro 2 the first thing I'm
gonna be doing is taking this Sigma e 70
brush and I'm going to take the color
rose' and put that all over my lid okay
so I'm just keeping that on the bottom
half of my lids next I'm going to be
going in with this Real Techniques this
is just kind of a fluffy blending brush
we'll call it that and I'm going to go
into the color right next to rosy this
one here called mocha and I'm gonna be
putting that on the outer basically
third of my eye
this color is quite pigmented so I just
use a little bit of it and I'm just
gonna be again putting it on the outer
now so give it these look a little messy
because we are gonna go in and blend
them out now I'm gonna take this Sigma
e-40 brush and I'm gonna go into the
color nectar it is a matte kind of
peachy pinky color and it's still very
neutral so we're gonna use that and
blend those colors out into the crease
so that we have no harsh line
we have lost a little bit of darkness in
this outer battle corner so I'm gonna go
in with this dark color here called
cocoa and I'm just gonna put just a tiny
bit of that in the outer corner just so
we have a little bit more definition and
it'll make the eyes pop a lot more than
they are now and this one is super
pigmented so just be careful
and then of course again we're gonna
blend that out I'm just using this
Mirabella blender just anything but I'm
just blending it out with Yelp um I'm
going to take the Sigma f7 deep brush
and I'm going to take the color buff in
the palate it is a yellowy cream color
it's matte and I'm going to put that
under the brow bone and blend that out
into the crease color
now I'm going to line my tight line with
Smashbox is limitless eyeliner in the
color onyx and then I'm going to smudge
this Stila smudge stick in the color
Oscar fish underneath my lash line and
then we'll come back and do the lower
lash lines okay so for the lower lash
line i'm going in with just this very
small smudge brush and i'm going to take
that color mocha that we used in the
outer corners and smudge that on the
outer third of the lash line okay and
then on the inner part of that lash line
we're going to go in with that same
brush we're gonna use that rosy color on
that part so we're just mimicking
basically what we did on that upper lip
and then last for I shadow I'm going to
take this pencil brush by Sigma and I'm
going to go in with the color Bain is
here it's a shimmery color I'm not going
in with snow because I feel like that's
too bright so this is just going to be a
subtle highlight on that inner tear duct
area so I'll put that color there this
is just gonna help open up the eye you
can see the difference between this eye
and the side
I'm gonna put some mascara on and I'll
be right back so that is the finished
look guys I hope you enjoyed it this is
one of my favorite looks to do with this
palette it's just very simple looks like
you tried really hard when really it
took a couple couple of minutes to put
on and it is a very warm look which I
also like for my eyes specifically so
let me know if you guys try this out and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
