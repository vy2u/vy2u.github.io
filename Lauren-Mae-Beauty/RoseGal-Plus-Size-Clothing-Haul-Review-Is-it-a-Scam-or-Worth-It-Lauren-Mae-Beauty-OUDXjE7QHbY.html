Lauren thank you so much for watching
tonight I thought I would film just a
couple of like chill videos I was just
feeling cute I got my new firm new
glasses in the mail if you guys have
been with me for a while then you know I
have gotten a lot of glasses from forum
in the past my circle glasses that you
guys always love those are from firm
mail I have a lot of them so I will
leave all the information linked down
below if you want to check these out I
think that they're a great place to get
cheap glasses I wear glasses every
single day on the Reg so like if you saw
me in real life if you saw me a person I
would definitely be wearing glasses if
you guys follow me on Instagram like all
my pictures or unless is because yeah I
wear glasses because I'm blind no I
really can't see though anyway that's
not what this video is about
but because I was filming myself I was
feeling cute I thought that I would film
my Rose gal like haul and review for you
guys if you can recall and it get ready
with me quite a while back I had asked
you guys if you'd want to see me haul
some stuff from Rose gal or like review
some stuff from Rose gal and a lot of
yours are like sure yeah do it some of
you guys are like it's a scam it's a
scam so I mostly wanted clothes we'll
get into it it's gonna be a long video
it's kind of rambling sorry you guys
I'll leave timestamps but I have a very
basic person if you can't tell from my
videos I like black I like graphic tees
I wear my hair in a bun a lot of the
time like I'm pretty simple and so I
don't go shopping very often for clothes
I spend all my money on makeup
hence the makeup channel and so I
thought this would be a great way for me
to like review this brand I like to if
their stuff was affordable because when
I look for stuff I look for
affordability I'm plus size so there
aren't a lot of places for me to shop
like they're definitely becoming more
options for plus-size girls but it is
definitely hard to find stuff so I like
when I can find something affordable and
plus size and the fact that they were
gonna send this stuff to me for free I
was like I'm gonna try it oh but of
course with that I wanted to come back
and give you guys a review of the
clothes that I got a review of the
website and just kind of give you my
overall thoughts so that you guys can
make informed decisions and
decide if Rome's Galilee is a place you
want to shop or not before we get into
the review and I show you guys too close
I kind of wanted to talk a little bit
about bein plus-sized like this is kind
of a whole nother video and topic but
since I haven't really covered fashion
or plus-sized fashion or really talk
about being plus-size that much on my
channel I thought I would just give a
couple little statements here I know
there can be a lot of like online hate
and trolling when it comes to plus-size
videos and people commenting on people's
weight online and yeah that's part of
the reason I'm not doing a trial and
plus a lot of this stuff didn't work out
so it's like I'm not gonna show these
hideous clothes on me like I'm not gonna
do and I'm not gonna probably wear half
the stuff that I got
I just want to deal with it more than
anything so I'm just gonna show you guys
the clothes and everything also with
this I think that everyone should be
comfortable and love themselves where
they're at but I also do think that
people should be healthy so whether that
means you're unhealthy and skinny or
unhealthy and fat
I definitely think people should try to
better themselves and make themselves
healthy so I'm trying currently to do
that and I think that's something that's
really important I know the body
positivity community and movement is
really awesome but I just want to like
point that out to that I do think people
should be healthy too anyway I don't
know we're getting into a lot of stuff
and I don't really want to so let's just
get into the freakin clothes shall we so
they let me pick out $200 worth of stuff
which I thought was freakin awesome I'm
super excited to try this stuff out
because I thought if this stuff works
out awesome I have some new clothes if
it doesn't no will harm no foul for me I
just have to like donate the stuff and
then I can also let you guys know my
thoughts out your way so first off when
you go to the website don't be alarmed I
feel like the websites gonna have some
cute stuff and then have some really
hideous stuff and you've got like you
need to set some time aside to really go
through all the stuff and pick the stuff
that you think is gonna be good because
not all of its cute and some of its
really weird this is like a Chinese
website so some of the stuff is kind of
weird and translated oddly so some
graphic tees like say weird stuff so I'm
like make sure if you're looking at
graphic tees they actually say what you
want them to and you don't like miss
read them or read them really fast and
it's not actually what it's supposed to
be um I just noticed some weird things
some things were really cute and like
funky cute and a good way and I was kind
of like I'm kind of feeling it and then
some of the things were like that's ugly
and then some of the things were like
look it was a whole mix of stuff so that
can be a positive or negative I just
definitely think you should set some
time aside to go through the website and
really look at the different options
that they have because again it's a lot
it's a lot to take in I felt like I was
able to find some really cute stuff so
I'm just gonna get into it also
something about my body type if you want
to check out my Instagram you can I
don't have a ton of full body stuff on
there but if you want there are a few
pictures of me I have huge boobs like
massive boobs
I'm definitely like top-heavy I have big
boobs I have a bigger stomach and then
my bottom half is kind of tiny like I
don't have a butt I don't have big
thighs I'm so I'm like a upside down
triangle I don't know if there's like a
technical name for that shape but that's
my shape so you guys know anyway I'm
just gonna show you guys the first piece
of this is the first item that I got and
this is the only item I have actually
worn out I have worn this outside Sam
had a improv like thing that he was in
so I wanted to look cute I worked with a
pair of ripped denim jeans and this is
really cute and it's really heavy like
heavy material the biggest issue that I
had with a lot of these things is that
the sizing is definitely runs small I
did measure myself and I also looked at
the measurements online and I suggest if
you are about my size and wear like a
size 3x in like forever 21 I wear on the
bottoms between a 16 and an 18 again at
forever 21 just I don't helps you out
but I definitely suggest
sizing up on this stuff I personally
like my stuff baggy I don't like like
showing off my boobies I don't like
showing off my butt I like showing off
my stuff I like like comfy casual cute
graphic tees just like looking kind of
cute
I like the sporty look I like looking
casual on purpose with a little swag um
that's how I would describe my style so
anyway I thought this is so so cute and
I still think it's really cute the issue
that I have with it is that it's quite
cropped on me
and I do find that a lot of things are
cropped on me because I have such huge
boobs they take up a lot of space
and so if shirts aren't either a normal
size or a little bit longer they are
gonna look a little bit shorter on me
and so this one does look a little
cropped I made it work and it's pretty
cute on but that was a little
disappointing if I could I would get
this in the largest size that they had
this is an xx
XL so I think I ordered it in a 3x and
I'm not sure what sizes they have I'm
gonna have pictures also on the screen
of what these looked like online anyway
I think this is the best thing that I
got it does pull a little bit weird here
so like where these seams meet sometimes
that can look a little funky but overall
I think this is a nice piece if I try
this on in store like let's say at
forever 21 um I probably wouldn't pick
it up because it's a little bit cropped
but since I have it I am making it work
and I do I do like it that's probably
the best piece of news that I have for
all of this stuff I'll show you guys my
next favorite thing though with this
order I did try to pick things that I
thought I would actually like that I
would actually wear and I didn't want to
like be too adventurous because I'm not
an adventurous where I like black and I
like I do like some funky things I like
things like that go on my boobs like
popsicles or like weird things like that
but I wanted to keep mostly like grays
and blacks and you know neutral colors
so next I did pick up a card again now
this one is super cute right it has all
these little teddy bears on it and I am
really happy with the quality of this
this is nice and thick it's not like
thin or anything and they're on the back
and front it's a little bit of a longer
cardigan but it doesn't go down past the
knee or anything
this one isn't an X X X X pail but again
these things just run small guys I
definitely suggest like if you are
actually bigger to like you know really
check the sizes on there and really like
just size up just get the biggest size
okay so everything about this looks
super duper cute again because my boobs
are big I would never be able to
actually like
this cardigan on myself but they show
these pockets online right and the
pockets are like in the middle they're
just weird they come up to like right
under my boobs and that would be fine
whatever but the issue that I have with
the pockets is that it's just this dinky
little pocket so when you have your
pockets in it's like this it's not like
an actual pocket in the material does
that make sense like it's kind of weird
so I'm not feeling that like that's just
kind of a strange thing but overall I
probably will be wearing this as well
once it gets a little cooler out it's a
nice quality which the sizing was bigger
I do think though a lot of people who
order off of places where their stuff
comes from China they kind of know that
you need to size up because Chinese
sizing is super small I did pick up
another cardigan this one's all black
again really heavy which is nice but I
can't have the same problem there are
the same little pocket issues but other
than that it's okay it's just not my
favorite like all this stuff these three
items it's like they're okay but if I
try them on in store I would not have
actually purchased them I want to try
them on and like oh those are cute let
me try it on and then when I try it on
out have been like not worth however
much it was you know but I probably will
get used at some point out of this and
you know if I do lose any weight in the
future I think it will only fit me
better when it comes to like the fault
of the jacket I do think that the
pockets are just like kind of weird you
know I have two more type of like shirts
or tops these are actually considered
like dresses and I was kind of excited
to get these this is like a long it's
like a shirt dress
it's definitely short again I think it
just is with the sizing but then my
boobs on top of that also make it even
shorter I was excited to have some of
this like embroidery on it guys know the
material of this is nice so it's not
like weird or anything
it also has pockets which I thought at
first would be like a fun little thing
but the way these pockets it they sit
right on my hips which is like the
widest part of me and it's not
flattering at all so um yeah this just
doesn't look cute and on me it just
looks like a little bit longer
shirt I couldn't just wear this with
leggings or something which I thought
would be really cute with like sheer
black leggings there's no way I don't
know it just doesn't fit right there's
just something wrong with the fit guys
and then this is the other one that I
picked out again I thought this is gonna
be like a nice shirt dress and it's not
it's just too short it's basically just
like a little bit long of a shirt that's
it the material on this
it's just weird material like it's
really stretchy it's like a legging
material like if you're gonna get a
cheap pair of leggings that's what this
is like made out of so that just it
doesn't like flow right it looks kind of
weird um I don't know
it's like quality-wise not necessarily
bad it's just the cut and fit just don't
actually fit a plus-size body or at
least not my shape plus-size body so
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get wear
out of these but honestly guys they just
don't work alright and the last two a
pair of like clothing items that I
picked up were bottoms excited to be
adventurous and pick up some things when
it comes to forever 21 right now I'm
really into sweat and like using those
as like kind of like sport leisure or
active leisure where I usually wear two
Exum forever21
bottoms when it comes to like something
that has a stretchy waistband so I
decided to go up a size I got a 3x in
these and let me tell you these are so
tiny guys these these barely fit my
husband I mean is very tiny you can see
it in my Instagram pictures these fit
him so yeah these are definitely not
plus size at all like I mean you guys
they're not they I don't even know if
these would be considered a large
honestly I feel like these are like a
medium they're just so tiny but quality
wise they're really really nice they're
so soft inside it's almost like a
blanket material I'm so jealous I really
wish I could wear these they also have
some cute stripes they have a nice
pocket and they have a cuffed band at
the bottom so I'm kind of sad that these
don't fit me because they're really
really nice
I really wish that these were bigger and
I would have loved them so much I would
wear this is my promise lies and be
chill chillin
but yeah so tiny guys like not even
close but good quality so if you're
really skinny order off the plus size
all right and then the other bottoms I
got I did try a pair of jeans cuz I was
like I'm gonna try them so this is what
they look like they do fit around my
waist but the issue with these is that
they are not high-waisted at all they
hit me like they hit me in a really
weird bad place they're not cute they
look
they're just look hideous guys nothing
about these cut wise fit wise work at
all I hate them so much
there's no way I could wear them guys I
don't suggest these at all they just hit
weird it's like either hit lower or hit
higher the hip oh they hit me like no
yeah I definitely wouldn't risk buying
jeans from them I think you should try
them on in store or buy them from a
place that you could easily return to in
the United States if you live in the
United States I see you guys know it
came in just like a big parcel bag like
this I mean that's how it was shipped to
me I also did pick up a few things that
weren't clothing items because I wanted
to just try some stuff out so I'm going
to show you guys that I picked up some
spool ease this is just one pack I did
pick up two and honestly I'm like
actually got $200 with the spool ease
because I use these that I make okay
they're great little spooley so those
are great I'm happy with those they have
a pretty big beauty site it's basically
like an eBay a bunch of like eBay type
of stuff so it's not gonna be the best
quality I don't expect it to and it is a
little bit more expensive than if you
were gonna like go through eBay and like
find these sellers individually but
since I could I decided to try out some
lashes as well from them now I have
already used one pair of them but I only
picked up two different styles so this
is the 510 those look okay the reason I
wanted to get these is because they have
a clear band and that's what I like in
my lashes I don't like any
with like a thick band on it I just
think they look really fake and a lot of
people don't want that I know Instagram
does and if you're doing someone who
wants Instagram makeup then get those
but if not you're doing people who don't
wear a lot of makeup often clear bands
like our del stuff is like the perfect
way to go and then these ones here are
the wispies and these are the ones I
really do suggest if you want to try
something wispy and cheap these are
really nice I can feel it a dollar each
everything's gonna be linked down below
for you guys and then I did pick up one
other thing a pair of earrings let me go
grab them really fast though I will show
you guys a close-up of these earrings
but these are like little fish scale
mermaid earrings and they're iridescent
and purple really really cute they
almost look like gauges in my ear the
way they look which I like these are
super cheap but those are kind of the
earrings that I don't like I just like
little easy studs so these were actually
a great Buy and I have been wearing them
and I really liked them so I do suggest
these but do you want to actually go on
Rose gal just to get like a pair of
dollar-fifty earrings all right no
that's up to you so my overall thoughts
for Rose gal um if any of this stuff was
something I had to pay for I would be
unsatisfied so I don't know how I feel
guys I think the biggest issue was fit a
lot of this stuff just didn't fit in
general or if it did fit it just kind of
fit funky and weird um and I think
because it's such a hassle with
everything you're probably not gonna
return these items so you are gonna be
out money if you don't like something
but if you do like something you're
probably gonna get it at a really cheap
price so you kind of just have to be
careful about it I definitely suggest
shopping really safe online picking
things that basically you know you're
gonna love and even if you don't you'll
make work somehow or something like that
if you're gonna do it overall honestly I
just suggest going to forever 21 plus I
section and shopping there I think
you're gonna have a better time I think
you're gonna find overall cuter stuff
you're gonna have less to sift through
and prices might be a little bit more
expensive but they're still really
reasonable at forever 21 for what you're
getting so yeah also I've heard with
people about shipping takes a long time
so keep that in mind if you are gonna
shop on there I got my stuff pretty fast
but they also instructed me to only pick
that would take I think like three days
to ship out or something like it'll tell
you online when you're shopping that
there are different wait times for items
so I definitely suggest checking those
out making sure you're willing to wait
but it might take a while for these
items to get to you because again
they're going to be potentially coming
from China so oh there's a fuzzy on me
this whole time
so all of that being said I think
honestly I don't think it's worth it I
wouldn't shop there again I would try a
different site out honestly that I had
never tried before before I probably
went back to Rose gallon spent my own
money on it just so you guys know yeah
let me know if you guys have tried out
Rose gal down below I think I have a
coupon code it's not affiliated at all
I'm not making any money but if I do
have a coupon code
I will definitely leave it linked down
below I'm pretty sure that they always
have some type of coupon code going on
so even if mine isn't working I
definitely suggest like googling that
beforehand so you guys can save a little
bit of money and I think that's it yeah
I did get contacted by Sheen to try out
some they're close and I might do it I
mean I hope that this stuff will work
out I really want it to I want the stuff
to look cute I would love to have cute
new clothes and I would also love to
share some awesome places with you guys
if they are awesome and they're an
affordable so I might be doing more of
these let me know if you want to see
more and yeah I'll try to do try ons if
stuff actually starts looking good but
if it's just stuff that I'm like
probably never gonna wear in real life
I'm not gonna like show the world it on
the body if I don't feel comfortable
showing like my best friend's out on the
town on a Friday night I'm definitely
not gonna like share the internet it
anyway I hope this review was helpful in
any way again if you want to see more
things like this like a forever 21 haul
or you want me to start incorporating
videos like this definitely let me know
and I think that's everything thank you
so so much for watching guys I know this
was like a weird one a little chill it's
my first one and I hope you enjoyed it
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
