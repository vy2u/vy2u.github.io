different video I decided that I'm going
to go through my sample drawer which is
the soldier here and just get rid of
stuff I'm probably not gonna get rid of
any of the perfumes in here but all
these sample packets I just need to go
through them I totally used to buy
things to get samples and now I'm like
don't need to where I work samples are
available to me all the time if I want
to try stuff and honestly I find that
I'm just letting these go to waste and I
hate that so I want to go through clear
some of these out I know I want to keep
some because it is a good way to test
things out but I just don't need to
hoard them like I was or have so yeah

get rid of half like definitely probably
hopefully more than half but at least
half so I'll assume you guys in a little
bit closer and we're gonna go through it
