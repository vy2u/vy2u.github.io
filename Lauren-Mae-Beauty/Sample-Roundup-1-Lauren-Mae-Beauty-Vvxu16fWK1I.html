today that it's going to be kind of a
new series or just a new type of video
I'm going to be doing on my channel I
have a lot of samples I buy a lot of
makeup or did I've been trying to be
really good you're them like really so I
believe the vacuuming has stopped but
now the banging and hammering has
started so we're just gonna deal with
that I feel like I just do that in every
video like why anyway this is gonna make
my sample random so I'm going to show
you some samples that I've already been
through and then I'm also going to show
you five samples i would like to use up
in you know the next two weeks month or
so I'm not gonna put like a time limit
on it but once i finish those samples up
i'm going to film another video and then
show you five more i want to use up this
is just away from me personally to get
through my samples since i buy products
sometimes because i want the samples
i'll do that so i want to use these
samples up and as I've learned from
using the samples that I have samples do
go bad and that sucks you know it's just
product that's been wasted I wish
someone else could have used it instead
of it just being rotten so i'm going to
show you the samples that have used up
really quick mini reviews since there
are many products and then i will show
you the ones that I'm going to be
attempting to use up within the next
month or so the first thing i have here
is a benefit Porefessional Agent Zero
shine now this came in a cute little
packet like that and it came with like a
brush and the product came in a pouch
like this this was okay I think it did
you know help stop shine pretty much but
it made me itchy um I don't know if the
powder or whatever I felt like it made
my face itchy and I only noticed this
once i started using it and i haven't
had issues like it now that i'm not
using it so that's something that isn't
worth it to me just because I don't
think it was absolutely amazing plus I
know this isn't the packaging but I know
what the packaging looks like and I
don't like it I don't like the packaging
so I wouldn't repurchase but i did use
it up and slightly enjoyed it kind of
halfway enjoyed it except for the
itching so yeah this is a totally vino
perfect serum
this was a very runny serum and it was
okay it wasn't super sticky it was
alright i probably wouldn't repurchase
but i used it up this is the oral gold
cosmetics 24k deep day moisturizing
cream I got like three uses out of this
packet it smelled pretty sweet but also
kind of Grandma florally it was ok I'm
pretty sure this is really expensive i
got this as a sample in my mall when i
was working and they'd always try to
like give it to me even though like I
work at the mall like you gonna give me
one every time I pass here so anyway um
I just thought I'd use it up i'm pretty
sure this is really expensive so i
wouldn't repurchase it I thought the
scent was kind of weird for how
expensive it was so it was okay nothing
too big for me this was the Botox buying
black cleanser this was like a gray
color I thought it worked really well it
was okay again nothing super special I
mean a lot of these samples it's there
just like okay it's like a diamond in
the rough if you find one that you just
love through a sample but it was okay if
I got another sample I would get it if I
got a deluxe sized I would use it but i
probably wouldn't purchase it now this
one was a derma e hydrologic acid day
cream I want to try this because I think
hydrochloric acid is the one that keeps
moisture on your skin and I thought it
would be really nice but I was gonna use
this at night just because I don't like
to too much moisture my students
entirely this was definitely bad it's
not nasty I put it on my face and I was
like Sam small this is a small gross to
you and he said it small girls and then
I just had to wash it off it was so sick
I wish that I used this up before it
went bad but I didn't so I did not get
to use this one but it is going in the
trash this one also was bad so this is
the kodaly divine scrub now I put this
in the shower because I had just
finished up a scrub and I was like oh
I'm gonna use this one up get a mini one
out of my collection this had like a
weird when I tried to skip it out the
first time the top of it was really
tasty like stuck together so I thought
that was weird and then I put this all
over my body and I just did not like the
smell of it it does smell like the
divine oil which i also have but it also
just smells a little bad and just
everything mixed in I
couldn't stand the smell so I did he was
a little bit of it but that was just
like because I was realizing as i used
it how gross it was so sadly that is
going in the trash as well and those two
products are really the reason I was
like okay I really need to just get like
through so much of my stuff cuz it's
they go bad like I figured they're
sealed in like little foil packets if
they're not gonna go bad for like ever
but they do they go bad this is a dermal
clear micro water I got this as a sample
this is deluxe eyes from Sephora and I
really did like this is from dr. jar
chart from dr. jart it is really similar
to the bioderma or those types of
Cleansing Waters i liked it i wouldn't
pay the price for an extensive one like
this but it was a nice sample and it
would be cute to bring with you the only
thing is the bottle is really hard to
squeeze you can't like squeeze the
bottle like I'm trying to squeeze it and
you can't so that made it hard to get
the product out but that's just minor
but it was a nice product inside this is
the lock suit on dry skin hand creams
the shea one I love this this is what
made me put the Shea hand cream in my
februari favorites it is so good it just
works so nicely I use of the sample I
have a couple full sizes of this hand
cream but I'm trying to go through other
one since I know I love this one and
kind of like switch it out so that way
I'm still treating myself in between
that's how I'm thinking of it but i love
this i love the size of this it was so
cute mini it'd be great for your purse
or just on a vacation or something where
you're not going somewhere too long but
it was wonderful this is the juice
beauty stem cellular repair CC cream in
natural glow I did not notice that this
gave me a tent to my skin it didn't give
me really a glow to my skin it just was
like a lotion I used it like right
before right after lotion and then right
before primer that's how i used this up
it was ok i probably wouldn't repurchase
it the smell of it was like any other
juice beauty stuff if you used any juice
beauty it smells kind of lemony and yeah
it's gone I'm glad it's gone I've had
this for a long time I think since if
see ya it was an Ipsy thing and the last
item I used up was the
 enlivening enlivening amino AGI
treatment I really liked this most eye
treatments that I've ever used actually
get into my eye like as I'm sleeping and
things like that so I wake up and have
like this film on my eyes or crusties
and it just grosses me out and this one
did not do this this came out very firm
like a firm gel I don't know I really
liked the way it felt almost kind of
like a primer actually and it just felt
really great i would consider your
purchasing this what i really want to
like get an eye cream I honestly don't
use an eye cream like I should every
night or anything but I was just happy
to find it i came that I actually
enjoyed using because I haven't found
one like that yet so this is definitely
would be on a list repurchase but I'm
not gonna be purchase right now so this
one was good now on to the five items
that I want to use up in the next month
or so I tried to pick samples that I
could use that are all different from
each other just I don't want to pick
with all body lotions or else face
lotions I wanted things i could use in
conjunction with each other just so i
could get through them faster if that
makes sense so the first thing here i
have the wii i think its way royal Ming
firming and hydrating cream I'm pretty
sure you can use this on your face this
is under makeup so you can use this in
the morning or the night and it it's
just for your face so I thought this
would be good to use its firming and
hydrating I don't know those sound like
good things to me i also i'm using up oh
this is the same brand I didn't realize
way to go this is a foundation in the
color light and I've had this packet for
a long time it's kind of a we're gonna
has like a weird opening thing here I
don't know I just want to use it up
because I've had a long time and I don't
I have a lot of foundations it's usually
I over perfume samples foundations
things that are kind of expensive that I
wouldn't buy on my own are you kidding
me we're just gonna go pass it so sorry
guys i'm just going to use this up and
see if I like it I don't know if either
purchase it I have a lot of foundations
I'm trying to work through but if I
enjoyed it I might put it on a list for
future type of purchases so we'll see
about that one I also have the Marc
Jacobs
concealer pen and this is just a really
small sample this is like a one-time use
this item is in the color one rendezvous
and it is supposed to be it's just a
concealer pen but it's supposed to
correct conceal and frightened so this
color I think will actually work for me
number four I have the soap &amp;amp; Glory look
better naked righteous butter body
butter and this is a pretty decent
sample it's pretty full and i just
wanted to use this up i did just get
this one but I thought I don't want this
one to go bad for sure so I might as
well use it and then the last sample
that I want to use up is this imani
minerals foundation primer in serum I
have had this for so long so i hope it's
not bad i want to try this one and just
mostly use it up i don't even think i'd
consider purchasing it really but i want
the little packet gone so those are my
samples I've used up in the ones i want
to use up i just think this is going to
be a fun way for me to try to use them
up in not a very pressured way but just
a way that'll make me focus on them at
least a little bit let me know if you
guys like this idea and i will see you
on the next sample roundup bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
