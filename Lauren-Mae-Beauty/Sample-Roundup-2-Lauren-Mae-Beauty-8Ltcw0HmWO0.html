sample roundup number two I finished up
the five samples i was using last time
imma show you the five samples i'm going
to use up next time I give you a little
review of what I've used anyway let's
just get into the products first thing
I'm going to talk about is this market
really the first thing I'm going to talk
about is this marc jacobs this is the
remedy concealer pen and this was in the
color number one rendezvous for some
reason because this comes I you know I
can see that it comes in a pen form that
I thought it was going to be more sheer
like a highlighting concealer but it had
quite a bit of coverage the color shade
was really good for me and I actually
got two uses out of it I thought I was
only gonna get one I used it underneath
my eyes and I really did enjoy that
concealer I honestly don't know if i
purchase it because it's super expensive
but I did really enjoy it and I wasn't
expecting to so that was great I really
did like it I thought it was a nice
product if I got it for free I would
enjoy it but yeah it was good I like
that one this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory naked
body butter in the cup in the smell the
righteous butter they have a couple
different body butters and sons this is
a really good size sample packet it was
quite full of product but um it worked
nicely it was felt fine texturized all
of that the problem I had with this was
descent I know everyone really likes
soap inglorious ends I'm gonna throw it
out there to me the smelt like a
feminine hygiene product yeah it just
smelt like a pantyliner something to me
and that's not cute to me so I don't
like the smell of this i don't know if
it's just like once it mixes with my
body I don't know it just kind of
grossed me out smell lies so yeah anyway
I would not repurchase the scent I
thought the product was nice and if you
like this end you go for it um I just I
can't personally do the Sun so this was
the way royal mean firming and hydrating
cream I thought this was ok I don't know
remember hating it but I don't remember
loving it either so I just used this as
like a nightly moisturizer yeah I was
okay I don't know I felt like my skin
might have been a little oily when I
woke up in the morning so that was
something but um nothing good or really
bad to say about that one and then the
last two were kind of fails in the sense
of like going bad I guess okay so this
is the amani foundation primer and serum
I used this once and I had more product
in it so i used it it smelt like okay i
don't know i don't know what it smells
like original you know so i used it
didn't I mean it didn't do anything
amazing nothing anything and then I went
to use this yesterday and when I like
poured it out like a black piece came
out of it but the packaging is black and
I don't know if like the cardboard got
like melt that melted but like soggy and
broke off into it I think that's what
really happened but anyway it totally
freaked me out like this like molded
here and like I can do it so i only use
this once I wouldn't repurchase it yeah
it just freaked me out i was like freak
job than I was like Lauren that probably
wasn't like that and then this one is
also a way product this is the ideal
skin perfect finish light foundation in
the color light I don't know I use this
one time and it is very light coverage
foundation but I just feel like it's
kind of bad the smell on it was just a
little weird and I used it that one time
and I just didn't feel comfortable using
it again I also don't like this type of
coverage like I'd rather just use a
tinted moisturizer than use this since
it's such like coverage anyway I don't
know I wouldn't like repurchases if I
got another sample I would try it just
because I knew it wasn't bad but I feel
like this went bad so yeah I just wasn't
worth risking putting this on my face so
those are all those samples overall I
feel good that those five are out I did
use three of them up like actually so
that feels good the other two as much as
it sucks i didn't use them i'm glad
and also because it's not worth risking
putting nasty stuff on my face just to
use up a sample like that I already know
I wouldn't repurchase anyway like it
doesn't even make sense so for the five
samples that I want to use up now i will
show you those guys i want to use up
this coach endo moisturizing foundation
sample its high-definition makeup I got
this from my friends beauty they gave me
some sample so I wanted to try this one
and see how it works I don't know what
color this is it's all I says made in
japan so i want to say it's all japanese
in the back I don't know I don't know
the color it says 123 on it I don't know
so well hopefully don't match I don't
know again a lot of things I don't know
this is the bubble and bubble surf foam
wash shampoo and conditioner I also got
this from the Friends beauty supply as a
sample and I thought this would just be
fun it's summer or spring time here so I
want to try the surf products and bumble
level is really expensive so I thought I
would try out some of their products and
see how i liked it i have this new detox
brightening fizzy powder wash I thought
this would be fun I think it's actually
like a powder inside there there's the
packet I think it's actually like a
powder in there that you put with water
it's effervescent powder kind of like
analysis alka seltzer I think anyway I
thought this would be really interesting
and I heard someone else I think talk
about it and I just want to try it I
don't know I just got this one it's not
let it sold I just really wanted to try
it out the fourth one is this red clear
skin keep young a beautiful instant
firming beauty shop says to put a couple
of drops before your moisturizer kind of
like a serum and it's supposed to I
think kind of tighten your skin and lift
it infirm it so that would be good if
that worked who doesn't love to firm
their skin and then the last one here
this is benefits the Big Easy oil-free
liquid to powder foundation in the color
03 this is kind of light so i might have
to mix it with something else but i'm
gonna try it out and see how i like this
guy and also i am getting a little
darker
now that we're going into summer and
spring and I'm kind of going outside a
little bit more so we'll see how that
one works that is everything for my
samples guys I really like this series
so far I mean this is a little sick one
I'll link my first one down below but I
think it's great i mean i'm already been
going through so many samples this year
and i just want to keep going so that is
everything i'll see you in my next video
