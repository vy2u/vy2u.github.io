channel this video is going to be a much
needed sample roundup video so sample
roundups are videos that i do to help me
get through a sample so what i was doing
before which i'm going to change i would
pick five samples and then however long
it took me to use them up i would use
them up and then I would let you guys
know what I thought about him like mini
reviews and then I'd pick five more and
kind of keep going like that over and
over so not only am I seeing if I liked
these products i'm also using up the
samples so they're not just sitting
around and going bad well I've been
neglecting this I guess segments of my
channel I don't know how you want to
call it so I thought that I would kind
of switch up how I'm doing it now that
again my life has changed so i'm going
to go over some samples that i had
before that I've used up I know this is
more than the five that I had in the
video but I can't remember what they are
they don't have time to look it up a
little sorry I'm just being honest with
you guys and I'm going to go over like
my mini reviews for those products and
then i'm going to pick probably about
like 10 or so samples just foil samples
i'm cutting it down to only foil packets
because deluxe a staples just take too
long to use up and I want to keep this
more regularly i am going to give myself
a basically the month so it'll be like I
want to use up I'm going to try to use
up these 10 to 15 samples in the month
of you know June and then let you guys
know and then pick 10 more type of thing
I think that'll just be easier instead
of having it like every two weeks or a
week depending on how fast they use it
up anyway let's just get into the mini
reviews this is a rent product this is
the Keith young and beautiful instant
firming beauty shot I have not finished
all this up there was so much product in
here and for how much you really need
for your face you're only supposed to
use a couple drops and it's quite a
large two looks a simple so I did enjoy
this and I have been enjoying this I
think it does make your skin feel firm I
don't know if it keeps that firmness so
I feel like it's almost like if you put
an egg white on your skin and let it dry
your fear you know hand or wherever you
put that is going to feel like tighter I
don't know that's kind of how it feels I
mean it feels better than an egg white
but that's kind of
consistency and I don't know just how I
think of this product so I mean I
enjoyed it I don't think I'd repurchase
it I know this one wasn't one of the
ones from the sample thing but I thought
I just talked about it this is the
realest still hydro tensor moisturizing
cream it's an anti-wrinkle cream so it
has a lot of hyaluronic acid in it too
kind of plump the skin and capture
moisture it's okay it just isn't it
wasn't hydrating enough for me i was
using this at night and I should there
is a this is like the liner version of
it there is a heavier version so maybe
that would be better I didn't notice any
like amazing plumping things with it i
only used it though probably four nights
because i had two of these but it was
okay i don't know i don't think i'd
repurchase but i didn't just like it it
just needed a more moisture this is the
co zhengzhou moisture foundation I
really enjoyed this I mean I don't know
if I'd repurchase it was just such a
small sample and it was one time use
like I don't know how well it stays from
just one time but I did really enjoy it
I would probably love to get like more
like a deluxe a sample of it or
something like that but I really i
thought it was good so that one's nice
this is the benefit it's potent eye
cream I use this but then it started
getting really weird so I kind of
stopped um I don't know I really don't
have any opinions and i creamed really i
don't know how i feel about them so I
one repurchase but I don't feel like I
gave it a fair shot at the same time
this is philosophies miracle worker this
is an anti-aging moisturizer I was just
using this as a hydrator because I
didn't have any at the time it was okay
nothing special to me all right this is
benefits the Big Easy um it's like a
tinted moisturizer BB cream type of
product I actually really like this and
I wasn't expecting to this was the
number three and I thought it looked ok
and it was really like more warm tone
which I enjoyed yeah I actually got
quite a few uses out of this I would
repurchase this product probably if I
was dad no BB creams and foundations and
wanted a high-end one I probably try
this one out yeah I was surprised
because I wasn't expecting to like it I
thought it'd just be kind of lame I
heard a lot of people talking about it
when it came out but I thought it was
just because it was new and because its
benefit and
everyone gets sent benefit stuff so i
don't know i actually did enjoy it was a
good product i used up this new detox
brightening fizzy powder wash it just
came in like a sample packet i just put
it back it was ok i got two uses out of
this it just smelled kind of funny to me
it's not just like like a kitchen
product or like a like a food product or
something I don't know it didn't smell
like a sweet or something it just I
don't know it's not like baking powder
or something and it was okay I kind of
like the idea of a loose exfoliant I
think that's cool but I don't know I
wouldn't repurchase this I didn't think
it was amazing I didn't think the fizzy
pneus I think if it had a better smell
it might have been a better experience
overall but it was okay I mean I'm got
to use the sample but I wouldn't
repurchase this is the last one this is
bubblin bubbles surf from wash shampoo
and conditioner I really liked this I
wasn't expecting to cuz sometimes with
surf products with salt sea salt type of
products and also I'm volumizing it's
just when I think about these I feel
like they just tangle my hair they make
it dry and look like straw and I really
like the way that this was on my hair so
i would consider repurchasing this I'm
not someone who spends a lot of money on
shampoos and conditioners personally but
now that I work where I work I would
think about getting this product I sell
bubble bubble of my work so um I might
try try to get this eventually we'll see
we'll see but I did enjoy it enough to
consider purchasing so now on to the
samples that I'm gonna pick to try to
use up in the next month or a cyclists a
month I have just in an overview I have
this is all my hair samples these are
all like foil packets um there's a lot I
have these are all like body care skin
care type of samples and then these are
all like makeup concealer primer
foundation
I don't know blush on paper and stuff
type of samples that was just a little
overview of like just to show you guys I
have so many so that's part of the
reason why I'm doing this series but
let's get into the 10 that i'm going to
pick to try to use up let's do it i
decided to pick out 11 different things
so here they are let's start with i
guess um makeup type of stuff so i have
this makeup forever powder I'm so sorry
about my neighbors this is in the light
complexion so these are just sample
powders in there so i thought i could
use this up pretty easily and get a good
test of how I like this powder which is
the pro finish multi-use powder yeah um
this is the naked flush this is again
just kind of like a paper with powder
products on it so i thought i could try
these out and there's not like a ton on
here but I could just get it done pretty
easily I have two more makeup samples I
want to use up this is the do your pore
minimizing primer so I thought I would
try this it's also supposed to keep your
skin mat which those are the two things
I want Matt and pore filling so or pore
minimizing so I thought I would try this
out see how I liked it and then i have
the YSL to shake lot number two is the
color so i thought i would try that out
and see how it work now for skincare so
that's four for skin care I picked I
think for as well this is Kate
Somerville's exfoliate I thought I would
try this this is like a scrub for your
face and I do have like a bigger size of
this that I got in the popsugar box for
Christmas and I haven't busted it out
yet so I thought I'll know if I like it
before I use it by using the sample and
if I don't I could give it to someone so
I thought that'd be kind of a good way
to not waste product in case I didn't
like it I wanted to use the Tata Harper
resurfacing mask everyone I we sell Tata
Harper at my work and a lot of people
really like this mask and online
everyone loves it as well so I thought I
would try it out it's like a pink color
so we'll see if I like it another kate
somerville product this is the cytosol
dark circle corrective eye cream i have
used the cytosol like serum that's for
your face and i really like that product
so i'm hoping to really like this as
well I don't fight huge huge dark
circles but I'll take what I can get in
terms of help
so that they're brighter so we'll see
how I like that as well and then this
last one for skin care this is your the
last one no I have one more last one for
skin care for like the face I have this
Lancome advanced genifique youth
activating concentrate I'm guessing it's
just like a serum so there's not much
product in here so i think i can get
through that this is laksa tons milk
concentrate it's like a body like lotion
I don't love lotions for the body but I
feel like if it's in a small form like
this I can kind of trick myself into
getting it done because it's like one
use and it's gone instead of a big
lotion where it's like I have to do it
over and over and over again so oh my
gosh I'm itching my neck in every video
lately have you noticed oh um so hoping
this will be good I hope it's not too
greasy that's my biggest fear the last
ones here these are two hair products
this is the KMS silk Sheen styling cream
we sell this at my work as well but I
didn't get it from work I got it from a
hair shop with my mom but I thought I
would try this out so that way I could
recommend it at work if it was good and
I love a styling cream i'm going to put
it in there hopefully it'll help tame
some of this I you know and I always
want to be like sorry for the messy hair
but in reality guys seriously this is
what my hair looks like like that's it
that's me all day or a day I can't help
it and I mean I probably could help it a
little bit more but I'm just let my
hair's be free I let them be individuals
and then blast analysis bumble and
bumble thickening shampoo and
conditioner we'll see how I like this I
want to kind of compare this one to the
surf one and see if I like it I also
have to sample packets of this stuff so
hopefully I like it so I can use up the
other one and enjoy it that is
everything guys I hope you enjoyed this
video we'll see i'll update you guys in
about a month on whether i like you know
I mini reviews on those sample products
and I will see you in my next video I
hope you're having a wonderful day hi
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
