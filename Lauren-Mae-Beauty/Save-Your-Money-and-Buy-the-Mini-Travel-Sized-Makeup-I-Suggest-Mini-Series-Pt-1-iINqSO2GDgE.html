Lauren thank you so much for watching
today is going to be kicking off my mini
series woo I had a request to do a video
about minis and so I was like I don't
know what to do because there aren't a
ton of minis that I've like tested and
then bought the full-size of or whatever
so you guys came to the rescue and gave
me a ton of ideas and got me inspired so
this mini series is going to be a series
of three different videos all about
minis it's also like a mini series it's
like so perfect today's video is gonna
be all about minis that I suggest that
you buy that you should buy over full
sizes now this is either because I
either have the full size I've tried the
product or whatever it is I'll give you
the explanation as we go but you guys
now on my channel that I try really hard
to use the products that I have I don't
want to waste a ton of things and I
think sometimes minis or travel sized
products are a great way to be able to
try different products without having a
ton of excess product that you may not
ever go through because you like to try
a lot of different products you'd like
to test make up and maybe you have a lot
of other things in your collection so
there's no way you would go through a
full size but a mini would be perfect
because you could use it and love it
without wasting so that's kind of where
I'm coming from mindset wise going into
this video but let's end the intro there
and let's get into the minis that I
suggest you buy or I think are good
value in the travel size form up front I
want to say that I think lip product
minis and color cosmetic like for the
face minis are really good deals in the
mini form I'm gonna say mini a million
times like when it comes to a blush you
don't go through a tough wash so it's
really great to get in the mini form I'm
sure you probably won't go through it
especially if it works out with like
fitting your brush in and different
things like that those are products I
think work really well seeing with lip
products unless there's like a known
issue or something like that I do think
that those for the most part are really
good ways to try it a lot of different
things from the line in that formula in
different colors while still not having
too much product but let's get into
number one the first item on my list
that I think you guys should try
something that I've been interested in
is the venti beauty balm baby mini lip
and face set this is $23 and in it you
get a mini
of the duo highlighter and then you also
get a mini of the Fenty lip gloss in the
fatty glow shade I do have the full-size
I love this lip gloss it's one of my
favorites so I do suggest this and I
love that you can get it in the mini
size as well as test out one of the
highlighters highlighters are something
that you don't go through a lot I know a
lot of us have a ton of highlighters so
as much as it might seem like oh I want
the big size they want the full size
like there's something about having that
one in your collection product wise
you're getting way more than you need
even in this mini I doubt you'll go
through it and if you do that means you
love it and you can pick out the full
size once you go through it so I think
that this is a really great set to test
out some things from fenty get
reasonable size products for a
reasonable amount of money I just
realized if my face looks darker than my
chest that is because I tried out some
new products today I'm testing a lot of
the new covergirl things and that is why
also it could just be that I do that
sometimes I don't know the next many on
the list though is a mascara now I have
the full size but I have gone through
many of the minis of this and this is
the Urban Decay perversion bigger
blacker badder mascara I absolutely
adore the many of this and the full size
just doesn't quite compare I feel like
the mini size on this I never paid for I
always got it as a hundred point perk or
some type of sample or whatever so I
don't even know if you can purchase this
mini but I suggested if you can somehow
get your hands on it if you see it as a
point perk or something like that it's
worth it it's so great I love it so much
it's not that this mascara is bad I just
I love them anyone I think the wand is a
little bit smaller this is a natural
bristle wand and it's great I really
love the volume and length that it gives
my lashes but this one just doesn't
quite do it for me like the mini does so
I suggest if you're gonna try this out
definitely you try to pick up a mini or
somehow get your hands on the mini for
the next one on my list was one I didn't
even know existed but it's from Giorgio
Armani and it's the luminous silk
foundation mini this is a foundation
that retails for $42
I just found
in it so a little over half an ounce
which means there's a little bit more
than half of the products you would get
in the full-size the full-size retails
for $64 and that's still a ton of money
for the mini but I think a lot of us
have a lot of different foundations and
it's still less money why would you
spend over $20.00 if you don't know if
this is something that you like maybe
you just wanted to try something
different if you're someone who rotates
your foundations you can buy less
product know what's not gonna go bad
spend less money so I think this is just
like a really great way to continue to
maybe expand your knowledge of makeup
know about different formulas try
something out and actually be able to
try it long-term like you know if this
is gonna work for you if you finish up
the entire mini but you are saving money
and you are not having potentially as
much waste in your collection that's
gonna be like a huge running theme
throughout this it's like I think it's
great when minis can help you reduce the
amount of waste that you have the next
maneuver I have on the list is the Becca
highlighters I did not even realize how
many different shades came in the minis
I thought it was just the opal one that
came in like different sets but you can
buy them individually in the mini for
$19 I don't have the amount of grams but
I do have the ounces sorry guys you get
point zero eight five ounces of product
in the mini form and in the big form for
$38 you get 0.25 ounces of product so
it's definitely less product but again
you aren't going to go through it you
aren't going to go through it to give
you example this is the Becca moonstone
highlighter this is the full-size and
this has eight grams of product in it so
I mean to go through this you have to
use it every single day of your life for
like two years straight and then maybe
maybe you've used it but that means you
haven't tried any other highlighters out
and I feel like for a lot of us who love
makeup it's just not necessarily how the
situation goes down I do have a smaller
one here from Becca this is the light
chaser highlighter in Champagne dream
flashes Bellini this has point to three
ounces in it and this is six point five
grams of product so the mini is going to
be about half of this size or so and I
think that
like a really great size I know it seems
small it's basically the size of an
eyeshadow but I'm telling you it still
takes you forever I've used an eyeshadow
as a highlighter for the past year and a
half now when I use it all the time and
I still have it left so I think that's a
great way if you want to try out this
formula if you want to try out maybe a
different color you already know you
love the formula getting the mini is a
great way to be able to have that
product use that product but again save
some money and not have a ton of waste
I'm really looking into getting the
vanilla courts one that's the one that's
on my list and I love that I can save
money and get to try it the next thing
that I suggest are the milk makeup stick
minis now I have a many of the glitter
stick yeah I know it's a glitter stick
but I also do have the full-size this is
the bronzer in the shade baked I love
this you guys have seen me use this a
lot on my channel I talk about it a lot
but I do suggest the minis if you're
wanting to try out some products from
milk I think that these are a great way
to do that they sell these minis in a
bunch of different ways you can either
get them in two kits with other things
and then they have started selling them
individually
I paid fourteen dollars for this one and
I think that's kind of the average price
specifically and the product that
sparked these for going on the list are
the holographic highlighting sticks that
they have you can get all three of their
shades in the mini so that's something
that you wanted I just suggested cream
goes bad so fast and if it's not
something you're gonna use every single
day if you get it in the mini you can
still love it and enjoy it and use it
but you don't feel guilty for not using
it every single day and you just have so
much less product to go through but you
still get the joy of using that product
like I said I have the big one in the
matte bronzer and I love this and I
suggest it like definitely try this
product out but it's going to take me
forever to go through this I can't I
mean you can barely tell I've used this
and I use it all the time so they
definitely are gonna last you a long
time now when it comes to the like
primers that might not be the same
situation because you're gonna be using
so much more of that product than you
are like a cream highlighter just here
whereas the primer is gonna be on the
entire part of the face but it is nice
to get the smaller amount of product
it's still enough to definitely form a
solid opinion on whether you like it if
it works for you and then if you want
you can always invest in the larger one
the next product that I suggest the
minion or the travel size is the
Brazilian crush sol de janeiro body
fragrance
I love this so much this is the classic
boom boom cream smell they described
this as a caramel pistachio and it's so
good it's so like sweet and tropical I
think this is great for a beach bag or
the summer or just anything like that if
you're gonna be down by the beach or at
the pool or anything this smells so nice
and kind of just like gives you some
nice set vibes this is the small version
it is three ounces of product 3.0 four
ounces it retails for $19 and then the
full size is 8 ounces and it retails for
34 unless you were just you go through
fragrance myths I think this one will
suit you I feel like you probably mostly
use this in the summer so it's just like
that perfect amount of product you can
use it all summer enjoy it either put it
away or if you do finish it up perfect
and then you can move on to maybe a
different scent or whatnot I just think
you get a ton of product in the travel
size so that's the one I suggest
especially if you don't know if you're
gonna like the scent sometimes I get
tired of scents so I like having it in a
small version and I feel like this is
enough product that I still feel like
it's a great value
the next product on the list is
something I haven't personally tried yet
this is the bumble and bumble pret of
powder for the mini size it is $13 4.5
ounces and then just for reference the
full-size is $28 for 2 ounces of product
when you break down that mathematically
it does not seem like a good deal but
the reason that I kind of suggest this
one is one just to see if you like it
prep the powder is something that is
kind of like I feel like a hybrid
between a volumizing powder and a dry
shampoo and I feel like I've heard from
everyone who has used this product that
it lasts forever so this is your first
time trying this product you don't know
if it's gonna work for you I think
investing in the mini is going to give
you enough product again to let you know
if you like this but you aren't going to
be out the rest of the money you still
have 15 extra dollars in your pocket so
I suggest the mini that's the one that I
would personally purchase just to see if
I like it and again if you do like it
and you use it all up that's amazing and
you can invest in the full-size next on
my list isn't necessarily a consumable
product but it is the Vera Mona color
switch mini
I had no idea that they even made him
any I think this is in collaboration
with Sephora that's at least the vibe I
was getting when I was looking at the
pictures and everything this retails for
$14 and again this is something I really
wanted to try I love that its mini
because you can easily travel with it
and for me the reason I would be using
the color switch it's just for eyeshadow
so I don't need a ton of space
necessarily and if I can save some money
on it why not I mean if I really love it
and I feel like I need the big one I
guess I could do that but to me I'd
rather save money get the mini and it
work out perfect so that is definitely
something on my list and one of the
minis that I saw in the site that I
suggest and the last mini that I suggest
is the Urban Decay primer potion now I
feel like you can definitely get the
full-sized primer potion usually half
off at some point during the year so
that is also an amazing time to stock up
on this product or try this product out
for a really good price but let's say
you can't do that
let's say you miss that dealer whatever
it is we all know that eyeshadow primer
is one of the hardest things to go
through you need the tiniest amount of
product this is a very very small mini
that I'm talking about this was a
hundred point perk and I already feel
like this is going to take me forever to
use this has point zero six fluid ounces
in it so not a lot of product but again
I already feel like this is gonna take
me a really long time to use but for
ones that you could purchase that aren't
just perks Urban Decay sells their mini
primer potion for $13 four point one six
fluid ounces of product and then the
full-size for reference is $22 four
point three three ounces of product so
you are essentially getting happy I
think the dogs know I think the dogs are
barking but you were essentially getting
half the amount of product for a little
more than half the amount of money so if
you are someone who doesn't wear
eyeshadow all of the time you aren't
using an eye primer every single day I
think that getting the mini and saving
some money there is a great deal until
you can maybe get the full size on a
better sale or whatnot it's just
something that you need the tiniest bit
of and you don't need a huge size of it
so I think depending on what your makeup
routine is every single day this might
be a really good mini to save some money
have the product and be able to use it
when you need it but again saving some
money initially and not having too much
product that's eventually going to go to
waste because it is a cream product it
is going to go bad after about two years
I mean obviously you can use products as
long as you
comfortable doing or until they smell or
something like that but I always like to
try to keep things that are creams and
can't host more bacteria closer to their
expiration dates than not so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I know not all
of these minis will work for everyone's
different routines but I think it's
something sometimes you have to like
rewire your brain for I'm doing the
makeup math series as you guys know and
I've learned from that that just because
you're getting a better deal price per
ounce or price per gram doesn't
necessarily mean you want to go with one
that has more product depending on your
routine things are different you know
and how you use makeup so sometimes it's
worth it to get less product for less
money even if it is more per gram
whereas in other times it's better to
get the full size because you will be
saving money in the long run and you're
getting more product and with that we're
gonna leave this video today look
forward to tomorrow's video because it's
gonna be the opposite I'm gonna tell you
what minis I think are a ripoff things
that you shouldn't buy the mini that you
should just go for full size and then
we'll round out this mini series with a
bunch of mini reviews so I hope you guys
are excited for this series I think it's
just kind of a fun one to do but other
than that I will see you in the next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
