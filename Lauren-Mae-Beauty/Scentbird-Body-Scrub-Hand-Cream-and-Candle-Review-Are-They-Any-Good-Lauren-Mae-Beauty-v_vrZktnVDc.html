Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm really excited because I'm
going to be reviewing some of the newer
items in scent birds lining you guys
might know them as like the perfume
subscription but they do have their own
body care and candles now and I have
been really excited to try these ever
since I saw them the names of the scents
really intrigued me
they had hand lotion so I was like
excited to try them because we all know
I love freakin hand lotions and candles
and body scrubs so I'm excited to get to
this review I'm gonna leave timestamps
down below because I do have some notes
I'm trying to be really concise and give
you as much information as possible
while still making this a short review
because I mean at the end of the day it
is just candles and a body scrub and
hand lotion and just to be completely
transparent with you guys these were
sent to me but that doesn't mean
anything these are my hundred percent
honest opinions which you will find out
and without further ado let's just get
into the pros and cons of each item I
want to start off with the body scrub
this is the nourishing sugar scrub and
coconut and sugar they have two other
scrubs ones like a mango Kiwi and then a
rose and Prosecco they seem to have
different formulas though once called
like an airy polish and ones like a
melting shower scrub I don't know what
the difference is between all of those
but all of those scents sound amazing
the key notes in this scent are peach
coconut melon sandalwood and sweet musk
and that's something that with all of
these products you'll see I really feel
like they deliver when it comes to scent
which is awesome since its scent burned
you would think and because that's
something that I was the most excited
about with their products because of the
interesting names and I also just love
coconut so I love the scent of this
product it's definitely tropical and
coconut II but it definitely has that
sweet undertone to it so it's almost
like a coconut candy I really enjoyed
the way this smells up the bathroom and
I really enjoy the way this product
works it's very gritty it definitely is
going to get the dead skin off of you
and something that I also love about it
is that it doesn't leave a greasy
residue I'm not particularly a fan of
that there are a few body scrubs that I
like that do leave a more moisturizing
barrier on the skin but this one does
not do that and I really like that about
it I also think the packaging is super
cute it's easy to use you squeeze it out
the bottle it is a little bit tough to
squeeze but I prefer the squeeze tube as
opposed to the tub personal
I just think it's easier when I'm in the
shower and all wet so overall I really
like the product I've enjoyed using it
and I will enjoy using it up my biggest
issue with this though and with the rest
of the products I'm going to talk about
is that this is just too expensive so
with Sanford
it is a subscription box with the
perfume but you can sub in every month
one of these products instead of getting
a 30 day a perfume sample that seems
awesome but that means that this at the
minimum price is gonna cost you $15 for
one product one body scrub and if you
decide to get this all apart meaning you
don't have a subscription you just want
to pay for this it's 18 dollars and I
just find that that's too expensive for
this product
I appreciate this product and I really
like this product but I would not pay
$18 for this product to me based on
packaging and cents and overall where
and just how I think about this product
in my mind it's very similar to Bath and
Body Works and the price of $18 is kind
of similar to Bath and Body Works prices
but as we all know about the Body Works
has buy two get one free and coupons and
all of that so the price you end up
paying is way cheaper than what you
actually see on the price tag and since
this is a subscription box and since
this is like online only and not like in
stores they don't have those types of
deals really going on I'm going to be
comparing these products with other
products on the market but first I do
want to compare this to the other body
scrubs in their line this says that this
is a hundred and fifty milliliters for
eight ounces and so I was like okay
eight ounces that's pretty awesome but
then when I was looking online the other
body scrubs are five fluid ounces and I
was like oh that's so weird why would
this one be bigger but this one isn't
bigger this is eight ounces when it
comes to weight and not fluid ounces so
it's the same amount of product in your
150 milliliters which is five ounces of
product but they decided to tell you
about the weight of this product instead
of the volume of this product so you
think this has more in it than the other
scrubs that are in their line but it
doesn't and I don't know why that is
maybe there's some weird thing because
it's like a heavy granulated sugar where
the other ones aren't I don't know why
that is but that was definitely
something that was deceiving to me and
the only reason I noticed it is because
I was comparing it to other scrubs in my
collection so we are going to be getting
into a little bit of makeup math just so
you guys know
this one I have in my collection it's
from Orly it's the rich renewal
exfoliating scrub and it says on here
it's eight fluid ounces for two hundred
and thirty seven milliliters so when I
was comparing these I was like wait what
like I know packaging can be deceiving
sometimes but I was like there's just no
way like how do these both have eight
ounces and that's how I kind of figured
out that discrepancy
so the aurélie product with eight fluid
ounces in it retails for twenty three
dollars which is a bit more expensive
but you are getting almost double the
product and then another product this is
new mer to me this is the Brazilian body
buff from Sol de Janeiro and this has
5.4 fluid ounces in it and that was
another thing I was like these look so
similar so these are very similar when
it comes to amount of product in it and
this retails for $25 so I don't know
this makes this more in line with this
than Bath and Body Works when you count
in all of the deals and everything and
that's just difficult for me to swallow
because it's scent bird I just don't
think of them as a luxe brand I think of
them as cute and they work well but I
just don't want to pay the price so
those are just some comparisons with
other things that I have in my
collection and how I feel about pricing
I just think 18 dollars for that product
is too expensive let's move on to the
hand creams I was probably the most
excited about these or tied with the
candle honestly I loved the scents so
again I have cucumber and Lotus the
notes on this one are italian lemon
water mint cucumber dewey Lotus and skin
musk this is a more refreshing scent it
has that cucumber in it it's so nice I
really really like it and then the white
tea and fig was something I was really
excited to try as you can tell this has
been my favorite one out of the two
although I do love both of them the
notes in that one are bergamot fig
Russian tea plum and crystallized amber
I feel like that amber makes this seem
like it's going to be a very kind of
like a musky scent but it is still
definitely super fresh and I can smell
that it coming through so on scent these
again get an A plus plus I love them
when it comes to the actual product and
the way these feel on the skin they're
great they're very moisturizing I feel
like they sink into the skin really fast
if you want a more moisturizing feel you
can add more product that's how I use it
at night to sleep but I can definitely
see these working really well if you
work in an office setting or you're
gonna put them on and then all
do things throughout the day as long as
you don't overuse this it's going to
sink you to the skin really fast and I
really like the way that these give a
nice silky feel to the skin without
feeling greasy so again overall with the
product I'm really happy with how it
performs in the scent I like the product
but again these are just too expensive
so again with the subscription you can
choose one of these hand creams which is
a 1.7 fluid ounce of hand cream for $15
which is the monthly subscription and if
you wanted to buy these ala carte for
the 1.7 ounce you're going to pay $16.50
or some of these cents have a 1 ounce
option if you only want to buy a 1 ounce
that is not a part of the subscription
that is just if you wanted to buy it
separately and those retail for $12 I
would consider myself a hand cream
connoisseur I love a good hand cream so
I have some comparisons here like I said
when I think about scent Birds line I
just think of them in regards to Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works
so fathom Body Works has recently come
out with some hand creams and they are
$4 for a fluid ounce so when you compare
that to the $12 for the scent bird fluid
ounce it's just way different Crabtree &amp;amp;
Evelyn is another brand that I really
like I have some here this size retails
for nine dollars four point nine ounces
and this is a raved about I mean their
hand therapies are super popular
products from their line and they're
still cheaper than scent birds and they
have great cents as well so you know I
just I feel like separate is like a new
brand that no one knows about them I
just think that their prices should be
better Sol de Janeiro also has a hand
cream theirs retails for $15 for the 1.7
fluid ounces so for the same price of
the scent bird subscription if you
wanted to get the hand cream with it you
would be paying 1499 which is
automatically coming out of your account
every month or you could pick up the sol
de janeiro one which i feel like their
brand is known for being very expensive
for their products and it's the same
exact price so that's where it's like
price its price point is at a brand like
sol de janeiro but I feel like it's more
of a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks situation I don't
want to just keep saying the same thing
but yeah too expensive for me I'm going
to move on to the candle now this is the
product that I think is the absolute
most worth it out of all of the products
that I'm talking about in all the
products in their own
this candle has five point six ounces in
it it is going to be $15 again in the
subscription or if you are going to get
this ala carte it's going to cost you
$22 this has one wick in it and I was a
little concerned when I got this in the
mail because it is a very small candle
but I will tell you that the Sen throw
is just as good as my bath and Bodyworks
candles which I absolutely love they're
the only candle that I find that I know
is going to be worth the price there are
so many candles out there you can get
them out of pretty decent price but once
you get them home they just don't
there's no scent through your like have
to be right up next to the candles
sniffing to get any scent and I live in
a small little apartment so I can't
smell it in here I mean you know it
sucks so I'm very very happy with how
this little candle performed I mean I
could smell it in my bedroom I could
smell it everywhere specifically this
scent is the Siberian foreign cedar wood
and I freaking love it the notes in this
are cedar wood crisp Siberian fir
eucalyptus floral musky and resinous
woody it's all of your Christmas pine
trim dreams in a candle this smells
almost exactly like my Fraser for candle
from x which is one of my all-time
favorite candles ever
I just finished using that up really
recently actually so I'm really happy to
find a scent dupe for the price of that
candle because that can will cost $50
this is made with a slow-burning soy wax
and you were supposed to get 40 hours
out of this candle and I was very
skeptical about that but I have been
burning this for about 30 hours now and
I have about a fourth left so I really
do think it's gonna hit the forty hour
mark with this and just to compare that
to the bathroom Bodyworks candles these
are a 3 wick they have 14 points
something ounces in them so they look so
much bigger and like so much better bang
for your buck but these retail for 24 50
I believe now and the burn time on these
are between 25 and 40 hours so they are
at the exact same burn time and they
have the same scent throw so that is why
I think this is still an amazing deal I
think it's very comfortable and if you
did get this in the subscription you're
only paying $15 for it which i think is
really nice I do like the packaging I
think it's super cute I love the little
tin you could reuse it it is
hard to get this off but it's not a big
deal I think it kind of locks the senton
which I enjoy I think this should also
make an amazing gift to someone if you
wanted to get these candles since they
are so nice and so compact I love that I
just love them this is a good product
just to let you know about some of the
other scents in the candle since that is
my favorite product out of everything
when it comes to the entire overlook of
it the product the price and everything
they have the cucumber and Lotus scent
they have an Earl Grey and Blackberry
that one sounds so nice a pineapple and
white musk
a rose and Prosecco and then they also
have a vanilla bean and heliotrope I
don't even know what that even means but
they all sound very interesting and
exciting and I would definitely urge you
to pick a candle if you were going to
buy anything I think it's the best bang
for your buck so I thought I would kind
of overall give you guys some thoughts
on these products again I really do like
them my biggest beef is that I guess I'm
a little bit cheap no no for me what
would make these products worth it is if
you got two of these products in your
subscription box every single month I
think paying $15 for two of these
products every single month would be an
amazing deal and that's what I look for
in a subscription box if I'm going to
give a company access to my bank account
once a month and they just automatically
withdraw money I want it to be an
amazing savings that's why I like
boxycharm you are paying $21 for a
hundred dollars worth of product and
when I look at these I'm not saving that
much money by going with the
subscription service the most I'm saving
is with the candle I'm saving seven
dollars with the candle with the hand
creams I'm only saving a dollar 50 so if
I really wanted these you might as well
just pick it up without doing the
subscription and getting product sent to
you that you might not want every single
month and with the shower scrubs as well
as the body washes you're only saving
three dollars so I think getting two
products would just up the value and I
think it would be worth it I think it
would get people to sign up and want to
do it it would definitely make me want
to do and I would do it if it was two
products for the subscription price I
just feel like it's too expensive
there's no way if it was Bath and Body
Works I would pay $50 a month to have
one of their products sent to me every
single month I wouldn't do it and that's
how I look at the scent bird product so
it's just too pricey for my blood at
least at the moment I totally understand
they can price things how they want to
if they want to be a luxury brand and be
that high price they can it's just too
expensive for me and as much as I love
the products I can't see myself
repurchasing anything with my own money
at the moment even though I want to so
bad I love I really do love the cents
I'm still intrigued to try the Earl Grey
and Blackberry the only thing I can see
myself purchasing are the candles I do
really like them so if I wanted to try
the cents I would try the cents in the
candles what I would personally love to
see is them come out with like a scent
every single month either in the body
wash or the scrub or the candle or the
hand lotion and then you get to pick one
that goes with it so you don't get to
pick one item and that's something that
they're creating for that month and then
the other product you get to pick and I
think that would really up the value but
then they could have some control over
some of the items they're getting I
think that would be really cool and like
a fun way to kind of mix getting
something you know you love and getting
something that is like a grab bag and a
surprise but anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope it gave you
some information if you are looking for
it on these items overall they are
really good and if you're willing to pay
the price I think you'll be really
satisfied with them but for me they're
not worth the splurge okay I'm gonna
stop repeating myself and I will see you
guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
