Soren if you hear any bird noises I'm
really sorry the apartment above me is
being renovated so that way someone else
can move in and it just feels like no
matter when I try to film that's when
they want to like saying today I am
going to be doing a tag video I'm really
excited about this one it's called
secret loves and this was created by LS
she collabs with Heather or love Heather
s here on YouTube they both tagged me
and I'm really excited to talk about
some limited edition products and
discontinued products things that have
been here but are now gone I feel I got
a lot of product on my lip right now so
just I'm talking weird that is why
before I get into it I just want to say
if you want to do this tag definitely do
it also if you have any other tags that
you think I should do leave them down
below I know you used in a fuse tag and
going around and I kind of want to do
that but yeah times are kind of
old-school and I want them to come back
they're super fun to answer some fun
questions I think that's all I want to
do will just give you into the questions
I feel like I have a lot of stress to
talk about especially towards the later
question so we'll get into all that when
we get there but the first question is
favorite limited edition or discontinued
products that you purchased owned or
tried now since I've decluttered a lot
of my collection and I feel like I
honestly don't buy a ton of new makeup
it's been kind of hard to go through
these questions and depict things out I
do feel like I have become disenchanted
by the makeup industry and limited
edition collection especially what's
been coming out when I first started
collecting it was the best I loved it so
much I mean I loved anything like
anything that was makeup like I wanted
to get it and put it in my drawers
so anyway going through my collection
was kind of difficult but I do have two
items that I really wish weren't
discontinued the first one is the Urban
Decay electric palette now I remember
when this came out I was like should I
get it I don't know I don't really wear
bright colors and I'm so glad I did I
use this so much if you have opinions I
this is what it looks like it's so so
pretty and honestly I just feel like the
formula of these is so good I love the
shade savage you guys know that I love
that like everything about these was so
great I just think this is such an
awesome talent and I think it's sad that
they've discontinued it especially
because I really don't feel like they've
replaced this with anything
better so it's just like a missing hole
in their collection to me if you get
your hands on it still I do suggest it
and the other item that I have here that
I wish wasn't discontinued is a blush
from Torino Tarantino now if you've been
with my channel for a while you already
know about this but this is the color
Neapolitan Lane it's just a really
pretty nude color there's nothing not
special about it there are a lot of
shades similar to this but I just think
that the formulation and the color of
this is just so pretty I want to talk
about it all the time but it's been
discontinued for quite a while now so
it's really hard to get your hands on I
got this in store and I think that's
part of the reason that I was able to
get my hands on it I just picked it up
on a whim I didn't do any research I
just saw it was like yeah I'll get that
and I just loved it so I wish that Teran
Tarantino products were like sold more
places I feel like they're really only
sold on like discount sites and I wish
they were back in Sephora or in a more
readily available space so those are my
two items that's really it honestly I
don't know I feel like a lot of stuff
that I have it's newer
either is it limited edition or is
limited edition but it's been around for
a really long time so you could still
get it now so there was no gap of like
oh man we can't get it question number
two what's your least favorite item
that's limited edition or discontinued
that you purchased right or open again
this was kind of hard for me but I have
two items actually I thought I only had
one but I have two the first one would
be the lorac I love brunch palette I
hated that palette I wanted to like that
palette so much so so much but it was no
bueno
I will leave my review video linked down
below if you want to check that out but
yeah it was not good it was really not
good yeah yeah I'm not even to go into
it and the other pot I was disappointed
with and it's kind of like I didn't
realize until afterwards that I was is
the Kat Von D star studded palette it
was a Holiday Collection palette and I
wanted it so bad I've missed out on the
palette before that the previous palette
so I was for sure like I'm going to get
it I can't wait so excited they have
like this really pretty like orange e
red shade in it but I thought it's so
beautiful I never use that palette I
forced myself to use it I could tell it
bingo to force myself and I ended up
muttering that palette I just feel like
the quality really wasn't there I don't
know what my brain was telling me I
don't know I just the whole mishmash of
the palette to the colors in it I get
that they have these little claws but it
just wasn't for me and I feel like I
told myself over and over it was for me
and it wasn't those are probably my
biggest regret purchases that our
limited-edition that I can think of
number three was there a collection that
got away now if you would ask me this at
the beginning of my collecting at the
beginning watching YouTube even though
even a year ago I feel like I've come
full circle I really feel like there are
stages with makeup addiction so when I
first started I like wanted everything
everything was great you want everything
to have you want to have all the naked
palettes because it's a complete set and
you want to have everything then I went
to project painting and I would like the
opposite like so guilty about buying
stuff I don't want to buy anything I'm
like obsessing now over using products
instead of buying products but it's
definitely I'm just taking that passion
that I had for collecting and moving it
to using things up but it's still like
unhealthy if you like and now I feel
like I'm at a place where I'm just like
in the middle I love makeup and I
enjoyed looking at the new releases but
I also have enough self awareness to
people like no they're not going to play
me like that or I don't need that or
yeah I really want it but I think I'll
be fine if I don't have it so anyway off
on a tangent but when it comes to things
that are more recent the only thing I
can think of is I really do like the
Anastacio palette and I really wish I
got the Mario palette
looking at it it just it didn't look
that amazing but I feel like it's
something I would really enjoy having in
my kit I feel like it's something I
would get a ton of use out of I would
use all the time it's fine that I don't
have it but it's like the one thing like
if it came back I might actually like
just purchase that one because I do wish
I got it you know yeah that's probably
the one thing I can think of because
everything else that I thought I needed
I've decluttered that I actually bought
so I know I know for sure anything I do
buy I definitely didn't maybe we are
question number four having a paper here
what I am or collection do you wish was
permit
here are my thoughts on limited-edition
stuff I don't have a problem with things
being limited-edition I think that
that's the whole fun of them that they
aren't going to be here forever that
they're kind of like this blip of a
dream this blip of inspiration and then
they're gone
we're on to the next season we're on to
new things I think that makeup can be
just like trendy and I think it's cool
to like move on to the next thing not
like super consumerism but just like
it's okay to change what you like and
what you want to use in different
seasons or when different collections
come around so I don't really feel like
there's something I really wish was
permanent I think if you really want
something and it's limited-edition I'm
like you know you might have to be a
little crazy and stand by it
I don't know I feel like something else
will come along or you can find
something to dupe it that's very similar
to me it's all about the inspiration and
I'm definitely the type of person who is
really into things and then moves on and
I like that limited-edition collections
can give you a look into different
things that people are being inspired by
or the different muses that they're into
I don't know so personally I really feel
like there's nothing that comes to mind
that I wish was permanent because I
think that there's always something new
around the corner and potentially
something better so if you really did
miss out it's like there's something
better coming don't worry
or you can dupe it if you really want to
I don't know is number five what do you
think about items that were labeled
limited edition but then come back oh we
got some drama for me it's all about
intention I have a problem with brands
that are trying to create a shortage of
their product or making it seem like
there's a shortage of their products to
make hype happen to make people go crazy
to have people will just like buying in
a frenzy where's the marketing
strategies that is to make things
limited-edition but then create a
certain amount of product but then hold
it and then release some and hold it and
release them like I guess that's a
genius marketing strategy but I just
feel like ethically it's it's totally
 up and it's just - it's just a
money grab you know when I hate that I
mean I get that
everything in all businesses are there
to make money that's their sole purpose
but I just wish there was a little bit
more ethics behind it I just wish that
it wasn't to create this crazy frenzy
and demand instead of their actual
product and because they're actually
good was creating that demand and not
they're like weird fake universe they're
creating for example like Bennet oxygen
on a sunset palette I feel like the
intentions on that were to be
limited-edition I don't think that she
had that palette and then was going to
bring it back a million times and say it
was and make it permanent
but because the demand was so big she
made it permanent and she's like they
are going to be here until fall which is
a long time it's also in time for
correctness I don't know I think you
just have to look into companies and
look into what they do what they sell
how they are when it comes to you their
different releases and you just have to
put your faith in them and hope that
they're not being a bad company and if
you feel like they aren't do not support
them and don't buy from them I don't
have a problem with things coming back
necessarily but I also do think that
again that's the front of
limited-edition and that's why it's like
you know it's fun not everyone's going
to get it you might be one of the lucky
ones there are only so many stuff like
the fun part about it to me and the fact
that again like it's not coming back
like even the mario palette it's like I
know that's not going to ever come back
yeah part of me is like oh but it makes
me think fondly of the collection
instead of it being like oh I can still
get it online if I want it right now
four months later or whatever I
definitely see why people are upset that
things are limited-edition and then come
back like within two weeks or whatever I
wish that they were just more
transparent about that even like hey
we're going to do like seven restocks
I just wish it was more transparent I
guess and I'd be way way better with it
okay let's just move on number six what
do you think about brands reusing shades
I'm personally not a fan of brands
freezing shades unless it's like part of
the inspiration of the collection like
urban decay belongs
well herb inque always does it but
sometimes we'll do collections that are
like 20th anniversary and they'll bring
back a bunch of shoots that are really
popular from their collections and I
think that's kind of cool that's the
whole inspiration for the palette is
that they are rereleased shapes but when
it comes to a palette
that's out and it has the same color in
it like to face does tart does Urban
Decay does just so many brands it
lessens the value of the palette to me
because I already have the shadow
why would I purchase something that half
the shades I already own in my
collection I just wish that they were
giving us a better reason to want to buy
it
besides packaging besides hype besides
the fact that it's limited edition focus
on the product I want the planet to be
the reserve the price is high and not
unwanted from sorry about Sam and I just
honest Angie I don't want to step up
with it because look now I'm like where
was I I decide about this in my new
beauty release video where makeup geek
has a palette and they want to charge
$50 for it but then there are like four
shades that you already probably have in
your collection because you can buy them
individually and so to me if you're
going to do that you have to think of
price point and you have to think like
well who or who is this for is it for
people who love makeup equal then they
probably already have those let's offer
them something new let's offer them
something else or let's offer them this
even though they might have at a great
price No - no okay next number seven
what do you think about holiday
collections I love holiday collections I
don't feel like I love them as much as I
used to they were so exciting to me I
love palette I love set I love getting
things are a better discount I'm it is
hard for me to buy a single like blush
or a single bronzer it hurts me um
whereas if it's in a set I definitely am
like oh I can spend fifty five dollars
and get a bunch of things or get a bunch
of different eyeshadows but to buy like
a single eyeshadow is like twenty
dollars you know anyway so I like I just
like sets in general I love palette so
holla time is like the bonanza man you
have everything and so I really do like
them I do feel like I'm disillusioned
with holiday the more I get into it the
longer you've been in the game the more
you've seen you know how everything is
repeated itself you see the quality
changes which people have been calling
out in the last couple of years it's
just a little sad to me about some of
the brands and how they use this time
again as a cash grab instead of creating
some really cool products for
people especially - now that the makeup
industry and beauty in general is such a
big industry they know that people
aren't just buying their gifts for their
loved ones they know that like people
collect this stuff that people are like
diehard fans and I just feel like it's
kind of insulting when they don't come
out with something really awesome or put
thought into it more than just trying to
sell some units for Christmas so number
eight what would be your dream
limited-edition collection now I want to
live in line eventually so I don't
really want to give away anything like I
know it sounds so weird and whatever
there's like collections that I always
think of in my head but for me I can't
think of a person or a genre I don't
know I can't think of like things like
that off the top of my head I just like
inspiration like I want to see inspired
thing if you want to make a collection
based off of Catwoman and like Wake Tech
suits like I am so down show me some
images show me some like bomb makeup
tutorials show me that collection and I
am like down and willing to like totally
buy into that I just want to buy in I
want to see your inspiration come to
life in these shadows and I want I want
that feeling like that's what I'm into
that's what I crave and I feel like so
many of these palettes are just so tired
tired so anyway it could be a place it
could be a feeling it could be a picture
it could be I don't know it could be so
many things
but I've long run like into it you know
when you sell it I think that's so cool
and that's what I want to see more of
and that would be my dream collection is
brands just branching out doing
something other than freaking neutrals
man but yeah so I don't have like a
specific collection in mind so I'm sorry
that's not that exciting but anything
could be exciting if you're putting
enough work and thought into it I feel
like even the peach collection from 2p
I'm not really into it but I do like
that they like went with the same one
went for it yeah it's peaches and maybe
a little childish but they definitely
went for it you know it's definitely a
it's just more being inspired by stuff
instead of just putting a random
collection of eyeshadows in a pallet and
trying to sell it to me
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope that I made sense I probably said
inspiring a million times and personally
a million shopping let me know your
thoughts in the comments down below and
again if you want to do this tab
definitely do it it's super fun to kind
of just reflect on your collection and
what you have limited-edition because
honestly I thought I had more limited
edition stuff and I feel like I do and
I'm realizing that although I may want
something that limited edition in the
moment I'm not missing it now and when
this tag comes up I can't think of
anything so you might be in a different
place with that than I am but it's
definitely cool to look back and see
anyway about to everything I'll stop
rambling and I will talk to you my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
