we oh there's a flood get another story
and we're gonna go over to this tunnel
wait to be very careful there's cars all
around I'm scared you scared me so much
I saw that part with something this hole
okay this is tell rock how cool I think
serious I'm excited
let's go underneath it and then we'll
leave we'll go into the next cool thing
can I go on top a tunnel rock this is
the other side that's our car over there
so it looks like the road used to go
through tunnel rock which would have
been awesome but it looks like they
stopped for the awesomeness the Flies
are still around
Oh Mike Sam's on the Todd I went to the
other side
there's a long tunnel wrexham he's still
up there guys he's gonna get down I'm
gonna videotape it in case you fall so I
can give it in to America's Funniest
Videos also just known as the internet
now oh I hope you don't die from this
whole Hans I hope you're more spry than
that safely down the mountain
I'm so pretty I love it it's been so
cloudy the last couple times
stopped off again and the view is so
beautiful and we are going to be
climbing up let's turn around we're
gonna see the largest tree by volume in
the whole world service general service
yeah it's gonna be awesome it's so nice
out we stopped by out here and it's just
so beautiful these trees are massive and
the foliage is like so pretty it's like
this I don't know pink
yellow peach it's so beautiful
this is I'm saying how can you even see
the fog is pretty intense up here
well sunny one just the clouds
is that bad there's that difference
we're just hanging up in the clouds
house so beautiful retreat Sherman tree
of General Sherman's
these trees are ginormous if you see
them like just look how big they are
they're huge
these ones are all kind of timing you
didn't put there are big ones those are
the trees we haven't got to the big tree
yet but look I know look at the clouds
and
kind of makes it a little eerie there's
a crow kind of scary I feel like in
these vlogs I just seemed scared of
everything so off in the distance
not this dream not this tree but this
one this foggy one is General Sherman
and if you can see all of this this is
how big it is if it were standing here
it would take up all these stone area
this is General Sherman
he's been here for how many years two
thousand two hundred years and it's like
if we were a mouse looking up at a
six-foot tall human that's what we are
looking up at this tree so here's the
tree there it is in all of its color
actually it's probably only unfortunate
and then you really can't see much more
because of the cloud
but it's huge its massive are the tough
twins Sam go stand in the hope in the
corner
they got hit by fire so that's Sam Sam
six two and this tree is math and then
this is the twenty one next to it yes
again I mean that's a tree the whole
thing is a tree it's insane
okay I thought we would update you guys
we are gonna have some food after
everything General Sherman I'm done that
this is the sign but not always be half
of it I'm a little elephant windy road
down
January
you're gonna you know I'm so happy so we
just had to there it was okay about 2.8
20 we've decided on to waiting like
solid good food
no I just saw I want to do is like super
great but it wasn't that long sunset
yeah too little too pricey for what it
was but you can't beat the location on
the way back down
it really really can't beat it ya know I
think it's good that
I just wanted to end the vlog here we
had a good day and it's dark out so you
can't see anything anyway I have like 3
hours to get home so hopefully we can
get some Vietnamese coffee on my own
happy created
