this video because it's the same day hi
guys this video is going to be about all
of my duochrome Sephora limited edition
like they all have beachy names
eyeshadows I'm going to do some swatches
and just like a mini review on these I
have all six colors and overall I really
like them I think they're great quality
I want to say these are 11 to 13 or 14
dollars a piece are they that much geez
I'm crazy if they are I mean not that I
don't like them but a lot of money on
single eyeshadows but I just thought I
would do some swatches for you and give
you a little bit of review I'm gonna do
it on each color overall I think they
are good I think all duo Chrome's kind
of are different though even though
these are in the same collection I feel
like the vibrancy of the duochrome
changes with each color I'm just gonna
get straight into swatches show you guys
what they look like and kind of tell you
my thoughts on each color specifically
this first color is iridescent shell
this is a super beautiful color and this
is probably my favorite one out of all
of them it is a purpley silver color and
then it does have flashes of pink on it
and like a green it's absolutely
beautiful if you were to get one this is
the one I would highly recommend I just
think it's so pretty I love doing this
and then like blowing out a really warm
purple lavender color in the crease and
just bringing out that purple pink
duochrome that this has this one's a
really beautiful one all of these I will
mention right now to have shimmer like
they have shimmer and Sheen and then
they also have glitter so just a little
bit of a warning on that if you don't
like glitter then these probably aren't
for you but I do find that if I use
these with the glitter base you don't I
don't see any problem with them but
they're definitely not everyday everyday
like my shadow so the next color I have
here is the color seahorse that's what
it looks like there this one I feel like
the duochrome on the
is not as good as it could be really you
know it looks really burgundy in the pan
but see that it's really like a black
bass at the burgundy shift when you want
to swatch this I feel like it looks
darker than you would expect it to be
because you'll see it in the light but
anyway that's it's watched right there
but it's see how it's like it's like
black but then it shines Burgundy that's
what this one looks like I still like
this color I don't think that it's like
insane or like amazing I personally
don't think the duochrome is that
amazing I don't even know if I'd call it
a duochrome like that I mean I'm again
not trying to give just like this
negative review it is still really
pretty and it does shine really nice I
just love when they are like more
vibrant and more just unique and
different like there's a reason I got
this shade instead of something else and
I'm gonna keep them all on here so you
can kind of see the difference between
them all I don't know I thought that'd
be nice the next color I have here is
the color stormy seas this one's really
pretty blue color and this one flashes
like a purple I'm gonna see if I can get
it in camera flashes like a purple and
also like a teal really really pretty oh
it's like a beetle do you see that oh
yes it's so pretty so this one I think
is absolutely beautiful I definitely
recommend this color I think you could
definitely make it look more purple or
more blue depending on like the base you
used with it or the other colors you
used I think this one's great definitely
one worth picking up I wish you could
see it better but it definitely has like
a purple to it like when you see it in a
certain light it's blue and then it's
purple it's so pretty so I really like
that one and although that one is dark
it doesn't look it's not like a black
base you know it's definitely a blue
base that flashes purple the next one I
have here is hidden treasure this is
like an olivey green gold color and it
kind of is in like a black base but
there's quite a bit of gold shimmer in
it
very pretty really like the Sun to you
that's it there it is definitely olive
green but then it has like in some
lights it looks like darker like has
more black within in others it's more
golden I think it's really pretty and it
would look really good on the eyes but I
don't think that the dual chrome in it
is absolutely like spectacular so this
is one that if you were only getting a
couple maybe is on the bottom of your
list of ones to get unless you super
love just that type of color but yeah
it's pretty definitely like on the hand
more like olive green then I feel like
it looks in the pan and the pan to me it
looks like this golden all oven it looks
more like khaki darker green on there
which could be part of like that
black-ish or darker base coming through
the next color how here is sirens charm
this is kind of like a burgundy a
burgundy brown color it has like this
purpley pink kind of shine to it again I
wouldn't call this duochrome necessarily
it's definitely like more of a weak duo
problem if you're gonna call it that but
I really do love the shade I would I
would recommend this shade it is like a
topi purple but more burgundy but then
also has like a pink flash to it it's
really pretty like see oh it looks pink
in that light I really like this one I
think that this is definitely like in
the top three so far that i've swatched
for you guys so definitely this one
which is again sirens charm that's a
great one but it's not gonna be like
classic like you turn it one way and it
flashes a color it's not like that but
it just has this pretty like under
glowing like lumination of that like
pinky gold color it's really pretty this
is the last one this is called mermaid's
tail and it is like a dark blue this
one's super pretty but so this is stormy
seas and then this one is mermaid's tail
so although this one looks more blue and
it's washed out I feel like you lose
some of that blue so I'm gonna see what
it looks like up against this one wants
it swatch
this one's also very much like a beetle
I feel like these swatch so similarly
you definitely don't need both so that
one right there is mermaid's tail and
not a stormy sea this one is just
definitely more of a grey blue and not
as vibrant but it definitely they have a
similar duochrome tendency to them with
that like purpley shimmer I really don't
think you need both I think both are
beautiful I really couldn't pick one for
you again I'll put them next to each
other just so you can see this one is
more blue and you could probably bring
the blue out more if you put like a
different base on it this one's more
like grey blue but they both flash
purple so I feel like you can get a
similar effect with either of these
depending on the basis you use I'm gonna
go back over the colors again with the
names and the swatches kind of more
close up the top one here is called
Sirens charm this one here is called
iridescent shell this one here is called
seahorse this one here is called stormy
seas this one is hidden treasure and
this one is mermaid's tail I really hope
this swatches and my little bit of a
review were helpful for you guys I'm
really into duochrome and I don't think
all duo chromes are created equally some
in a collection especially with this one
I feel like our spectacular wears other
ones you can see the dual chrome but
it's not as spectacular so again my top
suggestions for you would be oh they're
all so pretty I mean looking at them
swatch they still are pretty so I don't
want you to think that any of these are
just crappy or that you'll be
disappointed I don't I don't feel like
if you if you know we were going into
you'll feel disappointed really with any
of these colors but my top three would
be your doesn't shell that one there
this one which is Sirens charm and then
it's a tie between stormy seas and
remains tail I think both of those are
super pretty so I hope this was helpful
again I did have a request to get this
video out I do have one other video I
need to film still which is like a
makeup look in one of my videos so I
I'm gonna get that going really soon and
I just wanted to get this one out there
as soon as possible because these are
limited edition and I don't even know if
they're still selling them on the
website so hopefully they are and you
guys can get your hands on them if you
want to but that is everything for this
video I will see you in my next one bye
