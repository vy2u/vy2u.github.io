learned thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a Sephora haul I was
looking through my Sephora stuff and I
have not ordered anything from Sephora
since January I think I bought the
alchemist palette note the pastel goth
palette I think that's the last thing I
bought from Sephora so it's been a while
from purchasing specifically from there
it has some gift cards and this is kind
of a big haul I'm trying to be really
really good though of like returning
things that I think aren't going to work
for me or that are damaged or anything
like that so we'll just get into the
hall I've had this stuff for just a
couple of days so I have a little bit of
opinion I'll talk about that as we go
let's do this I got a lot of free little
samples to kind of like stocked up I
like cashed out almost all my points
because I was like I don't really
purchase from Sephora so there's no
reason to like have these hanging out so
anyway I'll stop talking let's get into
it the first thing I want to talk about
is from buxom and I did pick up another
one as they're full on lipsticks now I
have the shade dolly which I'll know I
love and I also have the shade Sydney so
I was looking at the website and I
thought that the shade San Francisco was
kind of something I would enjoy I wanted
to pick up another one because I love
the formula I just think these are great
I'm wearing this today on my lips and I
think it's nice it's not my favorite
it's not like the best compared to
dollar like nothing will beat that one
of my thinking but I am going to try
this out a little bit more I feel like
some things that have really good first
impressions and sometimes it just takes
me a while to love something so this is
something I will be keeping in my
collection and trying out and seeing if
I like next I think that's something
that I think most people will think is a
little weird but this is something I
wanted to try for the longest time this
is the Too Faced natural matte palette
now I remember when Casey Holmes first
got this she was like raving about it
and I don't know why that I really just
wanted an all matte palette I liked the
colors in here I liked that this wasn't
overly warm like there are some nice
warm shades but it's not just like
oranges and I've really been into kind
of neutral Browns lately I really don't
like like the color Bellaire from
colour-pop
or something like that so I wanted a
palette that I could have just all the
colors and mostly just want to try this
out so I have been liking it I've used
it a couple times now and I just think
it's a nice one it worked in my kit as
well so overall I just thought this was
like a nice addition to my collection
and I will say
those little pallets are so inexpensive
compared to what pallets are getting up
to I think that was 36 or 38 dollars
whereas like Urban Decay palette they're
starting to go all the way up to like 54
it's crazy
so I also really enjoyed that the price
wasn't insane the next thing I picked up
were some mascaras the reason I think
this up is because it has my favorite
mascara in it the Urban Decay perversion
but it has also a bunch of little minis
to try so it also has the tarte mascara
of fox and mascara a Lancome mascara as
well as the Bobbi Brown and this oh my
gosh like I didn't know that was going
to happen come on the price on it is 28
for all these little samples which i
think is pretty good on its own honestly
but the thing with this is a gimmick I
guess but the good iMix is that you get
a certificate to go pick out your
favorite one in the full-size once
you've tried them all so I already know
as love the perversion so I can always
get that but if one of these capture my
heart I can always get one of those so I
think that's really cool to find a way
to try a bunch of different mascaras and
also still get the full size that's one
thing you really do love so I am really
happy with this this looks definitely a
really good purchase for me the next
item that I have here is hoola light I
decided to pick this up because I have
just been wanting just bronzers that
aren't so intense and something I can
kind of build up this is what I'm
wearing today and I do actually really
like it I was kind of scared looking at
it that I wasn't going to show up
because when i swatched it on my hand it
really didn't do anything but it does
look nice and I do like it and right now
I'm like a little bit more dark than
normal I just wanted something that's
going to look a little bit more seamless
like not show all but just like more
harsh marks on my face so I'm happy with
this I'm going to continue to use it but
it is something that I will be keeping I
know that sounds like I bought this
stuff thinking like oh well just return
it if I don't like it but I kind of like
all these things with things that were
on my list and things that I wanted and
if it worked out for me I was going to
be just like so ecstatic and keep and
love but I also told myself that I'm not
going to keep things just because I
ordered it but they're not going to work
out for me or they weren't what I was
expecting or if they're broken or
anything like that so I just want to
have balance
I'm the tech person who will keep things
for no reason just because I don't know
I feel weird returning even if I'm
totally in the right on it I think
there's some stuff for milk makeup which
I'm really excited about the first one
here is one of their tattoo eyelining
stamped attaching stamps I think they're
called yeah tattoos dude I picked up the
heart-shaped one because no that's the
one I chose so this you can just like
easily think and then you have a little
heart shape how cute is that
now when I first was doing this I was a
little scared because honestly this on
your hand just like totally start going
into all the little lines so I'm going
to try this out on the face and make
sure that it works on like a powder face
and maybe just because there's more
lines on my hand than on my face I don't
know I'm going to try this out if it's
like stays in place obviously I'm going
to keep because it's super cool but if
this just like transfers and bleeds when
you put on the face I am going to return
it because the whole point of this is to
be a crisp part on your face and if it
doesn't do that then it's not doing too
strong so I'm kind of on the fence about
this one it just needs to work
practically for me the other items that
I picked up for milk makeup is another
bronzer this is the color baked which is
the lightest of the two and I really
want to try this out to they've heard
really good things and I honestly do
like a matte cream bronzer I used up the
bourgeois bronzing primer and I did
really liked the way it looked on the
skin the thing that's kind of
frustrating about it is that mine it had
a cap on it and when I pulled the cap
off it broke off some of the product now
I know it's not a huge deal but it's
just I want it to be fresh and new and
not broken the minute I get it and yeah
so I'm going to see if I can exchange
this just for a non broken one I just I
want like good products I don't want to
settle for stuff I shouldn't have to and
I don't know why it did that that has
not seen anyone else to actually talk
about this say that this happened to
them so I don't think it's normal
next I picked up a little many of a
foundation this is the cosmetic CC cream
and I think the light shade out because
I am a little bit darker plus I did want
to try out the smaller version just to
make sure I liked it I thought this
would be a great like to go version and
just I have a lot of foundations in my
collection so it's just an easy way to
be able to run through it make sure I
like it you have long enough to test it
to make sure it's something you'd
actually want to have in the full size
but this is way too dark for me like
their life is very dark to me it's like
I never know what I'm going to be am I
going to be the light am I going to be
the dark but this is just it's just not
going to work yeah and I just don't want
to have too dark a foundational maybe I
won't I don't know maybe I'll actually
try it on my skin instead of just
watching it to make sure
gosh dang look at me because I guess it
is more of a CC cream it's not insanely
full coverage even though it's super
full coverage I don't know we'll see if
this is too dark for me and ends up
actually being too dark I am going to
return this it kind of sucks because
they don't have the fair shade I would
just exchange it for the right shades
but I don't know if I want to invest the
42 dollars in this product yet so that's
that situation we're getting to the end
of the stuff I like paid for so at the
end of my purchase all of these Sephora
blushes were on the field site and I was
like oh they look really really pretty
so I was just going to pick up one which
is in this bag and it's a really pretty
color this is the shade of Kiros tickle
and these are like a mineralized blush
1/2 it's like more shimmery than the
other I'm very disappointed
these ones I picked up because I
couldn't decide between the colors like
I'll just get them all this one is be
colored guava glow and then this one is
the color rose emotion but these do not
look the same as they do on the website
to me I thought guava glow was going to
be way more peachy and I feel like it's
just kind of this like warm pink shade
and then this one color wise is also not
quite what I thought it was going to be
but even if the colors were the same
right I would be returning them because
this one wasn't broken when I got it oh
no this one was totally intact and I was
so excited to lick okay well I'm going
to try this once if I like the formula
and if I do all of them maybe one more
and enjoy it or whatever this is
impossible to open this I was trying to
open it for so long and it finally flew
out of my hands and fellow the floor and
broke and finally opened that way
it is just impossible to freaking open
so I'm not even going to deal with these
it's not something that I even want to
mess around with so that is super
frustrating that the one color I want is
the one that got damaged and then the
other two so I should have known I
should approve you know they were kind
of not a last-minute purchase but
something that wasn't as thought out of
it wasn't like I heard of these before
and wanted them and it was a fail the
last thing that I like per tono
the last two things that I purchased
purchased are in my bag when they go get
them I'm back so the next item is the
Brazilian crush spray body mist
fragrance from sol de janeiro you guys
know that I got the lip balm and this
shower gel from Oxley and I absolutely
loved them so when I saw that they came
out with a travel size of the spray I
was really excited the full-size one
retails for like 30-something and this
is 18 it's three ounces and I thought at
first like oh it's going to be kind of
small but this is pretty big I'm very
happy that I chose this size I really
love the smell and I'm very happy with
this purchase this is something that
makes me really happy and excited to use
it also makes me want to like totally
clear out those other body phrase I have
because this is just the best why would
I use the other one and last I picked up
one of the glosses from bareMinerals
I've been wanting to try these for a
really long time and I've only heard
good things this is the color sugar and
it is a really pretty color I thought it
was going to be a little bit deeper than
it is from online swatches that was a
little disappointing but overall it is
nice it's pretty opaque has a pretty not
insanely sticky but it does have a stick
to it which is going to make it last on
the lips I personally feel like I prefer
the honest Agia lip glosses better I
think they're very comparable but when
it comes to scent which this has is
still a kind of sweet scent I don't know
something about it it's a little bit off
to me I just prefer the anasazi ones
over this so if you were wondering I
would just get the anasazi ones or try
not store
I'm not going to return it because I
think it's still nice but just in the
future it's good to know that I'll just
get the honest other ones so that's it
for everything that I purchased now on
to what I redeemed with points and
coupon codes and whatever else I could
do another reason
I decided to make my purchase when I did
is because Sephora was eight percent
cash back on Ebates which was awesome so
I thought I might as well just do it now
get some money back get some things I've
really been wanting you know and just do
it the first thing here is a 250 point
perk this is the tory burch love
relentlessly i have a little collection
of these mini perfume bottles i just
think they're so pretty there in my
bathroom and i thought this is a really
nice one to add to the collection so
that's why i got this it's not
necessarily to use although this one
does actually smell pretty nice I have
some more Point perks here this is the
roller lash from benefit this was a
hundred points and I thought I might as
well try that one out I have tried it in
the past but I just thought why not get
a mascara next was something I was
excited about this is the tarte artist
pro glow and it's a little liquid
highlighter i do this is the perfect
size for liquid highlighter because to
go through that much of it it's enough
to like use but not go bad so to me
that's perfect and also just have my kit
like i think that's so awesome
next is a NARS matte lip pencil this is
in the color let's go crazy just how i
felt when i was shopping on - for like
let's go crazy girl this is a really
pretty pink color it's not something i
would probably pick out on my own but I
do love this formula so I thought I
would try it out and then last for like
point Perks this is the Stila stay all
day liquid eyeliner just a mini I
thought I would pick that up because I
don't use them very often so I have
something when I want to use it in the
last two samples that I have here this
is a sample of the cover FX blurring
primer I got this as a code so I was
looking back through my emails and
figuring out which code would work best
for me and I decided to go with a primer
since I like primers that was actually
pretty nice to have been using it and
it's good and then for one of my little
sample packets which they gave me random
samples ones I did not even pick any one
case this is the bye-bye pores from a
cosmetic so I want to just try that one
out
the other samples that I got I just put
in my kind of like declutter basket
already because I know I won't go
through them okay that is everything
guys that helped this call was it to
really are all over the place I'm pretty
sure it was though let me know down
below if you try to need these things if
you like it I really hope that some of
the items that I'm on the fence about
work out for me if not I am going to
return them just because I need things
that are going to work for me and I
don't want to have products in my
collections that never get used and
eventually just get too cluttered I want
things that I love so that is everything
I'll see you guys hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
