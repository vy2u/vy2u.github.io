Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing a video I've never done
before but this is going to be my
recommendations for the Sephora vib sale
I don't really usually feel the need to
do a video like this but I'm hoping that
I can give you guys insight into the
items that I think you should buy if you
were asking me like hey Lauren what
would you recommend these are the things
that I would recommend that you can pick
up from Sephora and that you can get the
discount on because they will be doing
the 20% off I did screenshot something
from trend mood just so I could give you
guys some dates because I know some
people are asking in my friends and
family hall I'll leave a link down below
but anyway from November 3rd through the
6th you can get 20% off if you're a VIP
Rouge and then from the 10th through the
15th you can also get 20% off if you're
a Rouge but also if you are a regular
like VIP member which just means you
have to sign up for their emails and
everything that's when the sales going
to be going on so I'm giving you some
time to think about your purchases I
don't want this to seem like super pushy
in the sense of like you should buy all
this stuff I really think that 20% off
is great you know it's better than
getting nothing off but it's not that
amazing also there are so many other
stores that do like 30% of I know derm
store does that so just keep that in
mind I remember back in the day I would
spend like I would drop like five
hundred dollars on the sale because it's
such a good deal but honestly it's not
if you are signed up to other websites
if you buy through other things you can
definitely save 20% off a lot of the
time so keep that in mind no need to go
crazy but if you order ask me what I
recommend these are the items that I
have purchased with my own money I think
there are only a couple of things that
are in here as like PR but other than
that like all these things are things I
purchased with my own money
what purchased with my own money highly
recommend their tried and tested these
aren't any like gimmicky items nothing
in here is like a first impressions
nothing in here is really limited
edition I don't even think so let's get
into my recommendations for the Sephora
vib sale first off is kind of like a 2
pack I have the Beauty Blender cleanser
and I also have the Beauty Blender
mine's a little bit dirty because I did
use it today I love the Beauty Blender
you guys if you've been on a channel you
guys
this is one of my all-time favorite
items for beauty ever I know there are
so many dupes out there but honestly I
just think the beauty blender is the
best one out of everything I've ever
tried let me know what your favorite
deeps are down below that are actually
similar like I'm talking actually
similar I know Real Techniques has their
miracle complexion sponge but it is not
the same to me so if you have something
different than that let me know but
anyway I love the Beauty Blender highly
suggested it's so great and if you wash
that and keep it clean with the beauty
blender cleanser you can have it a
really really long time the reason I
suggest the Beauty Blender cleanser is
because it actually breaks down the
product and gets all the stains out I
mean you can get everything out with
this cleanser which makes your Beauty
Blender last longer I also find that
this does not change the texture of your
Beauty Blender which some of the soaps
that I've used in the past have done so
if you're gonna spend the money I
definitely suggest coupling it with the
cleanser they have the liquid and they
also have a solid I just personally
prefer the liquid but yeah highly
suggest it if you want a video on how I
clean my Beauty blenders let me know I
have a bit of a method to it but um yeah
I highly suggest both of those for
foundations I have two recommendations
the first one is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation I personally use the
shade 117 or y22 5 but this foundation
is my absolute favorite foundation that
I've ever tried it's amazing it has a
medium coverage you can build it up if
you use a brush to apply it it has a
little bit more coverage than if you use
a sponge it looks invisible on the skin
and this is what I use in my makeup kit
so this is what I use on everyone no
matter the skin type if you want a
really full coverage matte like it's
gonna stay in place all day this is
definitely not the foundation for you
but that's why I love this I love that
this is easy to work with I love that
throughout the day even as my oils kind
of start breaking through I can easily
touch this product up even just with my
hands and kind of re spread it out on my
face and it just looks really nice it
doesn't cake up it doesn't have like
weird patchiness which sometimes can
happen when you use a really full
coverage like set in place foundation so
this is what I suggest for all skin
types all skin tones all skin ages like
everything about this foundation is
absolutely beautiful I love it so so
much
don't think you will be disappointed if
you liked all the features I just
mentioned in this foundation it's so
good now if you do want a bit more
coverage I suggest the our last stick
foundation this is an amazing foundation
I actually was sent this from love
Heatherette here on YouTube and this is
the color linen so this one's a little
bit too yellow and dark for me
personally but I love to mix this with
other foundations I also have worn this
on its own and it's beautiful
I feel like this formula defies most
stick foundations it has a lot of
coverage but it blends up so easy on the
skin it looks seamless it looks so
beautiful it looks like skin but if you
want something with more coverage a
little bit more glam I highly suggest
this it's so amazing they have quite a
few different shades as well it is
expensive but the amount of products you
need is so tiny especially if you just
want to kind of like even out the skin
tone you don't need much of this this is
another one of my all-time favorite
foundations I absolutely love it now
moving on to bronzers I don't have any
powder bronzers that I just absolutely
love that have like stood the test of
time for me that you can buy at Sephora
but I do have this stick one now this is
not going to be for everyone because not
everyone likes creams but the milk
makeup bronzer stick in the color baked
they have two shades this is the lighter
of the two it's amazing I think it
blends out on the skin so beautifully I
think something that's really
intimidating about putting on a cream
bronzer is the fact that it's not going
to blend out is it gonna look muddy is
it not gonna look natural and this looks
so natural on the skin you can use the
tiniest amount you can use a lot you can
use a beauty blender to blend it out I
think I prefer a brush just because it's
a little bit faster and just at the
moment I prefer using brushes to blend
out my foundation but I highly suggest
this they also have a kit going on at
the moment I believe for the holidays so
if you want to try this but you also
want to try out some other things from
milk that set has this as well as quite
a few other things I've been tempted by
it myself but I thought I would just
mention that if you are okay with
getting a smaller size this is gonna
last me at for forever
so I do suggest getting that one if you
want to try out some other things from
milk for blush I wanted to recommend
something that I think is just easy and
effortless that so many people can use I
just I don't know I really love this
blush and it's what I'm wearing today
its benefits rocket or this color is
just
really really beautiful it has a sheen
to it but it's nothing that's too
metallic it's not really emphasizing any
of your pores or anything but it's going
to give you a little bit of a glow like
I just think this is the perfect blush
if someone's like hey I want a blush
that I can wear every single day and
that's what a lot of these products are
the things that you can wear all the
time that are going to be staples in
your collection you're gonna get your
money's worth out of these products and
that's what I wanted to recommend you
it's just like staples things that
you're gonna love and use every day that
are gonna come to define your makeup bag
so anyway this is the blush that I
definitely recommend for the sale if you
like more neutrals or things that you
can wear every single day for brows
there are tons of brow products at
Sephora but I honestly think that you
can get a lot of stuff at the drugstore
but something that I think is really
great for the brows that you can get at
Sephora is the Anasazi a clear brow gel
this is an old one this is actually my
makeup empties for this year because
it's all the way gone I'm sure there are
a ton of brow gels at the drugstore that
you can get that work great but this one
is the one that I've tried out that will
hold your brows in place for forever
this is just such an amazing brow gel I
definitely think it's worth the price
this product also lasts a really long
time so honestly if you're not grossed
out you can use this for like the whole
year if you're using a personal self and
since it's not like by the eye area
that's what I do for myself just so you
guys know so I feel like for the 20
dollars you're spending on it plus the
20% off it's definitely worth it and
you're going to be so happy you have
this in your collection especially if
your brows are super hard to tame my
next recommendation is a mascara and I'm
sure you guys can all say it with me but
it is the Urban Decay perversion mascara
I absolutely love this mascara I think
it worked so well I'm someone who really
likes a lot of kind of bulb I like a
little bit of volume but I also really
like length I don't want anything too
too clumpy I'd rather my lashes look
more natural but just a fuller than they
are I love the brush on this it gives
them kind of this wispy vibe I love it I
don't really wear false lashes and why
really where I mean ever wear false
lashes and
just makes my lashes look so beautiful
it is definitely the mascara I recommend
but everyone I feel like has a personal
preference when it comes to mascara so
if you don't like it and you do get it
return it now for the sale obviously
you're gonna be getting a good discount
on so many things so I definitely think
getting some like higher-end products
that you were wanting to test out that
makes sense I do want to mention things
like getting the Natasha to Nona
eyeshadow palettes or anything like that
because they're just I want to tell you
guys about the products that I think are
just amazing products not just tell you
about expensive things that you would be
getting a better deal on so my Trident
your palette is the modern renaissance
from Anastasia you guys probably mostly
already have this but if you don't this
is the palette that I recommend getting
during the sale I have talked about this
at length in so many videos like so many
but this is just an amazing palette it
has so many different matte shades which
are my absolute favorite it also has the
perfect shimmers this one here is like a
light shimmer for the lid or the inner
corner there's a nice like gold shimmer
that's not too gold but it is gold still
and then antique bronze here isn't
anything too shimmery either I just I
love this palette so much you can do
warm toned looks cool tone looks
colorful looks neutral looks it's the
best I love it so much I really think
you're gonna get your money's worth out
of this palette and I highly highly
suggest it if you guys haven't gotten
that by now I haven't suggest this for
lip products I only have a couple of
items and I'm not a big lip product
person I'm very like neutral and
laid-back I don't like anything that's
too fussy so my lip products definitely
reflect that the first product is the
Fenty beauty gloss balm this is one of
my most recent items to my collection
and I love it so so much I highly highly
recommend it it's the perfect neutral
color and they made this for every
single skin tone so it's gonna look
great on everyone I'm wearing it right
now it's all I'm wearing I love it so so
much this is what I keep in my bag and
always have with me it's moisturizing
it's not too sticky it's just a great
formula a great color a great product
and I want to use this like every single
day for something a bit more
moisturizing has something that is
tried-and-true in my collection I wanted
to put in the fresh sugar lip balms this
one specifically is a small size it's
the rosy one but I mostly recommend just
the original like clear lip
it's my favorite it smells like lemons
it smells so so good me and Sam both
love that I think we've got through like
two of them at least now if you want to
splurge on a lip balm I know it's
expensive it's a really really good one
it's just my favorite like for quality
and sent an experience and just
everything it's my favorite lip balm I
love it so so much the next thing I
wanted to recommend to you guys actually
isn't just an item it's a brand I
thought this would be the perfect time
for anyone to pick up anything from sol
de Janeiro that they haven't yet so I'm
gonna leave my Sol de Janeiro video down
below like I did a whole video on this
brand because I freaking love it that
much so let me show you the items that I
have I recommend all of these items I
also recommend the boom boom cream that
is like a hi-hi seller of theirs I don't
have it personally because I don't like
lotions but if you do I've only heard
amazing things this smell of these
products is absolutely amazing I just
love them so much so if you wanted to
pick up some products I highly recommend
these ones this first one here is the
Brazilian foreplay moisturizing shower
cream gel I know we're going into winter
and these are like summery smelling but
I still suggest them get them at a
discount save them for later or so use
them now I'm using this in my shower
currently this smells so so good so I
got this from octoly I also got the lip
balm that was the first thing I ever
tried from them this is the Brazilian
kiss koopa coup it's a how you say it
lip butter I'm not sure but this one is
so nice the smell of this is also really
really amazing
I just realized must have melted somehow
because it's been like a hundred degrees
here but it's only been in my purse so I
don't know how that happened anyway cuz
I was outside for that photo shoot yeah
that's why anyway I love this lip balm -
this is a really good one if you wanted
tavlek and i'll turn it into the fresh
this is also really nice I think I still
like the fresh better but I still really
love this and would definitely
repurchase this one - kind of a weird
product that I have from them this is
the foot fetish and this is real
nice to if you're looking for something
to keep your feet nice and moisturize
while we go into winter this is an
amazing product as well I'm telling you
everything I've tried from them I've
loved so all that was sent to me and
then because I liked all those products
so much I did I have purchased from the
brand myself as well this is the
Brazilian crush of body fragrance mist
this is actually the travel size I know
it looks pretty large but this smells so
good it's their classic like pistachio
caramel smell it smells so so good so I
just haven't suggest all of these
products if you guys want to check out
the brand during the sale it's gonna be
a great time to save some money and try
some new things out the next thing that
I wanted to mention is a hand cream now
that we're going into winter this is one
of my absolute favorite hand creams I've
ever tried and I'm actually finished
with the one that I have this is just
like a travel size but this is the lots
of tone on Provence dry skin hand cream
it has 20% shea butter in it and it's so
nice I use this at night when I get
ready for bed
I put it on my hands and I let it soak
in when I'm going to sleep so that way I
wake up with better more moisturized
hands it comes in a way bigger size than
this one obviously but if you're looking
for a hand cream that's gonna work
really well really gonna moisturize your
hands has great ingredients this doesn't
really have like a smell smell to it I
highly suggest this hand cream you will
not be disappointed I have two more
things to talk about and these are
actually the items that I picked up from
the friends and family sale they do a
friends-and-family sale like before the
actual event for people that work at
Sephora and their friends and family
anyway I was lucky enough to get a code
for that so the next thing I want to
talk about is a perfume I'm gonna tell
you about the one I picked up but I do
think that the sale is a great time to
pick up a more expensive luxury item
like a perfume and save quite a bit of
money on it so the one I chose is this
one from Joan Malone this is the English
oak and red currant I talked about in
the haul video that I didn't know if I
liked this and I do really like it I
don't know what I was thinking at first
I mean you can tell I've used quite a
bit of it already I just I do really
like it smells really really good
this one is a bit more false and I
definitely stress going in store and
smelling the perfume you want making
sure it's something you're gonna love
you're gonna have for a long time and
then I went and just did the day
got the big bottle of whatever perfume I
was gonna get because I want it to last
and I know myself I use perfume up so
fast because I spray so much of it so I
do suggest a perfume and the Joe Malone
one is the one I picked up and last I
wanted to mention something fun I feel
like most of the stuff I've been
mentioning is very practical
something that glitzy glammy but I did
want to bring up the Urban Decay glitter
liners I love these so much
I wore this actually on Saturday when I
went to a party cuz I was a devil and I
use this on the air corner this stayed
all night no glitter around my face I
just think these are such an easy fun
way to wear glitter the shade I have is
pyro it's like an iridescent purple and
blue glitter it's so so pretty I just I
mean whatever color you want
get that color they have so many they
just came out with I think like five or
six new shades and this is one of the
new ones just I love them so much
they're gonna stay and they don't like
flake off throughout the night they're
just amazing and worth the money if you
do like to add a glitter accent now and
then and that is everything guys I
really hope you enjoyed this video I
hope that these recommendations helped
if you were looking for some staple
items let me know if any of these items
are your favorites or what you would
recommend down below in the comments and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
