Lauren this is going to be my sep tember
empties video so these are all products
that I used up this month I'm really
happy to be again moving stuff out it
always feels so great to use up a
product I don't know what it is about it
so let's just get into it i'll start
with makeup first some of the stuff for
whatever reason didn't make it into my
last empties video so i might have used
us up like two months ago but the first
thing here i have is the wet and wild
coverall powder and this is in the shade
light I think they have quite a few
shades surprisingly in this powder I did
really enjoy it I think it's a really
good price I definitely would repurchase
at some point but I am trying out just
different things so that way I can get
like a better idea of just different
powders out there just what works best
from you but I would repurchase this
another powder that I used up is the
pure four-in-one powder now I do already
have a replacement of this from octa Lee
and I do really like this powder
obviously it's all gone but I do use the
shade light I really enjoyed this it
gives really good coverage I mean
obviously I got the second one and I am
enjoying that I've already hit pan but I
do find that I get oily with this so I
want to just branch out and see if
that's just a problem of my primer if
it's because of this powder and see if
other powder foundations do the same
thing on me I just I really enjoy this
one but it's one of the only ones i've
ever tried so I do want to try other
things out there just to kind of compare
it to this I have two of the Maybelline
definer browse this is in the color dark
blonde I really like this pencil it's
really cheap in the drugstore I think
it's like under six dollars usually if
you can go to like Walmart or Target I
think it's a good pencil it's a good
color for my brows and I like how thin
it is this is not one of the pencils you
can roll up and then roll down though
you can only roll it up and then once
it's up you're done for I have had a few
times where this kind of like will break
off on me but even with that because of
the price and everything I do like it
but I think I might like the elf pencil
better it's a little bit thicker than
this so if you want more like precision
and thinness this is better but it's
cheaper the elf ones two dollars so that
is the one that I have gone with and
repurchased since after using these so
I'll probably stick with those for a
while but I do like this pencil this is
the clinic super primer I do really like
this primer has a really nice feel on
the skin honestly i'm using the hard
candy one right now and i do like that
one so i kind of feel like i don't know
i don't know if i'd pay the price for
this one again it's nice if you were
interested in it I think it's a good
primer it's kind of in between a really
silicone primer and a moisturizing
primer but I feel like the hard candy
ones that i'm using right now in the mat
or shine free version is a very similar
texture so i'm not sure if I'd
repurchase but I did enjoy it and last
makeup makeup item this is the Milani
lash trifecta of mascara I did enjoy
this the brush on it is nice it's kind
of like curved and it has like a
triangle kind of feel to it which makes
sense with like trifecta I felt like I
could get nice lashes I didn't feel like
it's liked at all or like smudged on my
lower lash line overall I did really
like it i have a ton of mascaras to go
through but this is a nice one again if
you were interested in it I thought it
was good and I liked the amount of
volume and length i gave my lashes this
is a Beauty Blender I'm calling it quits
on this this is the black one it's not
my favorite texture i do prefer the pink
one and it's just a had in awhile and
honestly i didn't clean this one as much
as I should have like you know as often
as I should have so I just feel like I
can't get it clean enough now and that's
something I really want to make sure I'm
doing like every like three uses I know
that might be gross to you but for
personal use I feel like that's fine i
just want to make sure i'm washing them
because sometimes i will use like this
in powder after using it on foundation
and i just feel like i can get gunked up
and i feel like i can never really get a
thoroughly clean Beauty Blender after
that so I just want to make sure that
I'm washing my pink one which I have now
often enough that it just can stay
longer I love the Beauty Blender though
it's my favorite tool to apply
foundation it's the best so good I am
gonna get a real techniques one in the
mail soon so I will try that I kind of
do a comparison video it's one of their
new sponges so I'm excited to try that
but anyway I love the Beauty Blender the
sex should be top coat I've had this one
for quite a while I think it's the first
one I've ever done I like this I have
two backups of it so i will go through
those but i do feel like the formula x 1
I just like better I
don't know what it is this just gets so
thick at the end which kind of sucks
it's like a fourth of the product is
kind of wasted by the end you probably
can fin it out but I just haven't I just
have the backups and I've had them for a
long time so I just thought like let's
call this quits but getting back to the
formula x 1 i just think that one's
really nice i've been using it the last
three times i've done a manicure and I
just feel like it makes my polishes look
really nice it keeps them on I just
really enjoy that one so i'm not sure if
my love affair with this is still so
strong i might repurchase that one
what's like i clear things out which
will be in like five years anyway so i
don't know i'm thinking about it but
yeah those are my thoughts on that I'm
just kind of over it i don't know my
height for it has died a little now on
to the rest of the stuff in the basket
first thing I'm pulling out here this is
the it's a 10 miracle finishing spray I
had this for forever when I say forever
I'm like four to five years because my
mom and I went to a hair shape she's a
hairdresser and the goodie bag was
seriously full of I think I want to say
like six or seven full size it's a 10
products they must have been like the
sponsor of it and this is one of the
products so I don't use hairspray very
much and it just took me a long time to
like finally get to using this I really
only started using it this year and Sam
mostly used it up this smell of this is
kind of strange Sam hates the smell of
this but probably because i was using
this to kind of like style a wig and i
think he just he got overloaded with it
then and then to use it on his own hair
anyway I won't repurchases I like the
Sebastian shaper or shaper plus I also
like the kenra hairspray better than
this so and right now I'm trying out
like a big sexy hair one so I definitely
feel like out of all those this just
doesn't hold up so i will not repurchase
it's not bad it's just not the best i
have a shower gel here this is from Bath
and Body Works it's the stress relief
eucalyptus T body wash and phone back I
really like the smell of this I used up
most of this and then Sam kind of took
it over and I started using the licious
one which I love i really like the smell
of it the most is there something about
it that was just so nice and comforting
i'm just nice it wasn't like overly
sweet or candy or floral or tropical
just had a nice herbal scent and
I did enjoy that I went through a bag of
sponges these are the face secret
professional medium ultra wedges I get
these at Sally's I probably could just
buy sponges from like other places but I
just like these ones so I definitely
would repurchase I have your purchase
they're pretty dang good and I like to
get them on sale I have two different
packs of cotton rounds these are both
from big wats one of them is the kinda
don't like which is just like a cotton
that's not encapsulated and the other
one is in a pack that was encapsulated
so I do enjoy the ones that are in
almost like a little pouch so that the
fuzzies don't get all over your eyes I
would repurchase but i think im just
gonna suck it up and i'm going to buy
the costco pack of this whispers ones
because i believe those are also been
like the nice pouch instead of again all
the fuzzies getting all over your eyes
in your eyes floating in the air you're
breathing them in I think I'm just gonna
go with that though I think it's like
twelve dollars or something for nine
packs it's a little bit over you know a
dollar apiece which is what I want to
spend but I think I'm just gonna go for
it so that I have like a backup and I
just don't feel like the quality of the
Big Lots ones aren't that amazing like
they're fine for like putting on clients
because I just like to own their face
with them but for like really getting
and rubbing on your eyes to get your eye
makeup off I feel like they still kind
of aren't the best or not as thick as I
would like them such an in-depth review
of those dang cotton round let's move on
to these face wipes this is a kirkland
brand daily facial towelettes and I was
given these as a gift and I did enjoy
them the wife is super big it's very
thick it feels very high quality it
leaves not like a greasy residue but it
definitely is more moisturizing than the
fpl wipes or Appel wipes whatever that I
use now and definitely like thicker and
you can just tell better quality I
thought it was nice and I enjoyed using
them the smell of them was not my
favorite it wasn't like insanely
overpowering but I definitely can
remember a smell so it just wasn't my
favorite I'm not opposed to buying these
but I just loved my dollar wipes so I
probably won't purchase these I used up
a shampoo this is the unite weekender
shampoo which is a clarifying shampoo so
many shampoos I enjoyed this I
use it every day so it took me a while
to go through this the smell in it is
nice but not like amazing it worked well
I did feel like it tangled my hair but I
find most clarifying shampoos tangled my
hair because they're really just trying
to like get all the grime out overall it
was ok I feel like there are other ones
out there though that I would try over
this I wouldn't spend the money i got
that as gratis a dry shampoo Battiste
you guys now this is my favorite dry
shampoo ever ever ever ever in the world
so good marshalls is now carrying them
for 479 a piece so if you haven't tried
them yet and you want to try them they
are down from 599 to even cheaper i buy
mine at marshalls even though the pro
stores around me carry Battiste i still
get a better deal at marshalls so
definitely check out marshals for your
Battiste do it it's so good I love it
love love love I'm like so intense today
and I feel like my voice just makes me
feel like a different person anyway this
is the color brilliance I on magenta
semi-permanent hair color I use this one
quite a bit for my hair when I really
want it pink and sometimes I'll mix this
was like conditioner to make it less
pink and sometimes I'll mix it with the
pastel pink to make it again a different
shade I kind of just do my own thing and
mix it around but this is definitely one
that I purchased a lot and I also just
purchase in general the color brilliance
I on dies a lot they're pretty cheap
they're 599 last year during black
friday they were 298 IP so if they are
to 99 again this year I will definitely
stop up I have a serum here this is the
Olay Regenerist regenerating serum and I
got this at costco so this was thirty
dollars for the 3.4 ounces and at this
store I like the normal Walgreens or
wherever else you can purchase this 1.7
ounces is usually thirty dollars so
definitely a good deal I enjoyed this I
really like the feel of this on the skin
it just feels very smooth very nice its
fragrance free so i like that it didn't
break me out Sam enjoys it too we did
repurchase so I mean I must like it I
just think for a serum it's a good price
everything about it i really like also i
like to use the serum as just like my
moisturizer during the day it
too heavy but it still makes my skin
feel really moisturized and it just is a
nice base for product so I do like this
and I did we purchase i have this razor
here this is from the dollar store I
thought this is a pretty like intense
razor for a dull hair and I think you
got two of them at the same time I
wouldn't repurchase these though I'm
just over the razors I feel like I talk
about the dang razors every time to its
cotton rounds and razors are like my
issues in life I don't know mermermer I
just want good racers but good thing is
I want good razors and I tell myself I'm
gonna get a good razor next time I don't
care how much it is i am worth it my
legs are worth it my life is worth it
and then i go to the store and I see
that to get like four razors it's like
1599 and I'm like hell no I'm not gonna
do it oh I end up then picking up
something that's just crappy because I
needed last minute and I hate it so I'm
trying to break the cycle we'll see
we'll see what happens right this is a
hand soap from Bath and Body Works this
is sunlight and apple trees I love the
Sun it's really nice I really like clean
apple sense oh yeah it just smells so
good I do have backups of this i think i
have like two or three right now I like
this scent and then the other side i'm
really loving and I put it in my
favorites video and I went out and
bought like all the ones they had at the
store because they were on sale for
three dollars apiece plus at my twenty
percent off coupon so they were like to
40 apiece I bought all of the
marshmallow pumpkin latte or whatever it
was so good i love that scent it smells
so good we're almost out of the one we
have and I just can't wait to put a new
one in to have it whenever I just want
to use it so anyway I love the Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works hand soaps they're so good
and I definitely suggest obviously
getting them on the deal if you can get
them at like the three dollar price
range each and then use your coupon on
top of that you really can't be such a
good product great sense they look cute
I love that they have the exfoliating
beads an egg or you can get the foaming
ones and for like 2 40 apiece I'm down
with that I think they're great and also
I can always tell when I use a different
soap even Sam can cuz i've been using
the bath body works opes probably i
don't even know probably for like three
years now so if we get a different soap
he can tell like the text
difference and usually they're a lot
thinner and he's always like I don't
like this so so if your husband notices
the soap is different and not as good
like you know the other soap is actually
good and you're not just like a crazy
person loving bath and body works I have
another toothpaste this is the optic
white toothpaste from colgate we get
this at costco in a pack we like it we
go through like one a month we are just
like little brushing our teeth beans we
are at the end of this basket I have two
random products here these are some like
anti-acid tablets like tums but these
are the mint ones and I thought it would
just point out if you guys get heartburn
definitely use like little calcium
tablets or whatever these are and I
suggest the mint flavor the mint is the
best and I really like it I keep these
with me just because I never know when
heartburns going to strike and I feel
like I can get the worst heartburn like
seriously such horrible heartburn and I
just like to be able to combat that as
much as I can so yeah I went through
these it takes me a while to go through
them I mean I get heartburn a lot but i
also don't i don't know i just feel like
i never know when it'll pop up so I just
I'm always prepared and the other thing
I wanted to mention is we went through
another one of these wellness formula
herbal defense complex tablets news we
get I think it like GNC or just anywhere
you can get supplements or things like
that vitamins we've gone through so many
of these whenever we start feeling like
a little bit sick you can also take
these just like every day just like
maintain your health but especially when
we start feeling like a little under the
weather will start taking these I think
you take like three in the morning three
at night when you are sick I'm like to
every day if you aren't and it just like
helps to keep your immune system up and
also to just kind of like hopefully
fight off that cold a little bit sooner
or hopefully not even get a cold and i
really like these they smell really
gross i like to get the ones in the
capsules if you don't get them in like
the plastic capsules you will get like a
horse pill and they're huge and they
definitely have like an oil of oregano
type of situation like with you burp
after you have these it can be a little
scary so I definitely suggest eating
them with food so hopefully you don't
have that issue I know it's a little TMI
but like I'm just being real I still
would buy these I need to report to some
because winter is coming um
no but winter is coming and I just feel
like I'm more apt to get sick then so I
want to make sure that we have these on
hand just for whatever we're not feeling
very well okay guys those are my empties
for the month I hope you enjoyed this
video I hope it gave you some insight on
some products that i liked or didn't
like or just er me and that's everything
I will see you guys in my next video I
hope you're having a wonderful day bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
