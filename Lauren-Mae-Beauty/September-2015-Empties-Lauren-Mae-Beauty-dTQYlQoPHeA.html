for it guys this video is going to be my
September it's going to be my September
empties these are all the products that
I've used up in September does it mean I
started them in September but I did
finish them in September and just to
like disclaimer you won't see anything
in my project pans or anything like that
in my empties because I do keep those
separate I don't want to show you guys
the same products over and over so these
are all new items that you haven't seen
empty before so let's get into it let's
have repurchased it and used it up again
but let's get into these items so I can
show you what I've used up i'll start
off with the makeup first i was really
happy that I was able to finish up a
couple makeup items this month the first
one here is just a tiny little benefit
Porefessional i love this primer it's a
really good one I think I like the
Smashbox pore filling primer just a
little bit better than this one but I do
enjoy this I would repurchase this
product given I didn't have anything
else in my collection it's a really
really good one so this I have finished
up I know it's small but this is in
addition to anything in my project pants
which is awesome so another thing down
for the year and then another item I
used up this is full size is a
foundation so this wasn't my favorites
video last month I believe but it is
totally gone this is a covergirl and
Olay simply ageless foundation and
sunscreen like it's like a cream it
comes and it looks like twisted with the
foundation in a sunscreen and this is in
the color to 10 I really liked this I
would definitely consider repurchasing
this I've seen it at the drugstore
though for like twenty dollars at least
out here in California which is crazy
and there's no way I would ever do that
but i'm glad i got this out and I didn't
let it go to waste I really enjoy just
dipping my beauty blunder in it and just
patting it all like you know spreading
it all over my face I really enjoyed
this too when I did have my acne it
covered really nicely it was just a
great product so I really enjoyed this I
definitely would consider a purchasing
it and I'm glad to have another
foundation out of my collection that
feels so so good so that I can continue
to work on the foundations that I have
then I can buy one
that I'm excited to try so yeah it's
done another makeup item is in the
empties but this one is non-empty this
is being thrown away because it smells
bad they smelt like watermelon before
and it definitely does not smell quite
the same it can still smell the
watermelon but it's definitely not like
it was this is the Beca beach tint and
this is the color watermelon moonstone
I'm just so sad I didn't I don't even
know if I use this one time on my cheeks
which just is heartbreaking to me it's
beautiful in the pan super shimmery and
it just goes to show me that I can I
shouldn't buy cream blushes and
especially not when I have other cream
blushes like I need to finish up the
cream blush as I have and then start
over and get a new one but I'm just sad
this went to waste but I mean it does no
good sitting in my collection Bank bad
so i am going to be throwing this one
out and last kind of beauty like a
makeup related item this is a Beauty
Blender I am done with it it ripped oh
it's so sad so I'm just throwing this
out i had this for a good like six
months it's not washed so sorry but i
did repurchase at work we have the set
with like the to beauty blenders and
then like the cleanser for I think it's
39 plus with my discount so it's a
really good deal so that's what I ended
up buying I really like the beauty
blender cleanser with the Beauty Blender
I find other cleansers tend to like
change the texture of the sponge and if
I'm spending so much on the sponge I
wanted to last as long as possible and I
really do think the beauty blender
cleanser really keeps the the sponge in
the best state for as long as possible I
also like it because it actually like
cleans the sponge act I can get my
sponge looking brand new with the beauty
blender cleanser and I find I haven't
been able to really do that with any
other cleanser so anyway I use this up
and I have repurchased i love the Beauty
Blender I use it every single day to get
ready every day every day and now my mom
loves it too because I got her hooked on
it so yeah I have a couple wipes here so
a couple different stories with them
this one is the simple the simple
cleansing wipes I like these I think
they're great they're saturated they
don't burn my eyes I would definitely
repurchase I have repurchased they were
in my last empties and now they're gone
so I got
any other wipes right now at all on my
collection but these are ones that I
would definitely consider repurchasing
these new chef Gina ones on the other
hand are not my favorite I don't like
these um I ran out of wipes and I asked
Sam to go get me some and I didn't well
I already felt bad making him go get me
them while he was at the store so I
wasn't gonna be like don't get these
ones I like these ones you know I was
trying to just like let him do it I was
Lee just get the cheapest ones and I
thought for sure these wouldn't be the
cheapest ones because I feel like
they're usually kind of pic pricey but
these are the cheapest and so he ended
up getting movies and I just don't like
them they leave like an oily residue on
my skin that I don't like because I
don't necessarily rinse every time I use
these some days I don't want i'm using
these because i don't want to like wash
my face with soap and water so on those
days it just feels greasy and gross and
I think it'd be good maybe for more
mature skin or to really dry skin they
might really like the way that these
feel but I don't have oil a skin and I
just don't enjoy these yeah I would
definitely rather go with the simple
ones or try out something else
surprisingly I only have one dry shampoo
this is Frank Laurent I really like this
dry shampoo I map at east girl I like
Battiste but this one's really nice i
like the mist I felt like I went through
it really fast but it is a really good
option so if this is more readily
available to you or if you were thinking
about trying it it is a really good dry
shampoo so yeah it's great I liked it I
would repurchase this I have quite a few
hand soap so we'll just go through them
this one was definitely I feel like my
favorite yeah my favorite out of all of
them this is autumn day Aspen autumn day
it's all really nice I really I busted
on an autumn scented hand soap because
it was September and we use this through
the whole month we did have friends in
town so I think that's why we went
through it a little faster than normal
but I really like the son I definitely
would repurchase these are my type of
like autumn since I don't like something
to like ambery and musky but i do like
something that just smells like fall and
like apple that's how this smelt it's
not really really good this next one is
dancing waters it's in the foaming like
style I don't remember the smell of this
i think it was in our kitchen I wouldn't
repurchase this this was probably
something I bought just to get the deal
and
I didn't want to repurchase the second
scent or something but yeah I wouldn't
repurchase his scent it was nothing bad
but nothing special and then last I have
eucalyptus mint I really like the smell
this one smells really nice especially
like right before you go to bed I just
like the smell of eucalyptus and its
really nice so this one I would
definitely repurchase the scent again it
smells really nice it's kind of strong
but I like it I finally finished up my
nukes serum this is the detox when I do
have a review on it i'll leave it in the
downbar below but I really did enjoy
this product I used it all the way up
and i would definitely repurchase it i
think it's $75 which is quite pricey and
i do get a lot of free stuff from work
so i don't know if i'll be like running
out to repurchase it but I really did
enjoy it while i used it i would suggest
it to someone i don't know if it made my
skin and look like I got two extra hours
of sleep like it claims but it did make
my skin feel really nice I liked
layering it with my like moisturizers at
night and then also sometimes in the day
I know you're not supposed to wear it in
the day so but sometimes if I just
wanted something lighter I would just go
with this and it was really nice so I
did enjoy this if you were looking at it
or already interested I would pick it up
it's a nice serum and it smells nice too
another item I'm kind of getting rid of
because of it goin bad this is a oil
this is the lavender moisturizing oil
from in dealey I was gonna use this up
and before I started the new oil I'm on
now but I opened it and there were like
I don't want to say it's mold but it
just freaked me out and I wasn't going
to use it so I'm throwing it away it is
quite old so I wouldn't be surprised and
it's not worth it not worth it I also
have this kate somerville exfoliate
intensive exfoliating treatment now this
is kind of a physical exfoliant and a
chemical exfoliant all wrapped into one
so you pour this product out it smells
like cinnamon it also looks green like
it's green which is a strange color but
you're going to put this on your face
you massage it into the skin for 30
seconds and then you leave it on for
about two minutes so i used this in the
shower I never really left it on the
full two minutes it was I was a little
sensitive to it but I did enjoy it I
don't know if I'd repurchase it but I'm
glad that I used up the sample or this
like
mini travel size and I did think it was
nice I could see what other people would
like it and I thought it was good but I
don't think it's like the end all be all
I wouldn't like run out to purchase it i
think the full size of this is like $85
or something which is crazy but it was
nice i'm glad i got to try it and that
I've experienced it for myself I
finished up a hand lotion this month
this is a soap &amp;amp; Glory hand food in
sugar crush I got this off the forest
website when they were like getting rid
of their soap &amp;amp; Glory stuff so i got it
for like four dollars or something it
was really nice I enjoyed it I do like
the original sent over the sugar crush
sent that's just me personally but I do
like this formulation of hand cream it's
not my absolute favorite because I have
a lot that I really really like but um I
don't dislike it I probably would
purchase one of my favorites over this
one if I had the choice and was actually
spending money on a hand cream so it was
good though this is a shampoo this is
from DS laboratories and it is the what
do they call it high-performance hair
stimulation stimulating shampoo this is
like a hair loss shampoo it uses a
copper peptide in an apple polymer to
help fight DHT i think is what it's
called which like suffocates the
follicle it's a chemical that your body
produces I believe when your or stress
or your levels of testosterone or high
or something like that anyway Sam also
use this I did use this a couple times
it smelt nice it did tingle you like rub
it into the scalp and leave it on there
for a little bit these types of products
eat I feel like you don't really see
results right away and it's also
something like you don't know how much
hair you're just not losing over how
much you're growing so I wouldn't be
opposed to buying this again but I got
it for free from work and that's why I
even had it in the first place so Sam is
pretty concerned with his hair even
though he's only 25 now you know trying
I mentioned it all the time it sounds
like my husband's fault he's not bald
but um you know he just wants to keep
his hair and the younger you start the
longer you'll have it so um yeah I just
let him use him and then I can go ball I
finished up a shower gel this is a
coconut-lime breeze this scent is ok it
didn't all of packaging um it's one of
those times I like coconuts
the lime kind of makes me get tired of
it so I usually can't use this scent
like back to back I couldn't use like
two of these in a row I'm just over it
by then but I did enjoy it while I had
it and I'm glad I'm on to something else
this is another item Sam used up this is
the Tom's wickedly no wicked fresh mouth
wash this is in cool mountain mint I did
not enjoy this I like listerine I like
something that burns I just feel cleaner
and there's something there's something
about it that I just like but Sam did
enjoy this I think he might have
repurchased it as well but I wouldn't be
surprised if he did I just like
something that burns I like the
listerine one and I don't really like to
go off of that one it's like the winter
mint listerine that's my favorite we're
getting down to the randos here this
little hairspray this is the big sexy
hair spray and play it's a volumizing
hairspray I use this in my kit for
school so for different projects and
stuff we'd each use it and whatever I
let everyone kind of use it whenever we
needed it and it's gone now it was a
great way to use it and have it be a
useful I don't but also move it out of
my collection so I'm happy about that I
have two toothpastes here there's Sam
likes to get every last like little drop
out of these that he can this is the
Colgate optic white this is like our
favorite one I really like this one it's
not as sweet as a lot of them so I like
that about it I feel like it just I like
the way it leaves my mouth and then this
one is the Colgate advanced whitening
toothpaste I have like three more of
these left i bought the man at costco
pack you guys probably know that if
you've been watching my empties but
after that I'll go to the Colgate optic
way once I finish all 8 million of them
up I have a little razor this is just a
gillette or chic chic quattro or
something little razor not a big deal
we're not gonna dwell on it and then
this is the last i am this is just one
of those like oh look see i did this
last time and it worked but it's like
Don I couldn't light a candle the other
day this is done I like these because
you can like get to your candle that
burning your fingers off I have a
million of these because of my wedding
so yeah we finished one of them and if
they were from the dollar store so this
was just a dollar
that's all my empties I hope you guys
enjoyed I'm going to film one more video
which will be my gratis hall for the
month and that will be it i will see you
in the next one I hope you're having a
wonderful day on this day and I will see
you hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
