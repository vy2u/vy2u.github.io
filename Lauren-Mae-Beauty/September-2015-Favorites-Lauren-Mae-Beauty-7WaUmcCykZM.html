this is going to be my September
favorites I didn't do a favorites video
for a couple months and I did last month
and I'm trying to be good so these are
all the products I've been loving for
September I have been trying to pan a
lot of stuff this month so I noticed
that when I do that I just I'm not
really exploring my collection or buying
new things but I feel like I have a good
amount of stuff some things I'm really
have been liking so I can't wait to show
them to you let's get into it I'm gonna
have some like random favorites at the
end because why not why not the first
thing I have here is this tiny little
item this is the Clinique bottom lash
mascara now this item is something I've
had in my collection for a while it's
ten dollars where ever you can buy a
Clinique and I think it's a good value
although I know that's expensive for a
mascara it's not like it's twenty
dollars and what I really love about
this is I don't touch up throughout the
date and I've noticed that there are so
many mascaras if they're not waterproof
that just smudge throughout the day and
I don't want to have to worry about that
happening so I know when I use this that
if I have anything on my like face it's
not gonna be my bottom mascara it's
gonna be like liner or some other item
and it's just nice to not have to worry
about that extra bit so I just love this
staying power of this I like the way
that it makes my bottom lashes look it
doesn't look clumpy I will say I did
have to let this dry out a little bit I
didn't like when it was brand brand new
because it was a little wet but I really
have been loving this and noticing what
a difference it makes when I use this
product so I will probably definitely
repurchase this because I don't want to
use like waterproof mascara on my eyes I
just don't have time it's already enough
time to take off regular mascara because
I have blonde lashes so if I have any
mascara on you can totally tell and I
like to make sure they're like
completely clean so it takes me a long
time to get regular mascara off and I
can't imagine doing waterproof so I love
this in my collection it's just nice to
know that it does work and I think it's
worth that like extra premium to have in
my collection I have a few things from a
recent haul that I've really been
enjoying now
my videos are kind of backed up right
now so I apologize but I'm trying to
tell this much as I can before I go to
Peru so some of this stuff might be
pre-recorded and then I also had friends
in town and my life has just been so
crazy and you know I don't know if you
guys ever want to see like a talked
video let me know where I'm not
necessarily like telling you about
beauty stuff but I'm more just sharing
my life with you just let me know but
life has just been kind of hard lately
and you know that's just how life goes
it ebbs it flows it's that's just how it
is and for a little bit like couple
weeks it's just been kind of hard so it
was just hard to do videos and now I'm
kind of back on track but I'm like I
have so many that are filmed now but
then finding the time to edit anyway
we're rambling so much but I have an
Asian beauty haul that should be up
behind this time and these are two items
that I got in it that I'm really happy
that I picked up which I'm really happy
about because I kind of picked up these
things on a whim it wasn't like they
were research so I'm glad that I am I am
enjoying them instead of them just going
to waste in my collection so we'll talk
about the brow pencil first this is from
the brand babyface and this is in the
shade 0-3 and what I really like about
this the spoolie is okay nothing too big
for me I'm glad it has a spool because I
do enjoy using it bye what I really like
about this is the shape of the pencil
now it's one of those that kind of is
like rectangular but also angled and I
find why I really like this is why it
makes filling in my brows so fast and so
easy I can turn it like flat ways like
this and get the like fullness of my
brow but then I can turn it like kind of
sideways and get the thinness of the
tail I love that I love that about it um
I will definitely be bringing this to
Peru with me and then specifically why I
like this so much is I personally have
trouble doing like the inside of the
brow I know a lot of people like that
like ombre look I like a strong brow
because I don't have brows naturally
they're very blond you can't really see
them so I kind of overcompensate and I
like it you know it's how I do my brows
and I do enjoy it but it's hard to get
like a
founded look or for them to be even when
I'm using such a small pencil it looks
like strokes are uneven I don't really
like it but this I can just kind of like
swipe it and it just automatically gives
me that even front it's just been way
easier I feel less self-conscious about
it with my brow so I've really been
loving this and this is only $4.99 I
think that's so amazing I think the
packaging is cute like everything about
this for $4.99 is absolutely amazing
even if it wasn't even if it was like
ten dollars I still would be putting it
in my favorite so the fact that it's
half that price is just crazy
I will probably definitely repurchase
this I don't know whether online or like
stock up when I go back there and get
like three of them or something but it's
really awesome and I really like it the
colors thanks to I'm wearing it right
now with powder over it I like it I like
it a lot the other item from that haul
was this dolly wink eyeliner this is
just a black winged liner and it's just
amazing that's kind of a fat one but
it's a brush tip and it's just really
really good I really like it I forgot
how much I liked the brush tip the first
one I ever used was the Kat Von D brush
tip one and it was just so easy to get
that flick like if you want a thick wing
you can do that but if you want that
thin really just it fades out into
nothing wing this does it for you and I
do realize how much I missed it when I
was using my other felt tips until I got
this back in my collection and I really
really do like it so this is a really
good one it's a good option if you can
get this because it is cheaper than the
Kat Von D one and I find staying power
wise that it's really good so I really
like this and I don't know am I gonna
talk about repurchasing because these
usually last me while I don't do a wink
everyday but when I do I'm excited to
have this to reach for two more makeup
items this first one here is from laura
geller this is the baked highlighter and
french vanilla i have really just been
enjoying this product it's a more
natural highlight so let's see that's it
there it has a lot of pigment and not a
ton of like sparkle and glitter like
some do and I just really been liking
this I'll
have been trying to go a little bit
lighter with my foundation now that my
skin's better I don't feel like I always
have to just have this like full fall
flawless face routine because there's
nothing really need that I have to cover
currently thank you actually currently I
do have one but you know what I'm saying
I don't have nearly as much I mean it
was my whole jaw line was like totally
crazy so I've really been enjoying this
and spoiler alert I did hit pan and my
other highlighter which is crazy so I've
actually been able to branch out and do
other highlighters so that's why I've
been using this and I have been enjoying
it it's just a nice one you know I like
having that variety having this one
that's a little more natural unlike this
really glow from within luck and then
having my buffet on ones that really you
know look like they're shining from
outer space so yeah well I've been
loving this is just some mini sites but
it's a good one and not alas me for
forever next and last makeup item this
is the Tarte CC fair primer it's the
colored clay CC primer now I've been
using this kind of the same way I was
using this Stila Stix
I think they were my last favorites
video or a haul video or I think I
mentioned them somewhere but I've been
using this stick in a similar way and I
like using this on days when I'm just
going to school or I'm going to work and
then going to school I don't want to put
on a full face of makeup because I'm
gonna ultimately just take it off at
school but I don't want to look like
totally unkempt at work that's a swatch
of it there it has a couple different
colors and it has like a purple and
agreeing to combat like yellowness I
think and redness I don't know quite
what those do I know the grandma does
redness and I think the purple one like
lilac is supposed to do like make you
not as jaundice it's kind of like a
purple shampoo for the face we're just
talking about that at work anyway so
I've really been liking this it gives me
just enough coverage to feel comfortable
and it's a nice consistency and I've had
this longer than the Stila ones so the
Stila ones are in my kid and so I was
just able to reach for this more this
month and I'm gonna try to use this up I
I'm excited to yeah see how far I can
get I've used that much of it so
I was using when I first got it as well
as it's not like just this month I went
through that much but I am yeah I've
been enjoying this I'm glad I busted it
back out and I've been getting some use
out of it it's a nice one too if I'm
gonna lay our other stuff on top of it I
can do this in just some concealer and
if I'm doing like a really light
foundation day that would totally be
fine I like it the two skincare items I
have I really have been enjoying and I'm
not I wouldn't consider myself a super
skincare person like I'm getting more
into it as I work in the beauty industry
but I just don't want to spend the money
I'm not at a place where I really can't
spend the money but I want to try a lot
of stuff so this first one if you're
interested is an amazing deal and I'm
going to tell you all about it this is
the rody el dragon's blood sculpting gel
this is a really popular item this is
from the brand one of their most popular
items my work we sell this for 98
dollars now that's insane
it's 1.7 ounces and I mean it's not
insane if you have the money whatever
it's a great product but I got this for
25 dollars well 24 and change from
Costco how crazy is that I picks them up
for my friends at work too because they
were like get me one when I told them
about it so I will be picking up a
couple more of these I really like this
product it just feels so smooth and nice
on the skin I've been using it day and
night and then at night I'll mix in a
little bit of my like argan oil just to
give it a little bit more moisture but I
really like this it sits well on your
makeup it has hyaluronic acid to help
plump and firm the skin and I've just
really been enjoying it I think it's a
great product it feels great it smells
great I love it and for the price
especially getting it on that much of a
discount you cannot beat it so if you
have a Costco membership or know someone
else Costco membership
I suggest totally picking this up it's
amazing and I have really been enjoying
it and I can't wait to get a couple more
as backup glass-like item item this is
from the turbo say this is the C + C
vitamin souffle mask I've used this a
couple times this month and one the
smell it smells absolutely fabulous and
I absolutely love that about it but the
texture of this is something like I've
never really felt before so I'll try to
show you guys it's definitely when they
say souffle it's very souffle like so
it just kind of feels like a whipped
consistency it just feels very luxurious
I find that my skin just feels nice
after use it looks a little glowy it
just feels like I'm taking care of my
skin when I use this mask
I can't wait to keep using this I mean I
it's $40 it's a mask you definitely with
like splurge on I guess again
I mean before tea dollars compared to
like glam glow isn't even that expensive
considering so for something just so
luxurious a lot of mature passe stuff is
really expensive so um yeah I've really
been enjoying that glad that I got it
for free to try out from work and I
really do like it it's a good one just a
few things I want to mention some songs
that I really been liking I like have
been loving Justin Bieber songs I know
it's not everyone's style but Justin
Bieber has a place in my heart whether
it's him or just like the way I'm
connected to him I worked at justice
just for girls for a really long time
for five years it was my first job I
moved my way up I was like store manager
by the time I graduated college so I
just have like a place in my heart for
Justin when I first started there it was
in October and it was winter and his
like first CD had come out so it was
like it played like every 15 minutes and
and through that and like all those
years I listened to so many songs of his
and won the beats just good but I just
you know it's just Justin and it's like
part of like my past it's weird even
though I wasn't like a super young girl
like at it's concerts it's because I had
to be into what the little girls were in
- because that's what we're selling and
so yeah it just has it's like memory
attachment to it so I really been liking
those two songs but they're just good
songs on their own to me I you know I'm
into it some other songs have really
been liking pretty young sang from
Michael Jackson I've really been
enjoying that song it's been playing at
work and I'm into it I really like that
song and then I've also been enjoying
operator I think it's his name's John
crow John I don't know I'm not sure what
his name is but it's like Papa Rita I
hope you know what I'm talking about
just from
I'm not singing anymore but I've really
been enjoying that song and I kind of
got into that song from the show
transparent which is also another
favorite transparent is a show it's like
a raved about show I think Jill Soloway
who is the director one for like Best
Director at the Emmys the Emmys so
anyway it's a show about like a
transgender parent and just kind of like
this family's like life and like how
they're dealing with it it's really
really good there's one season of it and
they're in the making of a second one
which Sam got to be an extra in which is
really awesome and so um that's kind of
why we started watching it in the first
place but it's just a really good show I
can't wait for season 2 and there's
something about it it's like this comedy
but there's this like it's it's sad but
it's also funny it's just really
reminiscent of like just real life you
know life is like you're crying and
you're laughing at the same time and I
think this month too I just could really
not relate to being transgender because
I'm not transgender but just relating to
just life and everyone's trouble so
anyway I know it won't be everyone's cup
of tea but I did I really have enjoyed
that show I thought it was really really
good
and I think that's it something I'm
looking forward to is crimson peak I
can't wait to see that I know it's
already gonna be a favorite of mine I
love Pan's Labyrinth and I can't wait
for this one
not that it's like a sequel but I can't
wait for crimson peak and I've also been
enjoying the book Dracula suggested and
parodies in general I don't know if it's
because it's turning October or what but
my taste has totally changed like the
x-files and Dracula and I just watched
an interview with a vampire and things
like that those are totally not things I
feel like I would have liked before but
now I'm like into it so anyway well I
love True Blood though I don't know
anyway I've just really been liking that
kind of seductive yet dangerous and
fanciful kind of story and a vampires
kind of fill that so anyway that's what
I've been into I hope you guys enjoyed

favorites are in the comments down below
