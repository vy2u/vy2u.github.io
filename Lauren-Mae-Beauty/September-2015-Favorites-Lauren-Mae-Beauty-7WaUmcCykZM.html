this is going to be my sep tember
favorites I didn't do a favorites video
for a couple months and I did last month
and I'm trying to be good so these are
all the products I've been loving for
September I have been trying to pan a
lot of stuff this month so I noticed
that when i do that i just i'm not
really exploring my collection or buying
new things but i feel like i have a good
amount of stuff some things I'm really
have been liking so I can't we just show
them to you let's get into it I'm gonna
have some like random favourites at the
end because why not why not the first
thing I have here is this tiny little
item this is the Clinique bottom lash
mascara now this item is something I've
had my collection for a while it's ten
dollars wherever you can buy clinique
and I think it's a good value although i
know that's expensive for a mascara it's
not like it's twenty dollars and what I
really love about this is I don't touch
up throughout the day and I've noticed
that there are so many mascaras if
they're not water proof that just smudge
throughout the day and I don't want to
have to worry about that happening so i
know when i use this that if I have
anything on my like face it's not going
to be my bottom mascara it's gonna be
like liner or some other item and it's
just nice to not have to worry about
that extra bit so I just love this
staying power of this I like the way
that it makes my bottom lashes look it
doesn't look clumpy I will say I did
have to let this dry out a little bit i
didn't like when it was brand brand-new
because it was a little wet but i really
have been loving this and noticing what
a difference it makes when i use this
product so i'm probably definitely
repurchase this because i don't want to
use like waterproof mascara on my eyes i
just don't have time it's already enough
time to take off regular mascara because
i have blonde lashes so if i have any
mascara on you can totally tell and i
like to make sure they're like
completely clean so it takes me a long
time to get regular mascara off and i
can't imagine doing waterproof so I love
this in my collection it's just nice to
know that it does work and I think it's
worth that like extra premium to have in
my collection I have a few things from a
recent haul that I've really been
enjoying now
my videos are kind of backed up right
now so I apologize but I'm trying to
film as much as I can before I go to
Peru so some of this stuff might be
pre-recorded and then I also had friends
in town and my life has just been so
crazy and you know I don't know if you
guys ever want to see like a talk video
let me know where I'm not necessarily
like telling you about beauty stuff but
I'm more just sharing my life with you
just let me know but life has just been
kind of hard lately and you know that's
just how life goes it ebbs it flows it's
it does just how it is and for a little
bit ly couple weeks it's just been kind
of hard so it was just hard to do videos
and now I'm kind of back on track but
I'm like I have so many that are film
now but then finding the time to edit
anyway we're rambling so much but I have
an asian beauty haul that should be up
behind this time and these are 2 items
that I got in it that I'm really happy
that I picked up which I'm really happy
about because I kind of picked up these
things on a whim it wasn't like they
were researched so I'm glad that I am I
am enjoying them instead of them just
going to waste in my collection so I'll
talk about the brow pencil first this is
from the brand babyface and this is in
the shade 03 and what I really like
about this the spoolie is okay nothing
too big for me I'm glad it has this
bully because I do enjoy using it by
what I really like about this is the
shape of the pencil now it's one of
those that kind of is like rectangular
but also angled and I find why I really
like this is one it makes filling in my
brows so fast and so easy I can turn it
like flat ways like this and get the
like fullness of my brow but then I can
turn it like kind of sideways and get
the thinness of the tail I love that I
love that about it um I will definitely
be bringing this to Peru with me and
then specifically why I like this so
much is I personally have trouble doing
like the inside of the brow I know a lot
of people like that like ombre look I
like a strong brow because i don't have
browse naturally they're very blonde you
can't really see them so I kind of
overcompensate and I like it you know
it's this is how I do my brows and I do
enjoy it but it's hard to get like a
founded look or for them to be even when
i'm using such a small pencil it looks
like strokes are uneven i don't really
like it but this i can just kind of like
swipe it and it just automatically gives
me that even front it's just been waiti
less self-conscious about it with my
brow so I've really been loving this and
this is only 499 I think that's so
amazing i think the packaging is cute
like everything about this for 499 is
absolutely amazing even if it wasn't
even if it was like ten dollars i still
would be putting it in my favorite so
the fact that it's half that price is
just crazy I will probably definitely
repurchase this I don't know whether
online or like stock up when I go back
there and get like three of them or
something but it's really awesome and I
really like it the color is nice too i'm
wearing it right now with powder over it
I like it I like it a lot the other item
from that Hall was this dolly wink
eyeliner this is just a black winged
liner and it's just amazing that's kind
of a fat one but it's a brush tip and
it's just really really good I really
like it I forgot how much I liked the
brush tip the first one I ever used was
the kat von d brush tip 1 and it was
just so easy to get that flick like if
you want a thick wing you can do that
but if you want that thin really just it
fades out into nothing wing this does it
for you and I didn't realize how much I
missed it when I was using my other felt
tips until I got this back in my
collection and I really really do like
it so this is a really good one it's a
good option if you can get this because
it is cheaper than the kat von d 1 and i
find staying power wise that it's really
good so i really like this and i don't
know am I going to talk about
repurchasing because these usually lasts
me while I don't do a wink every day but
when I do I'm excited to have this to
reach for two more makeup items this
first one here is from laura geller this
is the baked highlighter in french
vanilla i have really just been enjoying
this product it's a more natural
highlight so let's see that's it there
it has a lot of pigment and not a ton of
like sparkle and glitter like some do
and i just really been liking this I
I have been trying to go a little bit
lighter with my foundation now that my
skin's better I don't feel like I always
have to just have this like full fall
flawless face routine because there's
nothing really need that I have to cover
currently thank you um actually
currently I do have one but you know
what I'm saying I don't have nearly as
much I mean it was my whole jaw line was
like totally crazy so I've really been
enjoying this and spoiler alert I did
hit pan and my other highlighter which
is crazy so I've actually been able to
branch out and do other highlighters so
that's why i've been using this and i
have been enjoying it it's just a nice
one you know i like having that variety
having this one that's a little more
natural unlike this really glow from
within luck and then having my book bay
on one set really you know look like
they're shining from outer space so um
yeah well i've been loving this is just
a mini size but it's a good one and not
alas me for forever next and last makeup
item this is the tart CC fair primer
it's the colored clay CC primer now I've
been using this kind of the same way I
was using the stylistics I think they
were my last favorites video or a haul
video or I think I mentioned them
somewhere but I've been using this stick
in a similar way and I like using this
on days when I'm just going to school or
I'm going to work and then going to
school I don't want to put on a full
face of makeup because I'm gonna
ultimately just take it off at school
but I don't want to look like totally
unkempt at work that does watch it there
it has a couple different colors and it
has like a purple and agreeing to combat
like yellowness I think and redness I
don't know quite what those do I know
the ground does redness and I think the
purple one like lilac is supposed to do
like make you not as jaundice it's kind
of like a purple shampoo for the face we
were just talking about that at work um
anyway so um I've really been liking
this it gives me just enough coverage to
feel comfortable and it's a nice
consistency and I've had this longer
than the Stila one so the steel ones are
in my kid and so I was just able to
reach for this more this month and i'm
gonna try to use this up i I'm excited
too yeah see how far I can get I've used
that much of it so I
I mean I was using when I first got it
as well it's not like just this month I
went through that much but I am yeah
I've been enjoying this I'm glad I
busted it back out and been getting some
use out of it it's a nice one too if I'm
going to lay our other stuff on top of
it I can do this in just some concealer
and if i'm doing like a really light
foundation day that would totally be
fine I like it the to skincare items I
have I really have been enjoying and I'm
not I wouldn't consider myself a super
skincare person like I'm getting more
into it as i work in the beauty industry
but i just don't want to spend the money
i'm not at a place where I really can
spend the money but I want to try a lot
of stuff so this first one if you're
interested is an amazing deal and I'm
going to tell you all about it this is
the row dl Dragon's Blood sculpting gel
this is a really popular item this is
from the brand one of their most popular
items my work we sell this for $98 now
that's insane it's 1.7 ounces and I mean
it's not insane if you have the money
whatever it's a great product but I got
this for twenty-five dollars will 24 and
change from costco how crazy is that I
picks him up for my friends at work too
because they were like get me one when I
told them about it so I will be picking
up a couple more of these I really like
this product it just feels so smooth and
nice on the skin I've been using it day
and night and then at night I'll mix in
a little bit of my like argan oil just
to give it a little bit more moisture
but I really like this it's it's well
under makeup it has hyaluronic acid it
to help plump and firm the skin and I've
just really been enjoying it I think
it's a great product it feels great it
smells great I love it and for the price
especially getting it on that much of a
discount you cannot beat it so if you
have a costco membership or know someone
else costco membership I suggest totally
picking this up it's amazing and I have
really been enjoying it and I can't wait
to get a couple more as backup blasts
like item item this is from the turbo
say this is the C vitamin souffle
mask I've used this a couple times this
month and one the smell it smells
absolutely fabulous and I absolutely
love that about it but the texture of
this is something like I've never really
felt before so i'll try to show you
it's definitely when they say souffle
it's very souffle like so um it just
kind of feels like a whipped consistency
um it just feels very luxurious I find
that my skin just feels nice after he is
it looks a little below e um it just
feels like I'm taking care of my skin
when I use this mask I can't wait to
keep using this I mean I it's forty
dollars it's a mask a definitely with
like splurge on I guess again I mean but
forty dollars compared to like glam glow
isn't even that expensive considering so
for something just so luxurious a lot of
mature basay stuff is really expensive
so um yeah I've really been enjoying
that glad that I got it for fruit to try
out from work and I I really do like it
it's a good one just a few things I want
to mention some songs that I really been
liking I like have been loving Justin
Bieber songs I know it's not everyone's
style but Justin Bieber has a place in
my heart whether it's him or just like
the way I'm connected to him I worked at
justice just for girls for a really long
time for five years it was my first job
I moved my way up I was like store
manager by the time I graduated college
so I just have like a place in my heart
for Justin when I first started there it
was in October and it was winter and his
like first CD had come out so it was
like it played like every 15 minutes and
and through that and like all those
years I listened to so many songs of his
and one the beats just good but I just
you know it's just Justin and it's like
part of like my past it's weird even
though I wasn't like a super young girl
like at his concerts it's because I had
to be into what the little girls were
into because that's what we're selling
and so yeah it just has it's like memory
attachment to it so I really even liking
those two songs but they're just good
songs on their own to me I you know I'm
into it some other songs have really
been liking um pretty young saeng from
Michael Jackson I've really been
enjoying that song it's implying at work
and I'm into it i really like that song
and then I've also been enjoying
operator I think it's his name's John
crow
john i don't know i'm not sure what his
name is but it's like Papa Rita I hope
you know what I'm talking about just
from that cuz I'm not singing anymore
but I've really been enjoying that song
and I kind of got into that song from
the show transparent which is also
another favorite transparent is a show
it's like a raved about show I think
Jill Soloway who is the director 14 like
Best Director at the Emmys the Emmys um
so anyway it's a show about like a
transgender parent and just kind of like
this family's like life and like how
they're dealing with it it's really
really good there's one season of it and
they're in the making of a second one
which sam got to be an extra in which is
really awesome and so um that's kind of
why we started watching it in the first
place but it's just a really good show i
can't wait for season two and there's
something about it's like this comedy
but there's this like it's it's sad but
it's also funny it's just really
reminiscent of like just real life you
know life is like you're crying in your
laughing at the same time and I think
this month to I just could really not
relate to being transgender because I'm
not transgender but just relating to
just life and um everyone's struggle so
anyway I know it won't be everyone's cup
of tea but I did I really have enjoyed
that show I thought it was really really
good and i think that's it something i'm
looking forward to is crimson peak i
can't wait to see that I know it's
already gonna be a favorite of mine I
love pans labyrinth and I can't wait for
this one now that it's like a sequel but
i can't wait for crimson peak and I've
also been enjoying the book Dracula so
just vampires in general I don't know if
it's because it's turning October or
what but my taste has totally changed
like the x-files and Dracula and I just
watched interview with a vampire and
things like that those are totally not
things i feel like i would have liked
before but now I'm like into it so
anyway what I love true blood though I
don't know anyway I've just really been
liking that kind of seductive yet
dangerous and fanciful kind of story and
a vampire's kind of fill that so anyway
that's what I've been into I hope you
