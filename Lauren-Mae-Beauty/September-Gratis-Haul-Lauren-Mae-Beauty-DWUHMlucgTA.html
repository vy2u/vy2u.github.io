is going to be my gratis hall for
September I work in the beauty industry
so I get a lot of stuff for free from
brands when they come in train us so
that we can test out their products and
see how we like them I thought this
would just be a very transparent way of
me showing you things that I've got
things that are coming into my
collection if you guys want to review
you can let me know I mean I like
calling it a gratis hall instead of just
a regular Hall because I didn't buy
these items and I just want to be as
transparent about that as possible but I
didn't get these sent to me like for
YouTube or anything it's just because of
my work so let's get into it I try to
keep that disclaimer short because I say
it every single video I got a lot of
great stuff this month I'm really happy
about everything that I got and I can't
wait to try some of it so let's go we
started carrying this month a brand
called unite and I've heard about you
night through fleurdeforce and it's a
Haier brand product it's a hair product
brand it's a Haier brand anyway so I was
lucky enough to get to try quite a few
things from them this month and I'm
really excited about them so first
things I got a dry shampoo so you guys
know I'm excited about that this is the
seven seconds refresher this is a dry
shampoo it uses clay so you have to
shake it up and tell that you hear that
fall and then you just spray this in
your hair it does it's like an invisible
spray so if you have dark hair you're
worried about it great cast this is a
really good one for that it is like more
expensive this is like a professional
brand hair products so they are like
think of that price tag but I have
enjoyed this a couple times I've used it
this is just a little like travel type
of product this is the seven seconds
conditioner this is a leave-in detangler
this is one of their most popular
products their most raved about products
and I am excited to try it although I
haven't busted into it yet because i'm
using my moroccan oil i just haven't yet
but i am excited to try it out i've only
heard amazing things now those two
products came wrapped in just this
little like unite little band which i
thought was really cute and like brand
appropriate and then during the training
we got to pick two products that we
wanted to try so those i just got but I
got to pick out two items that I was
interested in so that was really awesome
i love when brands do that because
everyone has different needs and wants
for their hair and so when you get to
pick out the items if they work for you
you're really passionate about them and
excited to tell other people who have
similar concerns or you know want to fix
certain things because you tried it
yourself so I got this unite texturizer
spray this is a dry finishing spray kind
of like the orb a one kind of like the
bumble and bumble one so I like this
I've used it in Sam's here actually and
um it looks it works really really well
so I'm glad to have this and I feel like
this is quite a large can so that's
exciting the other product I decided to
get was the weekender shampoo this is a
clarifying shampoo you guys know I use a
lot of dry shampoo and I really wanted
something just to clarify my scalp and
my hair once a week or so and so I
thought this would be a good one to try
out I don't have a clarifying shampoo so
I you know wasn't getting something I
have a million of already so those are
the items i got from unite I haven't
really played with all of them that much
because I'm trying not to open a million
things at once but if and when I do I'll
let you guys know or if you guys want a
video on it just let me know a few of
their hair products that I got um
Michael is our bumble guy and we saw
each other again for like this event we
had at work and this was the dry spun
finish spray and he actually brought it
for me I was super super happy about
that I've been using this this is very
similar to the texturizer type of thing
I just wanted to try it out so I'm glad
to have this and to try it and yeah I
think it'll go well with that volume
mousse that i have so i kind want to use
them together and see how they work and
then another dry shampoo this is from
Bosley this is the volumizing dry
shampoo it's weightless now something
about this that I really like although i
haven't used it yet she told me that
this doesn't have aluminum in it and i
do not realized that of all the million
dry shampoos i sprayed in my head every
day have aluminum which I'm trying to go
natural with my deodorant once I finish
up what I have because of the aluminum
because of the like issues with
alzheimer and that type of thing but if
I'm just spraying it on my scalp every
day I mean that's not helping either so
I'm excited to try this one I'll see if
I like it but that's something that I
kind of look out for now um i have i
bought a dry shampoo in a long time
because i've been getting them from work
so much lately but once i start
adjusting my own I think it's going to
be something I'm just you know kind of
worried about because I use it a lot i
use a lot of dry shampoo and I just
don't I mean it's going on to my brain
and my brain it's going into my black
blood stream and into like my body and
if I'm so concerned about it in my
deodorant why not also be concerned
about it on my scalp so anyway I'm
excited I really hope this works out for
me this also will help with like hair
loss and stuff too because it's Bosley
Bosley came and trained us we also got
two of like the travel size shampoo and
conditioner of volumizing range those
are my shower now because Sam is using
them but I thought I'd just mentioned
them they're not that exciting they're
just hair loss shampoo I got a face wash
this month as well from ultra luxe this
is the mud lavender wash for a clean a
clean start for clear skin this is part
of their like acne range I thought this
would be a good one for when my skin is
breaking out it was mostly just
cleansers that we could pick from anyway
so this one I thought was most
appropriate for me I really like the
name of this it makes me want to use it
this is just a small size of something I
got from jawara I believe is how you say
it this is the candlenut body cream the
candlenut products from jawara smell
amazing they have a candle mat just like
scented oil that smells so so good it's
kind of like this mix between something
tropical and like like yeah nutty and
like more bakery but then coconut it
smells so good if you have the chance to
smell it I definitely suggest it but
it's just a mini body cream so i'll be
using that up something that I got not
from work but from school we went and
saw a demonstration at nigels beauty
emporium I believe and they gave us a
little like gift bag full of stuff it
only had a couple things in it but it
came with this like mini little mirrored
palette so you can like use this to mix
foundations or do whatever you're going
to do for a palette it also came with a
set of lashes these are kind of like
whimsical fantasy type of lashes and
then it came with another
item it was like a small brush cleaner
in the same brand as these lashes was
which is mondo or monda or something
which i believe is Nigel's brand I could
be wrong but I believe that's what it is
I just thought I'd throw those in here
because i also got those now on to the
beauty stuff that i got from work which
I'm super-excited about so um a lot of
the beauty stuff that i get from work i
get because we're switching out testers
so it's not necessarily a lot of makeup
brands we carry makeup but we the makeup
brands don't always come in so i don't
always have the opportunity and that way
to get makeup but i can take testers and
i'm the makeup manager so I'm the one
you know that kind of gets first pick i
guess you could say because I'm the one
that's switching out the testers and
making sure we have what we needed all
of that type of stuff so two things that
I picked up this month these are two
highlighters from vincent longo this
kind of more golden one is called patina
that's it's watched their a nice just
golden highlight these powders feel
absolutely amazing super soft I'm really
excited to have them and then this
lighter more frosty pink type of shade
is called flora and that's it there on
the top so I'm excited to play around
with these and have them in my
collection I just put them in my own Z
palette so those are them and then with
anything like this you can always just
sanitized a myth um you feel weird if
you want a video on how to sanitize
makeup let me know um but yeah I mean
most things you can sanitize as long as
you're not like dipping something that's
like touched your whole like your eye or
your lips and then dipping it back into
like a full thing of liquid product
other than that there's you can almost
sanitize anything so let me know I
picked up a few more things from our
nude sticks kind of like a box that they
gave us so we have a box underneath that
we can kind of go through every now and
then and pick products that we like so I
picked up more of the lip and cheek
pencils I just love these I know I
haven't put them in a favorites video
but these are some of my favorite lip
products are so easy I just really love
them so i picked up the color blush and
that's it they're just a nice neutral
it's a little bit Brown I really like
that I also decided to pick up the flesh
colored one this one is
dude it's like a peachy nude so that's
it there I just thought why not finish
out the collection i think i almost have
all of them i have six i know that i
think there might be but i have six of
them it's an addiction but a lease are
free right so but i love them i really
do i think they're great products the
last thing i have here is a big huge bag
that is full of dermablend items like so
much dermablend so i went through our
dermablend display at work and i just i
had a lot of like testers that were
sitting underneath and i just don't like
the clutter and i wanted to just switch
everything out start fresh why not and
so all the testers that I got rid of I
went through and took I took mostly like
the sticks and stuff anything that I
felt like I could actually salvage for
sanitation purposes so let me show you
what I picked out I'm not going to go
through colors but I will I'm sorry it's
complain I'm not going to go through
every color likes watching and stuff but
yeah so I picked up a lot of these derma
blend two sticks these are the quick fix
body so these can cover tattoos they're
really pigmented I also can see them
being great for like concealers and
stuff um as long as you like thin them
out maybe with 244 or something but
that's just a swatch of it there this
color is in the color nude I also have
the color sand I have almond and I have
tan and that's everything for the sticks
I also went through and change out a lot
of the smooth liquid camo this is a
medium coverage foundation since it's in
a squeezy tube all i have to do is
squeeze it out these aren't like it's
not in a pot or something so these would
be great too for like my kit and stuff
so I'm excited for that have tons of
different colors this is cafe the
lighter one here is called linen i have
sienna this is camel this color is this
cream cinnamon copper and the last one
here is CPS or sepia so that is quite a
few I definitely can use those and mix
them to basically get any color I need
and dermablend it's quite a thick
coverage type of foundation they're
really known for like covering tattoos
covering imperfections really
full-coverage type of stuff but I mean
you can fin anything
out with a mixing medium so I think that
this will be really really great and I
excited to have them in so many
different colors and such a nice product
and the two last things that I decided
to take home from dermablend this is the
leg and body cover this is in the color
light I also have the color ivory I
thought these would be nice i have a lot
of scarring on my leg so I just thought
I would take them and if I ever want to
have you know my legs look nicer with
makeup I can use these and that's what
they're meant for and then I also have
the long wear makeup remover and I'm
excited to try this out just see how it
works and that is everything lots of
makeup on this one um I'll like kind of
one type of thing but really awesome I'm
really glad to have those things it's
you know if you like makeup and say you
aren't in a career or something and I
think that working at sephora working on
a beauty place not that I work it's for
but just working at some type of beauty
store or place is so beneficial you get
so much so many free things you're
constantly talking to people about
makeup which is if you love it so fun
and you're getting paid to do all of
that I mean not necessarily the biggest
wage especially if you're just like an
associate but it's a great place to
start if you're young and I definitely
suggest it if you love makeup or you can
get like even just a part-time job if
you're a stay-at-home mom and that or I
don't know i just i suggested if you if
you really want to try it it's it's fun
to be in this kind of like beauty world
on on a level more than just on youtube
for me personally anyway i hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know down
below if you want to see a review on
anything um if you've tried any of this
stuff and you love it or anything like
that I loved hearing from you guys and I
will see you in the next video if you
have any suggestions for videos please
leave them down below I'm going to do a
couple different like Peru videos like a
my makeup bag for Peru and that type of
stuff I'm also going to probably do a
couple vlogs hopefully you guys will
enjoy that let me know but I still
wanted just because I think it'll be a
nice piece to have later in life and
that's everything I'm gonna end it there
I hope you guys enjoy it i'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
