Lauren I have a few videos to film today
so I thought I would start off with a
favorites video because they're fun
getting warmed up for my other videos to
come so let's get into my sep tember
favorites I still cannot believe that
it's already October by the time this
goes up between like halfway through
October it's crazy I feel like I might
have six favorites this month I'm not
entirely sure but I might we'll start
off with beauty stuff because it's
always the funnest it really is I'm
counting these all as one because I got
them all basically last month ish and
this month ish so my three new pallets
I've just really been loving these it's
been so fun to get new eyeshadows and
I'm just excited that I got them that I
put the bullet on them and that I picked
them up so starting off I have the lorac
mega Pro three this is the one I suggest
you get if you're only gonna buy one of
these pallets or if I had to make a
decision I think this is the one that's
just the most versatile I think that
shadow formula is absolutely amazing I'm
obsessed with rose quartz insider like
the most but i really love tan and pecan
and dusty mauve and violet grey toffee
vintage maple all of those matte shades
for the crease as well as transition and
just in love so i've also been using it
on set and everyone really likes their I
luck with it so it's basically just
winning everything it's winning my life
I'm so sorry if you can hear the beeping
I know you can because I can hear it and
my house doesn't hold secrets I'm gonna
leave my review it's kind of a first
impression though because I really
wanted to get it up so you guys could
get it if you wanted it but I will leave
my likes watch in comparison video of
this down below anyway it's my number
one favorite out of the three so far but
i do love all of them and just trying to
make it easy on you if you just want one
pallet another one of the pallets is the
ice cream palette from dose of colors
now this one's a little bit harder to
get you do have to get it off of their
website but i really like it i think
it's really nice i will have a swatch
and review video coming up and filming
that today so stay tuned for that I
might even upload it before this one
just so that way before you see it in a
favorites I don't even know who knows
the order i'll have bloated and right
I just really do love this palette this
is for someone who has a lot of pallets
want something different wants to try
like an indie brand or a new brand
anyway I really like it I love the color
selection it's what i'm wearing on my
eyes today although i know you can't
really see it because i am wearing
glasses but i thought i'm not gonna be
blind again i enjoyed not being blind in
my last video so i decided to not be
blind in these ones as well and then the
last palette that i got recently is the
kat von d metal matte palette it was one
that I was kind of on the edge if I
wanted to get it if I didn't want to get
it the color selection in here I love it
I like them you need a loko remix better
than this color selection but I do enjoy
it still I think I'll definitely get you
said of it I'm happy to have it i'm glad
that i got it before it sold out so
overall i am really happy with it but I
can totally understand why someone
wouldn't want this palette I've
definitely been playing around with this
I really do like ignite and the synergy
color I really liked like these colors i
did a really pretty look with those the
other day so I am enjoying this palette
and it's just fun to play around with it
on all of these pallets I will be doing
a for looks on palette it just takes
time to get it film so be on the lookout
for those i will also leave my swatch
video on this down below as well if you
want a more in-depth look at this
palette i know that was a lot of pallets
so I apologize but I'm just excited that
I have all those now I can't wait to
just kind of play with them anyway those
are my palettes let's just like move on
to other favorites the next favorite I
wanted to mention is a repurchase this
is buck soms dolly now if you've been
with me for a while you know i love this
i use this up in a project pan it's what
i'm wearing on my lips now and it's just
my favorite color like you guys know I
don't love a lot of lip colors I don't
wear a lot of lip colors so for me to
repurchase something is kind of a big
deal I really like this this is like my
go-to color I like it with every look
I'm into it so I just suggest this you
can only get it at Ulta for whatever
reason it is the buxom full on lipstick
in the color dolly the shade is not
available on sephora.com I've no idea
why they do that crap but yeah I love it
it's so good and the last kind of beauty
favorite that i have to mention our nail
polishes now i go on faces with my nails
because sometimes i like to do them
sometimes they don't sometimes i really
am into gel polishes sometimes i'm not
right now I
really been enjoying the formula X
polishes that were sent to me from
Influenster I was not expecting to like
these i was aren't even really excited
for that box because it was nail polish
and then when it came to me busted with
all of the acetone everywhere I was just
like so ready to write that box and
totally off like I was just gonna give
this stuff away without even using it I
know that sounds so psycho but that is
the truth anyway I'm a little Brock
shins alright guys let me let me try to
remedy that I like the shine it gives I
just really been enjoying them I think
they work really well and it could be
that part of me wasn't expecting them to
work as well or wasn't excited for them
that makes them just that much better in
my book but I really have been enjoying
them more than my setia be even so and
then because I've been liking to paint
my nails I rediscovered a Polish in my
collection that I think is absolutely
gorgeous if you're looking for just a
beautiful glitter for a wedding for the
everyday I don't care i like glitter all
the time like wedding nails are like my
everyday mail like so this is a polished
by butter london it's absolutely
beautiful it is called tart with a heart
and it is a kind of let's see if i can
describe it this is like a base that is
slightly pink just barely it's not clear
and it has I don't even know I'm pretty
sure its holographic because it shines
all different colors but it's just so
beautiful has little gold glitters in it
some like more pinky glitters it's just
the best lawyer ever biggest thing I
love about this is you can apply this
from the brush without having to do any
special tricks and it looks great two
coats of this you could do like almost a
whole opaque nail full of glitter it
applies really nicely and it applies
like it should to get what you see in
the bottle and that does not always
happen so I just highly suggest this
it's just a good one it's like one of my
favorite glitters I've ever used so I
love this my other favorites are not
beauty related they're just like randoms
I guess you could call them the first
one is going to be audible now I talked
about audible in my read 5 by November
fifth challenge but I thought I would
mention it here in case you haven't seen
that I just have really been enjoying
having books read to me so far I'm on my
like third book for the month the first
book that I listened to was the girl a
train me
eh i'm actually listened to that book
together I feel like when you read a
book it's just you in the book you know
just you two having a good old time and
you are thinking about it and there's
book clubs and stuff but having it read
to you is kind of like making the book
into a movie which is something that i
like i love show the love movies we love
to watch them together and talk about
them so just made the book a fun thing
to do it was fun to talk about the book
share our experience our like questions
our thoughts our fears all these things
because it was a murder mystery it was
just a really good book to read together
and I really enjoyed it and I just
really enjoy audible irie signed up for
my membership it was out of credits and
I was sad the other books I've been
reading are fifty shades of grey I've
really been enjoying it it's not a book
for everyone not only because of the
fact that it has a lot of sexual content
in it but because it isn't written
entirely well I feel like it is a little
bit more it's like remedial and
repetitive I totally can get that I
totally understand that because it is
but I really do like the story behind it
and I'm on the second book already so
yeah just audible in general there are
so many different books to choose from
I'm just excited I think the next book
me and Sam are going to read is going to
be fear and loathing in las vegas i
already have that in my library the next
favorite i think have two more favorites
actually after this so the next favorite
is dis me Leon if you guys follow me on
instagram you guys know me and Sam are
annual passholders now so I'm so excited
about it and I'd love to share it
because I love Disneyland we actually
have been annual passholders before when
we lived in Arizona but it's just so fun
to be annual passholders now where we
can actually go to Disneyland we went
twice in the month of September and
we're going again already when my mom
comes into town for October she's been
really fun to go to Disneyland and have
fun it's something that we've done so
much together in the nine years we've
been together and it's just fun to be
able to do it more often who doesn't
love to zoom in please when we went to
Paris that was like one of the things I
wanted to do which I know is like super
touristy of me I don't care I really
wanted to go to Disneyland Paris so I
want to try to go to all of them if I
could that would be fun i really want to
do Walt Disney World how fun would that
be anyway
and then the last we would I have it's
just a name at me and Sam finally agreed
that we're going to do and that's going
to be for holiday we are going to go up
to San Francisco I'm lucky enough with
being able to freelance with makeup and
everything and then his job slows down
around Christmas that we can take off I
think we're gonna take off about two
weeks which is like before Christmas
into new years but we're gonna drive up
the coast go to the hearst castle or
it'll be all decorated for christmas the
hearst castle is one of my like all-time
favorite places ever i absolutely love
it it's just so beautiful and then to
see it with christmas which christmas is
my all-time favorite holiday i give out
ornaments for my wedding gift I'm like
obsessed with Christmas so to have the
hearst castle and Christmas together is
so exciting i'm so excited to drive up
the coast to see that and then san
francisco is just one of those places
that me and sound I just love we went
there for a fifth anniversary it's just
a beautiful city and I'm excited to go
back have a few days where we can just
hang out have fun enjoy the holiday and
then from there we'll go and see family
for a couple of weeks which will be
great as well so I'm just glad that we
kind of like decided to do that that
we're able to do that I feel really
blessed that we're gonna be able to do
that and it will be so fun and I'm
really excited for it plus guess what we
can put that together with audible as we
drive up the coast so ok that's it I'm
so rambling this video I apologize but
