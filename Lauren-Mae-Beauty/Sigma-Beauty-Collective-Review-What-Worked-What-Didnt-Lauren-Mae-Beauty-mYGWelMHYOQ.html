Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to share with you some of
the Sigma products that I received
recently and just give you all my
thoughts on them I've been testing them
out for a little bit and some of them
I've tried more than others so I will be
completely upfront with you about how
long I've tried some of this stuff but I
thought it would be great to just give
you kind of like a collective good and
bad what worked what didn't I got quite
a few brushes and I did purchase brushes
from Sigma in the past that are like 5
or 6 years old so I thought it would be
cool to show you the difference between
the brush that I had that's old and the
new one because some of them are reapeat
and I think that's kind of interesting I
also have a tutorial on this look which
is using a lot of the brushes and the
palette and the gel liner and stuff so
if you want to see these products in
action I'm gonna leave that video linked
in the description box it's gonna be
uploaded on the same day I just wanted
to Pavlin separate in case you only
wanted to see one or the other or
whatever the case might be
just for clarity this is not sponsored
these are my hundred percent honest
opinions and yeah let's just get into
what I have and what I think about them
I'm gonna talk about the brush
accessories first then we'll go into
brushes and we'll go into like actual
products so first off they did send me
the mat as you can tell mines really
dirty I have used this and that's the
first kind of point where getting into
it because there's no way we can get
around it
something that I don't like about these
mats is that when you wash your brushes
and I don't know if it's the wash or the
product that's coming off but on the
silicone it just leaves a nasty film and
you could spend your time scrubbing this
away but who wants to do that so I
really enjoy this mat and the purposes
of it it works really well this one I
believe is the mini one which retails
for twenty-five dollars I think that's a
fair price but there are some other
dupes out there I remember when this
Sigma came out with the cleaning love
and I got it Sam got me this and I
really enjoyed using it Sam's got huh
speaking of singing sorry about that
little interruption so I did get the
original match they don't even sell this
anymore they have the one with like the
to where you can wear it anyway
I really enjoyed using this and I'm
actually really happy that I got the mat
because I ended up starting to use this
as a mat I'll just set this in my sink
and use it that way without putting it
on my hand so I just highly suggest a
mat in general I think these are a great
way to save your hand when you're
cleaning brushes if you have a lot of
brushes to clean and you use your hand
and like scrub your brushes clean your
hand is so like just raw and irritate it
at the end of it so this will save that
from happening to you
I just wish that the silicone didn't get
all dirty I don't know what that is if
you have a solution to that let me know
what it is because that's kind of
annoying but yeah I do really like these
mats I think they're really great next
let's talk about the Sigma Jack brush
shampoo this is a hundred percent
natural liquid brush cleaner it retails
for fifteen dollars comes in a nice pump
I think the packaging is nice and sturdy
I use this to clean the brushes and I
just I don't prefer this it's not as bad
of a price point as I thought it was
gonna be so it's not like completely
unreasonable in price I just prefer
something like the dr. Bronner's or
something like that it's I'm also like
all natural and really good for the
environment and you you can get so much
more of it for a better price and I
didn't find that this really just like
got rid of everything in my brushes some
of my brush is still had stuff if I used
too much of this one of my brushes was
like really it was like I must have not
gotten all the product out I'm not sure
but it was a really stiff afterward so
this is that we're not a favorite of
mine I don't think it's like the worst I
just would not purchase this I'm gonna
finish it up but I won't purchase this
and I don't really suggest it moving on
we have a time well actually let me just
talk about the other things and then
we'll just talk about brushes I think
that's because I have a lot of brushes
to talk about so next I want to talk
about the warm neutrals palette this is
the palette I use to get the eye look I
have today I think this is
a really pretty pallet super neutral and
definitely has those warm colors in here
I feel like the most interesting colors
in here are the Rouge shade and then
this fool's gold is a really glittery
kind of like greeny gold color which is
interesting I do like the mix of mattes
and shimmers in this palette and I do
like the size of it it's very very small
but it has quite a few shades in it to
do a bunch of different eye looks I
brought this with me to Vegas for my
birthday and I really enjoyed using it
you can only do something kind of basic
from this palette but I think it's nice
my biggest gripe with this is the price
tag this retails for $39 and I just
think it's too expensive if this was a
19 or 20 dollar palette I think that
it'd be worth the quality that you're
getting and the amount of shadows and
everything else but I just think that
$39 is too expensive for Sigma and this
palette there's just a lot of
competition and a lot of stuff out on
the market and I don't see anyone just
like going to the website to buy this
for that much money
Anasazi of palettes retail for 42
dollars so for three more dollars you
could get something of that quality and
I like the shadows better I did find
that these blended well and something
that you might really like about these
shadows is that they don't have a lot of
kick up in the pan so when you put your
brush in there even like a big fluffy
e-40 brush it's not going to kick up a
bunch of product they're not insanely
soft but they still blend nice and they
still have some nice pigment to them so
do I like this yes I enjoy this I'm glad
I have it but I would not pay for this
palette and even at 20 dollars I feel
like that's like it still has a lot of
competition because these are such like
normal average colors and I believe the
last product I got sent was the wicked
eyeliner I'd have it on today I have
only used this twice so I definitely
want to try this out a little bit more
but the thoughts that I have on it
currently I think it's nice of black
it's very creamy it does dry down and
set which is nice but I'm nervous that
this might not be a match for my hooded
oily eyes the last time I wore this I
did have transfer onto my upper eyelid
it was very light but it was just
starting and I only
had it on a couple of hours so I'm gonna
keep trying this and see if that's
something that happens or if that was
just like a weird situation but that
isn't necessarily a great sign other
than not this is one of their best
selling products though so it works for
a lot of people if you don't have hooded
eyes if you don't have extremely oily
eyelids I think this would work well
this retails for $14 which is pretty
comparable but again you can definitely
get stuff like that at the drugstore so
I don't know I wish they had some really
cool colors or something different but
they just have a black and a brown in a
gel pot moving on to the brushes these
are what they're best known for I think
that if you're gonna order something
from Sigma you should order their
brushes I'm really happy with some of
these some of them I don't use as much
but I do really enjoy the quality
overall of the brushes that I've used in
the past and the brushes that they sent
to me so I'm going to just start going
through them I'll start with face
brushes first and some of these are
dirty because I've used them so I'm
sorry but it's because I actually use
them I have watched all the new brushes
and I will say that I didn't have any
problems with shedding I didn't have any
problems with like dye coming out at all
so I was really really happy with that
especially for these brand new brushes
because I find with brushes that are
black like this a lot of the times when
you wash them you can get some dye
coming out so yeah let's just start off
with this one that I'm touching this is
the Sigma large powder F 20 brush if you
watch the tutorial on this look you will
see that I like to use this brush as a
bronzer brush this is a tapered powder
brush which I really like it's nice and
big and fluffy it's SuperDuper soft but
this is really nice for getting some
bronzer on and blending it out and
getting a nice diffused look I also like
the fact that it's tapered because I
find that even though it's big I can get
it kind of in the hollow ish areas of my
cheek which is where I like to apply
bronzer this is a brush that I had from
them in the past
my ferrule on this is getting a little
bit loose which is kind of annoying but
I have had this for like five or six
years and my other ones aren't like that
this is the large powder brush F 30 this
is like a classic powder brush in the
sense that it is nice and round and it's
not tapered I prefer the tapered brush
over this
this was something that I used to use
but I never use anymore I keep this
around because it's a nice brush and
it's soft and everything and I might use
it at some point but this is definitely
not something in my everyday routine I
much prefer the shape of this I have
three different foundation type brushes
these two were sent to me and then this
is one I've had I got a set so Sam
originally had bought me the mrs. bunny
set the mr. bunny set which I do not
believe is available still I was looking
on the website and I didn't see it up
there
it came with I want to say like twelve
different brushes and this is just your
classic flat foundation brush it's nice
I use this in my kit actually and
usually I use it to apply moisturizer or
kind of like pre foundation products I
don't tend to use this to actually apply
foundation because it doesn't really
blend well it almost just kind of lays
product down but doesn't really buff it
into the skin so I think this is a nice
brush it's good quality but it's nothing
very special but it almost be like if
they didn't have that brush like what
you guys are a brush company but you
don't have a like the paddle foundation
brush the other two though are really
popular products from them the first one
here is one of their all-time most
popular brushes this is the Sigma flat
kabuki f80 brush I've heard so many
people talk about this in the past this
is just like classic Sigma hair and I
really do enjoy this brush I think it
blends on foundation really really
nicely it's soft and it's dense without
being too dense I really do enjoy this I
believe this retails for $25 I will have
prices on the screen if I forget to
mention I believe this is about twenty
five dollars though and I think it's a
good price it's gonna last you really
long time again I've had my brushes from
Sigma for like five or six years so I
think that although it's twenty-five
dollars you're gonna get your investment
out of it so I'm really happy to have
this brush probably the biggest surprise
liking out of all this stuff is the
Sigma 3d HD max kabuki brush this has a
really odd shape to it it almost comes
to like a weird point and then it has
like outside flaps like it's it's a
strange brush I've seen that girl Shea
XO use this brush before and I know that
she's an affiliate and
Samantha March so if you're gonna order
any of these things use one of their
code so you can save 10% I am not an
affiliate I don't have a code or
anything but anyway I was kind of just
skeptical about this brush I thought it
was just kind of a gimmick of a brush
but I really really enjoy this I think
it's very very nice I like the shape of
it because I can get it into my nose
this is the brush that you will see in
the demo for this look so if you want to
see it in action definitely go check
that video out highly suggest this this
is a little bit expensive though it's
like 37 but I'm really happy to happen I
do really enjoy it the last few face
brushes I want to mention are ones that
I had previously but I thought for this
video I would just talk about everything
that I had that was Sigma so you guys
could just know my full opinions on
everything what I tried what I liked
what I don't and what not this is the
Sigma duo fiber brush at 50 I really
like a duo fiber brush this one is in my
kit currently I don't think duo fiber
brushes get as much love as they used to
I remember people would apply like sheer
glow with this like Tanya burr would use
a like stipple brush to apply stuff and
I do enjoy simple brushes for a
foundation they can look a little
streaky if you're doing something like
with too much product but if you're
really using a light amount of product
and a light hand and buffing it into the
skin I really enjoy these brushes I also
like these for really light powder
application because it's not very dense
up here so I don't know if I would
purchase this now but I'm glad to have
it and it's held up really nicely this
is one of my all-time favorite brushes
this is the large angled contour f40
brush I use this for my blush every
single day if you've watched a tutorial
of mine if you watched it get ready with
me I literally use this brush every
single freaking time
I love it I think it's great I love an
angled brush for my blush application I
just find it works really well this
one's nice and not too large I don't
want to blush brush too large I already
tend to go a little bit crazy with my
blush so this is nice and controlled
it's held up very very well the ferrule
is not coming off or anything so this is
a really nice one you could also use
this for contour which is what it's for
but again I like it for blush we're
gonna move into the eye brushes because
I have quite a few and I'm gonna start
with my favorite one because it's my
favorite so if you guys have seen any of
my tutorials again you've probably seen
8:40 brush I use this all the time to
blend shadows into my crease I
absolutely love this this came again
with my mr. bunny set and I will say
it's different than the two that I got
so they sent me actually two different
efore D brushes they're the same brush I
just got one in a kit with like the
Sigma eye kit essentials which if I can
find that I'm gonna leave it linked but
I couldn't find it online when I was
looking and looking at prices and just
kind of you know checking out the
website and then they sent me one that
was just like individually wrapped um
these are not as full as this one
obviously this one also has a difference
in the bristle color these are all black
and this has a kind of white tip to it I
like this one I think better and I have
heard that the ones in the kits come
differently than the ones separately I
don't know how you can get this one and
I don't know if part of the reason this
is a lot bigger and fluffier is because
of where again I've had this like 5 or 6
years but I love it highly suggested
it's the number one brush I suggest out
of all of these brushes if you were
gonna pick up one thing from Sigma I
would pick up the e-40 I think it's
worth it it's just great I love it the
other two I do enjoy though I think
they're nice they're just not as big and
as blending and fluffy as I'm used to so
it's just a difference in getting used
to these I will say like you can see a
bit of a difference from this one to
this one so I think with so time they're
gonna like kind of fan out a little bit
I still really like this brush though I
think they're great we'll move on to
another one that I have a duplicate of
this is the large shader e60 brush this
is my original one and this is the new
one this is a brush that I use in my kit
to apply concealer and then I'll buff it
out with a more fluffy blending brush I
think this is a nice brush it's
definitely not something everyone needs
but if you're gonna pick this up and it
comes in a set I suggest using this as a
base eyeshadow like setting your primer
type of brush that works really nicely
and I do like how you can use this edge
to get right under the brow bone if you
want to so I think that's a nice
application method for it you can't
apply concealer with it as well but yeah
I find
with my eyes this is just a little too
big for an actual like shader brush it
mean it calls itself a large shader
brush and it definitely is large I also
have matching eye shading brushes this
is the e55 brush again these are really
nice this isn't something I use all the
time I can use it to like kind of pack
something on but I tend to like
something that is a little bit less
fluffy when I'm going to really pack a
metallic shadow onto the lid so these
are nice
I just I'm glad to have them but this
isn't something that's like if I was to
pare down my eye brushes these probably
wouldn't make it in my like 5 eye brush
for my eyes kind of routine a brush I
really really love is the pencil brush
from Sigma I had one originally and I
use it all the time and then this is
just the new one this is the e30 brush I
believe these retail for $15 and I
really like it pencil brushes are great
for adding a little bit of shine to your
inner corner you can also blend things
out on the lower lash line so it's a
nice little detail brush and I enjoy it
the biggest difference in brush for me
what time is the small angle brush or
the e65 when you see the close-up of
these you are not going to believe that
these are the same brush because my
goodness they look different and I don't
know if they did change them up because
that could potentially be a real thing
but the new one is great you can get a
really nice and precise eyeliner
application with this I use this the
first time I use the gel eyeliner and I
got a great wing you guys can see my
eyeliner in that video it's the last set
of videos I did I do enjoy this I think
it's nice
it's definitely surprising because this
is the one I use a Mac it and this is so
frayed I don't know if it's just with
time and with cleaning and everything
but my goodness
if you can't get a precise line for crap
with this I end up using this one on the
lower lash line more than anything to
kind of like blend things out and not
get a super precise line I definitely
suggest if you or someone who is
struggling with gel eyeliner and getting
just a nice precise wing it's probably
your brush so invest in something you
could do this one or another one I'm
going to talk about the one from
colourpop's really nice too
I'm just in general trying to tell you
like it could be your brush if you're
wondering why you're not getting a nice
precise crisp flick it's probably your
brush this is really easy
to do what so that was great and it
makes me want to throw the other brush
white because it's basically useless the
eyeliner brush that I use today and then
you'll see in the demo is the winged
liner zo6 brush this is very very small
and it worked really really nicely I'm
really happy with the outcome if you or
someone who wants a really delicate
winged liner I think this would really
help you get that I usually use a pen
liquid liner instead of a gel but I'm
wanting to try gels out more now that I
have some nice brushes and just in
general I think that I can kind of
control the product better because the
applicator is nicer in a pen form maybe
the first time you use it it's nice but
it's hard to get that just really
precise line for me so anyway I highly
suggest this brush if you're looking for
a winged liner and you want something
really dainty and small this is
definitely going to help you get that I
was able to really control the product
on the inner part of my eye and get a
nice flick on the outside wing and then
the only brush that I haven't used from
them this is the eye liner brush the eo5
and this is just a classic eyeliner
brush I just like the winged and angled
brushes I think that they just helped me
get a better line and just have a better
grasp on the angle of my eyeliner but I
will be trying this out seeing how it
works if anything I think it'll be nice
to add some like detailed dots around my
eyes if I want to do something a little
bit more decorative or avant-garde or
something with the liner so that's
something I'm excited to try this out
with I really hope this was
informational or helped you at all if
you were looking at some of the Sigma
brushes and I hope you enjoyed the
side-by-sides of like my old brushes
compared to the new ones the wear on
them I thought it was really cool that
it had quite a few of these brushes and
so I've had a lot of time with some of
these things and I could give you guys a
really just thorough review of them let
me know if you've tried any Sigma
brushes what your thoughts are in the
comments down below I really like to
make the comment section in a place
where people can go for information and
if we could just have like a community
there my opinion is just mine and it's
great to hear from other people overall
I think Sigma has some nice brushes for
me they're just
any bit like I just loved them a little
bit more affordable but you can still
save 10% off I think more than anything
I'm just someone who likes to get things
at like insanely inexpensive prices but
I do think that if you're going to make
an order from Sigma you are going to
enjoy the brushes I think they're gonna
last you a long time I suggest going
with a kit if you can find one that you
will actually use a majority of the
brushes you will save some money but if
there are quite a few that you won't use
in a set I suggest just picking off the
few that you're going to and buying them
individually I would say about my top
four products from here that I suggest
you get her all brushes I really enjoyed
the 3d HD max kabuki you could get this
or the f80 whichever one you think
you're gonna like more but I really
enjoy this as one of my favorite ones
the e-40 brush I super enjoy it's great
I love my blush brush so I suggest that
one and then I really do like the winged
liner brush either get this or the
regular angle I just hope that this one
doesn't fray as much and since I've had
the other one fray I suggest this over
the regular angled so those are my
suggestions I really hope you guys
enjoyed the video thanks so much - Emily
for sending these out it was fun trying
them out and seeing what I thought of
the product so thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
