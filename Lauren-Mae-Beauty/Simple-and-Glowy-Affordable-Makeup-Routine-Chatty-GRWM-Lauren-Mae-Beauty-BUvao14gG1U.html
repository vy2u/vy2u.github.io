Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me but instead of this just being a
try to get ready with me where I'm doing
my makeup I thought that I would kind of
have something more to offer in it so
today as we're chatting I'm going to be
showing you kind of my more glowy
routine this is like my very simple
makeup when I want my skin to look
radiant and on top of that all of the
products I'm going to be using today are
affordable including brushes including
the sponge like everything in here is
from a more affordable brand so I
thought that was like some more
information to give you guys than just
me chatting that being said there's
construction it's like it doesn't matter
when I get up I am filming way earlier
than normal today and they're still
noises cute the dog barking seriously I
know I mentioned noises she's like all
the time and if you can't hear it then
you know god bless but I feel like
there's something that's like every
single one of my freakin videos so I am
getting a mic hopefully my next couple
of videos will finally have a mic and
hopefully that will help I don't know
we'll see
that'll being said let's just like get
into it and we'll talk because I haven't
uploaded a video in two days which I
know is like not a big deal for most
channels but since I upload everyday it
feels like it's been forever so I'm
gonna be using the Ordinaries hide here
in silicone primer this is like a five
dollar primer and it's nice just for
like smoothing the skin this isn't like
an overly glowy primer and so for me
since I have oily skin this might be
different than if someone had dry skin
so you can keep that in mind but I like
the way that this smooths over my face
so anyway the reason I haven't been
uploading is because I got extremely ill
really fast I don't know why I don't
know how it just was crazy
I don't I don't know what happened I'm
gonna zoom this in so you guys can see
everything up close even though we're
just chatting real fast for foundation
today I'm using this BB cream it's from
AOA and I mixed the shade light and I
mix the shade fair I kind of go heavier
on the fair one but I feel like fair on
its own is just a little bit too light
I've really been enjoying this BB cream
it's pretty light coverage but I've been
enjoying that and it's super glowy but I
don't find that it makes
super oily throughout the day which is
awesome so I guess we'll just start like
you know what I've been doing what I've
been up to so Tuesday I was really lucky
to get invited to this covergirl party
here in LA which is like amazing and
like so insane it's crazy because like I
saw Jackie aina I didn't say hi I didn't
say I don't like anyone I like actually
knew their faces from that like have
tons of subscribers because that freaks
the crap out of me
I know that's stupid but that's the
truth baby but it was just cool it was
like this Austin moment to be at this
party and you know so many amazing
influencers and huge influencers are
there and it was for cover girls fall
lineup and like the new matte foundation
that they're launching which has 40
shades for the drugstore which is
amazing and anyway it was a really cool
event and I had a great time so the next
day I wake up and I wasn't feeling ill
at all a little ill I had a little bit
of alcohol let's get real but I wasn't
really feeling ill and so there was a
thing that influencer had sent me
another kind of like event thing but
anyone could go to it and it was on
Santa Monica Pier it was for Marc Jacobs
and the new fragrance that they have
coming out called Daisy love and I love
Daisy so I was like I want to go smell
Daisy love it's new and it's free so
let's go so we went down to Santa Monica
and they were they like took over this
whole part of the pier so they have like
a ferris wheel that you can go on and it
has like all these decals of Marc Jacobs
on it it was just like a really cool
thing
so you see someone there and they give
you like a perfume as well as like an
eat play or ride and so we got the eat
one so we got to have some ice cream
that was inspired by the fragrance Daisy
loved so I got the vanilla one Sam got
the berry one and we kind of split them
and I hadn't eaten anything all day and
it was a little bit later in the day
until I was really hungry so I ate the
ice cream I was like maybe this all like
hold me over a little bit and we'll go
get something and so I was like no my
stomach's really hurting I don't know
what's going on so we went to tender
grains and I was like let's just get
some food and so then we're at tender
greens and I start getting chills and
I'm like Sam I'm like freezing he's like
okay well it's not that cold and I
usually always get cold by the beach
because I feel like the beach
as much as you expect it to be like this
warm sunny place like it is in the Sun
but like when the wind is blowing it's
freaking cold I was having shivers and I
just my stomach was hurting so bad and
so I was like Sam I think I might be
getting a fever so we went home I barely
ate anything and I had a fever I was
like shivering it was like full-blown
fever dumb and this whole time my
stomach is hurting so bad like up in my
actual stomach not like my intestines
like my stomach felt bloated and tight
and just hurt hurt hurt hurt so freakin
bad so I took some aspirin my fever
broke and I was like okay I'm feeling
better like I'm not hurting as much
maybe it was ice cream like I don't know
I don't know what it could have been so
I was like maybe it was just like this
weird fluke freak thing so I make myself
a sandwich it's pretty late at night but
I was like I need to eat something like
I haven't really eaten anything all day
and then my stomach starts hurting again
so I wasn't able to film a video that
day and get one up the next day I'm
still hurting so much and like basically
without getting TMI everything's just
like running through me and so today is
finally the first day that my stomach
isn't hurting insanely bad like it still
is and I'm still definitely not 100%
recovered but I'm hoping that I'm on the
right track last night was rough today's
already been a little bit rough but I
feel like I'm finally like on the verge
of getting better and I have no idea
what this was how this happened to me
why this happened to me I don't know if
it's something I ate but I don't feel
like that's it like there's nothing I
can think of that would have really made
this happen in the time of when I
finally was feeling the effects of it so
super weird and like it would make sense
if it was just a stomach thing but then
the fact that I got a fever is kind of
strange so anyway that's where I've been
I've just been so ill I'm gonna be
putting the Maybelline fit me concealer
on and I've been breaking out like you
can see here I don't know if that's from
the color pop highlighter or something
new in my skincare that I've been
but it's kind of like on my cheekbone so
I'm kind of scared
it's the colour-pop highlighter I'm
gonna be using today so hopefully that's
not true but I'm gonna try to like see
if I can pinpoint what it is but yeah
I've just been so ill it's crazy because
it's not like I had the shakes or
anything like well I my body was really
sore when I woke up the day after the
covergirl party it's like man I just
feel sore and like kind of weird and I'm
like I didn't do anything to make myself
feel sore so I don't know if that was
part of it I don't know what it was just
strange super strange but at the same
time I was telling Sam was like I feel
like this isn't weird for me and like I
need to be like taking notes I think and
like really understanding my stomach and
see if there's like a pattern that I'm
not really recognizing and see if
there's something that I can kind of
know like is it irritable bowel syndrome
is it lactose intolerant I don't know
cuz it's like kind of started with the
ice cream although I wasn't feeling
great before that so also you wouldn't
get a fever from being lactose
intolerant so I don't know that's just
something and I just literally have felt
so ill my body's just been weak I
haven't really been able to eat anything
and actually keep it in me so I don't
know I haven't really I've been trying
to eat for like nutrition but nothing
sounds good I know that if I eat it's
probably not gonna end up very well so
it's like I don't even really want to
I'm just trying to stay as hydrated as
possible anyway so that is the
foundation I definitely still have stuff
showing through but there is a nice glow
to it so for me sometime oily I do want
to set my face with the powder so I'm
use the AO a perfect setting powder I
love this translucent powder once again
super affordable but so nice and I set
this everywhere anyway so I'm sorry I
haven't uploaded um you know it's weird
because I'm just so used to uploading
everyday that it felt strange to not
have videos going up but hopefully we'll
get back on track I'm gonna film two
videos today and I think that will help
me get back on track so what else did I
want to update you guys on I wanted to
say thanks for all of these suggestions
on my Italy travel video I'm definitely
like taking those into account and my
mom's like making a list who she's
I'm gonna go back to the comments and
make a wholeness for things that we need
I was like okay great
so I really appreciate all of your
guys's suggestions and just everyone
who's just like I'm so happy for you
like I'm very excited for this trip I
know I talk about it a lot but I am so
again follow me on Instagram if you want
to be caught up I'm really excited to
start doing some of the Instagram
stories and I told Sam yesterday but I
do want to try to vlog while we're there
to at least have some footage when I
come back like I just I love traveling
and you know if I can try to make that a
really actually fun and like beautiful
vlog that would be really cool to show
you guys and share that with you in case
you haven't ever been or you just want
to see what it looks like or what we did
or whatever I think it'd be cool so okay
so my face is set that powder I don't
like to go to have you with it like
right now I look pretty matte but I'm
telling you throughout the day and kind
of just even in a couple of hours some
of my oils and some of that glow will
come through so for me being oily skin
this is how I do glowy next I'm gonna go
in with a bronzer this one's from
colour-pop and this is in the shade
California Dreaming it's a little bit
dark but this one has a bit of a kind of
like glitter gold glitter going through
it so I'm just going to be putting this
on the perimeters of my face and just
kind of bronzing up so I can bring some
color back to my face and some dimension
I also wanted to update you guys on my
weight loss at my most recent favorites
video for April I finally had hit my ten
pound mark I was supposed to mention it
in my favorites video and I just forgot
somehow so I am technically past my ten
10 pound weight mark I'm doing Weight
Watchers if you guys don't know it's
been kind of a slow going thing I
started this technically I think March
23rd and today is May 11th so you know
I'm I'm approaching two months and I
weighed myself today which I don't know
how accurate that is because of the fact
that I am losing a ton of liquid but
today I'm like down 12 ish pounds and
I'm really proud of that so I'm just
continuing on again like the biggest
thing that I've noticed or like that
I'm like proud of is the fact that even
if I'm not having the best day a certain
day I'm not like giving up and totally
scratching the plan it's like you just
start again the next food decision you
have not even the next day just like
okay maybe that wasn't the best so try
to make a better decision next time you
have a decision to make all right so
that's the bronzer on I feel like up
here my forehead is a little much but
that's me and bronzer baby so today for
blush I'm gonna go in with one of the
Wet n Wild baked blushes from the
flights of fancy
yeah flights of fancy collection this is
dare to soar this is the darkest one out
of all of them and since they're so
shimmery I was hoping this one would
give me the most color without the most
shine like I feel like oh gosh oh
um okay that was so pigmented I feel
like the other colors are lighter so the
pigmentation doesn't show up as much as
the shimmer that comes through and so I
didn't want I mean I want to look glowy
but because this is going on like the
cheek area where I tend to have more
pores I didn't want it to be too glowy
so I'm gonna go back in with my powder
and just try to like blend that out at
least a tiny bit I really don't have a
ton of like drugstore blushes I filmed
the blushes Bay tag and that'll be going
up when I'm in Italy like I'm trying to
do some pre filming now so that way it's
not like a ton of pre filming at the end
or really close to when I leave and so
that'll be going up and in that I'm like
I realized I did not have any drugstore
blushes except for these new flights of
fancy so it's not like on purpose but I
just don't for highlighter today we are
going with the kind of like main glow
aspect and this is the color pop
flexitarian highlighter so I'm taking
this highlighter brush from AOA I'm just
dipping it in and I really like applying
it this way so I'll put it on and then I
really like to swirl it into the cheek
bone this is the reason why I'm thinking
this is what's breaking me out because I
feel like this is exactly where I apply
my highlighter and that's kind of where
I'm seeing these breakouts I don't know
it's freaking me out
I hope that's not the case if it's not
it sucks because it's like highlighting
my texture this is a very glowy
highlighter and so it will definitely
accentuate texture that you have we're
gonna move on to eyes so I'm going to be
putting on a primer this is the elf
primer this is one I really do enjoy
especially for the price I think it's
like two dollars and for me it works
well even on my most like chill days I
need an eye primer because my eyelids
are very oily and they will crease so I
like to definitely always use an eye
primer next I'm doing my eyebrows I'm
gonna speed this part up but I'm using
the colour-pop
brow pencil and blonde for the front
portion my ELF instant brow lift pencil
in the second portion or the tail and
then I've been using the AOA brow like
gel in blonde over everything or maybe
taupe I think it's taupe or blonde
whatever the lightest shade is and I've
been using that to kind of like define
the hairs and I've really been enjoying
it so I'm going to do that and you guys
can watch it sped up
all right so those are my brows done I
do tend to like them a bit more fluffy
or crazy today for eyeshadow and really
not doing too much I'm gonna take the
color pop of bronzer and we're just
gonna be putting this into the crease
I'm using this brush from Wet n Wild and
I'm just going to be running that I'm
blending it just to give us some
definition but honestly it's a very
simple look I'm gonna bring a little of
that onto the lower lash line as well
I've been really enjoying lately apps on
my phone like games because I just more
recently got an iPhone and before that I
was using an Android and I felt like all
of my storage was always used up by my
photos and I could never get apps like
my last phone I couldn't download any
apps because it was just full like it
sucked so I've been able to actually
like download things other than my most
used like utilitarian apps and so I've
been downloading different games and
it's been really fun I've been doing
this like snake one I'll leave them down
below I'm not sponsored at all in any
way for these I've literally just been
playing them probably more recently too
because I was little bedridden
um but those have been really fun and so
that's something I've been like really
just enjoying being able to download
different apps and actually being able
to enjoy them right now I'm putting a
little bit of white in my waterline just
to make sure my eyes still look bright
and wide awake I don't have like a
really affordable eyeliner pencil so I'm
gonna take my brow pencil and I'm gonna
just put this in tight line at the base
of my lashes just so that way when we go
in with our mascara they look more full
at the base already that adds just like
a tiny bit of definition before mascara
I want to go in and highlight my inner
corner I'm just using the same brush we
used for the brown underneath the lash
line I'm flipping it over and just
adding the flexitarian hi
to the inner corner you could also just
use your finger and dab it there for
mascara today I'm going to be using the
covergirl LashBlast I haven't used this
in forever
and I used it the other day honestly I
don't like it as much as I remembered
liking it but I'm still trying to give
it a chance and see if it was just you
know how my eyelashes were that day so
I'm gonna use this and coat my lashes
pretty generously me and Sam started a
new show yesterday which is the crown
not that that's like a new show it's
just new to us but that's like been
interesting definitely I feel like a
little something different for me
it's been a bit slower but I've been
enjoying it it's enticing me we watch
two episodes yesterday so I am excited
to see how the rest of season one goes I
mean the production value in this
Netflix show is insane
like I'm like gosh all of these shots
cost so much money it's crazy so that's
really cool to see you know with Netflix
not that other shows they do aren't but
that's just something I truly noted I
mean because it's a period piece it just
it's crazy to me we only have lips left
to do so I'm going to be using a lip
liner from colour-pop this is an
Aquarius I'm actually not sure if this
is discontinued but obviously all of
colour-pop stuff is really affordable
and I'm just lining the outside of my
lips and I'm just feathering the color
in or that way I have a defined lip line
for when we go in with the gloss which
I'm going to be using the NYX butter
gloss in the shade of Clair which is
pretty pink so I apply it at first kind
of liberally smack my lips together and
then I use my finger to kind of like dab
it in and get rid of any excess oh my
gosh what did I do but you could use any
gloss I just gloss is so easy and so
simple and pretty so mmm
plus it's glossy for this dewy look so
that is everything so far for the look
let me zoom this out and I'll show you
it what it looks like as a full picture
okay so here is the look it's pretty
simple I mean you can definitely still
see some of my imperfections coming
through some of my breakouts and if I
wasn't doing this on camera and like
chatting away this would have taken a
very very short amount of time probably
like 10 ish
it's maybe 15 this is a look I would do
if I have to go like run errands I need
to look put together but I don't have a
lot of time or don't want to put a lot
of effort in this is something I would
do some type of variation on this so I
hope you guys enjoyed I hope it gave you
some tips when it comes to the glowy
affordable makeup everything will be
listed down below if I didn't mention
something including tools that way you
guys can see what those are as well but
other than that I think the construction
is just getting worse and worse so I'm
gonna go I hope you guys have an amazing
day I hope that you are feeling amazing
and I will see you my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
