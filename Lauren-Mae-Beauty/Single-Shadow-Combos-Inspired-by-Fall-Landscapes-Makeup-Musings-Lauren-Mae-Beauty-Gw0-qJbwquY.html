Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm really excited because this is
going to be a new video for my channel
we're gonna be focusing on single
shadows again but this time we are gonna
be doing I don't know self-made little
like mini palettes that what am I saying
it's so hard I cannot say this concisely
I'm gonna be showing you guys little
mini six pan palettes that I've created
that are inspired by just different
things
today's theme for this video is gonna be
fall look so I went on Pinterest I typed
in like fall landscapes or like nature
and fall because that's kind of what I
was feeling and wanted to look at I
saved some pictures and then I took
those pictures one into my single
shadows and made some quads built around
the colors and the inspiration and the
feelings I got from those pictures I
want this to be a way for you guys to
hopefully use more color in your
collections to get more use out of the
colors that you already have at home and
just inspire you to go looking through
your collections and just get inspired
so um I will be showing you the exact
colors that I have but you can
definitely use whatever you have at home
or something similar maybe even this
will inspire you to create your own
versions and spin-offs I'm also going to
be showing you the pictures up next to
the palette and kind of talk you through
why I picked what I picked I don't know
if you guys are gonna like that but
these are gonna be four different color
inspiration six pan palettes I don't
know what six pan palettes are called
they're not quads and they're not Quin
so I I'm not sure what six is and how it
would be cute if you have a cute name
idea for this series definitely let me
know because I just can't think of
anything I don't have shadow
combinations I don't know they're not
always gonna be inspired by like a
season or nature it's just kind of like
whatever I'm feeling so these happen to
be inspired by fall and I think that's
it we're gonna get into it um I don't
know the formatting or anything because
it's my first video like this but I am
excited I'm gonna show you guys my
favorite one first and this one was
actually I put it
together looking at one picture but then
when I was looking at another picture it
kind of looked like that so this is my
first fall quad I think it is so so
pretty obviously there's a lot of like
warm and yellow orange tones going on
and then it has that pop of blue which
really complements the oranges that are
going on this is the picture that I used
as inspiration it'll also be on the
screen but I was I don't know looking at
that and just kind of taking from the
different colors that really called out
to me and I thought this was really nice
now something with all of these palettes
it didn't include like a matte cream or
matte black or like a lot of Browns
I really wanted to focus on the actual
color I mean there are some Browns but I
definitely think that these are just
like six shadows to give you like the
most
punched up color and give you the color
story but I definitely suggest and what
I would do is I would probably pull in
you know a color here color they're a
lighter mid-tone Brown here Oh something
to deepen it up like a dark black or
whatever it is so these are not like
necessarily completed they're just
supposed to like kind of give you the
story without giving you a bunch of
shades you probably already have in your
collection if that makes sense okay
so let's just get into them the first
one on the top here this is the color T
key this is actually not my favorite
color I suggest like really any kind of
yellow this one is like a matte with a
tiny bit of shimmer in it but it
performs really well as a matte so this
would be really nice in the transition I
think you'd be pretty on the inner
corner I would love this just even on
its own with one of the Browns in here
so
Chiqui is the first color the next color
that I think complements Teke really
well is desert sands for makeup geek
this is a brown but it has a lot of
yellow in it so they just look so nice
together this is a shadow I almost have
pana I've used it quite a bit
and I think it would be so pretty you
could even do a like smokey eye where
you have this all over the lid I blended
out with yellow and be done and I think
that would be beautiful the next color
in the palette is pumpkin spice light
this is also a matte and this is a color
very similar to like makeup eeks
chickadee
it's like a yellow-orange so beautiful
one of the colors in the subculture
palette is very similar to this - if
you're looking for like dupes you might
already have at home so those are the
first three colors I think you could do
so much with just these three together I
love it they're all mattes they're very
usable wearable I really really like him
I was originally gonna do just quads but
I felt like it was just so limiting I
kept wanting to add more things I didn't
feel like I could tell a complete color
story so that's the reason that I picked
six shadows I think you definitely know
could you know move these six shadows
around and play with different colored
quad combinations within the six pans
and I think that would be really cool
and a fun way to get different looks
next I have the color saltwater from
colour-pop this is a really beautiful
shade it reminds me of Mac's mythology
it's a pink copper with a golden shift
and that's it there again all of these
would look pretty nice together
something kind of a little monochromatic
nothing popping too much but very
beautiful the one pop of color in this
palette that I think is just so
beautiful is the color Lake Shore from
Coastal Scents I mentioned this in my
top 15 Coastal Scents shadows I'll leave
it linked if you haven't checked that
video out the texture on this is so nice
it's so pigmented and so blue I think
this would be so fun as a pop of color
you can almost make this a summer
palette if you wanted to market it that
way but if you look at the inspiration
picture you can definitely see why I
chose the colors that I did and the last
one here is kind of boring but I thought
a really dark chocolatey Brown would be
really pretty again you can put that
blue all over the lid blend it out with
desert sands put this in the outer
corner and that would be just such a
beautiful look as well so this is the
color chocolatier from Coastal Scents
and it's just a matte deeper Brown I
think that's such a fun fun combination
of shadows although when they are all
swatched out they definitely look a lot
more summery then I feel like they do in
the palette now I don't have a demo for
any of these looks I'm so sorry I wish I
did
at least like a demo for one of them but
like I was saying I definitely can see
myself using this blue on like the lower
lash line are all over the lid as like
the fun pop of color you could easily do
this in the as a transition this in the
crease and this as an outer corner if
you wanted something just matte and
neutral like there are a lot of
different ways you could play with this
and then also bring in other colors as
well but but anyway I think this is just
a really fun color combination I think
it goes with the picture really well and
I'm excited to do a couple looks
actually with this quad not a quad with
this non quad maybe that's a good way of
saying it because my goodness I'm gonna
annoy the crap out of myself
the next color combination is definitely
an interesting one when you look at this
picture it's very very simple there's a
lot of that gray going on and there's
just just like bright yellow green and
there's a little bit of like topi and I
really wanted to focus in on that kind
of like yellow golden electricity that's
happening in the middle of so much like
mundanity or like so much gray anyway so
that's kind of my inspiration for this
palette and kind of what I was trying to
pick up on
I really love just those three shadows
like if I cover this side it can get so
pretty but anyway let's get into these
shadows the first color is from Coastal
Scents and this is the shade me0 8 and
it's a very yellow gold it's very bright
I went back and forth on whether I
should do a yellow gold
that's like metallic or if I should do
something else this is not my favorite
quality but I definitely wanted to bring
some of that yellow in sorry about the
thinking the next shade over is the
color star boy and this is from look see
Beauty this I thought would be really
pretty to bring in some of that silver
or gray that's in the picture like most
of the picture but it has such a fun
sparkle to it and that's what I really
liked it also has a bit of a greenish
tinge to it so I thought it would play
kind of fun with the blue I think you
could just do some really cool
combinations with this so that is the
color star would I move the colors
around so I moved the green up one just
so you guys know it was something very
interesting like the way you organized
the colors next to each other can change
the entire feel of the palette you might
not like it originally or you might
think it's really chaotic and confused
and then you might move a couple shadows
and you're like oh wow this is inspiring
so that's something to keep in mind like
if you have single shadows at home maybe
are you configuring them and
reorganizing them every now and then I
think we'll definitely spark inspiration
but anyway next I really wanted
something fun and a pop of green this is
the color Python green from Coastal
Scents and this is a matte shade so
pretty now I think a lot of you guys are
gonna be like what these aren't fall
colors like these aren't grungy and fall
and you know everyone has what they like
to wear and sometimes those are really
great colors in fall I get it you could
pick through a lot of these color
combinations and get those classic looks
but I wanted to bring to you a something
different like that's the whole thing of
this is too something to push you
outside of your comfort zone something
where you could create some maybe more
neutral looks but also have fun and have
the ability to create something special
and different I am so sorry about that
noise I know I complained about the
noise so much but I'm sorry if you can
hear and beeping I'm just like kinda
like going over it oh yeah but this is
Python green so pretty it's not insanely
pigmented so I think that you could
definitely like build this color up if
you wanted over a white base but you
could also just use this as like an
accent just something you know just add
a little bit of something to your look I
did decide to include a blue in here
again with those gray tones I feel like
a lot of the times balloons come out in
those so this is the color cornflower
blue from Coastal Scents it is a matte
shade and I thought this was so pretty
especially with the silver here in this
green as an accent that would be so cool
you could do the blue with this silver
and the gold like I think there are a
lot of different color combinations that
would be really interesting and cool so
that is the cornflower blue color from
Coastal Scents I did want to throw in a
shade that was going to kind of ground
the look and I was inspired to put this
in there by some of those just darker
areas of the photo some of the more
murky like cool toned areas so this is
the color taupe lessly devoted this is
from luke sea beauty I'm not sure if
this color specifically is available but
any type of dark taupe would be nice I
think there's a color from Coastal
Scents called timeless taupe that's very
similar as well if you guys want another
option but I just liked this one for
this look so that is topless Leda voted
by look see and that is a matte shade
and then the last color in here
something a little bit fun a little bit
different and this is dark goldenrod
from Coastal Scents this has a bit of a
duo chrome to it it's gold but then it's
also green and I just thought this was
so interesting and so fun so that is it
there if you guys want to know there is
a new shade from colour-pop cult tea
garden which is basically exactly this
color this one's a little more metallic
that one is shimmery but has a little
bit more sparkle to it so if you were
wondering and wanted any order from
colour-pop more but want a color like
this Teegarden is very very similar I
mean they're almost the same color I
thought this looked really pretty with
the blue obviously the green and the
gold are gonna play off with this really
nice so I just think you could get some
fun different looks with this yeah so I
thought that was kind of a fun you know
take on some greens and
tope the nice picture inspired me to do
something a little bit more
monochromatic than what we've been
seeing this is a very like deep dark
picture of the woods there's a lot of
blues there's a lot of greens and deep
rich colors so I really wanted to focus
on the Bluegreen aspect of that so these
are the colors that I picked out
inspired by that picture I thought these
were all very fun
I definitely think like if I was going
to use this I would bring in some like
mid-tone Browns some different colors to
ground the look but I really wanted to
keep the focus of this that rich deep
monochromatic green blue all right the
first color here is from look see beauty
and this is the color lime light this is
a white with an iridescent green shift
it's so pretty I love it so much I think
this is a great shadow for the inner
corner if you're doing a green look and
still want to keep that inspiration I
also love it to top over shadows if you
want to bring just a little bit of light
and brightness to something so this
one's really pretty and you could also
use like any of those green colored
highlighters that are out there from
like the Anasazi a palette or the Kat
Von D one it's very similar to this
shadow if you want something you might
have at home already next about I have
another look see a shadow this is the
color Aquarius and this is a light like
aqua green blue the shift on this one is
golden so I feel like it pulls green in
real life this would be so pretty again
on the inner corner depending on how
dark your look is you can use this all
over the lid and I think it's a great
one to top over shadows to bring that
light to the eye once again so really
like this one the first map that I have
in the palette is the color olive from
Coastal Scents I thought this was a nice
like mid-tone color I think this would
be really cool all over the eye just
like velvet with some of these shimmers
just accenting like the brow bone and
the inner corner and doing something
like that but this color is just so nice
you do have to build it up it is a
little bit powdery in a swatch but I
find on the eye it looks really nice and
you can just kind of like slowly build
that color up this is very similar I
believe to moss and the Kat Von D metal
matte palette to the next shadow is
another one from whoopsie Beauty this is
the color Noir and I just mentioned
this recently in my let stupit for the
prism palette from honest hacia i think
this is such a pretty color it's blue
but it's not it's purple but then it
kind of looks gray and i think it would
just play off the greens really nicely
it still brings something interesting
but it's cool toned and I think it would
mix well with the rest of the colors in
the palette the deepest shade in the
palette is Houdini from makeup geek this
is such a beautiful beautiful shade it's
really gonna bring that depth and
darkness that you see in the picture
like some of the deepest areas I thought
this was a nice one because it has that
depth but it definitely still has that
blue and green quality to it I think it
would be so pretty paired with so many
of these colors I love it I'm so happy
with that and then the last shadow here
is from Coastal Scents and this is the
color Pinehurst this is a matte shade it
looks a lot darker than it really is I
feel like but I thought this would give
a little bit more of like a cool toned
blue-green to the rest of the palette
and I think it would go nice with those
colors once again I just thought it
really completed it and gave you a lot
to work with so you could pair like two
or three of these shadows together and
then pull in a brown and complete a look
and the last of the colors that I have
was inspired with those reds and I feel
like more the traditional colors you
would see in fall the picture of the
trees has this really like hot red and
it has this almost pink hue to it what
you guys know I probably love I also
wanted to keep this all matte so all of
these shades are matte
these this tree just look like the
velvet to me with the Sun setting I
really would love to pair some of these
with like Noir and some of those like
blues as like accenting pieces to kind
of cool down some of the look but I
didn't have enough shades to do that so
these are the colors that I chose I
think this is a really pretty set of
shadows and kind of how I organized it
is this these colors are all very
similar they're all in the same family
these are the intense colors and then
these are the colors you would actually
use to like deepen up the look if you
just have these you wouldn't get the
intense color you wouldn't get that pink
that really vibrant pink you wouldn't
get that orange from this shade even
though it's orange it's not gonna look
vibrant it's not gonna look crazy bright
but with these you can use these as like
transitions or
the outer crease our blend out these
colors and you're really gonna get that
like fiery intensity while still having
the depth that was my thought process
anyway so starting off the first shade I
have here is the color terracotta from
luck see Beauty lots of luck see shadows
used so pretty this would look so pretty
if my eye look today if you guys didn't
know I do have a whole get ready with me
on this I look so if you want to check
that out
such a pretty shadow so buttery so soft
love it
the next color that I have your is from
Coastal Scents this is the shade of
marmalade and as you can see next to
each other you can see that this has
that orange intensity that's really
going to bring out the fun of that
terracotta shade I love it next we have
the color going steady this is a
beautiful color from colour-pop one of
my favorites I think it just has such a
nice mix of the purple and the pink it's
not too deep the color is still there
but it still gives some like depth to a
look so that is going steady and then of
course I had to have the pink guys I
really think that when that light hits
the like leaves
it really looks pink and if you didn't
have something like really bright just
even to like barely put in there you
wouldn't really know what it is it'll
just give it that extra bit of something
you know that's what this pink is gonna
do this is the color sand bar from
colour-pop you could also use savage
from Urban Decay I think there's
something from dolly wink is that what
it's called from sugarpill I think
that's what you guys are telling me
anyway that is so pretty I love this
already so so much it is considered one
of their like pressed pigments so yeah
you know if you're going to use it
around the eyes just make sure you're
not getting any irritation next is a
shade from makeup geek this is the last
color on the more muted side this is
going to give you a lot of definition
you can also always bring in a black go
to really get whatever definition you
needed but this is cherry cola from
makeup geek like I said so so beautiful
I talked about the shade quite a bit so
I'm sure you guys have heard of it I
feel like this color swatch is so ugly
but it performs really well on the eye
and again it's gonna give that extra
like depth to the looks oh man this pink
is getting everywhere and this look
wouldn't be completed without the red so
this is the color pomegranate
read from Coastal Scents it's not the
best ride ever I'm not going to sit here
and tell you that it is so if you
haven't read from a pallet I definitely
suggest using something like that but
this will definitely do the job and I
think again pairing these two together
you're going to get such a pretty look
so I think you could definitely get a
bunch of different things you could just
pair these off color wise together and
that would be so pretty
you could just do so much with all of
these and they're all matte so you can
use them wherever you want
you'd have to worry about like shimmer
reflecting things or anything like that
so this one is one of my favorites as
well probably this one in the first one
are my two like absolute favorites
alright guys that is everything for this
video I hope you enjoyed it if you have
any suggestions of how this series could
be better
I want to include at least demos or
maybe I could do i looks nightly show
picture I don't know just something like
that I think would be nice like picking
my favorite pot and doing a look I think
though keeping it to like four different
color combinations is best just so it
doesn't get too crazy and too long yeah
and if you have a name definitely let me
know I think that's everything though
thank you so so much for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed it I hope it inspired
you and I will see you in my next video
