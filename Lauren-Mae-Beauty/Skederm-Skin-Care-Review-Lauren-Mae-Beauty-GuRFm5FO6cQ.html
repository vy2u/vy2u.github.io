Lauren this is going to be a review of
the skidder my tamiya sieved from
obsolete you guys don't know about octal
e it's a way for creators to get with
brands and they send products for review
now just because I got this done for me
for free does not mean that it changes
my review this isn't sponsored at all I
just to give my honest opinion on these
products so let's get into them I did
show these recently in a haul video but
I got the smarts net cream I also got
the eye cream this is the ultimate eye
cream and I also got a package of their
sheet masks and these are the snail
jelly masks now there are so many
no-name skincare brands out there that
are charging an arm and a leg for neck
cream or an eye cream and that is like
kind of crazy to me I'm not saying they
don't work I'm just someone that doesn't
have a ton of money to spend on skin
care as much as I'd love to and I don't
think a lot of other people have a ton
of money to spend on skin care either so
I'm coming from a place where personally
I want to buy skin care for myself like
I creams your neck creams are things
that are going to help prolong my skin
and you know keep me looking younger
longer but I also don't want to fork out
a hundred dollars each on those items so
when I saw the prices for these items
between like the twenty and thirty
dollar range I thought that was really
great and I wanted to try them out now
there were a couple of things that I
wanted trial that I wasn't sent and I
haven't purchased them for myself yet
but I'm definitely interested in trying
though so i might mention those at the
end of the video a little bit about
Skinner meeeeee though skadam is kind of
a strange name but it's because its a
mix of the word sketch and dermatology
so a sketch is supposed to be kind of
like the creative aspect the design the
creation
then the dermatology part is obviously
about the skin and more the scientific
part so they kind of claim to combine to
both of those elements into their
products and those are like really
important factors for them I'm looking
at the website here and it says all art
begins with a sketch an idea a design we
at SkyDome transform our into
masterpieces also on their website they
have like reasons why sched arm is
better or you should shop Skinner
meeeeee so some of the things that they
mentioned are the fact that they have
patented technologies and formulas they
have luxurious and unique packaging high
quality at reasonable prices laboratory
and clinical testing in phases prior to
product launches strict selection
process of ingredients in quality
control and they say that they have a
high customer satisfaction they say that
their target audience is 25 and older
which I definitely agree with because
everything in here is kind of anti-aging
and I feel like if you're being
preventative that that kind of will
start at age 25 and just kind of
continues so my overall thoughts on
these products I do think they're really
good especially for the price point I
haven't been using any of these things
long enough and I honestly in general
don't think that a lot of like
anti-aging skincare products are things
that you can really see especially
because I am kind of more in the
preventative stage and 24 so I do have
like fine lines and wrinkles under my
eyes but nothing super intense so
anything for me right now is just using
to prevent I can't give you exact like
before and after pictures or anything
like that I haven't noticed anything
like that on myself but I've never
noticed that with anything i've ever
used whether I liked it or it happened
so the eye cream is probably the product
that I like the most out of everything
this is the ultimate eye cream and this
has energizing retinol in it this has
point five fluid ounces in it and it
says here that it's specialized formula
with energetic retinol hyaluronic acid
high-performance innovative Antarctic
teen I don't know if that's how you say
that for beautifying and promoting
attractiveness of human skin I do find
that some of the like descriptions and
even on the website I feel like the
English is a little weird so I don't
know if that's just me
me or what but I do think that this is a
nice eye cream I'll put a little bit on
my hand here the packaging is nice I've
seen this packaging before though and i
will say that i can kind of pop this
part out so there's a lot of just like
extra packaging which does make it look
really luxe especially for the price but
i would be fine with something smaller
personally this is what the eye cream
looks like it's pretty thick but it has
a really nice consistency so it doesn't
feel heavy the texture reminds me of the
Dragons cream or Dragon's Blood night
cream from rodial that I really like and
that's also hyaluronic acid-based so I
feel like I can definitely feel that in
this this has like a light citrusy scent
really nice and pleasant I've never had
any issues with this like hurting my
eyes and I do feel like one pump is a
lot of products so i usually use about
half a pump for both eyes just to
conserve product because you don't need
that much overall though texture of it
feels really nice i also have been able
to put product on over this some of my
primers don't work very well but i feel
like they're primers that don't work
with anything but for the most part i
can use this under primers and
everything and it works great so i
really do highly suggest this eye cream
so the way you purchase g'daron products
aren't on their site they're all
available on amazon and you can use
Amazon Prime with them I was looking on
the website right now and this is
actually sold out so there's no price or
anything for it I believe this was 24 99
if i'm not mistaken goodrum also has a
lot of like different like sales going
on a coupon code so what the normal
price is usually isn't what you pay but
even that I think it's like thirty
dollars or 36 but it's 24 with whatever
deal they have going on if they give me
a promo code or anything i will also
leave that listed either here or in the
description box i don't know if i have
one right now as I'm filming this but
anyway I highly suggest this I do think
it's really nice feels really
moisturizing and nice on the skin I've
really been enjoying it and it's
probably my favorite item out of the
three that i have here next I have the
smarts net cream
this has a strength peptide complex this
is supposed to help with you know you're
aging neck and just keeping it
moisturize as well as getting rid of
like wrinkles and just firming the skin
in general I do like this I'll pump it
on my skin so you can see again the
packaging on these look nice but they
also don't feel a hundred percent nice
look you can tell they're a little cheap
I appreciate the packaging I think it's
nice for the price but it's not going to
feel like you spent seventy dollars on
if that makes sense so that's what it
looks like again this is like a thicker
cream it has a similar feel to the eye
cream but it is a bit thicker it also
has a bit of a citrus smell but it is a
little bit different than the eye cream
this feels really nice on the skin again
these all just have like a very silky
feel on the skin which feels so nice and
I love that I haven't noticed obviously
any like tightening or anything on my
neck but I have felt like more
moisturize because of it this net cream
online retails like originally it says
that it is thirty-three dollars but you
can get it for 1999 right now I feel
like that's constantly because i checked
it right when i got these and it was the
same price i've been using these about a
month i really like that if you're
looking for a neck cream and um you
aren't looking for like insane results
immediately you just want something kind
of preventive or just moisture or you're
just not willing or don't have the money
to invest in something that expensive
but you still want in that cream I do
suggest this but for me personally in my
life it's just like an extra step that I
don't really want to do right now but I
do think it's nice I'll definitely
finish it up and I do suggest it for
people and last I have the snail jelly
mass now i have used one of these you
guys know that sheet masks are actually
not my favorite i feel a little
claustrophobic what i wear them yeah I
don't know they're not my favorite I
know they're all the rage though and so
many people like them so i feel like a
lot of people will really enjoy these
these are not just a sheet these are
also coated in like a hydrogel so they
kind of have that jelly feeling to them
i really like that about them and makes
them feel nice to me and more expensive
so you guys know this is
pack of 10 mm and it retails for 1699 I
think that's a pretty good price like
this less than two dollars for each of
them i will say that when i was using
this I felt like face wise as it fit on
my face there wasn't a ton of room for
my mouth and also I felt like um there
wasn't a ton of room for my eyes either
it kind of felt a little smashed I mean
that's me being a little picky I feel
like and again I haven't tried a ton of
these types of face masks so I don't
know how it compares to a lot of other
brands that's just something I felt like
I noticed this also left my face feeling
really cool like the whole time if you
felt like flushed or tired or felt like
you really need some that rejuvenated
you with a cooling feeling you'd
probably really like this it had a lot
of serum in here so there's a lot of
extra serum left over if you're someone
who likes that likes to use it afterward
or whatever this is something that you
let just sink into your skin you put it
on for 15 to 20 minutes and then you
pull it off and you let the rest of that
just kind of like you can pat it in or
just let it soak into your skin I did
really like it I felt really moisturized
after it I didn't really feel anything
other than that I mean I felt just in
general rejuvenated because of the
feeling of the mask but I didn't notice
like brightening or anything but I did
enjoy it and I thought it was nice and I
think other people would like it the
biggest thing I liked about it was the
fact that I felt like damask felt like
high quality that hydro like jelly
feeling um but it's again not that
expensive overall I do want to try a few
other things from this brand I think
that if you are interested in anything
i'm talking about definitely like check
them out check out their reviews see
what they're about my biggest rod of
this brand is the fact that they are
inexpensive but it seems like they are
offering a little bit more than
something from the drugstore which I
like they also claim to be like a
us-based brand but they also sell in
south korea so they call themselves
Korean skincare i'm not sure if how that
really works if they're like our Korean
skincare I don't really know but that's
like one of their like things that they
like to talk about about their brand the
thing that I really want to try next is
the skin Irma
shift in just snail serum it's a serum
and it has like a dropper I I really do
like serums and I want to try that one
because it's reasonably priced but that
one's also sold out on the website so a
bunch of other people must also be
liking that a couple other things that I
want to try out are these good erm X
hydro deep hydrating gel cream I want to
try that I think that would be really
nice for like a nighttime moisturizer
and then they have the same X hydro but
it's a complex moisturizer and I think
that'd be more like a daytime one so I
want to try those out because right now
i'm just using like olay serums and
different things that I feel like our a
similar price point to these so I kind
of want to try these out see how they
work and it's kind of fun to just try
different brands I just really i really
have been enjoying the way these feel on
the skin so that's everything I hope you
guys enjoyed this review if you were
interested I'm glad that this wasn't
like this is an awesome night cream that
they sent me it's seven hundred dollars
links down below if you want to try it
but it's really good I'm not like trying
to hate on anyone who reviews high in
skin care but I think that's something
that is hard for me being a youtuber is
you know it's easy to say that
something's really amazing when you get
it for free but if I can't purchase it
or wouldn't want to purchase it outside
of getting it sometimes it's hard to
like recommend or wanted to really try
it out for me personally because it's
like I mean I can't afford this I
wouldn't buy it i would buy all these
other things over it how can i expect to
like tell you guys to like it and go buy
it I don't know anyway hope you guys
enjoyed this I will see you in my next
video and I'll see you I hope you're
having a wonderful day guys hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
