Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be another video in my
makeup artist series I'm going to be
talking about all of these skincare that
I keep in my kit with me at least at the
moment I feel like my kit is
ever-evolving I'm always trying to find
these things to put in my kit I'm trying
to solve new issues that I come across
and of course just trying out new
products because I love products so this
is just what I have I'm not saying you
need to have these exact items in your
kids I'm just showing you what I have
what I use it for and if I find it
helpful if I actually use it if it's one
of those items I have just in case and I
hope it's helpful in any way so I will
leave my playlist linked down below I
only have one other video at the moment
in this series but if you have any
suggestions of things you'd like to know
about makeup artistry or anything you'd
like to see from this series definitely
leave them down below I'd love to hear
them and have your suggestions first off
this is what I keep most of my skincare
in its kind of overflowing at the moment
and that's because I went through and
picked up some items that were just in
my step bags that are also considered
skincare and put them in here but I like
this because it's a clear case I will
leave this link down below this one is
from Selassie but you can get them from
Zuka and there are other brands who do
these kind of like clear top pouches but
let's just delve into them because you
guys saw it's a lot of items and I don't
want to be here for forever these are in
no particular order so I'm just going to
start off with removers I have two
separate removers in here the first one
is in my cellar water I happen to have
the simple one in here right now this is
just a cleansing water there's no
residue it's really easy to take off
makeup with this this is what I use in
my personal everyday life that's why I
like to have it on set it doesn't sting
eyes it's really you know clean in the
sense that it's probably not going to
have any reactions when it comes to
anyone else's skin so I really like this
this is just a travel size that I
refilled constantly I also like by derma
or any of those micellar waters I think
works great next for removers I also
like to keep a traditional like eye
makeup remover in here this is one it
has like the two layers that you shake
up this one specifically is from Lancome
it's the beifuss ill and this is great
for getting off really stubborn
I make up maybe you have waterproof
mascara on someone and you need to take
it off like the micellar water is not
going to work and you need something
that's going to so I haven't just
keeping a more hardcore eye makeup
remover in your kit for those times when
you're going to need it you probably
won't need to use it very often but in
case you do you have it and I think that
it's important next I'm going to be
talking about moisturizers and that type
of product that I keep in my kit so I
have quite a few different options first
I have this Jack Black double DD face
moisturizer and the reason I have this
in my kit is because it has an SPF 20 in
it I'd like to have at least something
with SPF in case actor requests it if
we're going to be working out in the Sun
so I think this is a really nice one it
doesn't leave the skin too greasy and
it's lightweight so I don't know no one
feels gross on their skin especially if
you're shooting for like 12 hours I do
really like this next is one that it's
just kind of my everyday go to this is
the embryo leaf late cream concentrate
this is my third two of it so I've gone
through many of them a lot of artists
keep this in their kit this is great for
basically all skin types it's very
important to have more sherry skin on
your clients especially when you're
going to be adding layers of makeup on
top of it so this one is just a great
base to have on your clients and I don't
find that anyone gets excessively oily
with it so I wouldn't worry about that
it mostly works for everyone
next I'd have one that is a bit more of
a mattifying primer this one from
Bioderma and it is the pore refiner
it just says pore refiner I like to use
this on men and anyone who says that
they have oily skin especially in cases
where their skin being just the most
flawless isn't as important I know that
sounds bad but sometimes the skin is
main focus let's say they're going in
for an extreme close-up and they're
going to be right in on someone's face
you want their skin to look as good as
possible where is if it's going to be
for an event and it's okay for them to
look like they have makeup on it's not
as big of a deal
if they look like they have makeup on
because it's like this little as glammed
up or whatever so anyway that's what I
like to use this for I also really
prefer it on men especially a lot of the
times men have this like I don't even
know it's like a
our forehead you can't keep Matt no
matter what you try to do know there are
ways you can make in that but it's
definitely like a shiny issue especially
under really bright light so this helps
just kind of not add any extra shine
there because it's already going to be a
battle why make it and not tell one I
think I have cheer more kind of
moisturizing type of products I have
some packets here these are from rescue
skincare and one is the serum and one is
a moisturizer I don't use these all the
time in my kit but they are really nice
let's say your clients are you know on
the go or whatever you can just give
this to them and it's easy you also just
have a pre-portioned amount of product
which is nice to just have on the go so
I do find that these come in handy I
don't think they're like a must-have but
these are really good products and it's
great to just be able to easily give
them to someone without getting rid of
your entire huge moisturizer and last is
something I save for people with really
dry skin this is the Egyptian magic it's
basically just olive oil beeswax honey
bee pollen royal jelly and something
else it's this very very thick
moisturizer and I like to use this on
people who really need the moisture who
basically could have an oil on their
skin and there's no problems I actually
have an oil with me but I barely use it
so I don't know I keep the on without
the oil with me just because I happen to
have that one for people who have super
direct skin and can actually handle an
oil on their skin but this essentially
turns into an oil once you get some heat
on it and I D like to use this for
extreme cases of dry skin or if you
wanted something that was just more
glowy that could also be a reason to use
it we're going to talk about primers
next I feel like a half-million primers
I don't use all of them on most of the
time so I'll tell you about them as we
go through them but as you keep them in
my skincare section so first off is just
a little sample this is something I got
from Smashbox and it is the primer oil
again I just have this for more dry skin
I really have only used this a couple
times it's not something that I use
often
I love that it's in that small size
because if I need it I have it but it's
not again something that's an everyday
use item for me something I do you
quite a bit is the lorac I'm so
sensitive using face primer this is oil
free silicone free it's basically like a
moisturizer depending on how fast I need
to work on depending on what the
situation is I've worked with this
client before or not I kind of know more
about their skin and what I can do but
you could use this on its own if you
wanted to as a moisturizer in a primer
sometimes they don't even end up using a
primer I just use moisturizer it all
just depends and I think this one's
really nice I like that it doesn't have
too tacky of a texture so again products
just glide onto it better then like
catching and sticking and kicking up
another primer I have which I don't use
very often is the spackle tinted under
makeup primer and champagne from laura
geller this has a bit of a shine to it
so it's great for Bridal makeup or
anything that you want more of a glowy
ethereal type of skin look - but for
everyday and also for onset I don't use
it very often I do have a small sample
of the make it forever step one
smoothing primer this is going to help
fill in any pores I think it's important
to have this on hand just in case
someone has really large pores and
you're trying to make their skin look
really really smooth now again on set
when people are hired for jobs maybe
they have really big pores or maybe
their skin isn't the best but sometimes
that's what they wanted that's why part
of the reason they're hired for that job
so especially when it comes to TV and
film sometimes this is not what you need
I feel like this is more for women or
glam makeup more than anything for men
screaming it has quite a few primers
here and these are from mayer on and
these are the touch-ups anti-shine these
are mattifying primers and they have
them in different color so they have a
medium a dark and a light they just have
the letters a B and there these are
great for bald heads these are great for
that ring I was talking about where
they're not quite bold but they have
definitely shininess on the forehead I
like to use these on Sam these are going
to really mattify this skin and I do
really like these I am very careful when
I use these because sometimes I don't
know I haven't figured out when it
happens and why it happens but sometimes
when I use these they can tend to pill a
little bit or sometimes you can see like
an edge of where you had it so just be
very careful with this you don't need a
lot of it just
lair is going to definitely cut so much
shine off of where lights are eating the
face but I guess I think these are
important to have in your kit because I
use them all the time especially if
you're working in TV and film and you
have an area that you need to not be
shiny these will definitely help you
because I said this before but sometimes
powder just doesn't stick to the skin
and it doesn't work so those actually
will do it no matter what I have two
more I guess like primer primers I keep
my eyelid primer in here this one's from
Laura Geller and it's the special eyelid
invisible I primer use any ice cream
where you want I also have a Mac Paint
Pot and I really like using that too so
I just like to keep this in here it's
easy to grab and then the other one I
have here is from Laura Geller as well
it's the spackle under eye and this is
supposed to go under the eye I think to
prime it for like not creasing I don't
know how much it works sometimes they
just don't have the time to use an extra
product like this and also I try to be
very minimal with the product I put
under the eye I'm more for hydrating
than priming that area because I would
rather it be hydrated and look really
just nice and fresh and that means that
I have to blend out concealer because it
might crease every now and then I'm fine
with that instead of it looking dry and
caked on but it's not moving anywhere so
I think you just have to play around
products this one isn't necessarily bad
I just haven't had enough experience
with it - like recommend it speaking of
the under eye area I do have an eye
cream I think everyone should have an
eye cream this one is from Bioderma I've
talked about this quite a bit
you guys know I like it it's very
inexpensive which is one of my favorite
parts about it if you are doing
something like this and once you have a
really high-end client or you want to
really invest the money in it I don't
think you need something that is insane
amounts of money for an eye cream so I
highly suggest this one pick it up it'll
help make anything you do under the eye
just look so much better I'm going to
keep talking about eyes I don't know
still in no order but I have Visine in
my skincare kit now I highly suggest
this within my 15 non makeup items that
makeup artists need in their kit I will
leave it linked down below please check
that video out if you are a makeup
artist who is working on set because I'm
telling you I just did a short film and
literally like half of those things I
used on that set
man I'm glad I take my Odin faces but
anyway eyedrops are really important to
have actors anyone who needs these you
have them something that's a little bit
more than G or something you don't
necessarily need in your kit but I do
like to have our eye patches these ones
are from pathology and these are just a
gel that you put underneath these are
great for anyone who's had maybe a rough
night didn't get a lot of please maybe
have some drinks it's going to help
soothe the under eye area it's just a
nice calming thing in the chair if you
are makeup artist you know that when
people sit in your chair it's just it's
a relaxing moment for them whether
they're about to go on and perform on
set or they're going out to an event
it's this time of pampering and luxury
and this really brings at home as well
as gives actual benefits to the under
eye to help make your makeup look better
that being said I also do keep a lip
patch with me these are the same thing
for the eyes but they go on the lip so
they're going to help hydrate kind of
plump and they're just an extra
pampering step so I do keep both of
those with me for the lips I also keep a
couple other things that help keep
everything nice and juicy and plump and
not scaly I have lip balms here I love
the Jack black ones because they're in a
squeeze tube so they're really easy
they're sanitary
I love the mint one I do warn people
that it's mint because I didn't want to
neighbor like whoa it's minty and I was
like oh yeah
sorry so I just tell them like are you
down with mint it's not I have another
one I think I have some other flavors as
well but I really do like these and they
don't have a high shine on them they're
not going to like you're not going to
put them on and they look like a gloss
on a guy or something I also keep a lip
scrub with me this one's just from lush
it's the mint juleps and I just used a
little like spatula I just use my
spatula to get a little bit out this is
great if someone has some like crusty
list you can handle that situation we
are almost to the end here I didn't
think that it would go so fast something
that I keep with me all the time is 244
now I would necessarily call this a skin
care product I use this more with my
foundation but I thought it was
appropriate to mention it here 244 is a
silicon thinner so it's going to work
with any silicone based foundation or
really assigned any found
or any product it's going to kind of
break that product down and thin it out
so for a foundation let's say it's
really really thick and cakey and you
want a lighter coverage you could use
this product and get basically a whole
different look from that foundation I'd
also find I can use this with cream
products to make it a little bit more
like runny or liquid now because this is
a silicone though it doesn't necessarily
stay put so you're kind of like removing
the waterproof aspect so keep that in
mind I don't always like to do that and
sometimes I find that if I put too much
of this like underneath the eye or get
there that mascara could transfer
because of this product so keep that in
mind with how you use it but I do think
this is a really handy product talent
set and my last two items are spray so I
have more of like a makeup finishing
spray this one's from Scandinavia it's
going to kind of like set your makeup
make it last a little bit longer I
especially like this with men's grooming
if you put a little bit of powder on
them kind of spray them down it's going
to set their makeup without it looking
too powdery and again you don't want
that so I like this one a lot I would
repurchase it and then the other one
that I have here is from Mac this is mac
fix+
this is not going to really set or
mattify the skin but sometimes you don't
want that sometimes it's too matte and
you want a little bit more due to the
skin I especially love in movies MTV
when their skin looks like skin so maybe
it's not super mattified it's not greasy
but it just has like a nice shine to it
nice Sheen and if I'm looking for
something like that this works this is a
great pick-me-up for actors again kind
of a nice just refresher it smells great
I just really like this as well so I
hope this was helpful beauty of all the
items skincare wise that I keep in my
kit if you have anything that you use
and you absolutely love and you think I
would love leave it down below
I am always open for new things I'm
always switching these out so this is
just what I have in currently and it
could change at any moment honestly
thank you so much for watching again
leave any suggestions for the series
down below in the comments and I will
see you in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
