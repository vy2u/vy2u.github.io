Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to share with you guys
some of the skincare products that I've
been using recently kind of do a
skincare roundup video I've done these
before so I'll leave the other to link
down below I'm gonna try not to talk
about products I've already talked about
in those ones just to start your
expectations off right I do not consider
myself a skincare expert by any means
I'm just a regular person using skincare
doing my best so just keep that in mind
I'm just gonna be sharing with you guys
how I use these products how I feel they
work I feel like for the most part I
like affordable skincare I just I just
do I like affordable everything so for
most things that I buy myself I use
affordable things but I am lucky enough
to get sent a lot of like higher-end
stuff so I will share that with you as
well yeah and if you have any
suggestions for me in the comments I'd
love to know them down below but I think
that's it let's just get into it I'm
going to start by how I do my face so
we'll start with like spray spritzers
right yeah no cleansers we have to clean
first okay okay so the first cleanser I
have here is from skinned Iceland I
talked about this in my minty video so
I'll leave that link down below I got
this sent to me from skinned Iceland
through octa Lee and this is the Glacial
face wash with white willow bark this is
supposed to be a line for like stressed
out skin and this one though it does
have this kind of almost minty tingle to
it it doesn't really smell super mini
like I feel like there's like an under
note of it but like when you wash your
face with it it just has this tiny
cooling effect so I like using this in
the daytime or in the shower you need
the tiniest amount of this a little goes
a long way it's kind of thick and it
really suds up well so yeah I always
tend to use too much of this product
like I squirt out too much and I could
cover like three faces with it so I
definitely think this is gonna last me a
really really long time I'm gonna leave
prices up here on the screen just so you
guys can know how much these costs so
I'm enjoying it right now I feel like I
prefer my origins one over this that one
kinda leaves a bit of a squeaky feel and
this one doesn't but I just prefer that
one so this is good but I still like
that one better as for the other
cleanser I've been using you guys have
seen this in a couple videos it's from
pur Lisse and it's the Blue Lotus
four-in-one cleansing milk I really love
this stuff I'm so proud of myself for
changing my habits when it
comes to skincare I was a white girl for
a long time I would just use wipes to
clean my face that's it I really
wouldn't do anything else and I have
been doing so well with actually
cleaning my face at night and in the
morning so this one is amazing for
taking off makeup I cannot believe how
well it gets all my makeup off I do do a
double cleanse but I like that this
doesn't leave any like greasy residue it
doesn't leave a film on my eyes but I'm
able to basically get off all of my
makeup like it's crazy so I love this it
just like melt it off I feel like all
this makeup in my sink when I am using
this I love it so much so I know this is
a pricey product but it is one that I do
really suggest I really like this after
I'm done cleansing I always go in and
spritz my face with some type of like
spray facial spray or something so these
ones are both by pure lessons I got
these at Marshall's so these were $5.99
apiece I have the mint in bamboo and
then I have the aloe and rosewater I
like to use the mint in bamboo again in
the morning it kind of has that
refreshing tingle a little bit more of a
refreshing scent and then at night the
aloe and rose water I feel like really
soothes the skin it's a nice like just
smell so I really like these I don't
think they're doing anything that
amazing but I tend to like wash my face
and then put this on brush my teeth and
let that kind of sink in and then go
into my next product so I enjoy these
and this just kind of keeps my skin
hydrated as I'm brushing my teeth next
we have toner and this is the only toner
I've been using recently this is from
the ordinary and it's the glycolic acid
7% toning solution the glycolic acid in
here is gonna like help exfoliate the
skin and I believe you do have Sun
sensitivity when you use this so it's
always good to use this at night and
then use a sunscreen in the morning
obviously we've used about half of this
I share my skincare with my husband so I
do like this I do get a slight tingle on
the skin I don't necessarily use this
every single day if I feel like my skin
is getting a little dried out or if I
have some just like sensitive places I
kind of go every other day with this
just cuz I find that it can be a little
bit intense I think this is helping with
texture on my skin as well so I enjoy
this I don't know if I'm going to
purchase from the Orden
again I'm just not sure I'm kind of on
the fence about that so I don't know if
I'd purchase this again but I think it's
an amazing price for the product and
I've been enjoying it since I've been
using it I forgot to mention this one
with cleansers this is from Dermalogica
it's the clear start break out clearing
foaming wash and I actually don't use
this on my face I've been using it on my
body I tend to get just like you know
breakouts here and there I don't feel
like I have like a ton of breakouts on
my back or on my shoulders or anything
or arms but I just get enough that I've
been using this in the shower to
hopefully kind of combat that this has a
really nice smell it smells kind of yes
citrusy Dermalogica did send this over
to me and I've been enjoying it I mean
it's kind of a pricey product for just
using it on your shoulders this is a
salicylic acid to help fight break out
so I've been using that and I mean I
feel like I'm noticing a bit of a
difference but I think I need to use it
just a little bit longer to see
consistent results so after I'm done
with toner I go in with a serum so I
have two different ones here another one
from the ordinary this is the niacin
amide 10% plus zinc 1% you guys were
telling me in the comments of my Sephora
haul video this is gonna help with
evening out skin tone and so I'm gonna
continue using it a lot of you guys said
like keep using it like antioxidants and
all this stuff so I've been using it
we've used about 2/3 of it and this is a
nice product you don't need a lot of it
because it's pretty thin it's a little
bit more viscous than water but it's not
like a gel or moisturizer or anything of
that consistency this as it goes onto
the skin does get tacky so I like to
kind of like let it get tacky and kind
of sink in all the way before I go in
with moisturizer I feel like my skin's
been at a really good point just as of
recently I feel like just in general
everything I'm doing when it comes to
washing my face and just taking my time
and having a real routine has been
helping my skin look more radiant and
not be so dry like I have really bad
dryness around my nose so I don't know
if this is doing anything in particular
but I do feel like my skin looks good so
I don't know if I ever purchase again
but I do like it for the price I think
it's really great and I do love that the
ordinary is such an affordable brand
that you can try out different things at
an actual affordable price so yeah not
sure if I would repurchase again but I
think I like it I don't know it's one of
those ones like I'm not sure what it's
doing but I think it's doing good things
and not doing bad things so okay
the next one here is from PO speak I
think is how you say the brand this is a
radiance boosting serum with wild plum
and caviar lime isn't this over to me
and I believe they're like brand is very
all-natural and I believe they're
cruelty-free as well so this serum I've
been using in the day time and I've
really been enjoying it it says you can
use it day and night this is very thin
as well has a nice little draw for
that's glass and I just I really have
been actually enjoying this it has a bit
of a citrus smell I probably because of
that lime and it gets a little tacky but
not too tacky and I've really been
enjoying it so me and Sam have just
started using this stuff so I'll have to
give you guys more of an update but so
far I definitely want to continue using
it like for me I'm usually like I'll
finish something up like even if it's
not like the best but if it's if I don't
like it at all then I just pass it on
because I I don't have time to just like
hey a skin care product next let's talk
about I products so we have three
different things or I have three
different things that I've been using
Sam doesn't use all of these so in the
daytime I like to use this elf little
roller this is the elf i refresh I think
it's like a $2.00 product so I'll put
this on under my eyes and just like move
it around and I do like this just for
like the cooling aspect I think it's
really nice I don't think it's doing
anything amazing and it really doesn't
hydrate too much but I like that cooling
refreshing feeling so I do that first
then I go in with the bioderma sensibio
eye and i really love this product it's
a really affordable eye cream this isn't
going to do a bunch when it comes to
really anti-aging but it gives me just
the perfect amount of moisture under my
eyes that i don't feel like it's too
much it's not gonna make my concealer
crease this is my second tube I've gone
through I use this in my kit and i
really suggest it especially again for
the price so this is almost done I'm
kind of sad
and then for nighttime me and Sam have
been using the Saturday skin wide-awake
brightening eye cream I honestly haven't
noticed any brightening with this and
we've been using this a long time I
think this might have been in my last
video actually but I thought I would
update you guys cuz it's still going
strong I got this sent to me from
Saturday skin through octa Lee and this
has an ounce of product in it and most I
creams have only half an ounce so this
has double the product and it's taking
us forever to go through and I feel like
Sam like he can go through skin care
products he's so dry he's a very dry
person and so he can go through things
like he gloops it on I feel like because
his skin just like soaks it up so fast
and I cannot believe we are not done
with this so for value I think if you're
just looking for an eye cream this is
gonna be a great value even though it is
a little bit more expensive because you
get that ounce it's really bringing the
cost down this is a bit of a thicker eye
cream so I find it's a little bit too
thick to bring to the inner corner so I
like to just keep it on the outer
portion where you would have like crow's
feet and stuff like that it's nice it's
not my favorite I wouldn't purchase this
and I think it's a little bit too rich
in silicone II for me instead of like
rich and more moisturizing at least
that's how I feel I think it's okay and
I will finish it up but it's not
something I would purchase let's move on
to moisturizers for the daytime I just
have to to talk about right now I am
trying a couple more out but I feel like
I haven't tried them long enough to even
tell you if I like them or not so I
didn't want to bring them up the first
one here is from Bioderma and it's the
CBM pore refiner this is like an oil
controlling lotion and I'm just trying
to use it up I'm so close this product
smells like watermelon which is really
nice but I don't really like it it's
thin and it tends to play nice with
other products when sometimes more oil
controlling products can like pill up
with other things so that's great but it
just doesn't control your oil I find I
get almost more greasy with this than I
do with other moisturizers so it's not
something that I would repurchase and I
don't really suggest it even though it
is at a better price point than a lot of
other moisturizers out there and then
the other moisturizer I've been using
and the daytime is from skin Iceland
again I
got the sentiment from them this is the
antidote cooling daily lotion with
Icelandic help and white willow bark
okay this is also for stress skin I
talked about this in my minty video
because this smells like mint and it
freaking tingles and cools your skin it
almost feels like icy hot like it's like
this cooling sensation but almost this
burning sensation so if you have very
sensitive skin if that sounds like
something that you would not like I do
not suggest this because I find on days
when I like exfoliate my face or maybe I
don't know I was just like a little bit
harsher on my skin this tends to really
burn around my nose area in my mouth
area the most and I find that the
cooling effects of this last kind of a
while like a good 15 minutes where
you're really feeling it still but other
than that I love the packaging it's nice
and glass it's really heavy the pump on
it is really nice as well the pump is
really nice in like sturdy which I enjoy
so packaging wise I like it I tend to
use two pumps of this on my face in the
morning and that kind of covers my whole
face a little bit down my neck and this
drives kind of matte so if you have oily
skin you're looking for a moisturizer
that isn't going to leave you to do a
this is a really nice one for that it
tends to sink into the skin really well
where I feel moisturized but again I
don't have anything glowy I don't have
anything to do we or anything like that
so if that's what you're looking for I
think this would be great I would
definitely be careful about this product
when you are doing your eyes I always
make sure I do my eyes first and then go
in with this product I just don't want
to have any remnants of this lotion on
my fingers as I'm going to be tapping
things close to my eyes because again
that mint can transfer and then you have
some you know burning sensations and
places you don't want that so I do like
this product I don't know if I'd pay the
price for it because I know it is a bit
expensive now that I've used it but I do
enjoy it I think it's cool and
innovative it's definitely a different
product than I've ever tried before and
some people in the comments of my minty
video said that they really enjoyed it
for their rosacea so I think that there
is something nice about this I just
don't think it's for everyone and the
last product I want to talk about is
from number 7 and
is a product actually had in my
favorites video because I really enjoy
it they did send this out to me but it's
a product I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
repurchase because I like it that much
this is the pro tect and perfect intense
advanced night cream and I really like
how thick this product is it does have a
bit of a perfumey scent I didn't really
notice it until I made Sam start using
it and he had mentioned it to me so I
want to make sure that I tell you guys
that so in case you guys are sensitive
um it's thick without being too much I
don't find that I'm overly greasy I
don't find that I'm like not hydrated
enough at night I just I really enjoyed
the feeling of this on my skin it does
have some anti-aging benefits to it it's
supposed to like you know you know get
rid of fine lines and all that it's also
supposed to tighten and I'm not sure
about the lines but I definitely can
maybe understand the tightening feeling
like I feel like my skin is a little bit
more tight when I'm using this since I
have been using it and we're pretty
close to being done now that Sam's on
using this product we're like getting
down there but I really do enjoy this I
think this retails for $25 and I think
that's a pretty fair price for how much
I've been enjoying this so I think I
might repurchase this to bring to Italy
with us and that is everything for the
skincare I've been using recently I feel
like I'm pretty basic when it comes to
skincare I don't know like I said I'm
not someone who is really like deep into
skincare and ingredients and all of
those things I also tend to be pretty
frugal when it comes to skincare if I'm
buying it myself unless I've tried
something and really really loved it
so I hope it gave you guys a little
insight into what I'm using kind of my
routine I like doing these kind of as a
collective review situation so that way
you guys can know what I'm using because
I get a lot of comments being like your
skin so great I'd love to see a routine
and I think a lot of that honestly I
just feel like I'm a little lucky I
don't know I don't know if these
products or not but um yeah that's what
I've been using so let me know if you
guys use these things what you think of
them in the comments or if there's
anything you think I really should try
that you think I would like let me know
as well I'd love to check it out
so thank you guys so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
