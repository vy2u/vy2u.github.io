Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a different video for my
channel I feel like I've done a lot of
haul videos lately but I'm sorry just I
usually don't buy stuff and so I feel
like it it seems like higher than it
normally is just because i have bought
more stuff recently than in the past but
this is gonna be a different type of
haul video this is all stuff that's been
sent to me for free or given to me spr i
haven't paid for any of this stuff it's
all been sent or just given to me
there's one thing in here though just
given to me by someone i met on set
because they have a lash line so i just
thought this would be a really
transparent way of showing you guys
things that i've got in the mail I feel
like YouTube can get kind of like grey
when it comes to things that have been
sent and if you like them because you
like them or you like them because it
was free or just different things like
that so I really like watching these
videos because it is fun to see what
companies send people it's also I think
just more enjoyable knowing that they
were sent fpr while you're watching it
and just knowing all the facts and
everything going into the video so you
as a viewer can make your own decisions
about the product so anyway let's just
get into this let me know if you like
this type of video because I think this
will be something that I like to do
often I haven't tried out all of these
products so these are mostly it's mostly
just haul but if I have any reviews on
anything that I will say you know talk
about that in this video too yeah let's
get into it the first thing I want to
talk about our some nail polishes that
madam glam sent me I think I say madam
glam kind of weird right is it justs
madam glam I like to say madam glam kind
of like rhymes better right I don't know
anyway they came out with a couple of
their collections and I do really enjoy
the gel nails they sent me before they
were in a favorites video I don't paint
my nails nearly as much as I used to I'm
just so busy and when i get home i just
want to relax i don't want to sit there
and paint my nails so gel nails are kind
of in my head if I'm going to spend the
time I want them to last like two weeks
instead of like two days and they're
already chipping so when they contacted
me and said they wanted to send me a
couple more things I was like sure
that'd be awesome i'd love to try out a
few collections so i got four different
polishes from three of their collections
these two are from the smoothie
collection and the smoothie collection
is kind of like it was the one I was
most
excited about by looking at two watches
online it's like a jelly type of formula
so it's like almost see-through but not
quite and it has glitter in it it's just
so pretty so this one here is in the
color happy belly like that's such a
cute name right happy valley I'll put in
close-up shots of everything just so
that you can see the color swatch on top
and then the other one I got is called
peach bellini these just a right at my
alley they are fun but they're still
like wearable their glitter but I like
that they're kind of like have this
opaque look to them so I haven't tried
these quite on my nails yet they are a
thicker formula than their other nail
polishes like if you can see this
they're very thick so I'm excited to try
to see how these work i did email and
just make sure that's how they're
supposed to be and they are supposed to
be thicker so i will let you guys know
how these look on the nails i'll
probably take a picture on Instagram so
if you're not following me they're
definitely do my name is down below as
always but I'm excited the most about
these I just think they're fun and
they're just on my alley they're totally
me and if I like these I doesn't want to
try and look at different colors to the
next polish I got was from a
glow-in-the-dark collection this also
sounded really fun to me I think it's
cool that they glow in the dark who
doesn't want glow-in-the-dark nails some
of these things are a little bit
gimmicky but i think that the glow in
the dark one is still like a fun when
it's not like gimmicky in the wrong way
this one is like a pinky color I don't
know what it shifts to when it goes in
the dark but that was the cool thing a
lot of the polishes actually have a
color and then they change to different
ones so you can get like one that glows
blue or green or pink or just like more
white so I thought that was really cool
instead of it just being like one glow
in the dark like granny color that they
had different colors that it glows in
the dark and that the polish itself
isn't just a clear polish because I do
have a glow-in-the-dark polish from
china glaze but it's just clear so you
don't even know it's on your nails when
it's not glowing I haven't tried this
and I'm excited to see how that works
and then the last polish that I got from
them this is part of the cat eyes
collection and this is the one that I am
personally not necessarily
super into but I wanted to try it just
to see if it works like I was interested
in like hmm I does this thing really
work if I was great very girl so and
this one is in the color born to be a
star it's kind of a hobby purpley pink
color and the whole thing about this is
that you paint this on your nails and
then you would hold up these magnets and
I'm guessing there some type of metal
and the polish that when you hold this
up it creates like a cat I like the rock
a cat I where it's like if you don't
know what a cat is i'll insert a picture
what it looks like but that's what this
polish is supposed to give that effect
to your nails we'll see if that works
I'm not sure this reminds me of like
when se came out with like the scale
polish and just different ones like the
magnetic wave polishes and different
things so this one definitely to me is a
little bit more gimmicky than the other
ones but we'll see if it works so if you
want to know how this turns out let me
know so this hall isn't like super large
so I have two things from actually if
you don't know what octal he is I will
leave it down below but it's a it's a
really cool site it's kind of like Fame
bit but I feel like a little bit better
because it's not the sponsored video you
go on to their side of your Creator and
you can apply to get products and then
if they accept you they send you the
product and that you have to like talk
about it in a video or whatever and
review it they want you're a hundred
percent honest opinion it's not about
just like selling it it's about getting
feedback and just getting their name out
there and yeah feedback on the product
so if you don't like it it's it's okay
to tell them that if you do like it
that's awesome too so I just really like
the way that this website works as
opposed to other ways and other websites
you can do to get product so anyway I
believe I heard about this first through
curious sparkle to our new too baggy so
definitely i'll have a link down below
if you want to check her out she's
really awesome youtuber i really like
her but anyway i'll show you the
products i got if you follow me on
Instagram you already know but I got the
by Terry hyaluronic hydra powder and i
have been using this i used it on myself
a couple times and then I did use it on
some clients and I kind of already know
a bit
about by Terry when i worked at my old
job we sold by terry so you guys know I
have other by Terry products that have
gone as gratis or from like taking out
testers and whatnot so I had already
heard about this product I've seen this
product and so I was excited to like
actually try it on myself this is quite
an expensive product and I do enjoy this
product I think it works really well but
there are a few things like I don't
think it works well on oily skin I don't
think it's gonna keep you Matt like for
me it just doesn't keep me mad but
honestly not a lot of things keep me mad
and I don't feel like that's what this
product is for to me this product is for
people who have like normal to dry skin
maybe more mature skin who are looking
for a really nice finishing powder
that's gonna add some moisture back and
not be too drying this is perfect like I
feel like I would love to use this on my
mom or on Bridal clients or people like
that that is what this powder to me is
perfect for it is so finely milled I'm
telling you like if I open this you're
gonna see powder because it's just like
I mean it looks like it's crazy it's so
finely milled and that it's just a
luxurious powder I like the finish on
the skin I don't feel like this would
turn you ashy if you have a darker skin
tone you just really need to just buff
it in and make sure that you don't have
like two heavy of spots you just have a
nice powder brush and do a light setting
of this all over your face I think it
would be beautiful again that's part of
the reason I don't think that it's great
for oily skin cuz like for me I packed
powder on like I'm like you know sitting
there with like I'm patting it I'm not
sweeping any powder on this face I'm
like pushing it into my foundation so
for me it just doesn't work as well as I
feel like it would on other people and I
honestly just don't feel like that's
what this product is intended for for my
kit I personally again like I said would
love to use this on like private clients
or bridal situations people that again
have more mature skin and things like
that I think this is perfect but if I'm
just trying to keep people Matt like on
set if it's just to mattify this
personally to me is that the powder I'm
going to reach for only because one it's
really expensive and too I don't know
for like guys and stuff it's just like
I'd rather just use the Ben night
some powder and I know what's going to
make them mad immediately so now that
this doesn't matter if I but I just feel
like I need something that's gonna last
a little longer and this just gives more
of like a beautiful finish this would be
great for photo shoots and things like
that so that's like my review on this
but I do enjoy it I'm glad to have it
and it was really awesome to get and
then the other thing that I picked up
off of oxalate and I was like going back
and forth advice to do but I picked up
one of the pure foreign one pressed
mineral foundation this is a powder
foundation you guys know cuz I've
already talked about this on my channel
because I bought one myself at
generation beauty I just I don't know
okay I feel like I'm the type of person
that I don't know if I like something or
how much I love something until it's
gone or until I try something else and I
don't like it so I feel like now that I
talked bad about this but I just I
didn't type it up as much as I really
did actually like it so when I finished
my other one I was just missing it and
it was on the website and I was like I'm
gonna try and see if they'll send it to
me and they did and I just I do I really
like the finish of this product on the
skin the coverage and honestly I just
really enjoy how simple it is to use
this product I am gonna do a powder
foundation routine video with this but
this is in the color light I'll show you
what it looks like kind of powdery but I
just I really do like this product I'm
excited to have it back in my life I do
want to try out the Milani face powder
holla holla girl I don't know how to say
your name um I just realized tell me you
tell me the comment she mentioned that
in a comment to me to try she's been
using it i really want to try that a
hopper channel link down below to if you
want to check her out so I want to try
that after this but I do really like
this product I think if you have normal
to dry skin you would love this and even
though I have oily skin I still like it
I do get oily again nothing new for me
but if you blot or just retouch up
throughout the day I just prefer it just
gets me at the door so fast and I still
feel really pretty and my skin still
looks really nice yeah I love this and I
really excited to have it back in the
last item that I got kind of is like a
promo PR type of thing these are Ingrid
lashes I was working with Ingrid on a
set one day she was there helping assist
too so she has her own lash line which i
think is so awesome and I want to be
supportive of that because my number one
goal eventually in my life like if I
could hit the pinnacle of something
would be to have my own cosmetic line so
i think it's just so awesome that she's
out there doing that and creating her
own products and have her own packaging
and everything so these are mink lashes
I've never worn mink lashes and i've
only ever applied them a couple times
actually so this is what they look like
really pretty i did go with more of like
a natural style because that is more my
style i don't like to too thick of
lashes these ones don't have a name on
them but i believe all her names of her
lashes are after drinks which i think is
really fun so i will have a link down to
her website if you're in demand flashes
definitely check him out she does
different like sales to on her instagram
like for percentages off and everything
but i thought that was really awesome
and i just think it's really cool and
it's inspiring to see someone like
creating their own line from nothing and
just I know that takes a lot of hard
work a lot of money a lot of time a lot
so I just think that's really cool
anyway that is everything I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day I hope
you guys enjoyed this type of video let
me know if you've tried any of these
things down below or if you like any of
them I think that's everything and I
will see you guys in my next video bye
