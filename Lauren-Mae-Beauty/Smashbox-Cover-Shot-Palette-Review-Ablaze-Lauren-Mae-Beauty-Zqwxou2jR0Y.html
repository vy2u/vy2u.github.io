Lauren I wanted to do a really quick
video about one of the new Smashbox
these are the cover shot eyes shadow
palettes I believe they have eight of
them I did pick up one because of the
Sephora coupon that I got these retail
for $29 and I got the color ablaze which
is the warmest out of all of them I was
really excited to try this I feel like
this is a really fun idea from Smashbox
to come out with I was intrigued by the
price point by the pictures that I kept
seeing online in the different videos
and so since I had that coupon I thought
let's go for it this is just gonna be a
super quick first impression swashes I
have used this palette to a bit of a
review the first thing is the size I was
expecting this to be a little bit bigger
it's obviously not very big at all I
kind of thought it would be like the
lorac afterglow palettes eyes so not as
big as like a Naked palette but
something bigger than like the size of
my hand so that kind of threw me off for
it being $30
yeah just first impressions on size I
just wasn't expecting it to be that tiny
the front here is like a holographic or
whatever you want to call that where it
you know has the different thing I think
that's kind of cool I feel like the
packaging feels a little cheap though
like I easily could break this and would
it be surprised I even have a little bit
of wear already on the inside henges see
those white that's like the plastic kind
of like ripping away so I definitely
feel like packaging is not my favorite
either but besides that let's get into
the shadows I think the color selections
really pretty it's super on point with
what's popular right now I feel like
this is more for a red warm smokey eye
because there are really no light shades
in here I do like that the two lightest
shades are in bigger pans and the other
ones because you are going to be using
them more there are about four shadows
that are matte in here so this light
cream color is a matte this shade here
has a little bit of sparkle in it but
nothing like the two-faced ones where
they shoot glitter throughout a matte I
feel like the times I've used this it
translated as a matte and
used it as a mat and it works really
well for that and then these two are
mats I'm really happy about that I feel
like the colors that you would want in
this palette to be matte or matte which
rarely happens the rest of the shades
are shimmery and this one here kind of
has a little bit of glitter in it
nothing too much but it does come off a
little bit chunkier I could say than the
rest and has like a gold sparkle
throughout it overall quality wise I
think these are really nice quality
I love the pigmentation that I've gotten
from them so far let's just get in just
watching real fast I'll just show you
guys so I'm sorry they're really awkward
and kind of going down my arm but these
are swatches of the palette so
pigmentation is not an issue in this
palette I feel like they all swatch
really nicely and again I feel like
overall quality is really nice on these
palettes I don't feel like it's to hit
or miss these aren't gonna be the most
buttery shadows you've ever used
especially not the mattes I feel like
they're a little bit more dry
specifically these two colors to me feel
kind of dry as you swatch them but they
perform really nicely on the eyes I am
using this shadow on my outer corner
today and I love it and I also did a
really nice smoky eye with this earlier
and I really liked the way it turned out
I thought they blended nicely so overall
I like this palette but I'm kind of
underwhelmed I don't think it's a
must-have and I don't know I like it and
I'm gonna use it and I enjoy the looks I
create with it
I do wish that it had like a lighter
kind of lid shade kind of like a lid
shade I'm wearing now in it just so that
way I could just pull from this palette
there's nothing in here bright enough
for me to do that so that's why I was
kind of saying it's more like a more
smoky look or a darker look since
there's nothing really bright in here
even the matte cream shade to me it
works as like almost a light transition
like a Peach Smoothie type of color on
me I do think it's nice I could see why
people are liking these I'm tempted to
try other ones but I do think $30 for
how small this is is a little hefty I
wish it was more like 25 I don't know I
know that's kind of like being cheap but
it's just so small like I haven't done
any of the map for like the size of the
eyeshadows because to me that's not that
big of a deal unless you're really
panning stuff it's not really
that for me I don't know I know a lot of
people are gonna be against that but I
don't care if an eye shadow is like a
ton of product in $20 I would rather
have a smaller one for less money and
have more in my collection and how I use
my makeup so I'll show you one more time
some swatches overall it's really pretty
and I really do like how this shows up
actually cranberry and doesn't turn just
dark or you know sometimes it's hard to
get the true color to come out but yeah
those are some swatches and the cream
color just looks like my skin that's
everything for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed and I will see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
