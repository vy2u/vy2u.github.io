Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a video all about
products that I think smell really good
they smell like summer and mostly
coconut a lot of them are coconut
because that's like my favorite scent
ever I love coconut I just thought this
would be fun summer is coming up and I
don't know the weather is warming up
here in California and I was just
thinking about some products that i
really like the smell of and i was like
i'm going to do a whole video nuts we'll
just start off with big teeth because
you guys know it's one of my favorites
this is Battiste dry shampoo but this is
the coconut and exotic tropical scent
this smells so good not only is the
packaging on this just absolutely
adorable it smells so good it definitely
has that tropical coconut send and it
stays with you throughout the day so if
that's something you like you would love
it when I'm walking around after spring
this in my hair I can smell it i'll just
get like list of it throughout the day
which i love but i think some people
might not like it so it makes me feel
fresh and clean and then i love that i
have that just fun tropical scent with
me throughout the day another hair care
product that smells amazing you guys
know because of my empties the bikies
one let's say is a little bit more like
fun spring break on the beach this is
like you're on the resort you know
you're in the resort your fancy and
you're vacationing by the beach so this
is Moroccan oil Moroccan oil treatment I
just love the seller Moroccan oil I've
had the joy texturizing spray which
smells great the shampoo and conditioner
which smelled great my nose barely works
and I can still smell this and it smells
amazing they also have a body scrub I
believe it had a candle they have like
bar soaps I want to say this just smells
so good and definitely gives me like
summer vibes and just fun I don't know I
just I love it I feel like you could
also use this oil on your body if you
wanted to which would be a great multi
use for summer I'm going to remind you
some body products this one here is the
malicious body scrub and this is the
coconut sugar I've talked about
malicious a couple times on my channel
this product is actually sent to me from
octa Lee a while ago but i have bought
their body strap on my own because we
used to sell it in
my old beauty store that i worked at i
love the coconut scent but honestly i
think so many of their scents are great
i really like this one as well like a
cookie or like a it's like Oh brown
sugar it's an old salga too so I didn't
do their great scrubs they are a whisk
consistency mine is getting a little old
so it's not as like whipped as it was
but when you first get them they're just
such as a different consistency but it's
amazing the scrub feel so great it's a
sugar scrub and then it leaves like a
moisturizing barrier on you afterward
I'm not someone who likes lotion very
much I have a few luncheons I like
actually want I'll be mentioning in this
video but I love this because i feel
like i can get moisturization in the
shower without having to put on lotion
outside of the shower and i still feel
like I'm like taking care of my body I
just highly suggest these they are
luxurious in price but they're also just
luxurious as a product and I think
they're really amazing it wouldn't be a
video if I couldn't mention bath and
body works this is like a just a classic
scent I like so many a bath and
Bodyworks sense and I feel like they
come out with different ones for the
summer all the time for the different
seasons so basically you could just pick
up whatever sense out that season and
it's probably going to smell amazing but
this is a classic this is coconut lime
verbena this scent actually has a lot of
memory tied to it when me and Samm with
two year for the first time for like a
month I've bought a shampoo and
conditioner in this scent from bath and
body works and so the whole time we were
over there that's what we were using so
whenever I use this sentence like oh I
felt like Europe I just love this I love
the shower gels I like their scrubs I
like so many products from them so i
highly suggest this scent just in
general coconut scent settle and i love
i love them i have a skincare product
here this is from totally and this is
the beauty elixir now this does not have
a tropical scent this has a very minty
fresh scent you may have no i'm working
on this in one of my project pants and
that the sprayer is totally asked and it
doesn't work well but when this prayer
works well this is such a refreshing
products i love the smell of the mint I
love the tingle of the mint on my face
and this would be such a great product
to have with you by the pool by the
beach
just throughout the day if you're like
traveling or whatever you're doing in
general at work it doesn't matter this
is such a refreshing products and I
think especially for summer it's just so
nice and I just love the scent on it I
would definitely repurchase this this is
my second bottle of this so I have your
purchases it's just great i love it i'm
going to talk about your products
actually don't have with me their
products that I've used in the past that
you step and I just have ever purchased
yet the first one is a product by Johara
and it is a body butter / lotion it's in
like a tub I'll have a picture of it up
here gig is in a sense candlenut and it
smells absolutely amazing it is such an
a unique fragrance but it's very
tropical it just feels so good if you're
ever at a store that sells their
products and have a chance to smell it i
highly suggest it it smells so good and
on top of that the body cream itself is
just so luxurious it's silky smooth it's
one of my favorite body lotions I've
ever used and I don't like body lotion
so I definitely want to repurchase that
once i have like absolutely no body
lotions and it's like the only one I do
have I just love that one and I love the
scent that is definitely something that
reminds me of summer they also have a
small perfume roll or so I also want to
get that as well I really love that send
another product that I don't have with
me and just in general i guess our bath
and bodyworks candles i have a ton with
me but i don't have any in the tiki huts
end and that's my favorite one tiki hut
is just such a classic scent from them
and it's one that i know they have every
single summer so I know you can get it I
have a couple cents from them that I
like that have been discontinued and
never brought back one of them is mega
beachwood I don't get me started but I
didn't want to personally talk about
those that's just one I definitely love
I definitely would love to have my
collection all the time I haven't heard
the candle for a while and I recently
just went through a wallflower of it but
I definitely would repurchase hacker
purchase I love essence I'll talk about
the last like fragrance type of thing
this is a Wallflower and another product
for bath and body works and this is
designed ocean driftwood this is a lot
different from the other sense i've
mentioned so far this is very much like
a man smell
if you like mahogany teak wood you would
definitely like this I feel like this is
mahogany teak wood brother but a little
bit more peachy it smells so great and
if you want something that's a little
bit more gender-neutral this is a great
one I only have a couple more products
next I wanted to talk about something
that I recently got from actually but I
do love the scent of and I think that
everything about this just reminds me of
the beach this is expensive this is like
eighteen dollars and this is the sole de
Janeiro Brazilian kiss lip butter I'm
going to not even say that other word
everyone freaks out about the size of
this and I believe this is the sentence
of the bumbo cream 2 is the same scent
and this does smells really really good
I redirect ascend event and it was
reminding me of something at first and I
couldn't put my finger on it but this
reminds me of what my Jasmine korres lip
butter smells like it kind of almost has
this like it's tropical but to me it
almost smells like a burnt cotton candy
type of scent and that's what I
described the Jasmine corslet butter as
too and I think this one discontinued so
this is six awesome that this is my next
new thing I've used quite a bit of it
and I really do enjoy it it's something
that me and Sam are going to get a lot
of use out of and I like how big it is
because you could throw it in your beach
bag or you could throw it in your purse
and you're definitely going to be able
to find it plus I just love yellow like
ill is one of my favorite colors pink
and yellow those are my favorite this
also has a really nice consistency and
texture it's very moisturizing i highly
suggest this it is expensive but i do
you think it's a nice one and the scent
alone is super amazing but if you want
something an el borde restauraciÃ³n i'm
going to bring one up again i just
talked about these in my favorite lip
products video because i really do like
these these are from revlon and there's
a Revlon kiss bombs I love the clear one
in dissent tropical coconut oh I just
felt really really good that's how much
I've used of mine quite a bit this one
is the peach one and I really like this
one she would have a little bit more of
a cinch though cuz that peachy tint love
this though both of these are amazing
really summer friendly they're going to
moisturize this one's great if you want
a little bit of color you could do it in
the middle of anywhere on the beach
whatever and you're not going to
the mirror my last product it has to
talk to you guys about is my butter
bronze there's a rule this was going to
happen there's no way wasn't going to
mention this everyone talks about the
Elvis it smells really good it
definitely coconut has a little bit of
almost like a sudden screamy coconut
type of scent I've repurchases three
times now this is my second one because
my first one was almost done and then
it's broken shattered all over the floor
then I got this one and then recently
CBS is having a super great deal on
physicians formula products so I bought
it back up which I know kind of crazy
but this is one of my favorite bronzers
I've used it all the time I love the
color of it and the smell is just a
bonus honestly so the packaging is like
totally fit for this video too I just
love that product you guys already know
though I talked about it in a lot of
videos okay guys I hope you enjoyed this
video something a little bit different

going to name this something like smells
