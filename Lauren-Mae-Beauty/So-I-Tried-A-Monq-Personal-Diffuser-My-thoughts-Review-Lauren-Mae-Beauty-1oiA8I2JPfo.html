Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I have a review on a product that
is not going to be everyone's favorite
or cup of tea so I totally get that if
you aren't into this don't watch this
video
I'm personally not into it either I just
got this to try it out
what I'm talking about is the monk what
are these let me get the exact thing of
course it's not on the target ring let
me see well it doesn't say it on the
packaging either but I want to get the
wording right these are personal
diffusers personal air diffusers they
aren't technically an e-cigarette but
what this is is a little vial that you
breathe in the product and it's supposed
to be essential oils and it's supposed
to give you like a relaxing feeling or
column feeling or this feeling I saw
these and then was really really
intrigued and the only reviews I could
find on these product were sent to them
by the company which there's nothing
wrong with that that's way different
than being sponsored but I really just
wanted opinions from someone who didn't
get sent this product to genuinely use
this product enjoyed this product and I
really couldn't find any video or
reviews like that so I did this for
science now I went and bought one
because I was just so intrigued and I
know in my brain I would never get over
it until I bought it for myself and I
bought the ocean said now they have a
lot of different flavors I don't know
what we want to call them but they have
a whole like emotion range so there's
like happy sleepy and other ones I
believe there's seven of them and then
they recently and I don't know why
recently how recently but after that
they came out with a new fragrance scent
line taste wine I don't know that is
inspired by the mountains the forest in
the ocean and I picked up the ocean
scent so this is the packaging
I did not buy mine from the monk website
instead I bought mine from Amazon which
I believe is the monk brand selling
through Amazon I did that because I
didn't want to be tempted to get more
than one I didn't want to be tempted by
free shipping or anything like that to
get more than one so I paid I believe 20
dollars for this and then it was like
495 shipping so I believe in total I
paid about $25 for this thing it's
pretty sleek it's kind of heavy
it's not refillable this is like a
one-time use thing and then you get a
new one I believe you're supposed to
have like 250 breasts or whatever from
this I read a lot of reviews because I
was like trying to pick the scent I
thought I would like the mouth some
people are saying they tasted like feet
some people said it tasted amazing like
there were a lot of different reviews on
the different websites I was looking at
ultimately like I said I went with ocean
which is eucalyptus lined and tangerine
and I think it tastes pretty dang good
it talks to me by any means it's
definitely like herbal it definitely
kind of tastes like essential oil it's
nice I don't know I like to send I like
the taste whatever overall with this
whole thing I'm not really a fan I
thought that this potentially could be
something cool IRA nestled all turned a
little fun little something different
and I don't smoke but I have in the past
and never like a ton who was always just
like kind of social but um I don't know
I don't know why I just wanted to
freaking try this okay guys don't judge
me this is a jet free zone okay so I
picked this up and uh yeah I don't know
if you're a silly just breathing
essential oils into your lungs now I
will say I scoured the website because I
thought in my head like is it safe to
breathe in essential oils like if you
look at my Instagram and you look at
their website they're definitely are
giving off this vibe that this is
healthy this is natural this is like do
yoga then breathe your monk in like it
definitely gives us that vibe and that's
kind of strange because you would think
like breathing anything into your lungs
the size air would be like not good so I
was like maybe it'll say on there so I
kept looking at the website kept looking
I find
found a piece of the website that says
that you're not supposed to breathe this
into your lungs you are supposed to
bring this into your mouth and then
exhale out your nose but that is only in
one tiny section of the website it's not
like written all over the place
I feel like that's a bit misleading
especially because I feel like this is
targeting people maybe that are trying
to quit smoking people that are trying
to just be healthier but maybe have
those you know tendencies as oral you
know habits in addictions so I think
that that's kind of misleading and a
little shady to me that they only
mention it in one place and I feel like
naturally and instinctively you're like
goal or idea is to breathe this into
your lungs and then breathe it out like
you would any other type of thing like
this like a bait for a cigarette or
whatever I will not be smoking this on
camera or breathing this in or inhaling
this on camera I just don't feel
comfortable doing that and I also just
don't like to do it I will not be
repurchasing this and what we were
purchasing any of the other ones every
time that I would inhale this into my
lungs it was fine it didn't hurt didn't
feel bad I just felt like afterward it
just felt like I kept having to clear my
throat more than normal which is not
okay to me so you know personally
interrupt that's just me whatever and
then breathing it in through my mouth
and holding it there and then exhaling
it out my nose I just why I don't know
just rub some essential oils on yourself
I know yet you guys are trying to tell
me to do that earlier and some people
were leaving comments saying like
essential oil like irritate your skin
why would you breathe them into your
lungs you know I don't know how they
formulate this I don't know what
percentage of essential oils or how
diluted they are or anything like that I
just went for it guys I tried to do as
much research as possible but in the end
it's like either do it or just like
forget about it and my brain would not
let me forget about it so I just went
for it
this is not my saying you know the one
thing that's kind of cool about this is
that when you breathe in this lights up
but like is that a reason to have this
definitely not this review is just kind
of what
it might work for some people and I
think that's great maybe if you are
wanting to do something healthier than
smoking I do think this is healthier
than that I don't think that this should
become your new habit necessarily I'm
not trying to tell people ah to live
their lives you can do whatever you want
I just personally couldn't get into it I
was kind of excited for I thought it'd
be cool the biggest problem I have is
just that this is expensive I hate that
it's not refillable I feel like the
entire thing about the brand is very
like Oh naturally you can't even refill
the product I think it's like wasteful
and like so horrible for the environment
hello and we could try to figure that
one out maybe and besides that I just
feel like this is a bit false
advertising acting like this is some oil
diffuser and it's not it's not our oil
diffuser it's something that you breathe
into your lungs and it isn't it isn't as
healthy and natural as all of these like
pictures and and their brands presents
itself to be a definitely think they
have a great marketing strategy hello I
bought it as you're curious maybe try it
I mean I don't know you might be with me
and you have to try it but uh I'm here
to say for someone who's like looking
it's not that big of a deal it's not
that cool I don't know man I just think
that it's if you're wanting to get into
essential oil I think that applying them
onto the skin or just using them into
the air in a larger space is definitely
a better route to go than getting this I
will say if they sold these blends
outside of like the Pens I think that
would be a really great move for them
because I can like this blend it smells
really good I just don't like breathing
it into my lungs or which you're not
supposed to do but again I feel like
they aren't even that upfront about the
fact that you're not supposed to do that
you have to like dig and dig and dig and
I'm pretty sure in like all of the
reviews that I watch they like smoke
them or whatever inhale them on camera
and they definitely breathe them into
their lungs which is like not what
you're supposed to do I don't know so
that's my review my experience totally
unspotted unrelated to the company I
bought this is my own money mail my own
25 dollars and yeah I could have got
like a really nice blush or something
and I didn't
about this well and that's everything
guys I hope you enjoyed this review hope
it helps you out if you're looking for
something and sponsored or unaffiliated
with a brand and that's it let me know
if you've tried me down below let me
know if you're interested or not
after this I'd love to hear your
thoughts because again I did think it
was interesting and interesting enough
to buy it even against the will of my
husband and my mom and basically
everyone around me what can I say I'm a
rebel so that's everything guys I will
talk to you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
