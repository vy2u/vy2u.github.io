bit of a vlog style we are going to be
tanning I've never self tan before so I
thought I would take you guys along the
Tanner I'm gonna be trying is the Isle
of paradise this is the medium one and
it's green because it has like color
correcting pigments in it we'll see how
that works the reason I wanted to try
this one as opposed to like other
traditional tanners is because it's a
water and I thought maybe it'd be easier
I've been looking at reviews on Sephora
though and we'll see how it actually
turns out I'm gonna try to go
heavy-handed with it because it seems
like that is maybe what's causing it to
potentially be streaky so we'll see just
you guys know this was sent to me from
the company bud obviously this is gonna
be my honest opinions and we're gonna
see how it works out it says on the back
to exfoliate and put lotion on so I have
already done that
let me flip you guys around I'll show
you what I used I used the pur Lisse
coconut oil coffee body scrub in the
shower and this actually did leave me a
little bit
moisturized as well so that was great
and then I also put this on like the
ankles as well as the knees the sala de
janeiro boom-boom cream and then I will
be using Amit today to hopefully make
this look better yeah so that's kind of
a rundown I'm going to set up my station
I'll show you it because I'm gonna put a
towel down on the floor cuz again I'm
like the spray is gonna go like
everywhere and I will show you guys how
we're gonna do this Oh fingers crossed
that it's easy and comes out well all
right we got the towel down just please
don't mind the floor or anything I'm
gonna show you guys a before picture now
so you can see the level and hopefully
we can see a difference by the end of
this I also put a little star on my foot
so we can see the difference of like
where the tan is and where my skin color
is so we can see how much of a level we
got so alright let's do this
all right so we have put the self-tanner
on I I know I mentioned obviously that
I've never self tan before but some of
the reasons I have been self tan is it
just seems like so much work it just
doesn't seem like worth it I have gotten
a spray tan in the past so I have
sprayed my legs down that's how much
I've used obviously though I'm like I'm
plus-size I'm bigger though maybe that's
part of it but I felt like I used quite
a bit scent wise this smells like
cucumber melon it's really nice it
doesn't have like a self-tanner type of
scent so that's good the medium is
supposed to give me a golden glow so we
will see if that happens I will say with
the spray I the reasons I liked it is
cuz it was a water I just thought it was
interesting I thought it'd be easier but
honestly so far the spray just seems
like you're spraying it everywhere and
then it gets like on the floor it gets
on the cabinet seems like are you gonna
have like tan cabinets now so we'll see
how the cleanup is on that or how that
ends up turning out I also felt like
when you're spraying your legs you have
to make sure you keep the spray upright
instead of you know turned or anything
because it won't spray out then and that
kind of becomes cumbersome also this
doesn't have a color guard on it so it's
hard to know where you've got the Tanner
on already unless it's like soaking what
so we will see how it turns out even
with all of that I am really excited to
hopefully have some Tanner legs I think
that it'll look cute so hopefully it
looks good but I will come back and
check in with you guys after four to six
hours that's how long this is supposed
to be on just you guys know you can get
this at Sephora I think it's all sold
out right now they have two other colors
they have a lighter one and then they
have a purple one which is like a dark
tan they also have a couple other
different products so just if you are
wondering I would love to know what your
experience is with the Isle of paradise
tanners if you've tried them leave your
review down below so we can know what's
up if you tan a lot maybe it's easier
for you but anyway I will come back and
check in with you between four and six
hours we'll see I guess just to give you
another quick review - when it comes to
drying I did stand in front of a fan and
so it's a little like it just feels like
kind of tacky it feels like I have
something on but hopefully it won't
transfer anything so now I will actually
see you in about four to six hours
all right guys what's up it has
five hours now since I first put the tan
on and yeah we we have a little bit of a
tan going I'm gonna try to get you some
shots but I am alone so it's gonna be
kind of hard and I'm just doing it
blocks out but if you want an idea or a
little swatch I got my arm so yeah
that's kind of the color if you wanted
to know what it looks like on my legs I
think overall it looks pretty good I'll
say I went a little too ham on my feet
that's a little scary it looks a little
like dirty and my like ankles look a
little scary but overall I would say
that I'm really happy with like the
majority of the leg I think it looks
like just a little bit Tanner nothing
too crazy and it like definitely feels
nice like well it's a little more toned
or something I'm gonna try to get you
some shots of that though so let's see
and then I'm for sure going to show you
guys tomorrow what it looks like after
the showers you can see like the before
and after in the same area and so you
guys can see the tan that way when it
comes to like experience of wearing it
I'll say it was a little bit sticky and
I find that with myself something that's
hard for me oh you guys can just see my
nasty towels oh um what's the dryness
stop that from happening
there we go I'll just cover them but
when it comes to me I just I don't like
feeling like 1/2 stuff all over me so I
just felt like I couldn't sit on things
and couldn't do things not that it was
going to stain or that it would have
stained it just it felt like I had a
film all over my body and that's just
something that's like a thing with me
and then also the smell it was like it's
not like cucumber melon when I was
putting it on I thought it smelt nice
but honey it turned into Tanner smell it
was like the self tanner smell very like
this weird sweet nasty smell you guys
know what it's like I know I haven't
self-tan before but I have gone spray
tans I know what's up I know what the
tanning smell is I feel like as a woman
you just know what the tanning smell is
and no one likes it so that was a little
bit irritating hopefully though once I
wash it off it all be gone overall I
would say with my first impression
review I'm probably gonna use this again
I'm probably not going to use as much
like I really wanted to make sure I
doused my legs so I didn't have any like
streaks and that was based off of just
the reviews I had
right on Sephora but I think next time
I'm gonna try to go a little bit lighter
not use as much and see how that goes
and maybe kind of build on top of this
tan I don't know we'll see but I will
say I think that if I had to buy one if
I had to buy as tanner I would go with
something like the saint-tropez just
something more tried and true maybe the
loving tan when I know that one's really
popular because it's in a foam and you
can easily put on your body it has a
color guard you know where it's at
you're not spraying down your whole
bathroom I just think I would probably
purchase that instead of like
repurchasing this so I like the idea of
the water I don't feel like I got like
an orange tan like I think it's a good
color oh my gosh I'm one of those people
now where had to be like don't mind my
fake tan all over myself yeah you
definitely just have to be so careful
when it comes to fake tan and it's
definitely kind of difficult so if you
are like a fake tan a connoisseur if you
like know what it's about
you've like you know figured out your
system please let us know some tips in
the comments I would love to know like
something maybe you saw or you think
would help me out I'd appreciate it
other than that I'm gonna try to get
some shots and show you what's going on
right now I'm gonna take a shower and
then I will show you tomorrow let you
know if like it's developed anymore just
kind of what I feel like after the
shower and I will show you some
before-and-afters and that's kind of
like my whole experience of self-tanning
I feel like I couldn't do anything all
day for the five hours it was on because
I just felt like a mummy like I was
walking around like a zombie or
something anyway yeah let me show you my
my nasty ankles and dirty feet besides
the fact that the bottom of my foot is
actually dirty you can obviously see a
lion after you more occasion where my
tan is I also want to show you like you
can see the little star there I put a
little sticker and so that is what the
tan looks like like the original foot
color and then my fat color I'm sorry my
feet are so hideous and that's an
example of like I don't know if that's
my skin and just
weirdly just colored or what because I
do have some like marks from like bug
bites from the past but yeah that got
weird and I thought I would show you
guys again like that's what the tan
looks like so sorry for my nasty
bathroom I tried to clean it y'all they
tried ok I'm gonna get in the shower and
I will see you guys tomorrow
alright hi guys so it is the second day
and I've taken the shower I don't know
if you're supposed to wash it off but I
just couldn't stand the smell of it I
will say that the smell is still
haunting me I feel like I have a ghost
following me because the scent is
everywhere everywhere I smell it won't
leave me but overall I'm pretty happy
with the tan I will say my feet look
pretty horrible I'm out in like natural
lighting so I will show you guys what my
tan looks like it's pretty nice I
definitely think that some of the
mistakes I made could be just being like
brand new to it but overall I think like
in the main areas it's pretty good so
let me show you guys that it's been
really difficult to try to like film
this just so you guys know so like I
have like a drip here I don't know how
that happened my foot looks like crazy
so yeah all of that asked but that's
like the difference and then I also had
a drip here
anyway it wasn't too bad I feel like for
my first time but I'm gonna end the vlog
self-tanning vlog here thanks so much
for watching guys again if you have any
tips leave them in the comments and I'll
talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
