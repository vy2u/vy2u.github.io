exploring this is going to be a brand
new project pan this is actually
collapsed so I was contacted by glades
from in beauty mix here on YouTube as
well as on Instagram she contacted at me
and a ton of other ladies about a suite
on panning project pan and this was
supposed to all be seamed with products
that either look like candy taste for a
candy sell buy candy somehow work candy
related I believe this is both to
coincide is like the fourteenth of
februari like Valentine's Day or
potentially the end of said weary I'm
not entirely sure there were a lot of
messages to go through so I primary
products just in case if it was for the
fourteenth of februari that hopefully it
can make some progress but it's not the
end of every would give me a ton more
time so I wanted to say thank you so
much for inviting me I'm really excited
and I will link everyone down below i'm
not going to say everyone James because
we'd be here for like ten years there's
so many people which is so exciting
these bigger collapse are really fun I
really feel like a show of how much of a
community we are here on YouTube the
project planning community and yeah if
you aren't in on this and you want to
join we don't have a ton of time I also
don't have kind of timeless why it's
like getting up now but join in maybe
pick a couple things you think you can
just make some progress on even if it's
not finishing on my head a fan but join
it and definitely that being said I
didn't have a ton of product I decided
to join this project i believe i was out
of town so i didn't have a chance to
like look at my products and see what i
had so i just picked these allowed to me
they're all candy ish related um we're
going to go for it hopefully is good
enough so the first item that I thought
works really well with this project was
the glow kit from ah nostalgia in the
sleep now all of the products in here
are highlighters and the names of them
are sassy grapes Cathy butterscotch and
marshmallow so very candy related my
goal is to just use this palette every
single day starting today but I didn't
use it today Billy starting after today
listen I was lucky enough please get
this like for free so I didn't pay for
this but I do kind of want to use it
actually see how it works I really do
like to be locate formulations that I've
tried and I just want to get some use
out of this I think
are small and sassy grape which are like
the two lighter colors will probably be
my favorite spot we'll see maybe I'll
find a way to make this work and just
fall in love the next item is kind of a
given me item but I want to work through
it this is britney spears fantasy and to
me to smell like candy it's so sweet i
really do like the sentencers it's so
funny I feel like so many girls even my
husband's actually Sam can tell that
this is britney spears fantasy because
of sister instaweather so if i wear this
he knows like are you wearing britney
spears fantasy which I just feel like
everyone knows the fenton right you know
this time let me smell it I'm about here
on it so I don't have a time left I just
I've been working on this it is when I
continue to work on it get it used up
because perfumes are another thing I'm
still working on this year to move out
so this should not be a problem next I
have the NYX butter gloss is mrs. in the
color Eclair I am wearing it today on my
list and I don't think I'm going to be
able to use this up and my goal just to
like get more use out of it the butter
glosses I have are pretty old they still
smell really good which is why I
included it these are a little bit more
like a bakery type of scent but I'm
including it in the candy one it's sweet
right so I wanted to get more use out of
this so that way i'll probably get rid
of them at the end of this year they're
just getting a little too old I mean
unless the scent changes before then but
it's a nice gloss and now that I'm
completely over matte lips but I think
blossom should be coming back in soon
hopefully right hopefully we can get
something up and then dry cracked lips
seeing the trend no shade O'Shea's and
my last item this has three items in it
that I want to try to like pan so this
is the toothpaste peanut butter and
jelly palette and this smells like
peanut butter I don't have any of the
other two faced things like a candy bar
palette or capital bar palette so I
thought I would include this I want to
hit pan on three shades in here the
first one being bananas and I already
have a good dip going I just want to use
it everyday
hopefully had pan the next shade is
peanut brittle which is this one here i
am wearing it on my lips today just
slept over a color pop shadow I'd like
to hit pan on that or anything just get
more use out of it and last but not
least I want to use jelly and hit pan on
that so I think that if I really focus
on these I can definitely hit pan on
them I have peanut brittle in another
project coming up for like the year and
i also think i'm going to make this my
companion palette to my pan that palette
for 2017 which I will be filming a video
on soon so I definitely have like
multiple multiple multiple reasons to
use this and hit those goals I think
that since I like doubled up on that I
can actually make myself use them and
hopefully make some progress in those
items so those are all my items for the
sweet on panning project and we're
excited to be doing this I probably
won't have like another thing it'll
probably just be a finale so I might
show some progress on Instagram like if
I hit pan on one of those shadows I
might just put it on Instagram so if
you're not following me they're
definitely do what it's always linked
down below that's everything I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you max video anyways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
