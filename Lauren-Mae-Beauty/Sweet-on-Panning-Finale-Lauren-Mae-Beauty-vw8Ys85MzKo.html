Lauren this is my finale for my sweet on
panning project pan collab I was in
collaboration with so many other women
here on YouTube I'm going to have them
all let's sit down below please go check
out their finales and go say hi to them
this project pan was created by Liz from
in the beauty mix I will also have her
link down below so thank you so much Liz
for bringing us all together and
coordinating this it was really fun
because this project pan was themed with
all candy or treats or anything sweet
related so that is how you were supposed
to pick your items I did pick six
specific different goals so let's just
get into my progress and how I did this
wasn't my most successful project pan
but I feel like this year so far I've
really been just trying to use stuff
more and try more things in my
collection then really hone in on just a
few things so anyway let's just get into
it before I spoil everything I did
actually use up one item this is the
Britney Spears fantasy and this was just
a tiny little bottle I didn't have much
in it and I just kind of forced myself
to use it up in this project I feel like
my voice is cracking huh this scent is
so nostalgic for me I remember having
this a long time ago I feel like the
scent teeters on being like cheap and
also people still really like it I get
compliments on this all the time but I
feel like a lot of people wouldn't say
that if they knew as Britney Spears but
the actual sentiment people love and I
like it too it is nice
it's something I could definitely see
myself having in my collection at some
point again it's super sweet but it's
just really good it's like this classic
celebrity perfume I love it it's kind of
like rowdy around me right now so I hope
you guys can't hear anything else next
let's talk about a total fail this is my
lip gloss this is from NYX and it's the
butter gloss in Eclair there is a swatch
of it it's really pretty but I'm just
not into this type of lip color every
single day I do like it on me but I like
it with specific eye looks and it wasn't
something I could really force myself to
wear every single day so I did a
horrible job I probably use this about
six times from my intro so it's not the
worst I definitely used it more than I
would've but total fail
lip products for me are just
hardest I seriously gravitate to the
same tulip products and I'll wear those
all the time other than that I just
don't so if it's something that's a
little bit off even though this is still
like a pink it's not even something
super dark or whatever it basically has
to be those two darker new team of
colors for me to wear every day and so
since this wasn't it just didn't get
used as much and and that's just how the
cookie crumbles I will be keeping this
in my collection I do enjoy it I don't
want to get rid of it but I definitely
will not be using this up at any time I
will be throwing this away whenever I am
ready to throw it away next we'll talk
about the Glo kit I decided to put this
in here because it's the sweets Glo kit
and I thought it fit the project pan
really well obviously since this is a
bunch of highlighters there was no way I
was gonna finish one of these or even
hit pan my goal is just use this more
often than I did and I definitely did I
used this marshmallow highlighter
probably I don't even know I want to say
like a good half of the time or so I
really did tried hard to use this this
is a very light highlight so it actually
works on my skin but it has a gold
duochrome to it I'm also wearing it
today on my cheeks and I have been
wearing it in a ton of my videos lately
I do really like it it's not my absolute
favorite but it's nice the other one I
used a couple times with sassy grape
this was just a little bit harder to
work in with my different eye looks I
haven't really been going purple with my
eyes lately I've been doing more of the
warmer colors reds oranges yellows so I
just feel like this highlighter didn't
go with that but I did use it a couple
of times I don't think I took pictures
of this so I'm really sorry
but I am really happy that I was able to
get more progress out of this and I will
be like keeping this I think it's really
good I didn't even go for these last two
because they're just too dark for my
skin tone
honestly they just are even though
actually even though this one does seem
like it might be light enough when it
hits the light anyway I didn't even
branch out into those but marshmallow
was something I really was enjoying we
are under the final product I picked the
peanut butter and jelly palette from Too
Faced and I wanted to hit pan and three
of the shades I'm super disappointed
because I tried really hard especially
in banana I wanted to hit pan in the
shade so much but no matter how hard I
tried I'm telling you this pan is just
so deep I use this I mean I was going in
and packing it on my lid to try to hit
pan I felt like at least if I hit pan
and banana I'd be happy even if the
other ones I didn't but it didn't happen
jelly I got a little bit more progress
on definitely has a good dent going and
I did put a bigger dent in peanut
brittle but there is no pan so I think
the hardest part from you is that I have
my Z palette and then the companion
palette and then this palette and then I
think I also am kind of working on some
shades in the Naked palette so it's just
a lot of eyeshadow to be working on and
usually I only give myself like one
palette or one color to work on it was
just too much to be working on all of
those and actually see like pan in these
shadows
I'm not really surprised with jelly and
peanut brittle but I am really sad that
I didn't hit pan and bananas cuz I tried
so hard and honestly I'm so close I know
I have to be because I have dug into
this pan so much okay guys that's my
update for this project I wish it was a
little more successful but it was fun
than the last it wasn't a ton of time I
think I only had about a month and a
half once I got my video up so I'm
hoping that in my other projects I'll be
a little bit more successful because I
have a little bit more time if you
haven't seen any of the other projects
that I'm currently and I will leave
those link down below so you can check
those out thanks so much again to Liz
for creating this project it was really
fun and that's everything I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day thanks
so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
