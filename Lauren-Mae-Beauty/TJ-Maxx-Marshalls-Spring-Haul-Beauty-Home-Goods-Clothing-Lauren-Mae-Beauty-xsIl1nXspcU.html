Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I have a TJ Maxx and Marshalls
haul for you I honestly don't normally
shop a ton at TJ Maxx and Marshalls not
because I don't want to because my gosh
their stuff is so freaking cute I'm kind
of glad I don't go in very often because
it is so tempting everything in there it
makes you want to like redesign
everything in your house makes you want
to get like all new glasses and dishware
things you didn't care about all of a
sudden now you'd have to like revamp in
your house but we stopped in once to get
Sam some clothing and then I've got some
stuff as well and I had to do a return
so then you know I had to go back in I
got a few things so I want to share
those things with you I'm gonna start
with beauty because there's only a
couple items and then the rest are more
like home wear and that type of stuff so
it's not a massive haul by any means but
yeah I thought I would share with you
some cute things I was really excited I
went shopping yesterday and I feel like
I'm more of an online shopper so like
in-store shopping is something that's
not something I normally do it was kind
of fun to be out and you know talking to
people I helped someone else make a
decision on like what they should get it
was just it was a great time in the
t.j.maxx Oh anyway let's get into the
hall let's get into it so the first time
I went in when we were getting stuff for
Sam I did pick up to miss these are
facial sprays or tonic waters from pearl
essence I have tried this brand before I
got the coconut water spray it was like
in a bigger container with a white label
I have seen that in there since so that
one's really good I think it's like
$6.99 and I really suggest it I used it
all up I really like the bottle and
actually recycled that and put my Milani
setting mist in it so yeah that one's
really good so I thought I would try out
a couple different scents or flavors or
whatever you want to call these types so
the first one here is the aloe and
rosewater so that one just sounded
really nice and refreshing I haven't
used like a rose water setting spray in
a really long time so I thought that
that one would be nice and then I could
not pass this up because this one says
mint in bamboo and I love the smell of
mint it's super refreshing one of my
favorite like facial spray is the Kota
Lee it's just like elixir water looks
our skin elixir that one is so nice and
it has this like minty refreshing
feeling and this one
pretty similar it also has the bamboo in
it which makes it really fresh so I
picked those up and I believe they were
I think these were like $5.99 apiece so
I was a little bit disappointed that
they were in like the bigger container
for that price but obviously I still
bought them and I do enjoy them so it's
worth it and then the only other beauty
item that I picked up is a fragrance
mist this one is from the body shop and
it is Italian summer fig this called out
to me in so many ways one it's a fig
scent which those are some of my
favorites and I feel like not a lot of
brands do fig cents plus I'm going to be
doing a fig scent series video like my
coconut one so I kind of was looking
around to see if I could find any grapes
fig cents and this one caught my eye
first off this is only 399 it's in a
glass bottle and it is like a fragrance
mist in the sense that it's not mmm
super perfumey but it's so good if you
like fake fragrances I do suggest going
at this this is for the price alone
under five dollars like yes this reminds
me a lot of the Malon and gets fig
perfume because it has like this woody
under note to it it's kind of like
unisex it's not too sweet and again it
has like that like almost like a cedar
wood or something to it and I really
really like it so this was a great Buy
I'm really really happy with that I will
say so far the lasting power hasn't been
that great on it but again for the price
and just how nice it is I was just I'm
like into this one you can tell so
that's it for beauty I did pick up one
shirt the one I'm wearing right now I
picked up on the first let go I didn't
want to really show you all that because
I've already washed it and I don't know
I just I don't know I don't normally
show a ton of clothes which I don't know
if I want to maybe once I start like
actually buying more clothes because I'm
telling you I wear the same all the
time you guys see my videos like that's
my everyday life like but worse I would
like to try to put different tops on for
a video anyway I did pick up a shirt and
my inspiration for picking out clothing
was like things for Italy because I am
leaving for Italy in like two months
less than two months it's like freaking
me out and we're gonna be gone for me
and Sam we're gonna be gone for three
weeks so I wanted like cute stuff that
I'm gonna feel key
because I'm gonna take hella pictures
and I also just want to feel cute you
know like duh so anyway I picked up this
really cute top it's black which the
black base is like what I'm talking
about because I'd normally wear black or
darker colors it's just what I like it's
what I'm comfortable in it's what I feel
cute and like I love athleisure type of
style but this one I thought it was like
really fun in summary it's not too long
it has like a little ruffle I know this
isn't the best view of it but it's super
cute this is a 2x and usually I do get a
3x because I have massive boobs but this
one fit really nicely it was even a
little bit loose and I just think it'll
be so nice with like a pair of shorts or
whatever it's very very thin - which I
like so I'm just gonna wear a little bra
with it and yeah I am excited to wear
that I think it's like fun and colorful
but because it has that black face it's
still something that I think will be fun
plus I think I look cute with my hair so
I really like that this is from the
brand Grande and green and it originally
let's talk about the original price oh
yeah I was in the fitting room and I was
like what okay
the original price is $26 I got it you
guys on a very good deal for $24.99 I
seem to hold dollar and a penny why I
wish it was a better deal but I am happy
with this I've just realized - like for
me that used to be so much money like 25
dollars on a shirt and it's still pricey
for me but if I like love this item and
wear it all the time like that's so
worth it it's so worth it as long as it
doesn't like fall apart in like four
seconds it's worth it to me so I'm yeah
I'm excited to wear this
oh now on to the other things that I
thought okay this one kind of got me in
the ILO's we were checking out you guys
know how they do that they like try to
tempt you
I think if it kind of like Pan's
Labyrinth where the helpless like huge
feast set out where she's like doing I
think it's like the second thing she has
to go through where all these foods laid
out you know she's starving she wants to
eat it but like she's not supposed to
that's what the line is like your goal
is to not touch anything
while you're waiting in line to get
checked out anyway I saw this balloon
and
I just liked it I know that's looks so
weird this is from the brand sunny life
and it's a watermelon foil balloon this
retails for $7 but I've had it for four
$3.99 I just wanted this for like a
photo shoot I know that sounds so extra
and ridiculous but like I don't know
like I kind of do social media now which
is kind of freaking weird I mean my
Instagram I don't like do social media
Instagram like I'm not an Instagram
Instagram girl like I still post what I
want to and I like to keep mine still
really personal and fun and just post
what I want to but I thought this would
be so cute for like something in the
summer like going on location like a fun
little prop to bring I don't know that's
just my thought on it and I was like you
know what I'm just gonna pick it up I'm
gonna pick it up and but oh my gosh
so if you guys see a picture of me on
Instagram y'all know that I got it at
t.j.maxx yeah I'm excited I think it'll
be so cute like with like a yellow top
and jeans like that'd be cute right I
think so I think it'd be cute next I
picked up a few notebooks I feel like
this is the section that also tempts me
a lot when I go to Marshall dirty J max
I write a ton of notes and a ton of
lists it's like all I do for my videos
as well as to-do lists and like my
regular life and everything so I picked
up this cute cactus one I bought this
for $2.99 which i think is a fair price
for like a cutesy little thing my
biggest thing with this is that I want
them to be like more vertical and I love
that they have this like metal ring so
that way if I write on page like 700 or
you know 24 actually I can rip that out
without like compromising the rest of
the binder I hate when journals are like
you're screwed if you rip something out
in the middle like it just like messes
it up and I love that ring binders or
notepads don't do that and the other one
I got is a floral one super cute this
one's a little bit bigger if I have some
like beefy notes to take I can easily do
that it does have a perforated line but
I would just rip from the tops I don't
have all like little things at the top
you know what I mean super cute this one
was like a dollar more at $4.99 also I
just want to say I've got all the
stickers off the stuff without any of
the weird like where the stickers not
coming off like I knew it was my day
yesterday because I could peel the
freaking stickers off oh so you're
telling when they
but when they do it's like the stars
aligned heaven has been like we love you
keep doing your thing I only have a few
more things
these actually got at Marshall's because
where I'm at the t.j.maxx is right next
to the Marshall so I was like I'm just
gonna go in a Marshalls to LA I mean I
had such a good time at t.j.maxx like I
think we can have another good time at
Marshall so I bought these really cute
glasses when I saw them I immediately
was like I'm gonna get them and I did
think they were crystal but they're not
they're plastic they're just plastic
cups and I thought they were so cute for
like a little drink we have a set of
like crystal glasses for beverages and
that we got for our wedding but I just
thought these are so cute they're really
hard plastic I felt like they were
really nice quality I just love that
they were like tinted pink and these
were $2.99 apiece so I was really happy
with that price and they only had two or
would have picked up four but I really
like these I thought I would just show
you the other thing that I got at
Marshalls because I did only get those
two items or I don't have technically
three items but this is a pillow and
it's like a longer pillow it just takes
up the whole screen and it has all of
these really cute little cactuses on it
that's so adorable and I love the
tassels this is from the brand Isaac my
misery I whoa that's not right Isaac
Mizrahi why can't I read like I don't
understand okay anyway it's an indoor /
outdoor decorative pillow and I'm gonna
use it indoor I don't have an outdoor
space in my apartment and this
originally was 20 dollars and I got it
for $14.99 that was a little bit much
like I would have loved if this was ten
I would have like screamed in the store
but I'll take it for 15 obviously I
bought it so this is gonna go on this
really cute red chair that I have that
my mom hates she's hated it since the
moment I bought it but I love it so much
and it's like kind of old school it's
really cute it's so cute I don't know
why she's like it and I have a pillow on
there and it's just I've had it her
forever I've had it for like 4 plus
years and it just looks smaller and I
just feel like this will be fit up more
so I'm gonna switch those two out and
I'm gonna donate that pillow and I'm
going to replace it with this fun one if
you guys want to know my style for my
house it's like very mismatched
I would say
I used to shop a lot at like thrift
stores and stuff like that and I just
had a bigger space so I could like buy
knickknacks and just different things
and decorate differently and since
moving to LA I just I don't buy a bunch
of that stuff because I don't have the
space to really display things and I
just don't have the space to own
anything more like I've had to cut all
my stuff in half and anyway so a lot of
my stuff is like really vintage or like
older looking and then I like to mix
that with like fun pops of color and
bright fun patterns and I like it's just
more like a collective cluttered style
as kind of how I describe it um so yeah
I think this will go really well and I
really like it
long story long you know only two more
items and they're kind of connected so
I'm going to take all the crap out
because I was storing it in the box that
I got I feel like Marshalls is a great
way to like get some planning stuff not
planning what am I trying to say
some organizational tools and like
cutesy stuff at least in a better price
than if you were getting it like a
hundred percent retail so I am going to
like redo this space in our bedroom
where we have oh my god where we have a
desk area and basically we did it and
it's great but I don't like working in
there because I don't like working in
the room next to my own bed where else
is sleep it's like I want to have a
sleeping station and like where I rest
and then I want to have like a work so
so anyway I'm still gonna be like the
little desk area but just more cutesy
and like get doing little things and
stuff like hardcore work and like
editing and stuff so anyway um this is
one of the boxes I bought how cute is
that
this is just going to hide away all of
the crap that we don't want to be seen
but in like the cutest way ever
I believe this one was $7.99 I'm pretty
sure and then I did pick up the bigger
box so they do sit within each other
there's a fuzzy on my lip and this one
was $9.99 and then the top is like this
burlap it's like covered in a burlap
it's really cute really nice I feel like
these are like things that most of the
time I'm like ten dollars like you've
got to be kidding me I'm super cheap
guys if you guys didn't know like even I
feel like even if I have a ton of money
like I don't want to spend it
so I do think that these are great
though because they last you so long I
feel like with some of these types of
purchases I like and a little hesitant
at first I'm like oh my gosh it's almost
$20 on boxes but in the end I'm always
happy later on like two years down the
road I'm like all that box is so cute
I'm glad I bought that so yeah I'm
really excited to have these in my life
I think that they're going to be really
cute and functional which is super
awesome and exactly what I wanted so
well I hope you guys enjoyed this fun
little quirky haul and I it was really
fun for me I like showing guys the fun
things I got obviously I'm pretty
excited about them and let me know if
you want me to do more of this type of
stuff or even clothing stuff on my
channel I don't know if I looks like a
direction I want to go but I feel like
as I'm like losing weight which I'm so
happy I'm like doing really well so far
but anyway as I'm losing weight I think
that I'll be more comfortable with like
trying different clothes I'll be able to
buy more clothes because like I'll fit
my body and me and Sam are also doing a
few like things around the house or
we're planning to to make our space more
functional because it is quite small I
mean it could be smaller so like I'm
very grateful but you know we are doing
a few things to try to make it better I
want to have a different filming setup
as well in this house which is nearly
impossible because we have no space and
yeah anyway so I might be like getting
new things or different things I don't
know let me know whatever I will talk to
you guys later though thank you so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed it and
that's it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
