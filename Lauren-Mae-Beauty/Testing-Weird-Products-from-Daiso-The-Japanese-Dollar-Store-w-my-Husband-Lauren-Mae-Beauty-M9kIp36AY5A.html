Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm here with my husband Sam hey
and we are going to be doing a little
bit of a different video this is not
gonna be for everyone but we went to
Daiso today and that is a Japanese
dollar store where you can get
everything for a dollar fifty dollar
fifty store
so everything there is a dollar fifty
except for the things that aren't they
have everything about 50 except for
things that say like ten dollars or five
dollars or whatever else there is so um
we decided to pick up some items that we
thought were interesting and just test
them out and see if they work this is
just a fun video taking all the test it
Poli I don't have a cutesy name for this
we went to Daiso and this is what we
found does it work so yeah we're gonna
show you the products and we're gonna
show you testing them and then we'll
come back and give you guys the final
review of like what we think what do you
think that a good that this is the item
that sparked this entire decision
we got a lint roller which claims to
turn super dark carpet into super bright
carpet not sure how it'll do it but
we're gonna test it out and find out
this is I'm hoping so cute using on
clothes and stuff I don't even know how
high this suction power is like I feel
like for it to get anything that's where
the power is okay I'm gonna open it
right now let's just open it this is
what it looks like and oh it has a
little cap on it oh boy oh it's got
blades be cool about to put that back in
careful stop breaking it this is
expensive this actually was a dollar
fifty okay got the cap off and not
full-time so the back has battery Sam's
gonna go get them
I guess so we can just kind of do a
little test you on camera well do each
others clothes
you think that this thing is for
industrial strength to a dollar-fifty
garden ticket packages straight three
blades on it how they it's never sure
batteries are in I'm trying to put this
in without breaking it I'm taking off
the lid again little board ready alright
it sounds intense did shave with that
filling on it oh you suck it up it cuts
it up so we're gonna test this on Sam
oh wow some things are in there we need
something really dirty something just it
what they need to see it okay fun so I
don't know if you guys can see this
maybe we'll do a close-up but there is
some nasty stuff in here in my office I
won't i won't unleash the Kraken on it I
don't know what you would use this for
we don't have animals so it's kind of
hard I'm gonna do it from the Sam's back
yeah I can see little okay there's one
big hair on you and it won't suck it up
it's like too stuck to your shirt for it
together oh wow there was a thing in
there
I think it's cutting off pieces the
little dots the little like rolled-up
pieces because it's an old shirt
so yeah does it work oh yeah sure do you
does anyone need this I don't really
likes it I think for a dollar fifty and
you really want to try it I think it's a
pretty good deal do you need it for any
reason probably no definitely not let's
see when they get down on your carpet do
the entire time it was tiny little
circle
I don't really know it's weird still
weird don't know if it works we have
five items to talk about today so the
next item is a little pan and dry still
has like the cutest little things and
this is one of those cutesy little
things this is a strawberry little
frying pan why would you need this we
don't know but it says on the tag that
you can use this mini frying pan for
omelets and pancakes so I think we're
going to test this guy out we'll let you
know how it goes I think we should try
an omelet I think that'll be the easiest
just like a scrambled egg oh yeah do we
have toppings I don't really want to
cook think about it so we have the pan
I've washed it and everything and we're
going to be pouring this egg into it and
we're going to see how it works
first thing though before anything it
doesn't fit it's so tiny this thing
doesn't fit into the thing it kind of
like goes down and we have like a gas
thing so that's the first kind of
dilemma but we're gonna gonna turn I
guess sit it in there nestle it on in
there nice and uh we have it on the
absolute lowest setting I'm gonna put a
tiny bit of butter I guess so does it
stick I don't know in there alright
there we go
and I guess now I'm gonna put tea again
why this is one egg just
oh my it's perfect for one egg I think
you would do like a normal like an
overeasy egg or something not a
scrambled egg that's it an omelet you're
a oh boy
very good how am I supposed to flip it
I'm gonna try to fool oh I don't think
you should know I want to get the
strawberry shape I'm gonna let it cook
we're gonna let it cook I'm not really
sure what I'm supposed to do it said you
make omelets with it what I think this
would be better for like an overeasy egg
or something I don't really like this so
that's why we're doing the omelet
scrambled egg type of situation I just
don't get how we're supposed to turn it
over so yeah we're gonna just let this
cook this is what it looks like now oh
shoot oh gosh I'm gonna just try to let
the rest of that Cup oh but it's getting
really golden-brown isn't it look how
does the top get cooked we can't eat
that should I try to flip it sure I'm
not trying to let the juice do anything
I don't know what you do about burning
it's burning I know poor I get it down
so far this is a big old four-year-old
why would you not just make a scrambled
egg what do you think you think it looks
like in a strawberry basically this is a
big ol fail if I have to say anything
it's not a cute little strawberry maybe
a pancake would work but how would you
flip it over it's a no for me dog the
next thing we got was this which makes
your face cleanser into like a weird
phone you know how they make their own
whipped cream at Starbucks well you can
make your own facial cleansers with this
I've seen this actually like where you
can buy it but for a dollar fifty I
thought that was a good deal don't
understand why you would want to foam
your cleanser but we're gonna try it out
and see if it makes the experience any
better says it creates finer bubbles
than a foaming mess so if you're out
there using a foamy
you might you might have green beads
that's great to this all right so let's
go try that out in the bathroom
let's go so we're in the bathroom right
now it is and we are going to try this
out apply your cleanser to the surface
of the disc at the bottom of the
container with the hole for this dig in
it okay if using a solid soap scrape
across this surface pour a small amount
of water into the container hardness of
photo very watery use the line on the
inside of the container as a guide move
the stick up and down to create bubbles
we just cleaned it all off to make sure
there's nothing from the factory gonna
get on our faces and we're going to use
the Sephora music cleansing cream so
first I'm gonna place a little dab on
here just enough to make some foam with
a little water is the line as a guide
and your conscience now you just simply
put this on do that - water oh I don't
think it worked at all you got liquid
goo okay let's try it again try it again
we're gonna pour out half of this so
this time we're gonna add a little more
there we go let's try that about went on
around a little dab of water ready guys
here we go
this is not working at all what is the
point of this is it getting like a foamy
moose like it that's fine it's just a
milky subs
I write this is a bus so we give this a
negative one
thumbs down bad product the next item is
a bit controversial I wanted to put in
this video because I don't know I
thought it was just like the so weird I
don't understand why anyone would need
this but anyway people cut seizures
we're talking about the one with James
there's boobs they're fake boobs I don't
know if this is like a jokey thing or if
this is supposed to be serious I feel
like there's no way this isn't a joke
though like this is like a Spencer's
gift but like I think cartoons oh my
gosh okay these are instant boobs so I'm
opening the package I think that Sam's
gonna have to be the one to test this
out for us because it's true oh shoot so
more ways than one there's something
inside can you read the directions to us
they're naughty me wait
there aren't any directions in English
no there's pictures on the back how
about yeah it's like he's all I think
he's feeling it and then he squeezes his
boobs and then they he's really
having things are crazy um so I think
that it's easy as one two two-and-a-half
three
let's do it I think there's even little
pasties on here so are we gonna put on
the outside of your shirt or do you want
to go under the shirt perfidia
can we just go under I feel like that's
more realistic it was a blue undershirt
and oh my
do you want to change into his exact
costume for the tie I cut around his
head do you want to get dressed like him
no okay so let's just are you know do
you want to this is sticky just stick it
to your underneath your skin
stick it now underneath this game that I
need the shirt on the skin lift up your
shirt this is the creepiest one I'm
gonna not put it on your actual nipple
this isn't the worst thing this is the
funniest coolest thing yeah oh my god
alright so um as we can tell here Sam
has the boobs on and we haven't squeezed
them yet I'm kidding please squeeze them
can you please do alright instructions
this is Lauren's fault we'll put an end
is it working it's burning
no it's not actually is it burning you
guys there's like did you do it ah oh my
god is it really hurting feels it has a
chemical reaction
I think cuz there's something inside is
it burning you a little bit you know for
the sake of the video right for the
YouTube
what is it what's that it's not really
real
no it was just minding any going
everyone that I think these are
hilarious
any morning so sorry there you have it I
still hear sizzling whatever that means
Wow so there's like something in it that
when you've got it like and then it
kills it with air it basically becomes
like a balloon there are dangerous
chemicals we're not sure 50 so if you
want to go yeah let's take one off and
show what it looks like oh my gosh so
reacting so this is what it looks like
oh wow it's like freezing yeah so these
are the boobs very strange I wonder if
it's like frozen ice inside should we
pop it or do you think we'll dive yeah
what would you rate these I feel like I
can't really give a rating because I
wasn't really part of the experience
it was fun to pop it and like push it
and like you know it was kind of like a
fun experiment just kind of like a an
adult experiment even though is in the
toy section it's just a weird yeah just
a strange thing if you need this to
happen in your life then it's worth it
and if you don't you might check a
little little yeah that's pretty much
life I guess
am i glad we picked these up but because
it was to try out Sam probably will
regret this decision like it'll be on
the internet for that arrest no no I'm
not to like if you saw the people yeah
that's good
that one was really fun I had so much
fun at that and the last thing that we
picked up these are well they're out of
the packaging because they had to put
them in the freezer but they're little
it's like a fake Ice Cube's essentially
it's so you don't die what is this
some of these aren't frozen so it's said
that these okay it said that these need
to go into the freezer for two hours
which is how long they've been in the
freezer
I also wash them with dish soap like it
said to do because I didn't want to die
and so now we're gonna put them in a
drinks like they give you three of each
kind oh yeah three grapes three
strawberries and three yeah I want to
say the oranges are probably the most
flimsy like they're not very I'll take
one of each please
okay they're super cute you I've seen
these other places not sure that if you
need a cornucopia of ice it's kind of
like a fun little thing like even just
for like a picture I guess let's see
what these babies can really do we have
a can of soda here or soda water
this is room to room to hold mine I'll
hold
okay so we're gonna see if this actually
makes it cold oh it's gonna be weird to
put it yeah well yeah cover it right up
to the edges oh shoot I'm spilling okay
I've never pour it in soda before and
that's good wow it looks so pretty I
will say that like in the clear glass if
you had like a fun summer party or
something I think it'd be cool I get the
idea of these but I think it's just
really weird
alright alright Cheers I don't like
these it's cool like about cold but it's
cool I think we need to go to the
freezer a little longer yeah I think
that was not true 55 minutes so maybe
the five minutes are finish them all no
I don't think that's true I don't know I
feel like there's the barrier of the
plastic is not letting it really
activate the coldness fast enough yeah
my termite a taste
yeah I like super cold drink also I
don't know this flavor of lacrosse but I
don't know if there's any discernible oh
really flavor or smell different as well
I don't think so yeah I don't think so
it's kind of weird I don't know I think
these are work I think they're ok so
what do you give these I give a thumbs
up still I'll give a thumbs up because
they're gonna thumbs metal no I give
them a well mmm what I use these again
no probably not
but they're cute I think they're so cute
that's why I like them at a party but
that way when you're done with your
glass you just have to dump these in the
dishwasher I guess I mean in the sink
click to wash wash him yeah I just feel
like I don't know just drink your drink
fast and then you won't get problems
with the water I'm saying like ice
melting in your drink that's what I
meant but I will say my drinks pretty
cold right now oh my here you taste this
one I just put my fingers on old it's
like bath toys or something yeah first
or I give this so after testing
everything you know I think we should go
through and pick our favorite thing and
our least favorite thing what surprised
us I don't know kind of overall review
so what was your favorite thing I
honestly think that the boobs were the
thing that actually works like obviously
it's not gonna make you look like
everyone I'm saying it did really
supposed to do it was kind of fun I'm
like it was the only thing I felt like
that would maybe be worth it these were
okay - these are probably the next one's
for me and then as you guys saw the pan
a total fail it's cute they have an
Apple one too but you can do nothing
with this I should I saw this doesn't
even fit on our stove so it's just weird
I don't get hires those determinating in
here it's just a tiny hand it's just a
waste do not get this even though it's
cute you cannot create cute things with
this this is also a failure it just
sucks barely did anything it did not
make phone away the picture made it look
like you're gonna get this nice like
thick foam and you can choose
consistency of your phone depending how
much water nah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video don't know how this is gonna
head it out I thought this would just be
kind of like a fun thing to do you never
know what you're gonna get it died so
and if we prove nothing else
prove that here today anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed the video and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
