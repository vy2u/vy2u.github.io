five product face tak I believe this is
a tag video I saw it a long time ago and
they thought it would be fun to
challenge myself to do this full face of
makeup with only five products now a few
disclaimers I did not count brushes as
part of the products because let's be
honest it's just impossible but that
lace roomie so my brushes I did not
count as part of the five products and
then I also did put two pallets in here
now some people might consider that
cheating but if you can buy a product in
a pallet form I consider that one
product and that helped me make this
challenge possible so i did use it two
pallets in this video one was like a
cheek palette and one wasn't eyeshadow
palette I think pallets are a great way
for you to expand your collection and to
get the most out of your makeup with
like minimal space being used or you're
getting a better discount because you're
getting multiple items in one thing if
you like the two that i mentioned in
this video or great one is limited
edition but if you find any cheek
palette that has like a bronzer a blush
and highlight i think that would go so
far it'll look like this because you can
use them as I shadows you can use them
as face products you can use them as so
many things so I tried to be as
versatile with my products that I
possibly could so that I could you know
achieve a full face with only using five
things which usually now I use 10 to 20
products on my face anyway I'm gonna
stop rambling and we're gonna get into
the video i hope you guys enjoy and I
will see you in a second ok so I am here
with my naked face the first product i'm
going to be using is a spare minerals a
fairly light foundation it's a powder 1
i feel like this really helps my skin
just look really natural it's easy it
covers well and for one of my items I'm
not having concealer or anything like
that because I would need to set it with
a powder so instead I'm just going
straight to powder and i'll be using
that to cover my whole face I'm gonna
just be using this as a brushed by
Sephora this is just a really dense
smaller type of brush I feel like you
can really get in there and buff the
product onto my face that's why I'm
using this one
I swirl My product in the cab to work it
into the brush and then I'll be swirling
that onto my face
so that is like with basically like one
half of my face done so you can tell
that this I just looks a little more
polished it just you know not all my
imperfections are completely covered but
I just look more ready and finished like
on purpose instead of like I just woke
up late and I'm running out the door
okay so that's what I love life with
just like one layer of the foundation
puffed into my skin I am now going to go
back because there are obvious some
areas i have a huge sit on a why I chose
to this video now but I did so I'm going
to be going in with a smaller or dense
brush this one is from Real Techniques
this is the it's been rubbed off it's
kind of like a really dense fluffy kind
of concealer brush so I'm going to be
using that and just taking that product
and applying it in more specific areas
that I want more coverage and apply that
product more densely in those areas with
this foundation I believe this is like
the best coverage we're going to get so
I am going to move on to other areas of
the face the second product i'm going to
be using is this NARS virtual domination
cheek palette comes with five different
cheek products in it I'm going to be
using this bronzer to bronze up my face
this is just their classic Laguna
bronzer oops sorry I'm blending you and
then I probably want to go in with this
color right here which is deep throat by
NARS it's the blush super popular blush
so those products are going to be
putting in my on my face putting in my
face putting on my face for the bronzer
i will be using this Real Techniques
brush to do a fiber one so one of my
favorite ones to use
so that is it for bronzer I'm not going
for a super contoured look I just want
to bring some color and dimension to my
face so that's what I did with the
bronzer and now I'm going to whoa and
now i'm going to use the blush this is
the brush i'll be using this is just an
angle done from Coastal Scents you can
use any one you have and I'm just going
to blend those 20 the third product that
I'm going to be using for my face today
is going to be the naked basics now this
is gonna be used for a lot of different
areas so the first thing that I'm gonna
do is I'm going to do my brows and i
will be using this color right here
which is the color naked 2 i'm going to
be putting that on to my brows so that I
actually have browse yeah I have to go
get my brush because it's on
so those are my brows done these are
going to be a lot softer of a look just
because it is only powder that we're
using I think they look really nice
though they definitely add some
definition to my face since I do have a
lot of liner features and we are now
going to go into the eyes which we are
also going to be using this Incan
palette for so that's means a second
thing we're gonna be using it for so the
first thing I'm going to be doing is
taking a big fluffy brush like this and
I'm going to be taking this foxy color
here it's like a yellow cream color I'm
going to just be putting that all over
the lid getting it ready for shadow so
you can just be really and precise with
this next I'm going to be taking the
color walk of shame which is a cooler
cream color and I'm going to be placing
that all over my lid
now I'm going to be taking a big fluffy
blending brush and I'm going to take
that original make it to color that we
use to fill in our brows so that color
right there and I'm going to buff that
all over the crease just to get a little
bit of definition and now for a little
added definition I'm going to be taking
a slightly less fluffy a little more
tapered blending brush and I'm going to
be taking the second darkest color here
this one which is called faint and I'm
going to be keeping that in my outer
crease and outer v area I am just going
to blend that out with the brush were
using before with no additional product
just to make sure there are no harsh
lines I am now going to highlight my
brow bone using that same brush be used
for the lid and I'm going to be using
the foxy color we use at the very
beginning of this the more you'll atone
cream color and I'm going to be putting
that underneath the brow bone and then
blending it out again
I am now going to line right across my
upper lash line with this little smudge
brush with the black color from that
palette just to give my eyes a little
more definition this is supposed to be a
really simple emotion no makeup makeup
look but I still want a little more
definition on my face since I'm not
using a ton of products I'm also going
to smudge with that brush a little bit
of that darker Brown faint color
underneath the lash line just again for
more definition that's the name of the
game I'm excited as well just since I do
get the color I really wanted to
underneath my eyes I'm going to use one
of those cream colors the walk of shame
and just buff that underneath I just to
give a little bit more of a brightening
effect I know how long I was a recording
in case I don't know how much we missed
but I did go in with the Venus shade
it's the only sparkly shade in the
palette and I highlighted my inner
corner and also my cheekbone I did that
just so I could have a little bit more
glow to my skin since we are using
minimal products and just give it a
little bit Papa shimmer and then my
fourth item here i'm going to be using a
mascara I'm using the benefit roller
lash just because I have a sample of it
and I'm trying to use it up but you guys
can use anything you want pink mascara
especially for me I have blonde features
so my eyelashes are blonde when I browse
our blog I need to define those probably
the most when i'm doing minimal looks so
i'm going to be using this to make my
lashes appear disappear and make them
look full and long i like to go for a
decent volumizing mascara but then i do
like a lot of length just because i
think it just looks so flirty and girly
and that's just how I prefer my lashes
so I'm going to be using this to get
that effect
hey Savannah's what the look looks like
so far with my face son and my eyes time
for my fifth item i'm going to be using
this fun kind of burnt orange red color
from Fergie this is the color DJ doll
from those matte lip pencils I put in my
favorites video I'm going to be using
this on my lips I think when you're
doing such a very plain simple face if
you just brighten up your look with a
pop of color on the lips you can take
your look from just simple to chic and
it looks beautiful it looks like you
tried really hard that you tried to go
for that fresh face look when really
we're just trying to only use five
products here that's really the
challenge so I'm going to be using this
and putting this all over my lips and
I'll see you
alright guys so that is my five product
face I think that this look is just
simple and cute and girly it would get
you out the door fast you're using
minimal products so it's not a lot of
money and I just think it's a great look
I think this is just cute and simple and
fun so I hope you guys enjoyed this let
me know if you've done this tag below so
I can check it out just to see what
other people use and yeah definitely try
this out see if you guys can make a face
in five products that you would actually
where I think that's kind of the thing
like you can make one what you wear it
and I would definitely wear this one out
again I hope you guys enjoyed the video
and I will see you in my next one bye
