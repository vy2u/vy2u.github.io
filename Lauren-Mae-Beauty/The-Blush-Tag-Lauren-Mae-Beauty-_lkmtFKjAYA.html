Lauren today I'm back with a tag video
this is the blush tag I have seen this
been going around but it just sounds
weird to say I have seen this going
around hopefully that's right and I just
thought that I would jump in I haven't
done like a blush related video in a
long time and it's just fun to look back
through your collection and get reminded
of the things that you do love things
that maybe you don't love and just kind
of see if you can maybe narrow it down
to one one blush in each category which
is like nearly impossible I have a lot
of blushes if you want to see my blush
collection I will leave it linked down
below so I did my best to kind of come
up with one or so choices for each one
and also keep in mind that honestly a
lot of these could be interchangeable
for different questions because my
everyday blush might be my favorite
blush but I didn't want to show you the
same blush in every category so let's
get into it number one is best packaging
I decided to go with best packaging in
the sense of the way it looks so this is
the packaging I chose this is by a brand
that I cannot pronounce the name so I
will leave it down here so you can see
it this is in the shade o - the compact
itself is so beautiful it isn't metal it
is plastic so it's not like it has a
weight to it but I still really love
this there's just something classic
about this it feels pretty makeup
already feels pretty because it's makeup
and then to have it in packaging like
this it's just so beautiful I don't know
if you can tell but even the blush is
embossed or impressed with and kind of I
don't know the necklace with the faces
on it oh I don't know what those are
called so I'm sorry like a portrait
essentially so pretty this is just a
classic pink color I got this in France
when me and Sam went there we got
engaged on that trip so yeah I love this
it also makes me think of that which was
an awesome time in my life and it's just
beautiful so I will leave links for
everything down below if you want to
check out any of these blushes and yeah
this one is so pretty
number two is the prettiest color I
decided to go a little non-traditional
usually for me the prettiest color is
going to be a neutral just because even
though in the
they might look a little boring they're
just so pretty on the skin and there's
something I wear every day but I really
do like peaches and coral blushes on me
so I picked you that I feel like don't
get enough love and also ones that I
heard about before but have it now so
anyway these are my two picks for the
prettiest color the first one here is
Illamasqua lover this is such a soft
sorbet peach color it is beautiful I
love it it's one of my top 5 favorite
blushes or it was I mean I have so many
blushes it's hard seriously to narrow it
down I just feel like I don't have
anything like this I haven't really seen
a lot exactly like this the texture of
this blush is absolutely beautiful and I
love that it's matte so I just feel like
all around it's such a pretty color and
the other kind of corley type of color
is mucho mango from amazing cosmetics
this I got at Alta and I don't hear
really anything about amazing cosmetics
except for the concealer this color is a
bit deeper than that one and although it
looks really scary in the pan I feel
like it sheers out in a really nice way
again it's a matte color so I feel like
it can work with everyone I just I love
these colors I think they're so pretty
and they might look really pretty in the
pan maybe a little scary but they also
just look really great on the cheeks and
actually are still usable and wearable
although they are kind of out there
number three is most pigmented now I
decided to go with an Estee Lauder blush
that I have I got this at a CCO here in
California before we lived here it was
like I could not wait to go to a CCO and
this is the blush I picked up this is
number 24 and naughty I'm so sorry I
feel like my voice keeps cracking and
it's because I've been alone all day too
haven't talked to anyone except for you
guys and so my voice is reflecting that
anyway this is pretty intense I love
this color I think this is really pretty
as like an eyeshadow but as a blush it's
kind of crazy and this is not one of
those blushes that's like oh it looks
sheer like you know it's red it's really
red
I've never used this on my cheeks and I
just I don't know I can't get rid of it
because I do really like it it reminded
me of NARS Exhibit A and just other ones
that I had looked at but yeah definitely
my most pigmented the bets for short the
next one number four is everyday blush
these ones were starting to get a little
difficult for me because again my
everyday blush can kind of fit into
other categories like my favorite blush
and things like that but everyday blush
that I really do enjoy is one from Laura
Geller and this one's in the color
bora-bora
it's a really pretty peachy shiny color
I say really pretty all the time I'm so
sorry that's like my favorite word
pretty so pretty um anyway I think it's
really light so I feel like you could
get a big blush brush and you could do
no wrong with this basically if you're
in a hurry it's still gonna look good if
you're doing something dark it's still
gonna look good if you're doing
something light it's still gonna look
good it does have a little bit of like a
glitter into it but it's very small I
feel like it'll still look good on all
different skin types and tones maybe not
someone too too dark because it is a
little light but I just think it's so
beautiful I just love this this is
definitely one you could mindlessly pick
the side of your drawer it's gonna look
out of every look you're doing and again
it's just easy to apply in an everyday
routine
the next question is party blush um this
one's kind of hard I don't really know I
would wear only makeup any time to
basically anything except for maybe like
a funeral or potentially church or
something I don't know I have pink hair
and I just wear whatever I want so my
blushes could be for party for someone
and not for another but I just decided
to go with kind of a different blush in
my collection that has a really pretty
sheen this one is lorac Hollywood and I
do believe these are discontinued I got
these from work because we sold the last
one we had and so we didn't need it
anymore this is such a beautiful color
it's a copper bronze shade so so pretty
I think that if you wanted a similar
shade brushed copper or even rose gold
gonna be a little bit lighter but baby
brushed copper from
Bekka their highlighter I think would be
very very similar to this it's just
definitely in a different shade it has a
high Sheen to it and I definitely think
like this is like a more you know you've
maybe made your look up to fit this
blush though you're going out you're
doing something I don't know it's my
party blush next is a blush you regret
purchasing and I hate to say this but I
regret purchasing a sugar bomb from
benefit I bought this because I really
wanted a box blush I think it was the
first box blush I ever bought from them
and I don't know I really like warm
colors I just feel like this is such a
boring blush for how expensive it was I
just it's such a light color I don't
know I just I've tried using this a lot
and it's just something that I just wish
I didn't have and I wish I could have
that money back I guess it's one of the
blushes I'd be okay with like exchanging
for a different blush I've kept it
around because I did spend money on it
and it's not like the worst blush ever
it's just not one that I particularly
gravitate to over my other blushes and I
honestly just feel like I wouldn't like
to Dallas better I would have like
dandelion better what a like coralista
better I would have liked hermanas
better like I would have liked basically
every other blush they've ever come out
with over this I already have rockatuer
so that's why I didn't mention it so I
didn't need this number seven is least I
think that's what we're on yeah number
seven number seven is least used product
and I have to give it to my hourglass
blush palette trio I had two blushes
from them before I bought this I had
mood exposure and the really light pink
one and this has mood exposure and
that's the one blush I really like from
their whole line so I would have been
fine just having mood exposure and not
buying this but this one the hype got me
and it's not that these aren't beautiful
they're really beautiful but I just
don't give it enough love I don't know
what it is I think maybe because I can't
see the colors so in my collection that
just I don't know it just does not get
like any use it's so sad mood exposure I
mean I have used it but it's just
definitely one that for the price and
for just every
about it I definitely don't use nearly
as much as I should next number eight is
most used would never give up now it's
kind of hard for me to pick a most use
blush I kind of jump around and my blush
is quite a bit so I don't feel like
there's there's a couple that have quite
a bit of use but I wouldn't say there's
just a one that I just and die hard in
love with I'm also a project panner
which means that I'm really trying to
make dents in my collection so I might
be using a blush for a really really
long time like a couple months in a row
so that I can like hit pan on it or
whatever and my goal is on that blush
and so that kind of stops me from using
other blushes and although that blush
might have the most use it might not be
my favorite blush that I would never
want to give up if that makes sense so
anyway keeping that all in mind I
decided to go with my Clinique color pop
or cheek pop blushes I love these
blushes the first one I ever got when
they only had four was ginger pop I
loved this I've used I mean you can
still see the thing so it's not like
it's been dead but I love this so much
that it made me want to get a million
other shades oh I also have plum pop
which is so beautiful I have Cola pop
which is definitely a different shade
for me I want to use this as an
eyeshadow because I think it'd be
gorgeous peach pop which is very similar
to ginger pop I don't think you need
both and then definitely my most used
out of all of them is the nude pop one
and that one you can tell I've used a
ton in this one I've been using
unprompted so it's not like it's been in
a you know a project pan or you know I
haven't had any goals with this I've
just used this naturally because I love
it that much and so I definitely think
these ones are really good to me this is
more of like this is my most used but
also I just feel like out of my
collection I wouldn't want to give these
blushes up I think they would look good
on all different types of people
although they have like a sheen to them
I feel like it's not glittery it's not
too sparkly it just gives your skin like
it looks like skin on on your skin how
many times can you say skin anyway
I really like those ones number nine is
favorite blush brand now I have a lot of
Tarte blushes and although I have a lot
of them I don't think of my favorite
brand I just really like collecting them
I don't know so I wouldn't like one that
I just feel like doesn't get enough love
that I never gave enough love before and
just have decided that they're kind of
the blushes that I feel the most tempted
to buy even though I have way too many
blushes and they're laura geller I don't
know why Laura Geller does not get
enough love I'm telling you this one
here is the sugar-free blush and
brighten and boysenberry this is so
beautiful it is a cool Mavi color
I think people stray away from baked
products I know I do but these ones are
so nice and I just really like them this
is a great like matte natural color for
every day it could also be like more of
a fall color depending on what you like
I've already showed you Bora Bora again
I mean I hit pan on this one this one
was in a project and that's how I
discovered my love but I love this and
then the other blush I have is kind of
crazy it's blush and brighten and
sun-swept
it is so sugary it's kind of insane but
I just I love them and I really would
like to expand my collection if I see
another like big value set because I
feel like that's the best way to buy her
products are in like value sets just
because you save so much money compared
to buying them separate but I just think
they're so good I think that I just
really like him I really like them and I
would consider that my favorite blush
brand especially at the moment number
what number my own number ten greatest
blush discovery of last year no I know
I've talked about laura geller ones and
I really like those but to name
something different I really really love
this blush from Tarina Tarantino there's
a hair this one is in Neapolitan Lane
and this is such a beautiful everyday
tart exposed type of color I love this
the quality of this I just feel like
this one is better than tarts exposed
though because although I mean I'm not
hating on tarts blushes but they get
hard pan they do I feel like sometimes I
can't get my blush brush to pick up
product specifically though in tarts
exposed for me so this one has a great
formula I
have that problem it picks up product
great and it's just so nice I just I
never have tried these before I don't
know if these are discontinued I did get
them on sale from a beauty store friends
here in California I'm not sure if you
can still get this if I can find a link
to it I'll have it linked down below but
I love this this is like I just love it
it's one of my top favorite blushes ever
I would not want to live without this
blush I love it that much
11 most practical now I tried to go with
most practical in so many ways so for my
pick I decided to pick Milan E's Rose
blush and romantic rose now everything
about this blush is practical except for
the packaging which is like the best
thing ever the packaging is beautiful I
absolutely love it and they even had it
look like a rose mine looks deformed
because I've used it so much but this
color is so beautiful it's an everyday
color one of those ones again that can
go with any look you're doing it's easy
to apply it's not overly pigmented but
it's not too sheer it's just perfect
it's from the drugstore so it's cheap
and inexpensive but still great quality
and it's also matte so it's gonna go
with any type of skin tone or texture if
you have a lot of pores or wrinkles you
can still use this blush it's still
gonna look great I just think if you
were to have like one blush in your
collection this one is the one you
should get because of how practical it
is in so many ways but it's still so
beautiful and great I love it and from
that question we go on to least
practical I chose a liquid blush and I
don't have any cream or liquid blushes
except for this one and the reason it's
the least practical is just because I
don't usually gravitate to this type of
product this one specifically is
steelo's of rose water and it's
beautiful do not get me wrong I think
the finish on the skin is so dewy and
beautiful it's so sheer but in the
perfect way it's just unpractical for me
to have it in the sunset I mean I'm
barely gonna get use out of this this is
a perfect one for my kit because I find
that I use cream and liquid products way
more often in my kit because the makeup
I'm doing needs to look way more natural
for camera and so it just they work
better and also I'm doing you know
different people than my own age and
skin type so maybe someones more dry and
they need
that luminosity or if someone's has more
mature skin sometimes creams just look
better and more natural on the skin
again for camera and HD films so for my
own personal use that one is just the
least practical for what I like and what
I do every day number thirteen most
expensive now this is kind of hard I
feel like a lot of my blushes are
high-end I've been collecting makeup a
long time and as I declutter I just get
rid of stuff and for the most part
high-end stuff is just better quality so
if I have stuff and I'm weeding stuff
out I'm gonna get rid of the least not
as good of quality obviously that's not
everyone so anyway it's been hard to
find the most expensive because I feel
like they're all pretty similar in price
I don't have anything like designer
really I don't and anyway I found this
blush on hope look and this is the Yves
pearl blush trio and it is in the sweet
cheeks
light this blush I think was still
twenty-something dollars and I believe
it was half off
it was crazy expensive especially
considering I don't really know that
much about each pearl I mean I know they
have like some concealers I bought a
primer on there too and I had a pencil
I'm just saying it's not like it's in
Sephora and being hyped about a ton on
YouTube so for me to like fork over that
much money and then on top of it that's
not even the retail price that's like
the really amazing deal I got on it I
just when I look at my collection I this
one sticks out to me is like dying that
was expensive I really do enjoy this
blush it's not a must-have it's very
neutral and I have a lot of other
neutral blushes but I mean it's really
good quality and stuff but it just was
expensive this is an expensive and my
last blush for least expensive sadly I
do think these are discontinued now and
I'm sorry but this is probably my least
expensive blush this is from Rimmel and
it's the color Santa rose I remember
when Tanya burr was like raving about
this color and loved it so much and it
is a really pretty color it looks like
nothing and it barely shows up in a
swatch but on the cheeks it does just
give you a tiny bit of definite
a little bit of color nothing too much
and for the drugstore these were some of
my favorite blushes that they had and it
said that they discontinued them because
they don't feel like they've replaced it
with anything at least Rimmel has
replaced it with anything you know as
comparable but this would be probably my
least expensive because I believe these
were like under $5 ok guys I hope you
enjoyed the blush tack I feel like my
answers although some of them like
polanyi's Rose blush and some of those
are normal and you've seen them in in
the blush tag I feel like I have some
different picks I don't buy a ton of new
makeup so I'm not just mentioning the
hottest newest things because I'm really
trying to just love the collection I've
already built up and so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this maybe you got to
know a couple of blushes you've never
seen before or that maybe you want to
try out now again it'll have links down
below I tag anyone who wants to do this
to do it I don't usually tag specific
people because I just want everyone to
feel like they can do it you don't have
to be tagged I don't think I was tagged
I just wanted to do it anyway I hope you
have a wonderful day guys I will see you
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
