Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
top if you guys don't know what this
series is I started this to kind of have
a place where we can talk about
different things in the beauty community
different things relating to YouTube I
have a whole playlist I'm gonna link
that down below so you guys can check it
out I'll also link individual videos so
if you have a specific topic and you
want to see if I have covered it you can
check that out as well I want this to be
a place where we could just have open
discussion I try to be fair like my
biggest goal with this is just to have
like an actual discussion I'm not trying
to like preach to you guys I'm letting
you guys know the things that I weigh
when I think about these topics and I
love hearing your guys's comments down
below so definitely leave your opinions
in the comments if you have thoughts
either way but let's just get into this
one today we're gonna be talking about
kind of like the whole dilemma of
limited edition makeup I've talked about
limited edition makeup I feel like in a
lot of different videos it's not like a
new topic for my channel but I want to
talk about it in a bunch of different
facets
I was actually requested to do a video
about limited edition products and when
Beauty garrow's declutter them and how
they'll say oh I really love this I use
it all the time but it's limited edition
and you guys can't get it so I'm gonna
get rid of it and that was kind of the
inspiration for this whole video at
large so thank you so much for the
requests I appreciate it if you guys
have any other requests of course leave
them in the comments I mean I think we
all know what limited edition makeup is
this is makeup that comes out from a
brand that is not going to be in stock
for forever it is coming out for a
limited run whether that's for the
season or it's a collaboration with
something but you only have a limited
amount of time to get that item before
they're going to stop selling it or once
they sell out they're not going to be
promote it or reproduce it I think we
can all agree that as of lately in the
beauty community I would say in the last
couple of years
limited edition releases have gone crazy
I mean that's a lot of what brands are
releasing they're always coming out with
new stuff and I feel like more than not
they're doing things that are limited
and not necessarily permanent items and
it can be a bit overwhelming especially
because every brand is doing it and some
brands are doing it more than others I
would say colour-pop to me is someone
that comes out with just so much
limited-edition stuff they're always
having a new release all the time a new
collection I feel like Mac used to do
this they don't do it as much but they
definitely still come out with so much
limited edition stuff who else do I
think about
like tart always has limited edition
like face palettes and cheek palettes at
all look the same
two-faced has a ton of this type of
stuff there's so many brands have these
like collections that are constantly
coming out I feel like the overall
consensus at least with my audience is
that it's just too much and I definitely
agree with that I think that it's just a
lot of makeup it's just a lot especially
when you consider how long it takes up
to use makeup and I get that people are
collectors and want to you know have fun
and have multiple items in their
collection and have options but there
becomes a limit to that where it's like
okay I have 50 highlighters like
literally I don't right now but when you
look at your collection you're like oh
my gosh I have 50 highlighters how did
this happen it's because of these
constant releases and a lot of times I
feel like limited edition products I
think that one of the big reasons that
we fall into the hype of limited edition
is because of FOMO I'm gonna leave LSE's
video on FOMO link down below because I
thought it was really good it's all
about just like how basically you can
like stop having FOMO just like all
about FOMO which again is fear of
missing out and that's a limited edition
products due to you they make you feel
like oh my gosh I better get this now or
they might not have it anymore I might
not have it anymore and so it compels
you to buy it even if you might not have
bought it if you knew it was permanent
and it's definitely a marketing strategy
and I think it definitely works I know
that a lot of the times if it's a brand
and a product Daniel I really want and
it's gonna be limited edition some
brands come out with stuff and they
really do it sells out and it's gone and
so you're like crap I want to get on the
website I want to make sure I buy it as
soon as it releases and it kind of
creates this like frenzy around the
product and then there's more hype and
then even more people want it and even
more people feel like they're missing
out if they don't get it and it's
definitely a very successful and
strategic marketing technique that I
think has worked really well on the
beauty community and I do want to point
out that like as a brand I get it
I don't even hate limited-edition
collections too much like I hate the
constant releasing of products I think
that you know brands should come out
with like a good eye shadow formula and
then like keep it for a little bit I
don't know why we're reformulating
things all the time I don't know why
we're constantly having new bronzers
come out like don't charity half
bronzers like I don't know it just seems
like a lot like brands are just
constantly reinventing the same products
just to continue to drive sales once
again I get but I really wish that the
limited-edition collections that we're
coming out we're just more thought-out
and more specialized and inspired
I feel like two-face is an example of
collections that are a bit more
thought-out like the peach collection
everything's themed and it's like fun
and the packaging is fun it's a little
over the top for me and not necessarily
my thing and I know a lot of people are
like over it there over the unicorn's
which I don't know man I'll link down
with the unicorn I don't know like I
don't eat it on a bag but like I love
some holographic iridescent stuff like
I'm down with this I'm not over it but
like that whole unicorn collection is
definitely like you know a lot but they
just come out with so many products it's
like just come out with a couple of
things it's okay you don't need like a
whole range of stuff and that's more my
thing like I just wish it was like
seasonal or like you know every couple
of months maybe something came out but I
feel like with some of these brands it's
not every couple of months it's every
couple of weeks like every three weeks
there's a new product leaking or
launching or teasing or something it's
just like crazy how much stuff is coming
out if you were to buy all the stuff
coming out from just one brand that
would already be an insane amount of
money so think about all the different
brands that are out there it's crazy how
much money is being spent on makeup and
not all of that is limited-edition I
will say some of it is permanent product
some of it is limited-edition I feel
like with eyeshadows a lot of the time
it's like limited-edition palettes I
just think that it's getting more rare
for things to be permanent it's
definitely more about the
limited-edition kind of like fast
turnover of products where they can type
something up hype something up sell out
move on to the next thing really really
fast and for me one of the biggest
gripes that I have with that is that I
feel like the quality of some of those
products tends to be lessened because
it's not something that's going to be in
their line
I definitely see this with holiday
releases I think we all are like a
little bit wary at this point especially
like hardcore makeup lovers where it's
like oh you're not pulling it over on me
I know that that pellets not as good as
your normal pallets or your more
permanent palettes holiday is a time
where like things are mass-produced
they're sent over different places so
that they can have enough stock for you
know the majority of people who are
gonna buy which aren't always going to
be makeup lovers and then the other
thing I kind of have a problem with as
well is when things are labeled as
limited-edition
just to promote the sale of these items
but they constantly come back into stock
they decide to like oh we're actually
gonna reap remote it for this limited
amount of time and it just kind of
cheapens it it's like is it limited
edition or is it not like part of the
reason people want to buy it if it's
limited edition is because they are like
oh I can't get it any other time so I
better get it and so when all these
people bought it and then later on they
can buy it you know it didn't have to
have all the rush and could have seen
more reviews obviously that's all in the
buyer it's all them who is actually
making these choices but I'm just saying
as a brand I just feel like it's like
kind of messed up to say one thing and
then do another thing just to get
people's money I do think that there are
instances where they've made a release
of something and then it sells out so
much and goes crazy kind of like the
Queen of Hearts palette and then they're
like oh crap didn't know so many people
were gonna like this so then they make
it permanent or like the Natasha gent on
a sunset palette that was limited but
then she decided to bring it permanent
and I think those are genuinely a
situation where they didn't realize
there was gonna be so much demand for
the product but I think that there are
some cases where they're holding off on
stock and kind of testing their audience
seeing how much they can sell how much
more they can hype it up and do another
release and I think that's a little lame
like that's kind of lame guys moving on
from that I think that another topic I
want to touch on when it comes to I'll
get me on my golf cold in my apartment
another thing I wanted to talk about
though when it comes to limited edition
it's kind of where that suggestion came
from where we're talking about
specifically YouTube now and how so much
is hyped up on YouTube and we've talked
about first-impression reviews only that
you only down below it's always on to
the next thing here on YouTube it's like
people talk about a product and then
they do a review our first impression on
it and then it's on to the next item and
it never gets touched it never gets used
again and the whole point of the reviews
and the first impressions is to show
your audience what these products are
and you know maybe help them make a more
informed decision on whether they want
that item or whether they don't and so
you know I personally don't like to be
super like sales person II like that's
not how I really want my channel to go
but some channels are more like hey you
should buy this you shouldn't buy this
or more review based or whatever it is
and I think that's great but what kind
of ties in with these limited edition
releases is that you know if the
audience or your audience goes and buys
these products and then the youtuber
doesn't want to use those items anymore
because you can't get them anymore
and that's kind of where that comment
came in where when you see people
declutter in their makeup they'll be
talking about a product that maybe they
gave a really positive review to told
you that it's really good that you
should buy it you'll really enjoy it if
you like this this and this you went out
and bought it and you're so excited and
you can't wait to use it with them and
do tutorials and like watch what they've
done with it and get inspired and they
end up never touching it they probably
only used it one or two or three times
after that and so then they want to
declutter it and now no one wants to use
this palette that you spent money on and
and something that made me really
realize this honestly I did a video
called makeup that went missing I'll
leave that linked as well and it was
just talking about products that I feel
like we're really hyped up or that I you
know heard a lot about and now a year
later no one talks about them no one
brings them up they weren't necessarily
in yearly favorites like I just feel
like I heard a big boom about them and
then it just went away fizzled into
nothing and one of the palettes that I
mentioned in there was the Too Faced
natural love palette and I figured no
one bought this palette because it
wasn't really something I wanted like
there was a part of me that wanted it
because it's just like neutrals and big
and something different for Too Faced
but overall I was like no it's neutrals
and I definitely have all the shadows I
don't need this palette especially for
this fifty something dollars it was
gonna cost the amount of comments in
that video that people said oh I got
that palette and they either said they
love it and use it all the time or they
said they
we use it I was just surprised at the
sheer amount of people who bought it and
that makes me realize that like the
people on YouTube after making videos
like especially like bigger channels
where this is their main job they get a
ton of PR you know they are just so
different than the average user of
makeup even people who love to watch
them and love to like see the new
releases you know so many people at home
in their collections have these pallets
that the bigger youtubers don't want to
even use anymore because people can't
get it anymore as a youtuber she's
always so weird to say I will say that
it does sometimes suck when you're like
doing a tutorial or you're doing a
whatever look and you're saying that you
love this product or you think it's
really good and it's limited edition
where it's discontinued and you know
your audience can't get it it does suck
because so many people will be like oh
where can I get it or you know you do
get comments saying like oh I wish I
could get that or I wish I was a limited
edition and so it's kind of like you
have to pick a side like do I keep this
item and use it and show it on my
channel because I do truly love it and
then there's a lot of comment saying oh
I can't get it but then the people that
do have it can use it or do you get rid
of it and then the people that do have
it just won't get to see you use it it's
kind of like this mix I'm telling you
guys the comments section can definitely
be a place that messes you up I love
when you guys leave comments and like
especially in this video series but
sometimes comments can like be
disorienting because you have someone
telling you this and you have someone
telling you that and it's just a lot of
information to take in even if it's just
constructive criticism it's coming from
so many different angles it's hard to
know who to listen to and what to make a
decision so you kind of just have to
like look into yourself maybe ask
someone who's around you or maybe other
people who know more about the business
of YouTube or like what you're doing and
ask them for some opinions and then you
got to just kind of make a decision on
my channel i use discontinued and
limited edition products all the time
one because I do like to project pan and
like I like to use up my makeup and if I
bought something or if I have something
unless I just find that it's not working
for me anymore I don't enjoy it then I'm
gonna pass it on I don't really get rid
of things that are super discontinued or
super limited edition unless it's like
they're starting to get older or
I'm not in love with them like I used to
but I know there are a lot of people who
will you know get something review it
make the video and then when they do go
into clutter later on or like oh you
can't get this anymore so I'm gonna get
rid of it there's no use talking about
it anyway and I think that really does
show the disconnect between the youtuber
and the people who watch YouTube and the
actual like makeup consumers out there
cuz it's so different you know like I
said though I can definitely see both
sides I think it's like an individual
choice of the channel what you want
you're kind of like mission statement as
a channel to be and if it is more about
just like reviewing the next new thing
and giving people information and that's
how you want to structure it I get it
like that's their choice but it's
definitely very interesting and I think
it definitely does kind of promote some
of the continuation of buying and buying
and getting the next new thing
especially if you want to be using the
exact same products that people are
using currently I mean it's constantly
updating and changing it's crazy but
anyway I think that's a lot to say I'm
not gonna lie there's a part of me that
loves limited-edition stuff there's a
part of me that loves seeing new
collections and new releases I want to
bring up one more point too is it's like
one of the brands that I really enjoy is
makeup geek but I will say that I feel
like they don't have that many products
lately like I don't know they just kind
of fallen off I don't really hear anyone
talk about them I mentioned them a lot
for my single shadows videos and stuff
but I haven't purchased anything from
them in a long time and I think that if
they did more limited edition stuff or
just came out with more frequent
releases they would be more buzzed about
and talked about but I think because
they don't because it's not as many and
I feel like the ones that they have had
haven't been like very well received if
they had put out maybe different quality
products or different things but also
just more of it I think they would be
more in the mainstream more talked about
and that's part of it like brands are
chasing things we're driving it we look
at the trend mood Instagram and we want
to see all the new releases and we're
part of that so I think that if you
really want to see a change in that you
have to change it with your money I mean
that's what it is they are going to
continue to do what makes money and you
can tell the brands that constantly come
out well stuff are constantly in the
news they're constantly being featured
on channels are constantly being you
know shown on Instagram and tagged and
tweeted at and all
that stuff so it works like there's a
reason they're doing it it works but
anyway I'd love to hear your guys
thoughts on limited edition products
down below do you like them do you not
is it overwhelming also how do you feel
about using limited edition products if
you are a creator do you use them do you
not use them and as someone who watches
YouTube do you like seeing a limited
edition or like old school products
being used that maybe you can't get
anymore or would you rather it be things
that everyone can get at the time of
that video
alright that's everything if you have
any topics of course leave them down
below and I will see you in my next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
