with a hike to our car all those things
we live in LA so it's hard to find
parking and luckily Sam's nice enough to
give me the spot well he good and
scavenges for a spot so all day today
I'm gonna be going like that because my
lipstick so hopefully they'll be no
right on my teeth we'll see I hope this
isn't more shaky guys but I thought I
would lay out what we're doing for the
day Sam is driving so no worries I'm not
just ghosting it here we're going to a
pumpkin patch today but first we are
gonna be going to the Harry laughing
we're gonna go to the pumpkin patch and
that's in Temecula so that's like two
hours away but on the way but not really
is the loop and I went to the loop when
my mom was here and I really liked it if
you guys don't follow the loop on
Instagram do it I'm literally telling
you to follow like a food place but it's
awesome and it'll make you want a churro
so bad anyway we're gonna go there and
get a churro and a coffee cuz the
coffee's like the best I'm sorry we have
directions we just don't know where
we're going automatically
what
a salute not nothing on TV I'll cry on
the hook I'm gonna check and make sure
that the loop is actually open huh
fingers crossed guys okay update we
checked the lips Instagram they are open
at 12:00 so we're gonna get breakfast
first and then go eat there I know that
sounds crazy we will check in when we
get there and show you oh my god
we just crash it's just like crazy and
delicious this is mine it's super clean
more food and then pumpkin patches corn
maize very good really good crazy I
think they were good five six months
each get chorizo potato egg bacon and if
your machine just bacon and again and
I'll say like a 4.25 okay so that's the
loop and I am not the only one waiting
outside oh gosh my fingers are in it
there's a whole line outside we're not
the only ones I'm not the only one that
likes it I'm not crazy I am crazy but
look these people they're probably
getting out to get in line oh she's
working at the loop she's been asserting
with our own about for a second
yeah she's late she needs to get in
there it is 12 o'clock and we want these
churros now we're inside the loop right
now I'm so excited because I love this
place

in because I'm thinking to myself okay
so the coffee they just call my name
okay so I'll save the churro - this is
the churro pretty delicious oh there's
no good

but they're not so it's so good I'm so
happy oh yeah so anyway if we're gonna
enjoy that honor

distract by the traffic in here we got
the coffee and we are on the way to the
