Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna be doing the makeup
aesthetic tag and I'm really excited to
do this this was an original tag created
by LS and I will leave her video link
down below as well as her channel I
really enjoyed this video it's so
interesting to see people's inspirations
and their taste especially with someone
like Elle because she is such a unique
style and just such creative looks that
she does on her channel so if you
haven't checked her out I highly highly
suggested she is awesome I think a
couple other people have already done
the tag because it has been a while it
just took me a while to get to it so
what I'm uploading this if I can find
some other people I will leave there's a
link down below too if you want to run
through a couple different people's
answers to these questions so let's just
get into the tag the first question is
how would you describe your personal
aesthetic or style when it comes to
makeup and I will say something that I'm
like a little intimidated by is that I
feel like Elle has done her research
she's super inspired by like decades and
people and different artists and I feel
like I'm not necessarily inspired by
something so specific so it's not like I
have a specific time period in mind that
like really inspires my aesthetic or
style for me I would say that I'm really
into like clean fresh skin I love color
but I love doing it kind of wearable and
like just interesting pops of color and
interesting color combinations and
finishes I usually like a softer look in
general so I usually don't have super
harsh eyeliner I'm drawn to like
blown-out looks like blush like all over
the cheeks and into the eyes things that
are more ethereal I guess which is
definitely a part of Elle's style too
but I definitely love like those duo
chromes and just soft angel make up
fairy makeup glitter things like that
and not as much like really angular
lines and I'm really precise work I like
more of a blended out type of situation
hopefully that answers that question
number two who or what has influenced
your style choices I don't know like
it's not that no one influences me
because that's not true I take like so
much inspiration from so many people I
see but I also feel like I just take
inspiration from color and texture out
in nature and I feel like I've just kind
of developed my own personal style when
it comes to
I make up specifically I think that's
more what I'm known for
what I'm known for what does that even
mean but you know like what I am into
and what my personal preference is like
my favorite part of my makeup is my eye
makeup and doing like colorful eye
shadow looks and I just think over time
I've learned how to work with my own eye
shape and I've decided that I don't have
to have eyeliner just because it exists
like it doesn't have to be in every
single look and so yeah I don't think
there's like a specific person but I
will say that like color and texture in
nature and just doing things and being
out in the world and participating in
the world constantly inspires me to
think of new color combinations and
placement and whatnot all right number
three what are some of your previous
makeup phases so I would say that I
wasn't someone who loved makeup always
like I did I had like an emo phase emo
like wanna be emo where I loved
Hawthorne Heights is my favorite band
I had black bangs and I had black
underneath my hair if I can find videos
I will put it up it's funny because I
don't think of myself as super
alternative but I guess I do have like
pink hair I like forget that's not
normal but I loved basically black
eyeliner and I never did my eyebrows I
didn't have eyebrows and tell into
college so even in high school I didn't
have eyebrows and high school is pretty
basic like I did a tiny bit of
foundation but not too too much and then
I would do like a bronzy color on the
eye and that's really it like a little
bit of eyeliner I used gray eyeliner a
lot but I do have like specific phases
because honestly I wasn't crazy into
makeup and tell into college I found
YouTube and that's what sparked
everything for me and you know now I'm
in LA being a makeup artist and stuff so
yeah I don't really have to too many
phases it was kind of just like normal
and then all in you know
number four what combination of existing
brands would make up your perfect brand
and if you guys didn't know I want to
start my own makeup brand that's my
ultimate goal like that's part of the
reason I went to makeup school was to
just learn about products and learn
about what makeup artists need and all
of that so I don't like to talk too much
about it because obviously I want it to
be a thing and I don't want it to be
everywhere before I make it but I would
definitely say
like something like colour-pop ish mixed
with the fun of like urban decay and
glossier and milk makeup and then just
kind of in melt cosmetics like if all of
those had a baby that would be like my
dream brand I'm gonna leave that there
and we'll move on to the next question
next is number five name five products
that define your makeup style right now
okay so I have five products here the
first one are liquid eyeshadows or just
like cream eyeshadows in this type of
form specifically I really do like the
color pop supernova ones because they're
affordable and just so beautiful so I
have the shade over again I love this
one and then I also have the shade Lucky
Penny and if you haven't picked these up
and you were interested in them I highly
suggest them here's a few swatches
they're so easy to add such a fun pop of
like glitter and sparkle to the eye and
you don't get everything all messy so I
just love these I've been trying them
from a ton of different brands if a
brand comes out with these like I want
to try them next I think it would be a
crime honestly if I didn't mention pink
eyeshadow I'm wearing pink today I made
sure that I was wearing something that's
definitely my aesthetic on my eyes today
and this is from colour-pop I love the
pink in the Urban Decay electric palette
like that's my all-time favorite but
this one is still really nice as well I
will leave it on the screen here because
they don't have a magnet to get it out
at the moment but I just love pink I
love pink anything really honestly it's
so pretty I think that pink should be
incorporated into more looks I think a
lot of people stray away from it and
it's so fun it's so me yeah I love I
love pink but specifically eye shadow
like I'm not necessarily wearing pink
lips all the time I love I shadow up
here you know the the pink eyebrow type
of situation next I'm gonna put in a
bronzer because I just I love bronzing
it's one of my favorite steps in my
routine I love adding that dimension and
life and like sunkissed glow back to my
skin after I've evened it out with
foundation and my favorite one is the
butter bronzer this is just such a great
bronzer I've gone through two of them
I've repurchased multiple multiple times
like four times so yeah I love
love-love-love I think I'm gonna
actually talk about six things because I
can't follow directions but next I have
a setting spray and this is something
new to my makeup phases I guess I never
really used these before but this one
specifically from Too Faced is just one
of my all-time favorites I love it so
much and it's the hangover RX 3 and 1
replenishing primer and setting spray I
don't use it as a primer but I love the
way this makes the skin look after
you've finished everything you've done
your finishing powder you've done all of
your makeup you spray this on and you
just look so refreshed and so nice like
your skin just looks good your
highlights pop in I love the smell and
just the experience of it so this is
something that's like new to my routine
and definitely feels like a new phase of
my makeup life and kind of similarly to
that I have loose powders here
specifically I have the Too Faced peach
perfect one but just in general I am in
the phase of loose powders currently and
that is so different than most of my
makeup
life and career like I always use
pressed powders before and right now I'm
just into again that fresh skin look and
I find the best way to get that and to
not have too much like caking and too
much coverage from your powder is to
have a loose powder
I love the AO a studio one that one is
so inexpensive and just looks invisible
on the skin but gives you a nice like
soft matte look like you don't look just
like matte and cakey and dry and like
someone wants to throw water on your
face it just looks beautiful so just in
general again I'm in the phase of loose
powders I love them I want to try a
million of them I just can finally
appreciate what they do and how
different they are from pressed powders
and I love them and last I want to talk
about some easy lip products I am
someone who does not want a liquid
lipstick I want to be comfortable I want
to be like I want to have like naked
lips but I want them to still look good
some of my favorite products are just
like lip glosses or just like easy lip
cream type products this is my favorite
one at the moment so this is the one I
probably should just be showing but this
is the Revlon kiss plumping lip cream I
know I'm talking about it a ton but
honestly it's my favorite it's what I'm
wearing right now it does plump the lips
it has a little bit of a minty feel it's
so comfortable it wears off really
gracefully which I
can appreciate and it's easy to apply I
just I love it and then I wanted to
mention a gloss this one's from
bareMinerals it's the Gen nude gloss in
sugar and again just beautiful it adds
the perfect amount of pigmentation
without adding too much but in general I
do really love glosses that are like not
too sticky not too pigmented those are
my favorites so yeah just in general
easy lips glossy lips plumping lips
nothing too dry and matte and long
wearing I don't like that and I just
realized I had the white ring on my lips
because I've been talking way too much
today because I'm filming way too many
freaking videos so don't mind that that
normally does not happen with that
product of course while I'm raving about
it number six what kind of style or
aesthetic do you wish you could pull off
I think for me I'm really jealous of
people who can pull off really dark
looks I'm so fair and so the contrast of
dark looks it's just a definite
statement and I feel like other people
can use darker colors and it doesn't
look so out of place or so like holy
 you're wearing a ton of makeup and
I feel like on me that's just the way it
looks because of how fair I am I also
have really tiny eyes I have hooded
eyelids so I wish that I could pull off
more like cut creases and spotlights and
all of that I just don't have a ton of
lid space to play with I've been kind of
delving into cut creases lately and that
has been more fun so I think that
there's a way to make different
techniques work and kind of mold them to
each eye shape but I wish that I just
had these big ol eyelids that just
showed everything and like look so good
it could really show off the work I put
into eyeshadow but I sadly just don't
have that much space but I'm not
complaining too much I do like my eye
shape it's just I wish that they were
just bigger and I could put black on the
waterline and it didn't make them look
like little beads you know but I have
other things so I can't complain number
seven what style are you over for this
in general I'm just over just really
heavy makeup
I know it's still super trendy I'm not
trying to put anyone down who loves it
if that's your style that's amazing I'm
happy for you like live your life girl
but I think social media has sometimes
forgotten that like that's not
everyone's everyday
and some people it is like some people
do their makeup like that every day and
that's amazing but there's just other
ways to wear foundation than crazy full
coverage there's other ways there are
other benefits to wearing things in
different ways and I just wish people
would switch it up more like Bofill glam
one day go more like glossier the next
day go more in the middle a different
day like I just wish we saw different
things but I feel like it's like if it's
not full coverage foundation then it's
not good if you don't have black liquid
liner on and a wing it's not good warez
it's like you can still wear liner and
not wing it out like it's possible I
know it doesn't seem like it but yeah
that could happen I think just opening
people's makeup horizons because I think
it's just kind of stuck in one look
right now same with like to all the
matte stuff like matte face matte
foundation matte lips and I think we are
definitely like kind of swinging away
from it and that's how trends are but
I'm definitely ready for just plump and
you know really complementing the skin
instead of covering it I think I cannot
wait for that to come back into style we
can do it guys we can do it that's what
I'm hoping anyway alright number eight
who are some of your favorite makeup
artists and this is somewhere where I
feel kind of guilty because I'm not
someone who really knows a ton of makeup
artists I'm not like inspired by a ton
of like really prominent makeup artists
in the business and I just it I just
don't know about them it they're not how
I found makeup they're not how I got
into makeup it was from youtubers it was
from social media and so I just don't
have as much of a history um with that
when I think of makeup artist I've
talked about this before in a QA but I
think a lot of the times of like special
effects makeup artist those are who I
really respect because special effects
is something that I can do and I went to
school for and so I can do it but I I
don't feel like I'm the best at it and I
just can appreciate someone who can make
a realistic frickin bruise or a really
realistic swollen eye when I think of
like old school people I think of lon
chaney
I think of like Max Factor and those are
people that really inspire me because
they were doing makeup when there wasn't
any techniques there were no products
they were creating techniques and
products and so I guess I would say
those people
it comes to like people in the industry
next I would probably talk about Natasha
gin Nona I mean when I look at her
Instagram and the looks that she creates
with her palettes I think they're
beautiful a lot of them are my aesthetic
with the really blown out like just
beautiful lids she's not afraid of color
and I love that and then just in general
I feel like there are so many amazing
social media makeup artists like
especially on Instagram that I love the
looks I love Lee Dixon she does a lot of
like simple really aesthetically
pleasing looks a lot of wings I just
love her style sometimes her makeup
looks really simple but I know that it
took a long time to create that perfect
edge in that perfect wing I really loved
Alyssa Marie artistry on Instagram she
just has some beautiful eye looks as
well
she works for a Nastasia I feel like Kat
Von D's collected like beauty team that
she put together all of them are amazing
makeup artists and they inspire me
because they use color and they do
unconventional things but they also do
beauty looks like they just have a nice
mix they're inspired those are people
that really inspire me to in the makeup
world number 9 do you have any favorite
editorial or avant-garde makeup looks
and I don't have like specific pictures
like L mentioned specific pictures that
she takes inspiration from and I think
that's so cool for me there's nothing
that like sticks in my head where I'm
like that makeup look but in general I
love just looking at editorial makeup I
really love the look of like glossy lids
and glossy skin and glossy lips when it
comes to editorial it's not something
that I feel like I can pull off let me
tell you there's something about models
my goodness they're just beautiful they
come in you barely do anything to them
and they just look freaking gorgeous and
so I just love looking at those pictures
I love looking at just raw skin and
freckles and really just like natural
brows that have been like brushed up and
just look bushy and beautiful I love
monochromatic looks I love things that
are simple like one color blend it out
all over the eye into the brow into the
like the side of the hairline stuff like
that it's kind of my aesthetic again
just like very almost simple but still
something just so beautiful about it
that's what I like I'm gonna leave that
one there and then the last question is
number 10 what is your favorite time
period for me
and what is your least favorite again I
don't feel like I'm specifically
inspired by any time period necessarily
for my own specific style so honestly I
would say my favorite time period for
makeup is now because we have all the
time periods of the past to recreate we
have so many makeup products at our
disposal things that are really
affordable and easy to access as well as
really nice quality high-end brands
there's so much creativity going around
we have social media which is sharing
those ideas and letting so many of these
techniques and inspiration pictures that
wouldn't be able to be seen before in
other time periods so yeah I think
that's the answer I'm gonna go with I
just think right now you could do
whatever you wanted you could recreate
twiggy's makeup if you wanted to from
the sixties you could do like a vampy
type of look from the nineteen what 40s
or 30s or 20s like you could do a really
old Hollywood type of look like I just
love that we have so much at our
disposal we have so much information and
yeah so I think this period and honestly
I don't think there's a period of time
that I don't like for makeup maybe like
the dark ages or like the Middle Ages I
would hate that
I mean we're paying in chamber pots I
would hate that too so yeah that's
probably the time period I wouldn't pick
but I don't really know how they did
their makeup then unless you were super
rich and like a noble person you
probably weren't worrying about your
makeup anyway we're gonna get off on a
tangent on that so I'm gonna end the tag
here thank you guys so much for watching
thanks so much to Elle for creating this
tag and if this was something you were
interested in doing I suggest you I tag
