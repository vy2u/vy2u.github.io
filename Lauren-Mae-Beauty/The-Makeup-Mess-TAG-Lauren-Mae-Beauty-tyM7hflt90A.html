Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm filming a couple different
videos and I'm actually filming a couple
different tag videos so today's tag is
actually something that was created by
Laci or spooky lips and fat hits here on
YouTube if you guys haven't checked out
her channel I definitely suggest it you
will love it she is super awesome and I
know you guys will enjoy her channel but
anyway she tagged me to do this and she
created the makeup mess tag so this tag
has to do with just like how you make a
mess with makeup and just kind of is
relating around that theme I thought it
was really fun and really enjoyed her
video so let's just jump into the
questions this one actually has quite a
few questions in it which is kind of fun
so let's start off with number one which
is how often do you wash your makeup
brushes or sponges
first off let's say like like no judging
like no judgy I am a makeup artist by
trade so obviously the stuff in my kit
is always sanitary always clean after
every person actor ever used I'm
constantly cleaning when it comes to my
own makeup I'm just a normal person so I
do not wash my brushes nearly as often
as I need to I definitely watch my eye
brushes more because they get colored
product on them if I did like a red eye
or a pink eye or a purple eye or
something and I don't want that color
obviously I need it clean but yeah
honest if I'm honest like maybe once a
month maybe like I'm bad I'm so like my
blush brush there's so much like you do
not know what blush DNA is in there it's
just like a mix of everything any color
I wanted to see the same brush so yeah
same with sponges honestly I'm so bad I
would say like once a week I clean my
sponge maybe if I'm good yeah so that's
the cold hard truth there for y'all
mm-hmm alright I already regret this
okay number two how do you organize your
makeup collection
I am classic I got those Alex doors baby
I do have Alex drawers and they have the
white ones which are like the nine
drawer normal thing you see that's
actually in a closet so to give you a
little backstory when I love dinners
before I had my channel I was super into
YouTube I had the whole beauty guru
collection thing going I had my own
Beauty room we had a two bedroom
apartment one bedroom was for us one
bedroom was her all my makeup and then
we moved to LA and rent here is double
the price for half the space so I don't
have the luxury of having my own Beauty
room anymore
luckily the apartment we have actually
has this like little foyer type of area
before you get into the bathroom that
has my closet and I'm able to keep my
makeup in that room so that worked out
really nice by these Alex nine drawers
for more my like kit makeup special
effects makeup I have like a I'm an
airbrush gun I have like a bunch of
different things in there and then I
have the Alex like bigger fatter drawers
and I have two stacked on top of each
other exactly how Tiffany D does hers
she has it and I was like oh my gosh I
did the same thing and but anyway I keep
on my makeup in there and I'm just basic
I know it's like this running joke that
everyone has the idea Alex yours which
one I do think they're really great for
storing makeup because there's small
little drawers but also they're more
affordable than a lot of things on the
market so yeah I got you girl but my
drawers that are outside like not the
Alex 9 drawer or black they're not white
I I guess I'm not really into that very
like clean look I I like to put my style
as like cluttered and eclectic moving on
number three do you put your makeup
products away after you're done using
them or do you leave them out for
tomorrow I used to do the system where I
would take an acrylic like five drawer
little tiny things and I would put all
the makeup that I'm using for like the
month or if I'm project panning it or
whatever I put that makeup in there so
it's just easier to reach for but
honestly lately when I've been getting
ready I just go through the main drawers
it just keeps me inspired by my
collection and keeps me seeing all my
makeup it worked really well for panning
but I've kind of not like going away
from panning but I'm not doing like
multiple projects at a time I'm just
doing like one maybe two I'm just not as
like hardcore into like using everything
up right now so that's how I use it and
then I just put it straight back away I
feel like the biggest time at the top of
my drawer gets messy is like after
filming videos I'll have like all these
products that I used and I try really
hard to put them away right after
because if not the next morning it's
just like chaos and it's just hard to
get ready especially if I need to get
ready fast so I would say for the most
part I put it all away like as I'm using
it so it's ready and clean for the next
day number four is loose or pressed
powders and if you had asked me this
question a year ago I would have been
like press powder all the way but I am
definitely into loose powders I love the
wave loose powders look on the skin I
love that you can pick your preference
look if you want just a little bit you
can use a little if you want more you
can use a lot they leave less texture on
the skin and I just love them so yeah
loose powders when it comes to like
setting powders for other things I'm
just I'm regular with pressed powder
like I'm fine but for face powder for
sure a loose powder I just love them so
much I'm gonna start a new series which
you guys will be seeing either before
this or after this or during this face
and it's gonna be like you guys helped
me decide and I cannot wait to see what
loose powders you guys think it's
probably gonna be the next category that
I do because I love loose powders number
5 do you ever fall asleep without taking
your makeup off no no no no no I used to
all the time I would sleep in my makeup
my pillowcase would be all like you know
mascara and like foundation all over it
but no I do not sleep in my makeup it's
just gross to me like I hate the feeling
of makeup on my skin and then putting it
on my pillow oh no I'm not saying I'm
the best at taking it off like sometimes
it's just with a wipe or whatever but
like I have to take off my makeup and
put moisturizer on like oh I can't even
imagine even just taking it off and not
putting moisturizer on my skin like
crack up and dry and like oh just
disgusting feeling I like your bangs I
be thinking about so yeah I clean my
makeup off when I go to bed you just
want to be relaxed and like naked I
sleep naked so you know I want my face
and it gets to the next question is
number six what makeup rules do you like
to break and I like Lacey's answer for
this where she talked about how she just
like non wearable makeup isn't a thing
to her like she just wears makeup all of
its wearable and I'm kind of similar to
that like honestly to me makeup just
doesn't have rules it's art and I think
it's more understanding of how products
work and how things look on the face
and then you manipulate them the way you
want them to look so I've talked about
this before but like with you know
putting mats in the crease the reason
you're putting a matte in the crease is
to push that feature back instead of
bringing it forward what just shimmer
would do because it'll catch the light
and so that's why for the most part you
would want to do that for like a classic
look but if you understand that concept
you can play with it and then do
whatever you want maybe you want to do
something different or whatever and you
want to put shimmer in the crease or
something similar in some of their
aspects so to me I just don't think
there are rules so I wear anything you
want like today I'm like a way more
classic I'm like doing this a lot today
I'm in like a very classic Lauren look
like this is what I would wear if I want
to just feel me pretty simple classic
and I feel like I've been doing a lot of
like either more minimal makeup or like
crystals and rhinestones and gray lips
and different things in my other videos
so I wanted to do something a little bit
more just like I could feel a hundred
percent Cardian but honestly I just love
doing all different types of makeup I
love experimenting and that's what you
guys see on my channel too you see all
the different looks I do even if it's
not my favorite look I've ever done on
myself like it's still fun and exciting
to try different things and to learn
what you like like if I had never
experimented with pink and my brows like
this I would never know that it's like
my number one favorite thing today so
yeah no girls to makeup I break them all
I love to do whatever I want to do with
my makeup alright number seven well you
use a product even if it's cracked or
broken I would say that at the beginning
of like my makeup career I would because
I didn't have a ton of backups I didn't
have a million powders and all that so
it's just kind of like out of necessity
like crap but now if a powder breaks I
will repress it which I have a whole
video teaching you how to repress or
just showing you I guess how I WordPress
my products if you guys want to check
that out I'll leave it linked down below
if a product is cracked in my collection
I never reach for it I just hate when
you dip your brush in and then like a
couple of the pieces like stick in and
then you're doing in there flinging
everywhere like I do not have time for
that so irritating so I definitely
suggest if you have a product you love
don't want to get rid of but it's
cracked that you repress it and you can
get all the rest of the life out of that
product number eight do you wait to pan
a product completely before you replace
it no I was
pretty large collection I do enjoy
panning products and like hitting pan on
things and so even though I like to pan
stuff that doesn't mean that I'm like
finishing up a bronzer completely before
I'll allow myself to buy a new one I
just like to try to keep it as in check
as I possibly can while still enjoying
make it because I love makeup it's my
job it's my hobby it's my passion I love
it so I just like to have as much of a
balance as I can possibly do in my life
because makeup is also not everything
like you know I'm I tried to stay
realistic ish number nine how do you
feel about sharing makeup okay
as a makeup artist disgusting no
obviously powders are very easy to
sanitize because we can use powders and
kits and we can do other people's makeup
with the powder and then move over here
and do it when it comes to obviously
anything that has like a doe foot or
anything that basically you're touching
the applicator to the face and then
you're putting that applicator back into
the product and contaminating everything
in it for everyone and like if you were
just gonna share it like hey you over
there that's really gross and I
obviously like to keep my kit sanitary
and it really grosses me out when I see
people do other people's makeup who
aren't maybe like their best friend ever
or like their cousin or their mom it can
get like it just grosses me out it's
just not worth it and then I just I
think I just always go back to like
being a makeup artist and like I can't
imagine putting something disgusting
like that on a client like it really
grosses me out
and it also is just like for anyone to
even consider doing that and then like
being a makeup artist and then giving
all makeup artist like a potentially bad
name because like you gave someone some
type of like disgusting infection of
some sort whether its eye or I don't
know it's just gross to me that being
said like mascara is pretty much a no
like the only person I will potentially
give the option to use my mascara is my
mom and it's only if I haven't used it a
lot and then I just let her bake it's
more just so she can make the decision
but she's the absolute only one other
than that I don't even do that anymore
because it just grosses me how eyeliners
you can sharpen so that's fine as long
as it's not like a liquid and again if
I've used it a million times it's just
like it needs to be thrown out lip
products I'm okay with sharing with
family about other people no I just it's
just not worth it guys it really isn't
worth it yeah okay I'll stop talking
about it cuz it's got me on it it's got
me on one so we'll move on to the next
question number ten is how do you feel
about buying or trading used makeup so I
guess just like say about my channel I
do not sell any of the makeup i
declutter I don't sell any used makeup
like it doesn't matter if I got it for
PR if I bought it myself like I just
don't personally like to do that like
some of my products are pretty old and I
just don't feel comfortable sending them
out to you guys or selling them to you
I'm not here to like make money off my
use products and I know a lot of people
do that and I'm not trying to like hate
I'm just telling you what I do for my
channel and what I feel comfortable is
obviously you can sanitize products like
I said with powders and whatnot so there
is a way to make it sanitary I just I
think that products just get held onto
for a really really long time and I
don't want to buy into like this
consumers if mindset of like you
constantly have to replace stuff because
it's too old but I also think that like
makeup is a consumable and it's not like
a fake consumable like it is a
consumable product and it does go bad
it's not like something that people are
telling you goes bad it's not like a
cell phone or something where it's like
oh it's not the newest one and - it's
making it seem like it's a consumable
when it's like no this technology is
perfectly fine then you could use it for
a long period of time but you're just
choosing to upgrade and get a new one
like makeup does expire like if you have
a foundation it's too old it like
separates and is disgusting okay I think
I'm still on one I don't know I just
think like if you really want something
you should save up for it and find that
one item I get though that everyone's
financial situation is different and you
know prices that are lower can be
tempting you just don't know when you're
buying makeup online one if it's fake or
not like if someone's selling it did
they accidentally buy a fake or are they
faking you out and sending you a fake
like I just don't want to use fake
make up like that like I don't like to
support that one but I also just don't
know what's in that and so that's a
potential issue for me you don't know
what kind of home it's coming from
what's been done to it before so I just
it's not something that I enjoy
lacy specifically mentioned glambot
which it's like we're we're just always
so close we're so similar
I personally am not really into glam but
I was gonna send my makeup like at the
very beginning on my channel I did to
declutter and I was like who I'm gonna
send it to play I bought let you guys
now and I ended up not doing that but
glad abouts one of those things that I'm
just like I don't know man I don't know
how I feel about it like it's just kind
of a weird situation like again I'm not
trying to be judgy don't judge me I'm
not judging you I'm just tying my
thoughts and I just don't like there are
times where I could have like
potentially worked with glambot or like
done something like that and I'm just
like I don't really want to be a part of
that you know what I mean like it's
great for people who want to do it I
just I just they're something like
there's just this little voice being
like and so I'm just listening to that
voice alright moving on we'll move on I
know I know
number 11 how often do you declutter
makeup I'm someone who declares makeup
very often I have worked really hard on
my channel you can go back I have like
six hundred plus videos you can see my
first ever declutter x' and how hard it
was for me and wearing that now and for
me the biggest separation is that I
don't have as much of an attachment to
my makeup if it all burnt down I would
be fine I would be sad but I would be
fine and before it was about like I just
had such an attachment to the makeup and
so being in the position I'm in I do get
sent some PR now which is really really
awesome so as I get new things in and as
I decided I don't like those new things
anymore if someone sent me something and
I don't enjoy it I like to pass things
on as often as I can and I want to pass
them on while they're still in their
prime while these products are still
good and well they still have a lot of
years left on them so other people can
enjoy them I'm lucky enough to be in a
position where I can either buy this
makeup myself or get it sent to me and I
want to be able to pass that on if I'm
not giving it the love that it deserves
and that's kind of my outlook so I have
a bag next to my makeup drawers that I
am cost
putting things in as I decide I don't
really like this I don't really want
this this isn't my favorite anymore or
whatever the case may be and I will put
it in that drawer and then whenever I go
back to Arizona I will give it to
friends and family and that's just kind
of my system and it works really well
for me I'm so proud of the fact that
I've been able to diminish the
attachment make a pass on me and like I
don't want to just have makeup to have
it and that's like such a positive to me
and that's why I like to cluttering and
just keeping my collection as clean and
tidy and me as I possibly can number
twelve do you use your fingers to apply
makeup I do not use my fingers to apply
makeup for the most part there are a few
select products that I honestly think
work best with your fingers and
sometimes when you're doing a specific
look even on a client your hands are
just the best tools there's something
about the way products melt into the
skin with the warmth of the hand and it
can just kind of press product into the
skin really nicely so in those cases
that's when I use my fingers so for me I
like to use it for usually like cream
products like cream highlighter cream
blush I think fingers gonna work really
nicely for that I also have a Becca
corrector that I recently got and I find
that the best way to apply that product
is with my ring finger so I also do that
but um for the most part I like to use
brushes or sponges I just it's more of
like a thing for me I don't like to have
my hands dirty with product it just
feels gross especially when I'm doing my
own makeup for certain products I allow
it but overall it's not something I
enjoy number thirteen what products if
any do you hoard in your purse bag
backpack etc so I brought my bag over
here this is my my kidding myself and
face this is the bag that I'm using
currently compliments of my mama for the
most part I just keep lip products in
here so I'll show you what I have it's
not too many and then I have a perfume I
keep this little rollerball the
rollerball I have is from a little pin
Rose perfumes and this is Little Dipper
so I keep that in my purse just to like
spruce it up I also keep deodorant y'all
this one sucks though don't get it I
still happy oh when I use it but I
always keep a deodorant in my purse just
a little fun fact
and then currently I have
three different lip products in there so
I have the Fenty beauty gloss balm love
that I have my Sol de Janeiro Brazilian
kiss lip butter which I'm almost done
with I'm so sad like that's all I have
left but it's so good I love that I
always have a lip balm for sure and then
this is something I got right at the end
of 2017 and it's been in my purse ever
since it's the Revlon kiss plumping the
lip cream I obviously haven't heard
anyone talk about this but I really
enjoy it this one is in the color barely
blush and it's really nice this is like
a really thin like cream it's almost
like a gloss but I really like it's kind
of similar to the color I've on now it's
pretty low maintenance but it does have
a bit of a plumping tingling effect
which I really enjoy so those are the
three lip products and that's kind of it
I'm super low-key I've been trying to
keep like at least blotting papers but
not even powders I don't touch up really
I just like look like a hot mess if I
look like a hot mess
alright like people will get over it I
let my personality outshine how I look
tip let the little tip for you too we're
so close two more questions
number 14 is what is your least favorite
step in your makeup routine and nutbeem
eyebrows I just have blonde brows and so
it's like I have to start from scratch
every single day and I just don't want
to it's not very fun you never know like
today's gonna be the day that they're
totally effed up and you know you just
don't have time for that um I also would
say like in general winged liner like I
enjoy the look of winged liner on me
sometimes but it just it's more like and
the last question is 15 what is your
worst makeup memory and honestly I don't
really have like a specific one that
stands out I feel like first off my love
for makeup it wasn't like in my
childhood I loved makeup like I loved
collecting things and I loved like
having little things and I like to make
up as much as any girl liked makeup but
like in high school like when I was in
high school which wasn't even that long
ago I'm only 26 yeah 26 makeup wasn't
this insane thing it wasn't as crazy as
it is now like oh my gosh no I didn't
have any brows again my
my eyebrows are blond so um I did my
face and my eyebrows were non-existent
when I look back at photos like I just
don't have proud I just look like a baby
like it's so weird
my brows just give so much personality
to the face I'm super expressive I'm
super like I don't know I just move my
face around and make jokes whatever and
I feel like so much is missing when you
don't have the brows there to like
really punch a joke in or something you
know anyway um so that's probably the
worst one overall about like when I go
back on my channel sometimes I'm just
like kind of cringy that looks cringy oh
my gosh I'm wearing like 10 million
times too much bronzer or my face is
like a totally different shade or tone
than it normally is or whatever but I
feel like that's just constant and you
live and you learn and even now every
day is different like I really like my
makeup today and sometimes I don't even
like from a video to weeks ago like I'm
like oh okay
I could've done without that look but
that's just the way it goes anyway yeah
that's the makeup messed I'm super fun I
was really chatty in this video I'm just
like I'm feeling filming today which is
always here we go again so great again
go check out Laci I'm sure you guys will
enjoy her channel so much I think she
just hit a thousand subscribers which is
so awesome I'm so happy for her and and
that's everything thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
