Lauren thank you so much for watching if
you're wondering I did switch out my lip
product
I now have bareMinerals a lip gloss and
sugar on because I just put too many of
the other lip products on and Leonard um
and I felt uncomfortable so I took it
off anyway today is going to be another
tube talk today we're going to be
talking about first impression reviews
and why I hate them now I don't hate all
of them I think that they're just so
abundant at the moment that it makes me
definitely hate them and I think that
they don't have a lot of value so I have
of course a bunch of points that I want
to bring up and talk about in this video
so um yeah I hope you guys are
interested in this I'm sure you will be
because I feel like a lot of people
share a similar opinion to me but if you
don't I still want to hear what you have
to say so now to clarify I do not think
that first impressions are bad
necessarily and I don't think that
full-face of first impressions are
necessarily bad I think that they just
serve a different purpose and what
they're currently serving to me they're
entertaining they maybe tell you a
little bit about a product but they're
not a review they're definitely not
something you would use to judge if you
want to do buy a product or not they
just don't hold that much clout they
don't have that much substance and the
reason I say that is because when you
first use a product you might know that
you love it but I feel like more times
than not the more you use a product the
more you learn how you like to use it
with a brush with a sponge how the
staying power is if it works with other
things in your collection if it works
with your skin type if you just overall
thought it was nice at first but then
changed your mind what I'm trying to say
is you change your mind about products
and I've had this happen with me a ton
of times where I didn't like an item and
then as I used it more and more I
realized like no I hate I do not like
this actually I got all and I've also
had it the other way where at first I
didn't think I liked it but the longer I
had it the more I found myself reaching
for it and using it in my everyday
routine so I think that because we're
humans and we're not perfect and we
don't know what we like exactly at the
moment we try it I definitely think that
first impression reviews do not work as
real reviews because it's not it's not a
true
opinion it hasn't been tested and tried
enough to be a for sure solid 100% this
is how I feel about a product to me now
like I said I think that first
impressions could be a fun thing I think
it's a fun idea again like I said it's
entertaining but but I definitely think
that what we're lacking here is that no
one comes back to talk about these items
if they're doing a first impression
review on even my favorite people do it
so it's just horrible but anyway if
they're doing a first impression review
on something most of the time most of
the time I'm not saying every one but I
would say a majority of the time people
do not come back to these items and let
you know what their actual review is on
them it's kind of like what they said in
that video is what stands true unless
it's in like a favourites and you know
for sure they really do like it or maybe
they talk about it later and say they
hate it but I feel like it just doesn't
really ever get addressed and it's kind
of left in that initial video whatever
they say it means you should or
shouldn't buy it and I just hate that
we're not more thorough with the makeup
we're buying I think we're forgetting
how much money these products are and
that if your job is a beauty youtuber
and that's what you do for a living that
you should hopefully be putting out some
really good reviews about products and
so that's why I'm saying like if you do
first impressions maybe do one or two of
them a month or depending on how much
you upload because if you only upload
eight times a month maybe that's kind of
often but other than that I would love
for you to take the time when you get a
product early to when it's going to
release to be actually testing an item
out so I can get an awesome review and
know if I need to buy this product or
not and because I feel like these first
impression reviews are treated so
flippantly it's hard to trust if what's
happening is real or good or not if it's
an innocent mistake of them liking a
product at first and then not liking it
later if it's because it's sponsored so
they just like it like it just gets so
jumbled and so confused that I feel like
a lot of that would be eliminated if you
just took the time with a pallet even if
you only used it for a week and did a
couple different looks or whatever it is
and
came back and gave your review it would
just be so much more informed and so
much more important and useful for your
subscribers I realized that part of the
reason that these videos are so popular
that first impression reviews are just
like running rampant across the beauty
community it's because there's so much
new product to test out and so they're
trying to get reviews out of all these
new items and the only way to do that is
to not really test it out like to try it
that date like that's what gets me how
can you like I don't get it I don't get
how you can take an item right there sit
around the camera be like mmm yeah I
love it definitely the best product get
it definitely I definitely suggest it
it's really good I don't know how
something can be said just with so much
what is this whatever this is I don't
know how something can be said with so
much confidence when it when again it's
the first time now I get being like hey
I really like this product when you're
trying it the first time be like I'm
gonna try it out more but so far I've
really liked it like that's different
but I feel like again like a lot of
these videos it's just the final say is
that video oh and I feel like that helps
perpetuate you know people buying so
much especially when something's
limited-edition and they go off your
first impression review and they're like
oh I'm gonna go buy it you know they
want to make sure they get it before it
sells out or whatever the case may be
and they're not necessarily buying off
of a great opinion okay now I'm gonna
bring up an example here that I feel
like helps show my point a little bit
and I don't want this to be taken
negatively because I don't have any beef
I have nothing like this isn't me trying
to be mean or call anyone out yeah
enough of the disclaimer we'll just get
into it but Jen loves reviews did a
video recently talking about products
that she's changed her mind about and of
course I was like who I want to see what
people have changed your mind about
because I think that's a very
interesting concept it ties very well
into you know your first impressions
initially and then how those can change
over time and I will say I think this is
like super brave of her super honest of
her and she's someone that's held up in
like the smaller Beauty community as
someone who is really trustworthy
someone who puts a lot of time and
energy into her videos in thought and
care like she's not trying to sell you
stuff and she had mentioned in that
video to products that she had done
sponsored videos with originally and she
said now going back that she did not
like these products and didn't think
that they worked necessarily or weren't
the best or as good as she thought in
those initial videos now she did see in
those original sponsored videos that
with the time that she had reviewing
these products these were her thoughts
and she even said in the other video
that she stands by those thoughts but I
just think that kind of shows you that
even someone that's so trusted obviously
can change her mind about products and
that's with her trying her hardest to
test this out in X amount of days or
weeks however much times she had to test
the products out before she had to get
the sponsored video up that lets you
know that even someone that that trusted
can change her mind so think about
people who don't take that much time you
don't care who you know who aren't gonna
come back and be brave and say hey
actually I didn't like this item or hey
you know I tried it out and with more
testing it doesn't actually fit into my
lifestyle I I don't know I feel kind of
like speechless
you know I it just makes me seriously
wonder like how many people would not
come back and say that hey actually I
don't like this product or even would
test it in the beginning in the first
place you know I would just give it a
decent review especially if it's a
sponsored video which I will say yeah
and you know this has nothing to do with
the topic necessarily at hand right now
but I'm not against sponsored videos
necessarily honestly all I think that
sponsored videos could be better a lot
of the times and affiliate links because
at least the companies paying you to
make a video you have to disclose it
everyone knows it's sponsored whereas
affiliate links you're making your
subscribers pay you and you're selling
to your subscribers like I don't want
that I'd rather have the company pay me
money and you'd be like hey this is
sponsored this is the products and
obviously I'd only do a sponsored video
of something that I like but hopefully
you get where I'm coming from with the
difference there but this isn't about
this isn't about that but I think that
it's definitely just something to you
think about and with other people who
aren't as trustworthy or maybe you know
don't have as high of standards what are
they doing and I'm not trying to call it
anyone specifically I'm not saying it
just makes me wonder you know there's a
lot of money being thrown around in the
beauty community to talk about products
and I mean it's all in their name
they're influencers they influence you
to purchase things and it's it just is
uncomfortable for me that so many
influencers are influencing people on
first impression reviews instead of
thought-out dedicated reviews and I'm
not saying everyone needs to be
necessarily as thorough as like
Stephanie Nicole which she does really
great reviews where she breaks down
costs and grams and all of this stuff I
just want someone who's like actually
use the product I don't want someone
who's using it literally like opening
the package the first time on camera
every time I want them to kind of know
what's going on like I've used this
shade and every time it does X you know
or oh when I first use it it did this
but when I did it this time it didn't to
me that's just important and I will say
that this goes both ways as a creator
you want to get reviews up as fast as
possible so that your subscribers can
know about things but also a lot of the
times it's a great way to grow on the
beauty community and I know a lot of
people that's how they gain their
subscriber base is by having reviews up
first and being able to get those first
initial views because no one else has a
video up and when subscribers are being
like who I want to see that review I
want to see that review you feel
pressured to try to get a review up as
fast as possible so that they can know
what's going on so I think that our job
as Watchers and fans and subscribers is
to you know be okay with letting people
take the time to actually use a pallet
now I will say though with these bigger
beauty gurus they definitely get stuff
sent to them earlier so they have a
little bit more time to play with these
products and I really wish they would
use that time and actually do some
really great reviews because they have
the luxury of doing that and it could
just offer so much amazing information
to their subscribers so that people
could actually decide if this is the
product for them if it's going to work
in their lifestyle
and if there are actual flaws with this
product what are they and I think it
would also stop a lot of the initial
drama from happening I feel like with
the Hooda palette there was some drama
because one person had a bad first
impression I feel like that's a lot of
the drama with the fenty stuff I mean
the Fenty reviews were literally coming
up like 12 hours after it's released
like that's crazy I get some people
doing first impressions but I really
wish like after a certain point it's
like okay we don't want first impression
reviews anymore like I want to know how
this actually sits on your skin what
you've done the first five times you
tried it with a brush and it didn't work
but when you use this primer in this
combination like it did and now I really
love it like I want all that information
so that I can be like Oh too much of a
hassle for me don't want it or oh my
gosh perfect that's exactly what I'm
looking for I feel like there'd be less
polarizing things if people weren't
basing their opinions off of first
impressions and kind of my solution to
this and something that maybe you might
see on my channel and that I've also
seen love Heatherette do I think that it
would be really cool if beauty
influencers could kind of mix the two
together do a first impression the first
time you use it everything like the fun
little oh man it did this in a car to my
eye or whatever it is and that's
entertaining and fun and then come back
after trying it for six days in a row or
whatever it is with let's say it's an
eyeshadow palette with pictures of the
different looks you've done and then you
can talk about alright so I used it the
first time you guys saw how crazy that
was but the more I used it it actually
worked out and I really really loved it
now or mmm I still don't like those
initial shadows but these five are
really good or whatever the case is and
I feel like you can kind of mix the
entertainment as well as the actual
information into one video I think that
would be so amazing granted it would
take a little bit more time you can't
just film it all in one day but I think
that it would just be so much better I
feel like their content would be so much
better and it's definitely something
that I want to try to implement into my
channel I just think it offers so much
more and I don't know why more people
aren't doing it please guys we would
love to see it that's a thing you have
such a huge audience
I know people would love it people would
love people who love to see you at all
on camera so
you're coming up with new and inventive
ideas I know that people would love it
all right that is everything for this
video definitely let me know what your
thoughts are on first impression reviews
down below I think they can be fun I
just wish that wasn't all we're getting
I think that's just it's just too much I
want some just a little bit more a
little bit more time and I just want the
mindset of just like having quality
products and not just everything in your
collection to be kind of at the core of
everyone's thought process as they're
reviewing and as you're picking and
buying things like I think that overall
would also help but anyway I'll stop
rambling thank you so much for watching
guys
and if you want to check out other tube
talks that I've done in the past I will
leave them linked down below you'll
probably enjoy them if you enjoyed this
video
anyway that's everything thank you so
much for watching guys I'll see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
