Lauren this is going to be I believe the
springtime tag is what it's called i was
tagged here by Betsy or make up your
mind she is been watching my channel
since like the very beginning before she
started making YouTube videos she would
comment on my channel and I I don't know
I just when I think back at like the
beginning of my channel she's one of
those people that's like been there like
oh gee and since then she's decided to
make her own channel and be a part of
the project panting community if you
don't follow her already i'll leave a
link down below definitely go check her
out she tagged me to do the springtime
video and she talked a bunch of people
and i thought it would be really fun
tags are just fun videos to do so here
are my answers for the springtime tag
even though i feel like i kind of went a
little summary too I just couldn't not I
guess I don't know the first question
spring means glowing skin what do you do
for healthy glowing skin I am quite oily
so if I'm gonna glow I like to have a
controlled glow I don't really want like
a dewy foundation because by the end of
the day it's just the scariest thing
like I could just swipe across and just
be like an oil gunky mess it's gross so
I decided to pick up a highlighter
because that is my preferred method
especially like a powder highlighter but
I decided to pick one that I feel like
no matter how I'm feeling what I'm
wearing I feel like this highlighter
goes I've talked about it before in my
channel I'm gonna talk about it again
this is the laura geller frenched oh my
gosh I've said it like four times now
this is the laura geller french vanilla
baked highlighter it's such a pretty
high lighter i love it because it isn't
too shiny oh shoot i still have a swatch
for my last video whoops that's it there
it is quite opaque and it just doesn't
give off like two shiny or metallic of a
finish and that's something i really
like it really just gives you this nice
glow and a little bit of brightness I
just really enjoy this I think it would
work for basically everyone skin type
wise it's just one of my favorites and I
just feel like I can't really fail with
this on I don't ever feel to like
metallicy and I don't ever feel like
this shows off like texture in a way
that I don't like and that's something I
really enjoy about this product so a
close earner up would be the honest asya
glow
kids but I just feel like I've had this
one longer i've used it longer and it's
just more of a tried-and-true product
than that one number two what is the
first beauty thing you think of when the
weather warms up when the weather warms
up I like to try to go a little lighter
on my foundation I do my foundation I
feel like differently all the time it
just depends on if I'm panning something
just how my skin is acting if I have a
lot of breakouts if I don't whatever so
I feel like I usually like to go a
little bit lighter though and do a BB
cream so I thought I would mention one
of my favorite BB creams I've gone
through tubes and tubes of this and
that's the Rimmel BB cream and this is
the mat version and this is in the color
light it isn't the lightest light out
there so I feel like it also just works
best for me in the summer time because I
am a little more tan I just love this BB
cream it has so much coverage for BB
cream I think it looks so good on the
skin this is something I've used on Sam
when he was going to set they didn't
have like a makeup artist on set and I
was like oh thing you want to look good
if you're gonna use this for your real
so I just put the tiniest bit of this on
him and you cannot see it on the skin
looks so good and for the price i think
this is like 499 you just can't beat the
price i really like it a high-end
alternative of something that I really
like is the smashbox BB cream although I
feel like that one is thicker and
texture than this one that one still
feels really good has a lot of coverage
looks really nice on the skin I just I
love this I've gone through so many and
this is definitely something I bust out
more in the springtime summertime number
three what's my favorite thing about
spring this one's kind of hard for me
because I lived in Arizona my whole life
until recently and spring is just like
non-existent it's just like kind of cold
and then it's just hot as hell literally
as hell oh there is not really a
springtime it just goes straight to
summer and you're sweating and it's hot
and it's horrible so I just don't feel
like I've ever had like a proper spring
until we moved here I just like the
feeling i love the change of seasons
it's not even just spring it's just i
always look forward to the next season
like oh I can't wait for summer it's
gonna be so this and that in this and by
the time summer comes and we're enjoying
it and we're moving on I feel like yes
I'm ready for fall and then same I'm
ready for
enter I'm ready for Christmas and the
holidays in my birthday and then we're
back to spring and I just love that
changing something new something to look
forward to something to like push you
forward and I don't know I got home
that's my answer so I don't even know if
that makes sense but that's what I'm
going with it's not even specifically
for spring but what of number four do
you do your hair differently in the
spring I'm a bun girl I wear my hair in
buns all the time I just feel like I
like the look of my face I like the look
of like just my whole outfit and body
with my hair up I know a lot of people
are the opposite way I'm not I don't
know my hair is very thin so we don't
feel a ton confident with it all the way
like dan I just feel like it looks
stringing and flat and greasy by the end
of the day so I just feel cute like I
just like maybe it's a sea and cute with
my hair in a bun so I doing here and a
button all the time I think though when
I think of spring and I think of
hairstyles I like keeping it short so if
I'm gonna have it down definitely
keeping it kind of like a bob type of
look that's like straightened and lots
of volume in the front I really like
that look and I think fun colors for
spring early fun like pastel pink pastel
purples just kind of like dying your
hair I think that's really fun for
spring too although I think it's fun to
dye your hair any time my answers are
horrible okay number five what clothes
are you most excited about wearing I
wear a lot of like muscle tank sore
muscle tees they're my favorites but I
wear them all year round honestly I'm
not the type of person I just like what
I like and I wear that whenever the FI
want to wear it that's not special
that's totally me but um so just like I
love like short sleeve muscle tanks and
I also really love sandals but again I
wear sandals year-round in Arizona it's
not that cold I'll wear sandals every
single day every single day it doesn't
matter it's raining sandals it's haha
it's cold out sandals even when I was in
tech lab and we have all these heavy
things I just risked it and I let my
toes show in my sandals and yeah I'm
just a sandals girl I love sandals i
love that they're seasonally appropriate
actually in springtime that i'm not just
being like a freak but I don't care
enough to not so sandals are definitely
like oh yeah love
I love like Birkenstocks I'm wearing a
pair of like Steve Madden type of
birkenstocks but the ones that are like
a t-strap I love those so much so anyway
that was a weird answer to but those are
my favorite clothing items for spring
number six what is your favorite
springtime fragrance or smell again this
was hard because I usually like a clean
floral fruity type of scent which I feel
like is kind of just springtime in
general and I don't wear sense because
of a certain time necessarily there's
like one fragrance in my collection that
I do that with other than that I just
wear them whenever I want and whatever I
feel like smells good and again I just
feel like my scent preferences are
usually more spring time type of sense
but I did pick one this is the Bulgari I
think that's how you say it super hard
there's no oh there's one two bells just
kidding this is just hard to say but
this is the omnia I think it's onion I
always say romina mmm anyway omena omnia
coral love the scent this is my second
one and I'm about here on it i'm almost
done they did change the packaging on
these it just smells so good it's very
fresh i get so many compliments on this
every time I wear it guys girls we're
going out to eat someone compliments me
everyone loves this scent I think it
works really well for my body chemistry
love this for spring especially but I
wear this all year round number 7 is
your favorite springtime lipstick color
I picked a lot of products I'm not a
super lipstick type of person but these
are some that I wear all the time I
absolutely love and I wanted to share
with you because these are definitely
the colors that I gravitate to you and I
kind of feel like I could just have
these five products for spring and
summer and be like a okay so four
lipsticks I have two options the first
from here is from to face this is the
melted liquid lipstick in the melted
fuchsia color this is a bright bright
pink I love this color I I just it's so
fun I've worn this in quite a few videos
and I definitely wear this quite a bit
for it being such a bright color it
screams like spring mostly summer I feel
like these look close a little more
summery but spring and summer to me and
I just love it the next one is also
something i talked about on my channel
and I feel like because I talked about
this so much it's just true that I
them you know I don't switch it up I
just these are the ones I like this is
from butter london and it is there
lipstick in the color ladybird I love
this is a matte formula and I'm not
necessarily 14 just like Matt all the
time this is a very orange II read and I
love that look for spring wearing like a
black and white striped top with like a
really bright lip just like lashes maybe
some winged liner and like you know your
blue eyes popping through I love that
look for spring and even some where it's
very nautical very French in a lot of
ways so that is one of my favorites I
just love that and the last three like
lip colors it's not a lipstick are some
glasses from buxom I got these in a set
a really not a really long time ago but
a while back and these are just like
juicy these are like if you want your
lips to be like juicy and like plump and
summery and like basically fruit on your
lips these are what you want so I have
three different colors this one is the
color strutted I don't know if these are
limited-edition but i would definitely
just check out the buxom lip colors and
these have so much pigment in them even
though that's it there and see that
shine i just love these they have a lot
of pigment even though their loss so I
don't think you need anything else I
feel like they're low maintenance for
summer and that's it there and then the
last one which i think is really really
pretty that's probably my favorite one
is chacha and that's it there these are
just like melted candy and just again
juicy I just I really like that look for
summer and spring number 8 my favorite
springtime nail color crap I didn't even
pick these out why didn't I let me go
grab him I kind of picked a lot I
couldn't just pick a couple yeah I'm
sorry one of the colors Betsy mentioned
in her video was I'm such a budapest or
you're such a budapest I'm not you are
you're such a budapest by OPI and i love
that color but i didn't want to bring up
the same one so i picked a couple
different ones these are just colors
that i wear all the time in spring but
just again in general these are just the
colors i love i love these types so
number one favorite is not about you by
OPI i love this on my toes I've talked
about this before in a springtime
favorite nail polish video which was
like last spring oh wait i'll i'll leave
it links although i feel like in the
thumbnail of that picture
like that I'm now picture I look like
I'm looking into your soul and very
creepy but for you guys I will i get so
many notifications but i love this color
it's so pretty love love love another
pink color really like is this one from
SE this one's in the color cast away oh
that just means i've used it in the past
but i'll turn it around i really like
this color it's a little bit brighter a
little bit more summery and just like
not quite neon it's kind of neon but not
super duper neon I really really like
this this one I hate to mention because
it is lime crime but it is when I own
and I won't repurchase this but I do use
it a ton it's like half gone I love this
color this is the color lavender e I
just really like in general like
lavender type of colors I really like
the one I've got from a damn glam that
one's a very similar color to this but
just in general these types of purples I
just absolutely love and I have really
enjoyed this one specifically on my
nails two more colors I know I know
another SD color this is au lait
caliente and this was i believe limited
edition but I don't wear Reds I don't
really like red on me but this color is
kind of like that lipstick it's a little
bit more of like an orange you've read
really really pretty very nautical I
really like this this is very I guess
more summer but I really enjoy this one
when it starts warming up and it's one I
repurchase I had it in a small size I
used it all up and then I repurchased it
before the collection went away because
I liked it that much and last this is a
classic type of china glaze color this
is a neon and this is son of a peach I
really like peachy colors this is just
like a really nice one I don't like that
neons chip and come off the nails easily
but I do like the way they look for
spring and summer last question let's
get through this can we do it we can do
it number 9 what does spring like where
you live well like I'd mentioned I used
to live in arizona so I don't ever I
don't have like this nice like idea of
spring um in my head or in my past but
now that I live in California it's
beautiful I hate to be you know bragging
but I'm gonna brag I love it it's so
nice because it's like warm in the
daytime and you go to the beach and
enjoy it but there's kind of almost
always this little bit of a breeze and
when it blows it's actually cold in
Arizona if there's a breeze it's like
hot and like a hair dryer I'm sure
you've heard that before if you've ever
heard about
Arizona but it's true here it's just
nice and cool even when it's hot and
then at night when we go on walks and
different things it's nice and cool out
we can open our windows we don't need
central air which is like a really
strange idea when we first moved here I
was like no we need air conditioning I
don't care what they say and now we just
have like the little like side boxes in
our apartment and that's totally enough
for what we need it because it just
doesn't get as hot here and it's
beautiful I have heard that it has been
staying a little colder than normal but
beautiful i love it it's california like
rumors are true California's beautiful
except for the pollution and traffic
other than that weather-wise it's
amazing that's why everyone wants to be
here anyway that's everything guys I
hope you guys enjoyed this if you were
tagged definitely do it I check everyone
to do this it's just a fun run so um I
will see you in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
