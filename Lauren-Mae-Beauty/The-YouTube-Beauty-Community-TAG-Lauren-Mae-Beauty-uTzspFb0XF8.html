Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing a new Beauty tag this
was created by Lisa Stevens and she
actually tacked me in it so thank you so
much Lisa I'm excited to do this I'm
gonna leave her Channel and her original
video link down below so you can check
it out but this is the beauty community
tag as soon as I saw this pop up in my
like feed I was so excited to watch it I
love talking about you too I love
talking about the beauty community if
you haven't seen my tube tops hello you
guys know and only like imagine my
husband cuz seriously I talked to him
about this crap all the time so I'm
excited to answer these questions I
actually haven't really prepared any
answers to this so I hope you guys enjoy
and let's get into the first question
the first question is what are your
favorite videos to watch and honestly
I'd like oh I don't know I like a lot of
different videos I always like watching
videos about products that I'm
interested in so if there's a new
palette I want to try and anyone in my
feed does like a review or even swatches
even if it's first impressions I'll
watch it because I kind of just want to
gather as much information as I can
about that product I really love to
clutter videos because I love being
inspired to go through my collection and
get rid of items that I don't like I
love project panning videos that's where
I've started with my channel as a
project panning community and that's why
I even started making videos so I love
project panning videos especially when
they're like really to the point and not
to rambley I don't even know if I do
that myself but I like when you you know
it's all about the motivation to me with
those videos I also do like kind of
travel videos look I don't like all the
drama videos don't get me wrong but I
kind of like more like I think what I'm
trying to say is not necessarily super
drama but more like kind of like videos
like my own tube talks things that are
talking about topics or situations in
the beauty community or just the
community at large and dealing with them
in a very like professional kind of non
biased way and trying to just like have
intelligent and respectful conversation
about it I really like videos like that
and then other than that I really
like just different types of makeup
video so like coming up with the
different ways to look at your
collection top eight of this or I don't
know basically things like Samantha
March is doing Callie's doing live loves
or makeups doing Lisa's doing like
things that are different and exciting
talking about makeup but just not the
same crap over and over question number
two what are your favorite videos to
film um my favorite videos to film
I love favorites videos I love recapping
my month I do mind a little bit
differently than like a traditional
Beauty monthly favorites I limit it to a
top five so I try not to talk about more
than five beauty products a month and
usually I only end up talking about
three or so and then I talk about other
favorites that have happened to me
throughout the month it's kind of like
my version of a diary or I don't know
like a recap so that I can look back at
the month and like remember what
happened I just it's fun to talk about
fun things and things you like so I
loved filming favorites videos I also
really enjoyed filming my tube talk
series which I think I've mentioned now
three times in this video alone but I
just I really love just getting into
topics and I love reading the comments
after you guys like after I post it and
you guys are commenting I love hearing
what you guys have to say I would say
those two are like my most favorite to
film I'd like filming mostly all my
videos though like if I really don't
like doing it I'm not gonna do it number
three is what are your least favorite
videos to watch I don't say in general I
don't really like super long videos
which i think is hilarious because I do
a ton of long videos but I don't I don't
like watching super long videos unless
I'm like getting ready or I'm doing
something like I'll put them on in the
background but I really like to keep it
between like 10 and 12 minutes that's
like you know a good sweet spot for me I
really don't like first impression
reviews for the most part again unless
it's something I was already interested
in I'm probably not gonna watch that and
the reason I don't like
just because they're just not thought
out it's just it's just kind of useless
to me when it comes to products unless
you're just trying to get swatches but
other than that I just don't have it
doesn't have any value for me personally
and then other than that I think I'm
just not a big fan of vlogs I've done a
few vlogs on my channel it's not
something that's ever been like a staple
of my channel but I'm just not a fan of
them unless you're going to a super
awesome place like I'll watch them if
it's of a different country or something
tropical or just something like that
excluding beauty brand trips though like
I'm talking more about like Travel
Channel's
but when it's just like vlogs of people
like doing nothing or it's just I just
personally am NOT into that I like Casey
nice tats blogs but his are like
extraordinary the way he edits and just
how he does his are different but I just
personally am NOT into those I just know
vlogmas has been hard for me let me tell
you that I love that people are
uploading so much but I kind of wish
that vlogmas also meant like that you
also were just filming everyday and you
could have like put together content it
doesn't have to be like an actual vlog
every day honestly no one's life is that
fun like whose life is that fun you have
to have a lot of resources for your life
to be so fun you can film a vlog every
single day or every single week right
like I don't know anyway I'll stop
talking about that I'm not trying to
offend anyone I'm just giving you guys
my honest opinion number four what is
your favorite part of the beauty
community honestly as much as I like
feel like I talk crap about the beauty
community it all comes from a place of
love I love the beauty community so much
I'm very passionate about it and I want
it to be better there was this time when
I was so in love with everything about
it I bought all these things and I just
wanted to get back to that place but
what I love about the beauty community
still is that this is a place for us to
come we all love makeup and I think a
lot of us in our daily lives don't have
people who are as passionate I've helped
make up as we are and so there is this
place online where we can talk about
makeup and share those same passions
with people who don't live anywhere near
us but we can not feel so alone it's
just fun I've
made some really awesome friends here on
YouTube and as many bad things as there
are about the community I really truly
feel like there are more good and you
know it's who you surround yourself with
and all of the people the channels that
I watch and I feel like my subscriber
base that is amazing and so I love the
excitement and the passion and just the
kindness that I've found in my little
own section of the beauty community on
YouTube alright number five is what is
your least favorite part of the beauty
community now I know I discussed about
why I love it but there are a lot of bad
things in the beauty community I'm gonna
plug my tube top one more time but check
out my tube talk if you want like more
in-depth things on different topics
there are just so many issues as the
community's gotten larger as you know
brands have learned of the influence of
these beauty gurus I think that has
created a lot of issues the turn from
having videos be more about like your
friend telling you about awesome
products and teaching you techniques to
being super product's heavy and about
new launches like now basically every
beauty video is about is marketing for a
products like even my video is if I'm
talking or reviewing or using a product
in a tutorial I feel like it's mostly a
marketing situation now even if we don't
want it to be whereas before it wasn't
that it was just more genuine so I
missed that authentic 'no subcommittee
before another thing that i personally
don't like about the beauty community
specifically is how Cadi it can be I'm
also not a fan of how a lot of the
beauty gurus tend to lead these like
luxurious just over-the-top lifestyles
it's just ridiculous I don't care how
much money you have or how famous you
are you don't have to live that
lifestyle you don't have to do that
whereas there are other youtubers who
are just as successful in other
communities on YouTube who aren't doing
that and there isn't that same issue
yeah they have a lot of money yeah they
have some notoriety and fame but guess
what they're not running around and just
having all the drama and like basically
being a Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie
back when they were in their heyday like
that's what I feel like the beauty
community is now
at least like really big influencers and
I kind of wish it wasn't that I don't
think it I think like beauty already
gets a bad reputation for being super
narcissistic and only about looks and
all of that where is it doesn't have to
be that you know and I feel like
sometimes the beauty gurus are
perpetuating those types of what are
they called stereotypes and I kind of
hate that I know there's a lot you know
but um I'll stop talking number six what
motivated you to start your channel um
so I started watching beauty videos I
don't even know how I started it was
just like randomly one day I just
somehow stumbled upon YouTube and I was
watching a few videos and then I just
got sucked and I watched every beauty
video I wanted everything oh I was
buying so much makeup I was so excited
and I was so into it I did that for
about two or three years had a ton of
makeup and then I found the project
painting community online with YouTube
and that's when I decided I wanted to
start my channel I mean I always wanted
to have a channel but that's really what
gave me the motivation to do it I would
do project pans at home alone I would
save my empties and write them all down
like I was freaky I was like living the
life of a beauty girl without the actual
filming and I decided just to do it and
really what gave me the biggest kick was
when we moved from Arizona to California
I filmed an empties video that was my
first video I ever filmed it was like in
three parts because it was a crap load
of stuff and I didn't want to move with
it to California with me so I filmed it
I think I ended up editing it when we
were already living out here and I think
I did it in February of 2015 and that's
when I started but yeah it was the
project panning community that really
like gave me the push to actually post a
video question number seven is heyou
most inspires you and this one I had to
take a really hard look because I don't
know I don't it's hard for me to think
of like one person I feel like it's just
a lot of people at different times I'm
inspired usually by a lot of different
things but if I had to pick one person I
would go with Emily Noel I just love her
so much I admire how she runs her
channel she always has creative ideas
she just loves makeup she loves beauty
coming to us with thorough thought-out
reviews interesting fun videos she's
consistent she's not in drama she's
almost done a million freaking
subscribers I cannot wait for her to get
there I think it's so sad how the
community has turned so much so it's
like I don't know why I mean I know why
but I think that Emily Noel deserves so
many more subscribers than some of the
bigger beauty gurus but because they're
more outrageous or their videos are more
entertaining they just get the
subscribers and have grown you know so
much more than her but I just I think
she's a staple in the community and I
love how she doesn't compromise herself
for anyone she's gonna give an honest
review no matter what I just feel like I
can trust her I love her family I love
her videos I think she's great so yeah
Emily Noelle she's my fave number eight
is the number one thing you would change
about the beauty community this is
really hard for me because there's so
many things honestly if I could I would
change a couple things but if I could
change one thing I think I would stop or
like eliminate the manipulation of
consumers and the audience into buying
things which means like stopping
first-impression reviews and doing like
actual legit reviews where you've tried
and tested a product that would mean
brands not having as much influence over
influencers so that they were actually
giving honest reviews instead of maybe
sugar-coated reviews or complete lie
reviews there'd be more disclosure when
it comes to sponsorships so everyone
knows what's going on and in general I
would just mean that influencers would
have more integrity when it came to the
decision of money or their subscribers
you know so um yeah I hope that makes
sense but I just really wish that all
the cards would be laid out on the table
so that consumers and audiences can make
better informed decisions and that the
youth because I know that a lot of these
big influencers have young audiences
that they weren't being taken advantage
of so yeah okay yeah moving on number
nine is your number one advice for other
creators or new people starting out a
channel my number one advice for anyone
who wants to start a YouTube channel is
to do it stop talking about it and
actually do it I want
start my channel so many years before I
actually did it and I kicked myself I'm
like digging it if I'd started two years
before where would I be now I just think
if you really want to do it do it and
you will learn through doing if you
actually want to stick with it and do it
or if you decide like hey it's not what
I thought or it's just a little bit too
much work or whatever it is you'll learn
that from doing and I think that about
like everything in life like go for it
just you know stop talking stop thinking
and and try to actually make things
happen do some action so that's my
number one advice but other than that I
think that my advice would be that
YouTube doesn't just make you successful
you're not like gonna turn into some
overnight success you're not gonna be
this YouTube famous person necessarily
I'm not saying it won't happen but that
comes with time and hard work and you're
not gonna post your first video and it
gets a million views and all of a sudden
you have a million subscribers it takes
a lot of hard work and dedication and
consistency and yeah so don't start it
for money don't start it for fame start
it because you love it start it because
you think you have a voice and you want
to add something to the conversation but
if you think you can do that then do it
like have fun do it bring you as much as
it's like do something different you
being new can be different enough you
know what I mean so yeah I hope that
makes sense those are my like biggest
advice it's just like don't do it for
money don't do it for fame do it because
you love it and if you want to do it
then do it and the last question number
10 is what do you love about YouTube as
a whole my love for YouTube runs so
strong seriously I meet so many people
who are like oh I want to do this and
I'm like making YouTube know about it
make a youtube channel around it you
like to I always bring up gardening but
like if you like to garden or if you
like to paint glass eyes like I don't
know what you want to do make videos
about it find your community that's
what's so cool about this platform is
that you can find people that are
like-minded like you somewhere out there
in the world and that's so amazing
because if you live in a small town you
might not find people that you connect
with on that level and you can find
other people out there in the world who
get you you can find people who have the
same
as you who are excited about the same
things as you and I think that is so
cool I also love that YouTube is a place
where you can put up whatever you want
you are the sole creator it's YouTube
and I think that's so liberating and so
awesome
you can create content however you want
to if you want to create a web series or
if you have a script Eero and you want
to you know film it and get it up or
whatever you have a platform to do that
where there's an audience there and I
think that's so cool I think that gives
so many opportunities to so many people
I really think that YouTube can be a
platform for anything that you want to
do in life you can make it a career with
the help of YouTube and I love that
YouTube can take something that was a
passion and turn it into a source of
revenue and income it can help grow your
audience so that you can expand into
other things like I love it I love
YouTube so much
I just think YouTube opens up so many
possibilities and I love that you put in
the hard work and you can potentially
have a really awesome outcome although
the algorithm decides things too I just
feel like YouTube really is a place
where you can turn nothing into
something and turn yourself into a brand
okay that is everything I hope you guys
