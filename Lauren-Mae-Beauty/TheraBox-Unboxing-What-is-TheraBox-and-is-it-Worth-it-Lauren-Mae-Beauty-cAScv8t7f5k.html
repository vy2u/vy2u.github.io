Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing an unboxing
video I was reached out to you by Sarah
box to try out their subscription
service so this is a box they sent me
it's not sponsored or anything and I
thought I would just open it up on
camera with you guys see what's in it
this box retails for $34.99 a month I
thought this was an interesting box
because it's something different than
all the beauty subscriptions you see out
there this is a wellness box so this is
curated by practicing therapists and
inside the box every single month there
are five to seven wellness products in
there and there's always one happiness
boosting activity in here so I thought
that was just something interesting and
I thought we could open it up and see if
we thought it was worth it for $34.99 a
month and for the availability on this
this is available worldwide
it's $34.99 for people in the US it's an
additional $4.99 for shipping in Canada
and then other countries it's an
additional $24 so it's gonna be pricey
if you want it but you can get this box
anywhere I think that's everything I
have to say about the box you know
something that I think is really awesome
I've been trying I feel like lately to
take care of myself mentally so I think
this is kind of a cool idea and we'll
see if it it fits it's kind of expensive
for me but you know everyone has a
different financial situation so let's
see let's get social in here this is
what the box looks like on the inside
comes nice and wrapped I don't know what
month this is I'm hoping it's May okay
so oh wow so I think I got I think this
is like their one-year anniversary this
is the one-year anniversary box
ingredient list so they have this
pamphlet and my goodness it's a lot
that's a lot to take in I don't know if
you guys saw that but it is just like a
million thing so this is really
overwhelming I'm just gonna put that to
the side cuz it's too much for me they
have another little card in here it says
free seven-day meditation challenge plus
one free month of online yoga classes so
that's kind of cool I don't know I
usually never look at a little pamphlet
thing ever okay so the first thing I'm
touching here this is the dose of C I
magnify natural skin therapy from delia
organic
so that's what that looks like that's
nice a little eye cream I think it's
like a gel consistency almost looks like
aloe vera gel or something like that so
that's interesting let's read the
instructions really fast with the
perfect balance of moisture and
protection this eye cream will restore
the youth of your eyes use daily under
makeup or alone apply a tiny amount to
your eye area with your third finger and
light pressure I will try that out
definitely a different consistency and
like I don't know it's like a gel so
interesting I'm glad I got a beauty
product not gonna lie so next we have
some bath salts these are the Lotus
Naturals bath soaks take some time for
self-care and relax in the tub with this
luxurious a bath salt handmade with love
in Bend Oregon so this is really cool it
has like all these flowers in there with
the salt so that's definitely
interesting let's see how much of this
stuff retails for the eye cream retails
for $29.99 and the bath soap retails for
$12 so right there that definitely pays
for the price of the box if you were to
purchase those but you know you probably
wouldn't so let's see okay so next in
the box is this like purple animal print
tea thing I don't even know what this is
this has a bunch of different teabags in
it one says sex tea hangover tea happy
tea energy tea I'm going to open this up
your tea authentic blends I think the
packaging is like throwing me off like I
thought it was like a pallet that's how
the makeup related I am okay oh wow this
doesn't really open that much oh you
just have to break it a little okay your
cheese gift box magazine so comes with
this little magazine so much reading
material oh okay and then inside it has
the four different teas so yeah there's
like a like I said a sex tea and it
comes with three different bags each
drink me to get jiggy with it
The Hangover team drew me to say goodbye
to hangover huh okay well that's kind of
cool I mean I'm interested I'll try
these out and see how they are it's
honestly not that much tea this is only
what six twelve glasses of tea I don't
know it's like a lot of packaging I feel
like for such a small amount of tea it
says your tea creations of the night
gift side is $15 so that's not bad I
thought it would be a little bit more so
I think for what you're getting that
makes sense so yeah interesting kind of
a weird one
next I'm pulling out of the bag or the
box is a canvas tote it says life is
found in the dance between your deepest
desire and your greatest fear my fair
abox so that's the tote it's cute um you
know me and Sam call Sam the bagman
because he has so many bags he's always
using different back so maybe he'll use
this I mean we can find a way or to
grocery shop with it so yeah it's nice
and sturdy but it's just kind of like a
classic canvas bag let's see how much of
that retails for okay the tote retails
for $15 but to me I feel like that's
something you get free a lot of the time
wow there's a lot of stuff in here I
thought we were like done after the
taupe but there's two more things so the
next one is a book and it's the little
book of self love love yourself first
and everything else it falls into line
and it's just a little journal I mean
like there's nothing in here I thought
maybe it would have activities to do but
I think that's really nice I use this
type of stuff a lot to take notes and I
don't really journal myself I just like
to make lists so that's what I'll
probably use that for it says on here
that that retails for $15.99 because it
doesn't have any like inside text I just
think that's a little overpriced I know
I get most of my journals at like
Marshalls and TJ Maxx for like five ish
dollars so yeah that's a little pricey
to me and the last thing in here this is
the olivine life Meditation mind and
spirit spray it says during meditation
aromatherapy inhalation can
helps stimulate the senses promote
relaxation and create an ambient space
so you can really focus directions spray
liberally where desired use as a body
room linen or yoga mat spray shake
gently no fillers or emulsifiers added
so let's smell this bag it doesn't tell
me this is mind and spirit spray so mmm
I like this hmm I like this a lot
actually um it's kind of woodsy there's
a little bit of mint definitely very
herbal um yeah pleasantly surprised I
thought for sure it smell smell not like
how I wanted it to I like that okay so
it says on here that this is just like a
spray you can smell like you can spray
it on your body you can spray it
whatever on here on the sheet it says
that it's a yoga mat cleaner spray and
that it retails for $17.99 but I'm not
gonna use it as a yoga mat cleaner spray
cos at all you do yoga but I really like
the smell of it and since it says on
here that you can use it wherever as a
body room linen spray that's what I'm
gonna use it as and I really like this
$17.99 is a lot of money for this little
tiny bottle I feel like you would go
through this really fast if you were
actually spraying this on your yoga mat
but yeah I'm excited for that one this
is one of my favorite products in the
box oh no no no no okay wait Willie I
was wrong it says this is a meditation
spray this retails for 1899 so it's a
dollar more and then I think you just
get like a code to get a discount on the
mat cleaning spray because there's
nothing else in the box so I guess
that's just like a code you get for
spray I don't know I don't really know
what that is because I didn't get
anything else in here okay the only
other thing that's on this list is that
original card I have showed you guys for
the seven day challenge in the yoga
which is a $25 value so um yeah let's
let's review what we got shall we so
this is what the end of the box looks
like just so you guys can know there's a
little bit of worms in there as bunny
would say my favorite thing is the
meditation spray I just really like it I
think it's really calming and I just I
really enjoyed the scent I was scared I
wasn't gonna like it so this is
something I will use and enjoy although
I feel like it's a little bit pricey for
how much
I know essential oils can get expensive
but almost $20 for that tiny bottle is a
little bit expensive for me next I would
say the notebook although I don't agree
with the retail price of this I think
that this is a nice little like addition
to my house again I will actually use
this product I'll write lists in it take
notes whatever so that will be actually
useful and I think also going with the
theme of the box with like you know
doing an activity you could journal in
this and I think it could help with you
know therapy and like self-love and
everything next I'm gonna go with the
tote bag I think that it's simple but I
think that it's useful I think that the
simple design is cute though it seems
sturdy and I can get use out of this
with grocery shopping so the next I
think the tea I'm not gonna lie I think
the packaging of this is really not my
favorite I don't really like animal
prints and then the purple I feel like
it just kind of looks a little cheap it
would have been cuter if it was just
simpler and less bulky I get that it's
kind of like this more of like a gift
set type of thing but you know when you
take out and you just have these little
things I wish that they just you know I
think it'd have been in cute even in
like a little cellophane bag honestly I
don't know maybe I'm just simple this is
my next favorite thing I think this is
nice I'm definitely gonna use the cheese
and try them out um oh no it says on
here attention beach bodies our tiny tea
talks what's all the fuss about oh god I
hope this isn't like a laxative tea I
mean I'm sure the sex one is in the
laxative tea right okay um the beauty of
a blend is quite the topic of discussion
these days and for a good reason to a
tiny tea is the most loved tea talks on
the market
I'm gonna have to take into the reading
on this glad they gave us a whole little
pamphlet just because I'm not really
into the tees that do that like you know
so I'm gonna read more into that before
I try these but um yeah that's kind of
my next one I do think it's kind of cool
just I feel like the packaging makes it
look so grand but what you're getting
isn't that huge the next favorite thing
is the eye cream the reason it's not
like higher up on the list is because I
don't know if it's actually good the
packaging is a little bit like cheap
feeling it is a cheap eye cream though
it's not like it's super expensive so
we'll see if it works nice I'll use it
it's probably not something I would
repurchase but hey maybe I'll know and
last I have the bath salts just because
I don't take baths so I probably won't
even open these up I'll probably pass
them on to someone I know so they can
get some nice use out of it because yeah
I just don't take baths in my bath it's
just a tiny little you know tub it's not
grand or luxurious I feel more than
anything nasty sitting in it so yeah
overall my thoughts on thier box I feel
like for $35 all the products I got like
I got a lot of different stuff in this
box I don't know if that's just because
it was the anniversary box or what but I
did get a lot of different products I
don't know I think that it's worth it
because it is such an expensive box I
feel like if this is something you like
if you like getting subscription boxes
or maybe $35 a month isn't too much
money for you I think this is a fun one
to try out maybe once and see how you
like it nothing in the box is something
I would pay for but it is always fun to
be introduced to new brands and new
products I wish that some of the stuff
in the box were more name-brand things
things that we've heard of or known like
at least one thing in there that really
could seal the deal for the value I get
that they do more all-natural products
but maybe just partnering with some like
brands that we've known about or heard
about or are a little bit more prominent
would be better for just upping their
value and just for me feeling like I'm
getting really great products for an
amazing price and like you know just I
don't know I feel like I could buy in to
the subscription more the fact to me
that it's all brands I've never heard of
or like this is Thera box brands this is
their boxes brand it just kind of like
as much as these are nice and they feel
nice it's just like I feel like they
add whatever value they want to the box
that way because it's their own products
but you know overall I'm happy with this
at this point like if I had money I
probably wouldn't get the box but let me
know what you guys think down below is
it something that you're interested in
or not I'd love to know your racist
thoughts which product was your favorite
out of everything and I think that's it
I mean it's just a little fun unboxing
so let me know if you guys think thanks
so much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
