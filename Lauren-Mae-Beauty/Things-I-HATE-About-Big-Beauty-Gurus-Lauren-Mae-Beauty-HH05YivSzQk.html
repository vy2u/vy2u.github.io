Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to do a video about five
things that I hate about big beauty
gurus now I'm going to start this off
with a bit of a disclaimer so sorry but
I don't want this to be taken the wrong
way I definitely respect the hustle I
think that a lot of people who have
gotten to a really big standing on
YouTube have worked really hard they've
worked hard to get there there's no
doubt about it whether a video went
viral and they gained their subscribers
really fast or they've been working
years and years and years to gain that
following I respect it I do YouTube
myself so I get it it's tough to get
people to you know follow you and to get
exposure and all that so I respect the
hustle I respect them and I also think
that as YouTube personalities we don't
know the whole story we don't know
everything about them we only know what
they show and so that's what I'm going
off of by no means do I hate anyone if I
do mention anyone specifically I don't I
don't hate them I don't know them these
are just things that I see trending
through a lot of beauty gurus and just
think that I have an issue with and I
personally do not like at all I wish it
would stop and my reasons why I feel
that way so let's get into it my first
problem that I have with large beauty
gurus is that I've heard some of them
complain about not getting specific PR
and that is so entirely frustrating to
me I am not jealous by any means of PR I
think that's big beauty gurus and anyone
in the beauty industry should get PR to
try out any product I think it's a great
resource for us to go to if they're
going to do swatches and show it and all
of that so we can make informed
decisions before we go to the drugstore
or to Sephora or whatever and just in
general in the beauty community gratis
or PR is just a part of it so even if
you work at Sephora or in some way work
in the beauty industry you will get
freebies it's not a new thing it's not
just because of YouTube so it's just
normal and I personally like that
they're making it more transparent that
they get sent all this stuff I don't
think that before we knew how much
people are really getting and now that
it's like popular to make these PR
videos I think that's great but what I
can't stand is them complaining that
they don't get PR for certain brands
like at this point you are so successful
you're getting just so much makeup to
your inbox and if you don't get
something from someone guess what you
definitely have the means to buy it you
know and I think that's my biggest thing
it just it feels so out of touch with
reality especially when you think about
how much money people are spending on
makeups don't get these PR packages you
just love youtubers and love the beauty
community they're buying all this makeup
with their hard-earned money money that
they're not even making nearly as much
as you're making and they're spending
their money on all the stuff you get for
free so um it's just kind of like tacky
to me to complain about not being on a
PR list when you're on so many and
you're already so big and you already
make a ton of money it's like just buy
it
I'm sure you could hire an assistant you
can wait up online and buy it for you
even if you feel that way don't say it
to us I just I think that's something
and that's not trying to be like a liar
cuz I'm really I hate being like
dishonest it's more just choosing what
you say and it's like the rest of your
audience isn't really going to
understand that and it just it comes off
the wrong way even if it's not meant to
I just I think it's kind of tacky to say
that so I really wish that they wouldn't
complain about not being on certain PR
list number two I really wish that these
bigger beauty gurus would showcase more
makeup than just what is sent to them
for free there are a lot of beauty
companies out there more than what you
see in Sephora and Ulta and in the
drugstore there's so much more there's
so many indie brands and since you have
such a high place of influence and power
and you have the money now to purchase
cosmetics I wish that they would you
know kind of invest some of their money
into brands that are unknown and do some
reviews do some different videos with
different products and different
companies spread awareness and kind of
get back to your love of makeup I'm sure
it's overwhelming getting so much makeup
for free but it would be so nice for
them to come up with content on brands
that don't send out huge PR packages and
give us advice and information about
brands that maybe we'd want to branch
out and try but it really is
not much information on it I don't think
that would be so amazing why not spread
the wealth and the knowledge I just
realized I think this is more than five
things so um yeah I can't count sorry
about that I think you guys will like
there's more than five next number three
though let's talk about clickbait titles
I am over it I'm so over it the world's
best eyeliner the world's worst
foundation like no it's just a
foundation and you're doing a first
impression review on it like that the
situation I can't stand it if I see
another WTF in this fricking thumbnail
or title of a video I'm going to shoot
myself
um no but seriously what the heck I'm so
over it I feel like we're at this point
where we're so stimulated and everything
is such a situation that you have to
one-up it to be even just remotely heard
over all the bullcrap that is the B
Street community and I think that's just
as bad I really wish we could just have
like you know upfront titles I get that
part of it is just YouTube it's not even
that it's like they're just trying to
make sure that they get the views and
all of that to continue getting money
and sponsorships and brand deals and all
this stuff and part of me gets that but
I just am so over the stupidest titles
and they're not click baby in the sense
of like what they're talking about in
the title isn't ever brought up in the
video
but I just hate that I I can't
I'm just exhausted talking about it
honestly you guys know exactly what I'm
talking about I just it's like we don't
need the world whatever in a title I
hate that trending I hate that that gets
abused because people are going to
continue to do it and it's just
disappointing to me I'm all for creative
fun titles but it's just too much I just
can't moving on number four is something
right is just irritating to me and I
can't stand is that everyone looks the
same and I get the trends or trendy and
that's what's you know happening but it
everyone looks the same they have like
insanely large lashes they have winged
liners usually a cut crease is super
popular what else really heavy
foundation really strong
Torin highlight and all that makeup is
fine and dandy I have nothing against
that it's just that everyone looks the
same everyone tries to do the same exact
looks they have the same exact
background they have the same exact
everything it's like they all have this
one standard like to be a beauty guru
here you're like here's your checklist
and they'll mail out to each other and
have like monthly meetings about what it
means to be a beauty guru I really think
that it would be so refreshing to see
some people do some different stuff it's
okay to not look the exact same and to
explore makeup is creative and I feel
like we all are in this community
including them because we love makeup
it's an artistic outlet for us and I
really wish I could see that through
their videos and in their makeup looks
instead of it just always being the same
thing and it could just be their
preference and they all just have the
same preference but it would be just so
refreshing to see some different looks
and to see people not look this is yeah
this is so much more than five I don't
know what I was thinking okay number
five we're on size now we have like
three more to go after this essence what
so number five I'm done with the tired
content this is kind of talking straight
up with makeup struggles she did like a
whole video of like things she wished
Beauty yours did I'm gonna leave her
down below I'm also going to leave
Angelica
oh I can't say your last name necklace I
know that's not it but I believe her
link down below to if you like these
types of videos I just think that
they're doing some awesome content make
a struggle is like totally in your face
but not like route she's like she's just
like real it's like I'm not being rude
this is just true anyway check them out
they're so amazing I'm so overtired
content a lot of these beauty yours only
upload about twice a week at Max and
that does not leave a lot of room for
content so you have about eight videos a
month that you do and we have to take
out like monthly favorites you have to
take out I don't know no one does empty
doesn't really empty these are my
monthly videos most mostly yes mostly
savers but you know you should take out
the videos that they do every single
month and then you're not left with much
when it comes to new releases
they do first impression reviews on so I
really wish that they would come up with
some new see reading some creative video
just something new like sit down and
brainstorm some really cool ideas and go
for it test them out see if your
audience likes it so many people love
these huge channels like they have
millions of subscribers so there are so
many people who are willing to watch
them I just got a ton of pickup so
that's like but there are so many people
willing to watch their videos because
it's them that they can take these
chances I don't know why they're not I
guess it takes more thought and creative
power to do it but I mean it would be
successful if they made it successful
and if they put the work in and my
example for this is nikkietutorials
powered makeup that was something that
no one had done before and it went
insanely viral it shot her up to like
crazy success and it was like this new
cool thing like let's see more of that
why isn't that happening more often I'm
not talking about stupid condoms Beauty
Blender challenges that's not that's now
where we're going with this we're
talking about actually cool creative
ideas not just like let's beauty blend
with freaking anything other than a
Beauty Blender please don't do any more
of those I can't handle it but like you
know maybe some different tag videos or
I don't know just be creative I don't
know I don't know you know in your brain
think of it I try to do that on my
channel and I think that those are just
fun it keeps it fresh it keeps it new
we're over everyone coming up with the
same ideas make your channel stand out
and do something different and I really
do think that people will appreciate it
and enjoy it and you could change the
trend why would you not you have so much
influence and power which is so amazing
I just wish they were using it and more
creative and awesome ways than they are
number six my bonus ones I guess Mahalo
I really wish that bigger influencers
were taking the time to really be a part
of the beauty community find smaller
channels find smaller Instagram accounts
and bringing those people up with them
they have so much success why would they
not want to spread the wealth and love
now I get that they're really busy and I
think
it's great that they're all friends with
each other I hope that they're more
friends with each other than there is
drama because they're you know they're
they're hanging out with each other a
lot but it would just be so nice if they
could watch other people who aren't at
their success level but are in the
community and you know if they truly
felt like they were really great or
really connected with them to shout them
out I also think that if they're going
to be doing any videos that got their
start from the underground they need to
do the research and freaking give credit
where credit is due I try really hard to
give credit on my channel to shout out
people's names anytime that it just
feels right or it works
I never feel obligated to do it but I do
it because it's like why would I not say
oh I was inspired by this or whatever
like I just wish I saw more of that I
don't ever hear that unless it's like
Manny talking about Jeffrey and Jeffrey
talking about Manny and I think it's
great they're friends but they already
are both huge
I've only helped them I don't know I
just think that there's so much well to
go around why would you not you know
help bump a couple other people up there
who you think are really awesome and a
lot of it I think is that they aren't
necessarily watching other people in the
beauty community I don't think that it's
necessarily just evil and they're trying
to like court their wealth insane I
think that they aren't a part of you
know they aren't watching a ton of the
smaller channels who aren't in their
million subscriber range I don't think
that they're watching them I'm sure they
don't have a ton of time but I really
think that if that's what you do your
job is a beauty insolence there on
YouTube you should try to be as involved
in the community as possibly can so that
is something that I hate that I don't
see happening more often on these larger
channels my next bonus item is going to
be first impressions now I like first
impressions overall I think that they
can be helpful in their own way they're
kind of entertaining but my issue with
first impressions when the thicker
beauty gurus get it is that that is all
they're doing now first impression
review that's it that's the final that's
the like judges gavel there's no oh let
me come back to this there's no hey that
was my first impression now I'll let you
guys know if I like it more so much of
YouTube is
now you have to be all the way over here
all the way over there you can't be in
the middle and so these first
impressions reviews either come out like
it's the best thing ever definitely buy
it or it's tough never spend your money
on it I hated it like it has to be
sensational either way it can't just be
like yeah it works ok I don't know is it
worth it maybe here you know here's an
actual reasonable review on it I just
wish that first impression stayed just
that there my first impressions that
they're not necessarily a way for you to
completely base your purchase off of
this um but they're not I mean most of
even the subculture palate reviews were
first impressions but it's not helpful
if we already have some negative reviews
have want people who have actually used
this to give me some reviews it just
isn't helpful when it's constant I think
that's my issue with it because I've
done first impressions I continue to do
first impressions but I come back to you
and let you know how I feel about them
and it is legitimately a first
impression it is not just the final
review on something and what this is
something that I hate for them but I
really hate that these bigger gurus have
gotten so much heat over the years
they've gotten so much criticism I think
with the rise of drama channels and just
again sensationalism but now in the form
of scandals and this and that I think
that they've gone to the point that
they're just going to do whatever they
want they don't even care and I don't
blame them for that I mean I can't
imagine getting called out called out on
like every little thing you ever did
when you didn't intend something to be a
certain way and then it becomes this
huge scandal in it shouldn't have been
that happening over and over and over I
can definitely see how that would
hardened you to actual constructive
criticism from people who want to see
you do better and already love you and
so I think that some of these attitudes
maybe stem from the fact that they have
received so much hate and so much drama
has happened around them that they're
just like at this point whatever I'll
never win if I do this or do that it
doesn't matter so I'm going to do
whatever I want and I really wish that
people would just be more level-headed
when things came around and like I said
at the beginning these youtubers are
just people they make mistake
I know so many people hold them up to
this like high pedestal they're just
humans that more humans know about than
other humans is not a sense like they're
not any different than me and you and so
yeah they're going to make mistakes and
also again everything that you see on
camera is not the whole story and I
really just wish people would like keep
that in the back of their mind
anyway I bending it there so hopefully
that made any sense I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I would love to hear
your comments down below what are some
things that you just can't stand about
the bigger beauty gurus I don't want
anything to get too nasty I don't feel
like I was nasty at all in this video
but I'm totally down with like having
real battle of the conversation I think
that that is helpful and good anyways
that's everything bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
