Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
talk if you guys didn't know my channel
kind of grew a lot in the last I don't
even know week and that was actually
from a tube top that I did all about
makeup addiction so I will leave that
link down below if you haven't checked
it out I will also leave my two top
playlist linked down below but this is
just a series I started on my channel to
start discussion and dialogue about
topics that I think are interesting most
of them have to do with the beauty
community but not all the time they're
like YouTube related usually so today as
you saw from the title we are going to
be talking about haters and trolls and
how to deal with them and just kind of
in general my musings I don't want this
to be taken as me just acknowledging
haters and that's how it is this is
genuinely to me a I want to have a
discussion about haters no matter what
we try to stay they're real and it
happens and if you're a creator online
then you've probably dealt with some
online cyber bullying or cyber hate and
I think that it's important to talk
about it and so that's what I'm gonna be
doing today I also want to say that I
have not gotten a lot of hate I don't
want you to sit here and think that I'm
trying to like make you feel bad for me
or anything like that
that's not what this is I've been very
very lucky to not get that much hate but
with my makeup addiction video I'm
getting a lot more views than my video
is normally good and I think it's at
like fifty five thousand or so now it's
brought a lot of views to my channel
it's brought a lot of subscribers which
is so awesome but along with exposure
like that you are going to get trolls
and haters it's just gonna happen and
luckily most of the people that have
commented on the video have been so nice
and supportive and great but there's no
denying that there have been a few hate
comments and since I feel like my
channel growing it's almost doubled in
the last week my subscriber count is
almost doubled in last week I think that
this is kind of like a new chapter for
my channel and it's just something I
want to discuss and that's been brought
up because of that current growth so
again we have the notebook here because
I don't want to miss anything and I'm
hoping that this video can be a resource
for people potentially who are getting a
lot of hate and it's hard to deal with
maybe it'll just be like a
opinion so that way you can have like a
healthier way of like dealing with it
because again I think that it's
impossible for you to just be like oh
it's just hate like just don't think
about it just whatever because if you
actually read your comments and you read
that comment that's hateful
I gotta go kill yourself comments
there's something about it no matter
what like no matter how healthy you are
no matter how much you're like whatever
there's still a part of you like the
tiniest part of you that's like what the
heck why would someone write that even
if it's just at that level it's like
what the heck like it's just like it's
hard to comprehend especially if you're
not a hateful person so I'm hoping this
will help other people who are creators
or who are dealing with like hate and
hopefully it'll be a way for them to
have some discussion I also just want to
have some discussion on it because
obviously this is a huge problem on the
Internet and any on YouTube specifically
I feel like if you know anything about
YouTube you know that the comment
sections especially on like huge videos
it's just it's insanity so yeah it's
just like I know in fact so first off I
want to talk about how the hate comments
I feel like in the beauty community are
so much different than hate comments in
other communities I've noticed that the
beauty community is just so savage and I
don't mean that in like the fun like oh
you're savage like no like literally
savage and and they like attack you
where it hurts they attack you on your
looks they attack you it's just so petty
and it cut too deep I think that females
can cut very deep with the what with
what they can say and I feel like that
definitely happens in the beauty
community and I feel like those comments
can just be so much more hurtful than
what I see other places i watch h3 h3 I
love Ethan and Ellen I think they're so
funny I love them so much but their
comment section if you go to it
definitely there's hate definitely
there's horrible things being said but
there's something about it that almost
has this air of like it's like funnier I
don't want to say hate is ever funny but
something about those comments is just
there's something that's a little bit
more playful about it and I feel like in
any of the beauty community on these
bigger gurus I don't care if
don't like in there for you do you like
them some of the hate that they get is
just absolutely horrendous and just it's
so vile that someone would choose to
write that let alone think it but then
to write it down it's just absolutely
horrible and there's nothing playful
about it there's nothing like funny
about it at all and that's something
that I think is a big difference in the
beauty community and something I've just
noted so that's just the point I wanted
to make again like I said some of these
are just like my thoughts on it like I I
really like trying to understand and
figure things out so that's just like an
observance I had I've also noticed that
as channels grow obviously the hate
grows and it's because your audience
just gets bigger I definitely have
noticed that the number one way to get
subscribers is exposure that is it the
more people that know about your channel
the more likely they are to subscribe
and so when a video goes more viral or
gets a lot of views it just brings a ton
of traffic to your channel and so you're
hoping that some of those people will
subscribe to you but along with that
come other people who are just haters or
maybe they just didn't really like your
content for whatever reason and have a
very strong reaction to it and so that's
something that's definitely as I'm
growing it's just definitely different
and it it almost makes growing a little
bit scary like I said I'm not trying to
say that I'm gonna try to say that I
grew so much and I'm such a big channel
now it's just it was a lot of growth at
once like I said it almost doubled my
numbers and when you're slowly trucking
along I mean I've been on YouTube now
almost a little over two and a half
years you know and you're growing slowly
you're usually getting followers and
people are coming to your channel that
actually will like your channel but when
something grows that fast that isn't the
case so it can definitely be scary when
a video is just getting a ton of views
you don't know why you don't know how
you don't know why you're ending up in
people's recommended videos or in their
suggested videos to the side like you
don't know why that's happening and so
it's almost like obviously so exciting
that is the bigger the bigger feeling
out of the two but there is this part of
me that had a lot of anxiety about
growing so fast because I was just
scared of what people are gonna think
and it
this reality moment of oh my gosh like
people are actually watching my video as
much as I know like my subscribers would
it's like this is going to so many more
people than that there's this anxiety
about it because you just don't know if
people are gonna react well and then and
then that can be compounded with people
giving you horrible comments and I'm
very lucky that I didn't get too many
but I definitely got someone wait and
like talking about how I'm like addicted
to food in that video and just whatever
which actually I'm surprised and get
more comments calling me fat I that's
like one of the things that I've thought
from the beginning like I knew in my
head I was like Lauren you're gonna do
YouTube people are gonna call you fat so
you know just like just know that in
your heart but that's gonna happen and
it's fine so that way you know you've
already protected yourself from that but
luckily there wasn't too too much there
wasn't too much and I'm kind of
surprised so I don't give a ton of
attention to haters and the specific
things that they say necessarily because
it's not about that my mom I was talking
to my mom on the phone and she was like
did you see this comment and I was like
yeah I saw that comment she's like oh
you're gonna write back to it and I was
like no I'm not writing back to it I'm
not gonna write back to someone who is
so mean or negative on my channel when I
already don't necessarily write back to
other people why would I waste my time
on the one percent that feels like that
instead of the 99 who have given me only
love and praise and have been just so
kind and sharing their stories and been
open themselves like I'm not wasting my
time on that person like there's no
reason to waste my time with that when
there is so many other positive things
happening I mean Sam we're talking about
this and he was like you know it's
fairly interesting as humans that we can
have all of this praise because if you
look at like your thumbs up or you look
at the rest of the comments they're all
so nice but you get that one mean
comment and that's what sticks with you
that's what you think that's what you
think's wrong instead of focusing on all
the amazing positive aspects and that's
something that if you have a channel I
definitely suggest you try to do I know
it's hard I know it's hard but to look
at all the amazing support that you have
instead of focusing on that one negative
comment because I promise you for that
one comment you're probably gonna have
so many
or comments that are saying nice things
to you is giving you support sharing
their stories and you're really doing
them a disservice if you're gonna listen
to the few that are like bad eggs I also
think like another I think tip or
something that could maybe help you deal
with it is just having someone outside
of social media to talk to about these
comments that you get I don't think you
should necessarily go in rants on social
media about them my biggest thing is
like I don't want this video to look
like that again this is more of a
discussion about haters it's not me
ranting about the hate that I've gotten
I hope you guys can see the difference
there but I think it's important to have
someone you can talk to you about these
comments so that you can like talk about
them get them off your chest and let
them go and they aren't just like
sticking with you I know for me and I'm
sure for a lot of people if you just
keep stuff in your head mentally you
keep going over and over and then you're
questioning yourself and you're
wondering well did it come off that way
or all these stupid things and it's like
no no no no no no someone else from the
outside can give you a better
perspective and kind of help ground you
and help you realize like okay now get
them out of town forget that thought
that's just like some random person who
was having a bad day or whatever the
case may be eat me you know I think we
right off some of these people it's like
oh they're just having a bad day or
whatever like some of these people just
are hateful like I'm sorry if you're
writing that mean of stuff like maybe
you are just like a hateful person
inside I don't know for me personally
when it comes to hate comments I
actually do not delete them I honestly
don't delete many of my comments at all
I sometimes delete spam especially when
it's someone who's like commented on
like every single one of my videos the
same exact comment like sometimes it's
just too much and I delete them but I
also delete some things with like links
cuz I just don't know if they're shady
or not and then I've only deleted one
hate comment and that was because it
just started getting nasty it was like a
back-and-forth between a subscriber and
them and it was pretty nasty and I just
felt like I don't know I just wanna like
end this but for the most part when it
comes to take comments I do not delete
them and that's mostly because to me in
my head at least
moment this totally could change and I
honestly think that people should handle
hate comments however they want to
whether that means that they block
someone and they delete their comment or
they have a moderator to read their
comments to delete those comments for
them but for me it's like no matter what
that happened like someone said that
nasty word and me deleting it doesn't
make it go away I don't know there's
something in my head about like making
the comments look only nice that it's
like I don't want people to think that I
only get nice comment if I don't I don't
know so for me I don't delete them I let
them be there and you know I suggest to
you guys to not fight what these people
do not give them the time of day I mean
honestly you just don't know what their
intentions are you don't know if that's
what they want to do they just want to
fight or what it is they're just trying
to be outrageous to be outrageous or if
they really think that way and they're
ready to like you know go head to head
with you it's just not worth your time
and energy I'm telling you that is why I
don't respond to them but I do usually
leave them up unless I mean there might
be cases in the future where I decided
to delete them or maybe I'll change my
mind because I'm a growing human and
situations change and your experiences
change as you grow and get older but I
think that if there's something that
really bother you I think you should
delete them I think that you should get
them out of your life and never look
back do not let these these haters get
to you seriously if you are putting the
time and energy even into making videos
and uploading them putting yourself out
there is such a brave move like that
alone is so amazing and you shouldn't
let these people who are just being
negative stop you or make you feel
insecure or uncomfortable for doing that
and I know that when we talk about
haters and none of this is a just like
just don't let it get to you just
whatever because they are hurtful
they're meant to be hurtful comments and
they are they do hurt if you read those
comments it's hard to not let them go
you can try to be more callous against
them and not let them affect you too
much but eventually I mean it does hurt
even these bigger gurus you see them
talk about hate all the time because it
gets to you as a human naturally it will
you don't want to like upset people you
want people to like you you want to fit
in and
when people are coming after you and
being hateful it does hurt no matter
what so I don't want any of this to look
like it's a just like just get over it
or just do this um it's not I think it's
something that you always kind of have
to deal with and that's part of being on
social media and being on YouTube sadly
that's just a facet of it and it's
something I think we're going to have to
constantly figure out how to deal with
and that's a personal issue and journey
for you to go on is to understand how to
deal with those people and still keep
your mental clarity and not let it
affect your joy and how you do things
because for every one person who maybe
doesn't like you doing this or doesn't
like this or is hateful about whatever
there are so many other nice people out
there who don't feel like that my last
kind of like musing I think is just
about the fact that something I've
realized with my new influx of
subscribers and with all the new views
is that my demographic I think is a lot
different than a lot of the larger
beauty gurus I just have an older
demographic which I love I'm 25 and when
I look at my statistics the bulk of my
subscribers are between 25 and I think
45 and that's just in life who I get
along with better and who I gravitate to
and like who I click with so it makes
sense to me that my channel is received
well by those age groups but I think
with the makeup addiction video there
are a lot of younger people who saw this
and I'm not trying to say that everyone
young is stupid and hateful but I do
think that a lot of these more hateful
and ignorant comments come from these
younger viewers who maybe that did today
just don't have enough life you know in
them to know how hateful they those
things are they're just immature and I
think that's a good way to put these
people into perspective and these
comments so it could hopefully hurt a
little bit less and you can kind of move
on a little bit easier I also think that
it's interesting to look at these people
and maybe take their side and understand
their side because everyone has
different experiences and so you have an
experience and you make a video let's
say about that experience but everyone
else has a different experience
some of the comments I got we're talking
about how like makeup addiction isn't a
thing or shopping addiction isn't a
thing only things like drug and alcohol
are addiction and I try to look at that
comment in the sense that everyone has a
different experience and if they have an
experience with drug or alcohol
addiction or someone they know has it
maybe this doesn't seem like a big deal
and although maybe how they phrased it
or what they said was more hateful or
wasn't nice trying to understand and
pick out the pieces that maybe make more
sense or just understand them even
though they're being mean that is
something that you can maybe try doing
and that I try to do if I can and try to
understand like wow why would someone be
that upset hmmm I wonder and not get too
involved like I'm not trying to like
mentally think about that for a long
time because again I ain't got the time
but I think that's just something
interesting and then last this is what I
have to leave you with and something
that I think is a really good analogy
for these people and why you shouldn't
give haters and trolls the time of
freaking day you got a lot of times
these comments are literally crazy guys
like that's how you have to think okay
so imagine you're at a dinner party
right and you're here with your husband
or in your significant other and
everyone's there and everyone's having a
good time you know maybe it's not like
these aren't your best friends but
you're being cordial you're being nice
to try and have a good time make
conversation maybe you have a little bit
of dialogue and not a discussion maybe
it doesn't get to like an argument but
you can kind of banter back and forth
have a little bit of a debate and then
there's this one person who just goes
crazy on everyone who's Apes and
like freaks out is freaking out yelling
and doing all this stuff at the party
everyone would be like what the Freak
like what is this person's problem right
like you're just all looking like holy
crap or like when you leave and you get
in the car and you're just like talking
about like what the heck was up with
that and everyone's thinking the same
thing like this person's crazy
that's the troll that's the troll in the
hater right there is the person like
like acting like a freak at this party
you know just like you wouldn't
necessarily give them the time of day at
that party you might just like walk away
you don't want to get involved in this
drama like everyone knows collectively
that this person is like freaking out
and you know not do
right thing is not on the right at all
is spewing absolute bullcrap
everyone knows that so that's how you
should treat your trolls and haters is
just like they're the freak at the party
that you're just like walking away and
making eye contact with other people
being like girl you're seeing this right
like I'm not alone here that's that I
would love to hear you guys as thoughts
down below on any of this if you deal
with hate and what your thoughts are
even as someone who just watches people
and sees heat in the comments but you
guys think about it I would love to know
your guys's opinions and if anything I
mean this helped me talk about it a
little bit but I hope this helps anyone
who maybe is dealing with some heat and
maybe it'll give you just another
perspective and just like talk about I
feel like if we if we can have like
actual dialogues about it it maybe won't
hurt as much so that is everything for
this to talk I hope you enjoyed it let
me know any suggestions you have for
other tube talks down below in the
comments and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
