I'm here with my mom and also my little
brother we just filmed the
mother-daughter tag and now that we've
kind of got all the giggles out of our
system we are going to film a thrift
haul we went thrifting while she was
here it's one of our favorite activities
to do so I thought we would show you
guys what we found I personally only
found one thing and then I have
something of Sam's and then the rest is
all the moms she was the superstar this
weekend but we're just gonna get
straight into the video that's how
little brother Mark and now he's gone
now he's decided not to be in the video
he didn't my need answers 00 their eyes
okay no we're not gonna do that back of
words all right um so let's start with
our first item the first place we
stopped dead was not a goodie boutique
it was just a little little place and I
got this cute little maxi dress it's
strapless and I thought it has little
ruffles on the bottom really cute cute
little and it is long but you could wear
it even with like this little jean
jacket you can do it later guys see how
cute that would be or a cover-up for a
swim suit you wear it on the beach and
whatever like you it is really it was
only four dollars four dollars four
dollars really really cute and it's just
brown and white little is a cheeseburger
so that was really cute and then we went
to the goody and while we were there we
found most of our stuff there yeah I'm
gonna go into my wine I'm just get this
over with it's kind of a scary one so i
got this lamp okay let's put it here I
got this is so awkward I got this lamp
at the goodwill I've been looking for
one of these for a long time I feel like
I saw these with a good we'll all the
time when I wasn't in the mode to
purchase and then I was like you know
when I'm gonna buy that one the next
time I see it I did not find one for so
long and I finally found this one it
does work I've tested out from light
bulb dan I'm excited to find a frame
shade I was going to say shade yeah to
put on top of this and I just love it so
much it was 14 99 which is kind of
expensive but once i get my lampshade I
feel like that's a great price for this
piece if I were to buy it somewhere else
like already all put together that would
be an amazing price so yeah that's my
item i did get four pieces of clothing
because while we were there between the
hours we were there if you purchase
something before one clothing if you
close all begging was three dollars
before we dollar self course we went we
were in the dressing room like yellows
so i did get this this is a gibson sure
but it's just a t-shirt just simple
simple it is longer in the back yeah
Tylo and it's really and it's a striped
lightweight i live in phoenix so this is
perfect cuz it is hot yeah and i thought
it looked at a dart in him and she got
it looking flight done yeah so either li
NE denim through the q it and then oh i
found another really cute cute shirt and
I thought we thank you for Easter what
do you think that's really pretty this
is more mint green and I'm kind of blue
on camera but it's a really pretty mint
green top with a peter pan collar has a
little button in the back and it is a
brand-new looks pregnant yeah and three
dollars that's a great name is dollars
I'll do the next one okay even though
these are so my mom's but I want to talk
to okay so my mom got another maxi dress
it's hard to like have someone else in
the video okay so this is another maxi
dress it's kind of a tribal print and it
goes all the way to the bottom it does
have like a ruffle at the bottom as well
which i think i might haircut on a
ruffle off she wants to have the ruffle
off I do ruffle looks nice but it's a
really cute dress it's from the brand
weavers I think they sell this at Ross
um just really simple casual dress it's
just like a cottony soft when two or
three bucks kantri dollars this is the
last climb another one of these at home
that I love it is in blue and dark light
blue dark blue but this hello Ted
tubberman and is another price but it
still has the tag brand new never come
or but it's just an a-frame dress like a
shift dress yep with pockets it does
every girl loves a dress with pockets
very comfy nothing cooling you do that
love that no clean for me in so really
cute
really adorable pretty print yeah I'm
gonna go into the items Sam got he got
Sam got a pair of rollerblades so he's
been looking at rollerblades for a
little bit and saw these tried them on
and they worked out great these were
also 1499 in a brand new they look brand
new and yeah these will be great if he
wants to go along the beach or on a bike
path or wherever he's going to my roller
blades too so those are his little find
and then the rest yep when I found quite
a few things the rest of it is going to
be like bric-a-brac is what we call it
or like home goods that type of stuff
now this is just it has a little
pineapple on top but its wine it's not
like four napkins but I have one of
these at home that's white and I put all
my cutting boards in it love it if I
thought it could be four paper plates
the big ones and I use the small paper
plates to it could be for that lids
whatever I think it spray-painted if I
wanted hello dollar there was a dull
hair one dollar kind of undoubted ago I
love it then who did she found out she
was also a dollar it's beaded it is

just too cute I don't know what I'm
gonna put in on but you could put
anything in them you could he good so
