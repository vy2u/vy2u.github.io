I'm gonna do my top 10 nail polishes for
spring I thought since I look all
springy I would show you guys my
favorite nail polishes for spring these
are gonna be pretty much pastel colors
also bright colors just anything that I
think it's just fun or definitely
something I gravitate to in the
springtime I feel like these videos I
used to see these videos all the time
and I don't see anything on nail polish
anymore and we still need to love our
nail polish guys and give videos to them
so we're gonna do that today let's just
hop straight into it i also have my
nifty color wheel here which I'm scared
they're not going to show up true to
color which will be horrible cry the
first nail polish I have to talk about
his or Alize rage this was super popular
on YouTube probably a couple years ago
it's a great color this is kind of a
rose gold it also comes a little silver
though I think it's beautiful i love
metallics and this one doesn't have any
sparkle to it it just is a pretty shine
just a pretty basic color if you want to
do a neutral but you still want it to be
fun I think that's a great option this
is opie eyes mod about you this is one
of my all-time favorite nail polishes
ever i love this polish on the toes and
also the nails i mean i love it on the
toast it looks so cute I don't have the
nicest feet but when I wear this on my
toes my feet actually look cute and not
just like large and gangly these is this
really helps me out and I just think
it's a beautiful color it's that perfect
baby pink that isn't too pepto-bismol
looking doesn't look roast like that it
just looks wonderful I have heard people
talk about this being as as being
streaky but I do not find that to be the
case this is only two coats though and
it comes on streak free it looks opaque
it looks wonderful so I haven't
personally had an issue with streaking
but I have heard about that criticism
it's a wonderful color I would
definitely check it out if you're
looking for something in that color
range or if you're looking at OPI
polishes that is one of the better ones
I apps
they love that polish this is a classic
nail polish this is China glazes
flip-flop fantasy I feel like this
always gets brought out whenever spring
or summer is around it is a neon corally
pink color absolutely beautiful is sense
it's neon it does dry matte on the nails
and it also does chip quite easily this
is a polish that I where knowing it's
only gonna last me about 12 days I just
started using seche vite top coat so I
haven't tried it with that yet but it's
still it just isn't one that's gonna
last long that is not a claim I would
give it it's a beautiful color though it
just screams fun and summer and the
beach and just all things wonderful and
I definitely would check this one out if
you haven't already or if you have it
pull it out give it some love it's
beautiful the next nail polish i have is
by pop beauty this is in the color i
don't even know like this seriously
doesn't have a color on it like a name
at all um this doesn't have a nail
polish color I didn't realize that so
I'm sorry guys but this is my pop beauty
I got this in like a kit I've seen it
around either at Ulta but I bought mine
off of all cosmetics wholesale it's
disappointing anyway this is just a
really pretty hot pink color I think
it's just a classic that classic hot
pink color it's wonderful it's fun it's
bright it just lightens up the nails it
lightens up your outfit makes you look
fun and I really just think this is a
good one but I think just in general if
you can't find that color since it
doesn't have a name I think that any hot
pink color is perfect for spring and
summer just something that is just fun
and bright and makes you feel happy
that's how it makes me feel the next
color is splash of grenadine by Essie
this color is just a really pretty in
between lavender and pink it kind of has
both times it's like a warm toned
purpley lavender color really pretty
this is a great color on the nails when
I want something that's colorful but
it's not just gonna pop out I feel like
this almost blunt into my skin I know
that sounds weird since it's purple but
it just looks so nice and finished on
the nails it's almost like a neutral for
me again I sound crazy it looks just
wonderful i'd highly recommend this
color it
if you're not someone who wants a full
bright on pop of color instead this will
give you that color without being too
in-your-face the next nail polish i have
here is from lime crime this is in the
color lavender e it's a beautiful creamy
opaque light purple color lavender it's
beautiful I love if I don't know what I
want to paint my nails this is something
I'll gravitate to I know there's you
know all the stuff about lime crime but
I have had no problems with this I did
get this again off of all cosmetics
wholesale man I should work for them
this polish was only six dollars on the
website which I was like that's such a
great deal so I bought a couple
different colors and this one's by far
my favorite i love the other ones but
this one I use definitely the most
because i love this purpley lavender
color it's one of my favorites
especially right now hence my eyebrows
and it's just wonderful this is the next
color this is from OPI and this is
you're such a budapest this did come out
with a collection but i have seen it in
stores still so i think you can still
get this even though i think it is
limited-edition limited-edition let's do
some simple addition anyway limited
edition this one reminds me kind of a
splash of grenadine in the sense that
it's a color but it's not going to be
too bright on the nails it's still going
to be something that's i catching but
not like boom baby like freaking people
out it's kind of a mix between like the
lavender color but has a little more
purple in it I definitely call this like
a periwinkle this is another classic one
that's gotten lots of hype on YouTube
this is Sally Hansen's pacific blue this
is just a stunning color this is a color
I don't have anything else in my
collection like it it's this beautiful
purpley blue indigo type of color if you
hold the next two blues I feel like it
looks more purple if you hold it next to
Purple's it looks more blue it just
comes off so vibrant on the nails it's
just beautiful and I really I mean I've
never seen anything like it sometimes
like maybe that's like it and then I get
it home or I look at my pacific blue at
home and i'm like now that wasn't
similar this one if you see it in the
stores it's I it's kind of difficult to
get I like always kind of scan for it
just because i am i'm down to hear what
doesn't even halfway but of course i'm
looking for a backup and i did end up
getting mine
ulta calm but i would definitely highly
recommend this color this is a great one
to pick up if you see that the store and
it's drugstore so what's a great price
this one is like a neon polishes his
life gave me lemons by OPI I believe
this came out with like the neon
collection that came out last summer
this is just a super fun one it's going
to be great with any of those neon ones
i think this info fought fantasy are
just so bright so just fun go to the
beach have fun get a drink hang out I
know to have a good time enjoy your life
that's what this says when you wear it
on your nails I'm young and even if I'm
not young I'm enjoying my life and I'm
gonna do whatever I want and that
includes wearing this nail polish on my
nails it's just fun especially with the
tan any neon colors are gonna look
amazing with the tan so I definitely
think this is just a great one to have
especially when you just want that fun
pop of color in your collection and the
10th polish the last one this is Deborah
Lippmann mermaids dream this is a
beautiful nail polish and this is
different than the other ones most of
the other ones were cream finishes
except for the early rage this is also
kind of a metallic glitter color it's
absolutely beautiful it gives you that
teal kind of minty green color but with
some sparkle and flash to it it's
absolutely beautiful this I find to me
just tip a little bit even though it's
like quite high end it's expensive
polish but if you use a good top coat or
to me it's worth it it's just so
beautiful on the nails and I have not
seen anything quite like this nail
polish at least in what I've you know
been looking at those are all my nail
polishes guys I think these are all
great options I don't think you should
actually go out and buy these ones
except for like Opie eyes mod about you
that one you have to have and so is the
pacific blue one I think those ones are
like must have in that exact brand and
color and everything but just those
types of colors are things that I
definitely gravitate to when spring or
summer or the hot weather hits I think
they're just fun and they make me feel
happy when they're on my meals let me
know what your favorite nail polishes
are in the comments down below or if you
guys have a nail polish video that i can
go check it out i'm always on the hunt
to find new nail polishes or to pick out
old ones in my collection that may
someone else mentions and I'm like oh
yeah that is a good nail polish anyway I
will see you guys in my next video I
hope you're having a wonderful day and
peace out bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
