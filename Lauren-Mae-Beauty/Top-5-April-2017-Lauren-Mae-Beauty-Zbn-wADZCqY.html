Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my April top 5 favorites
this is my version of a monthly
favorites video I like to just kind of
narrow it down pick out just the best of
the best the things I've been loving and
share this with you guys so they're not
too overwhelming sub favourites videos
can just be way too long and I like to
keep it short and simple so let's get
into it I'm going to start with probably
my favorite thing for the month and this
is a lip balm this is from sol de
janeiro and this is the Brazilian kiss
lip balm miss Mel so cos I've been using
this every night before I go to bed and
I've just been obsessive it the smell of
this is amazing I just am starting to
get like scent memory with it and I just
I really like it I also love the way
this feels on the lips so I highly
suggest that this is about $18 which is
definitely higher end but I think it's
worth it I would definitely repurchase
this product yeah it's just really nice
I'd also like if you put a lot of this
on your lips are like overly greasy
looking they have like a little bit of a
shine but it's nothing too glossy and I
like that so I definitely have been
loving this this month the next item I
wanted to talk about is a concealer and
this is from Milani this is the
retouching erase light lifting concealer
I got is at the end of 2016 and it was
in the packaging for so long because I
wanted to do a video reviewing this and
the Milani like foundation but that
foundation is just really dark I've
tried it like one time and I just I
don't know I haven't filled that video I
don't know if I even will anyway I
decided to just bust this out of the
packaging actually start using it and I
really liked it this does have a weird
like sponge tip applicator I'm not a
huge fan of that but the product itself
is really nice this is the color fair
which it's great that this is actually
binding as some brands the fair and the
light varies so differently that you
never know if it's going to actually be
fair enough for your skin but this looks
really nice this reminds me a lot of the
Maybelline fit me and I've really been
enjoying it so if you were thinking
about picking this up it's really nice
this gives about a medium coverage it's
definitely not full coverage but it
definitely has a really nice skin like
texture on the skin and that's what I
really love about it another drugstore
item to talk about this one is from wet
and wild and this is their photo focused
pressed powder these powders are really
and as you can tell this is obviously
not my shade the color I'm talking about
here is golden tan and I really like
this because I use it as a bronzer this
is a very subtle bronzer on my face I
really like it because it just makes me
feel like I have lice to my skin gives
me a little bit of dimension but I don't
feel like it's ever over the top I'm
wearing it today and you can definitely
build this up I feel like it translates
darker on my face than it does like in a
swatch or even in the pan and the
texture of these powders is really
really nice they're very soft and smooth
they have a very like just silky look on
the skin I don't feel like they look
like powder I also have this initiate
that matches my skin tone more it's not
a perfect match I feel like it'll be a
lot better in summer but I do like that
one as well for whatever reason that one
got hard panel and this one didn't so I
don't know what's up with that but I've
really been enjoying that this is a
really cheap way to get just like a
really nice natural glowy love this
reminds me so much of what I use in my
kit my girl on bronzer to kind of do a
similar thing but this is so much
cheaper so for me this works amazing and
I've really been enjoying it and the
lack of Beauty favorite for this video
is a matte eyeshadow it's the color
antique and on a free in general just
Mac product I'm so excited to be using
I've been loving six-plus I've been
loving the next to nothing foundation I
just I'm really into Mac right now but
this is something I've had from Mac for
a long time and this is the color wood
winked in their eyeshadows this is a
Velux pearl shadow now this is the color
I bought because there was so much hype
about it everyone loves this color and I
just was like okay it's like a shimmery
kind of coppery brown like what's the
big deal I don't know I didn't get it
and I still don't quite get it to the
same level of everyone else but I really
have been enjoying this diet shadow
which is super weird because again I
just it just wasn't very special to me I
feel like so many Mac shadows are like
that it's like I see them in the pan and
I'm like but on the eyes they look so
beautiful this is what I'm wearing on my
lips today and really what I love this
color for is just a one shadow look I
like to put something like in the crease
a little bit so technically it's two
shadows but this just all over
the lid blend it out even little bit of
shimmer blend it up and out I think just
gives such a sultry just warm really
beautiful look it's not overly warm
which I like it's not like an orange
shadow or something with a lot of red
orange in it it just adds a little bit
of warmth and I've really been enjoying
this so if you're looking for something
just really easy everyday and something
else is going to give you almost like a
soft sultry look this is a perfect
shadow I am excited to be wearing this
for the summer I'm excited to put this
on a bride I think I'm going to use this
in my test makeup for her it's just so
pretty I really really love it so those
are my three favorites keeping it short
and simple I do have a few extra things
at the end first thing I want to mention
is a drink man Sam has been making these
lemonade mint drinks it's like a frozen
lemonades mint drink anyway we
absolutely love them they are delicious
I'm going to leave the recipe link down
below I'm also going to link the channel
that I got the original recipe from I
have tweaks the recipe tell me and say
I'm like to drink it but I just want to
give proper credit so I'll have that
linked if you want to check that out but
I also have the recipe just written if
you just want the recipe the mint in it
is so refreshing and you actually put
like full bit leaves and you blend them
up that's why it's so green it's from
those middling it's just so refreshing
such a great summer drink since it's
starting to heat up I just highly
suggest this you can also put a little
bit of alcohol in this and that would be
delicious as well when we were making
this drink Sam was like I put this into
my favorites too so it's definitely a
good one and honestly I don't really
know it kind of places to make a drink
like this I know when we are in career
with the big thing but I haven't really
had this a ton of places and I think
that everyone should sell this because I
buy it anywhere I weigh a couple more
just like quicker favorites
me and Sam listen to a podcast this
month it was called s town which stands
for town we went into did his
family for Easter so we listened to it
on the way there and finished it on the
way back and it was really really good
it's kind of like a second spin-off off
of this American life and cereal if you
don't know about those I'll leave them
listed down below too because I highly
suggest them but this follows a man in a
small town I believe in Arkansas I'm not
mistaken and he
take the reporter and talks about how
there might be an unsolved murder in
their towns the story just kind of goes
from there and you find out all this
other stuff it's kind of a murder
mystery it's kind of like a little slice
of life and like documentary ish so I
will leave that down below definitely
listen to the trailer I guess if you
want to like get an idea of what it's
about but it's very interesting I
thought it was really well done I really
like pieces like that that make you
question the characters are very
endearing and I just really enjoyed it
so I highly suggest that podcast and
then last year I just wanted to retaught
about the shows that I did make it been
since they are going to be airing on May
4th and May 14th the first one is second
widest Club I'm super excited I just
wanted to remind you guys that it's
coming up and it's still a favorite
because it's about to be here and I'm so
excited I'm going to the premiere on
Thursday so we can like watch it
together I'm doing Katie's make it for
it so I'm really excited about that and
then what happens at the Abbey the other
show that I was lucky enough to work on
that is also premiering on E on the 14th
so again I'll leave trailers down below
for those if you want to check them out
and you haven't yet but I'm super
excited it's so cool to see the like
previews for the promos for it on
entertainment on different Instagram
accounts and also on e on the like site
as well it's so cool so yeah that's
everything guys I hope you guys had a
great month I hope you guys are doing
