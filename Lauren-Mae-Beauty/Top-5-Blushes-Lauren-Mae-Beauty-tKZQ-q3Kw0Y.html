start of again another new series i'm
going to i think it's fun to do serious
things but i'm going to be doing my top
five favorites and so i'm going to be
doing my top five favorite like
groupings of products and maybe it's
blushes bronzers that type of thing but
it also could work for a specific
product maybe I have a lot of
specifically I'm thinking of like color
pop I shadows or coastal scents hot pots
or things like that that I have a lot of
I'm gonna do like my top five of those
as well so this is just something that
I'm going to be sprinkling in I thought
this would just be fun I wanted with
this series to pick things that were
really my top five I was going to do top
10 but I thought top 5 really these are
the items that if I was cleaning out my
collection there's no way that these 5
i'm getting rid of or these are the ones
that i've used the most out of my
collection I've gone back to the most
that I would bring with me if I just
need a fail-proof makeup this is what I
would bring so this video specifically
is going to be on blushes so let's just
get straight into my top 5 favorite so
my first favorite not in any particular
order is this blush right here by
amazing cosmetics this is in the color
mucho mango it is a dusty burnt orange
type of color it's so beautiful i love
this color because it just looks so nice
on the skin i love warm tone colors
especially with my blue eyes when i put
this on i feel like it really just
live-ins up my face it makes it look
glowy and a little bit of brawn since it
is a deeper color but it just looks
beautiful in the skin I've definitely
used this blush quite a bit I know this
is a pricey blush and I just went for it
i just thought on the website was like
you know what I'm gonna get it and i
love it this is a matte blush i love it
i think it's beautiful i definitely
recommend it if you're looking for an
orange e colored blush to definitely
it's kind of orange EPG but i would
definitely check this out if you're in
the market for something like this
another one of my favorite blushes is
this one bike or lactic now this is in
the color milan and
is a beautiful plummy mavi color this is
probably the most cool toned color out
of all the ones i have i usually do like
warm ones but this one just looks so
great on a skin it looks super natural
it just is that perfect if you want
something more cool toned flush of color
on the cheeks it's going to look like a
neutral color it's kind of a nude color
although it is still pink I really love
this color I don't have anything in my
collection quite like this I got this in
a box too so it was just perfect how it
worked out that I got this blush I think
it's wonderful the quality of this
product is amazing I know girl lactic is
like kind of starting to get talked
about more but this is a great quality
blush I know girl lactic is expensive um
but it's wonderful i love this i will
want this in my collection all the time
when we had to bring your blushes for
school this is one of the ones that i
brought in as a neutral color one just
because i love it that much kind of
staying along that neutral line this is
tarts blush in the color exposed I
absolutely I absolutely love this color
this is such a nice rosy dusty pink
color that's going to go on the cheeks
and just look very natural but it just
has this beautiful effect on the skin so
you're going to put it on and you're
going to think what this color is not
going to look that great and you put it
there and it just live-ins the face up
without being clownish or looking like
too crazy of a color if you are looking
for that no makeup makeup look or just a
very natural simple look but something's
still special about it this is going to
give you that I absolutely love this
it's been raved about and there's a
reason because it's a great blush this
one is a must-have in anyone's
collection I know again these are a lot
of these are pricey so sorry guys but I
really do enjoy this blush I don't
regret purchasing this blush and I
definitely suggest it for everyone it's
wonderful finally a drugstore option
here this is milan ease powder blush in
the color 01 romantic rose now this is I
believe a dupe for the last one I just
showed you tarts exposed but I
absolutely love this color it's
beautiful on the skin I need
used quite a bit of this as well it used
to be more pronounced the Rose imprint
in it but I've worn it down because I've
worn it so much this color is just
beautiful again on the skin it gives
that same type of dusty rose color to
the cheeks where you're not putting too
much color but just enough to give your
face that hint of not it below because
there these are all matte so far but
just some life to your cheeks and just
make them look beautiful so if you don't
want to do the tart one I suggest this
one you don't technically need both but
of course mmm I'm an addict so I have
both and I would definitely recommend
this one I know this was a limited
edition but I'm pretty sure they are
bringing them back and I've seen people
start talking about these really
recently so i would definitely hit up
your drug store and try to find this one
and then the last color i have here is
illamasqua powder blush in the color
lover I've heard people talk about this
but not a ton it is such a beautiful
peachy pink color I love this color just
to wear anytime in the daytime just any
look I love it it's warm it just gives
me warm so from doing a warm look on my
eyes I love to use this I even love to
use this with like purple tones I just
think it's so beautiful it looks great
on the skin I highly recommend this
color it's almost like a creamsicle
color it's beautiful on the skin I don't
know how this would work for darker skin
tones honestly it might look a little
ashy but i believe for a lot of skin
tones this will work and it is just
beautiful on the skin I highly recommend
this one this one is going to give you a
little bit of a brighter color but still
quite neutral peach I feel like is a
neutral color a lot of people like that
color on their cheeks and this one is
just absolutely stunning I know that
illamasqua is not sold at sephora any
longer that I got this one it still was
so i would definitely check out the
website it's a little bit harder to get
though those are my five top blushes
that i have in my collection i know that
a lot of those were high-end so i'm
sorry but i do like to buy a lot of high
end makeup personally that's where i
like to spend my money i'd rather spend
twenty dollars on something then
like 15 on to drug store items that's
just me personally but those are the
suggestions that I would give if someone
was asked me what blushes you love those
are the ones that I would automatically
think of and start listing in my brain I
hope you guys like this series I'm going
to be trying to put up quite a bit of
these I just think it's fun I'm a
product person I love products of
talking about products so I hope this
will help give you some ideas of things
that you you know might like or maybe
you won't like it after seeing swatches
or whatever so let me know and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
