sorry again about the glare and the
glasses but you know I like to see
sometimes in my videos I try to keep a
50-50 anyway today I thought it was
appropriate since I'm wearing really
dark lips they're like a purple blue
metallic color I thought I would do my
top five but with my favorite dark
colored lipsticks it's spring but that
doesn't mean you can't wear dark lips
plus I went to monsterpalooza today and
that is I'm wearing this look here and I
probably was like super tame compared to
some people so I thought I would just
use my makeup for today as a video for
you guys and please forgive me if it's
not perfect I've been wearing this since
like nine o'clock in the morning and
ivory applied it and stuff but you know
bear with me if it's not perfect now
there is a trend of these i usually like
purpley darker lipsticks and this isn't
for everyone so I totally understand if
you don't care about this or anything
like that I'm gonna stop rambling
actually I'm gonna say one more thing oh
and also these are actual lipsticks that
I would wear out like I wear this type
of makeup out if I'm feeling like it I
love makeup and so I love makeup on like
all levels even this like I think this
is super cool and I like it a lot so
these are also colors that i actually
have worn out and actually we're just on
it though that out there but let's get
into the first lipstick in no order ok
the first lipstick i have here is a max
factor and this is I think hippie chic
or no oh I don't even know what it's
called it's not on the bottom here it's
number 56 though I got this off of you
guessed it all cosmetics wholesale I
believe max factor is like a UK brand
it's like covergirl but UK version or
something that's what I believe anyway
this is a very pretty really deep purple
it looks gonna right in the camera but
it is a purple color I'll swatch it here
for you guys that is what it looks like
and it is a really pretty color i think
the opaqueness on this is really nice
this also doesn't have like a funky
smell it just is neutral which I'd also
love about it this is one of my favorite
ones though it's not super opaque I mean
it is quite opaque but it's not gonna be
like completely like concealer but dark
or something I really like this color
and I worn this one quite a bit and it
was really cheap on the website i don't
know if it's still on there I'm not very
good about like linking stuff but I will
try to link all of these in the
description box below if I can i really
love this max factor one the next one i
have is also drug sir this is revlon's
matte lipstick in number 10 wine not
this is probably the most read toned one
I have here so that's it in the tube and
then swatched it is that one there it's
very pretty it's definitely I would say
a pretty true wine color it has a little
bit of berry in it and what I love about
this is that it is mad I feel like bat
lips but also dark lips are also super
popular right now like for people who
aren't just like gothic or into darker
things like normal or more normal girls
this is sounding bad anyway I feel like
more and more people are wearing darker
lips and they're becoming more trendy so
I think this is a good kind of like
beginner one it's not super dark well
its eyes are because it could be I guess
but it's still really pretty and it is
more red tone instead of purple so it
looks more natural like a darker red or
something but that one's really great
and matte lipsticks at the drugstore are
awesome revlon's formula is really nice
I really like it all these are drug
store except for one so that's good a
little different than my blush video
this one right here this is smitten by
covergirl this is number 310 and this is
not as dark as any of them like you're
gonna see next to them this one is a
purple I'm off color and it's not super
dark again this would be a great one for
beginners but it I don't know to me this
is definitely not just like your
everyday color I like wearing this one a
lot especially like early days of fall
where it's still kind of hot outside and
wearing a deep lip might feel weird but
I mean I would wear a lip I'd wear
anything I want to anytime I want to
that's my style but this one's really
pretty especially for beginners I will
say that this covergirl one definitely
has like a lipstick kind of taste and it
definitely sticks around that taste does
that's the one thing i don't like about
this one i also got this off of all
cosmetics wholesale again i'll link them
down below if i can find these things
cuz i honestly don't know if anything's
limited edition but i mean now that
they're more popular you can probably do
any of these
anyway this video is quite distracted
okay and then another one that i have
here this is from sleek cosmetics and
this is in the color mulberry this one
is really pretty as well and this one's
definitely i'd say the closest to black
and definitely the darkest out of
everything i'll show you it in the tube
sorry that's it in the tube that is it
on the hand now it is a very dark dark
dark mulberry color I really like this
look I just think it's pretty and I
personally like a dark purple almost
over a dark red something about it I
don't know just gets me I like it I like
that look especially with a really
uncomplicated I kind of like what I'm
doing here i am wearing quite a warren g
warm tone color in the crease today
that's just specifically with this look
I wanted that but if you just did a
really pretty mad I with any of these
lip colors maybe a warm brown and the
crease like something like Matt soft
brown and then like a graphic winged
liner you can even leave winged liner
out just have nice lashes I think that
would look so good and it kind of
neutralizes the dark lip if that makes
any sense so instead of looking like
girl you're crazy dare I say the word
classy here I think it looks kind of
edgy but still classic looking it's a
classic way to do it it's the I feel
like the best most clean way to wear
that look where it can still look put
together in trendy while still being
quite out there if that makes sense we
are on to the fifth one here this is the
last one and this is occ slipped art and
techno pagan this is what i am wearing
on my lips and i love it this was
limited edition so i'm pretty sure you
can't get it anymore it is such a
beautiful color i got this on her
honeymoon and i actually wore it in san
francisco on her honeymoon and they kind
of wearing it today i have a great
husband who would still go out with me
and loves me here and things all acute
so um he lets me have fun and he's not
ashamed of it i love him this color is
just so beautiful in what i think is
just so unique besides the color because
it is kind of this in-between of like a
royal purple and like a dark blue it's
also metallic which I just love it has
this much
election to it it's so unique I'm so
glad I got it a little this goes a long
way this is the only lip tar I 09 I just
went old and didn't do anything else but
I really love this product I think it it
stays pretty well as well I mean I wore
it all day today and I touched up I
think only once and then I touched up
before filmed but I think it lasted
pretty dang well and I thought I would
bring up to and just show you guys what
I actually used to line my lips with
this because obviously for that color
you know I don't have any lip liners
that go with that so i use this eyeliner
from urban decay and this is in the
color rock star and it is just a really
dark purple that's it next to it so i
use that to line my lips this morning
well somehow i lost the other liner that
I used kind of now but I used a brighter
more metallic purple today to kind of
line my lips once I wanted to film both
of those works really well so if you
have eyeliners that match I mean you can
use those two as lip liners especially
if you don't worry by that specific
color for that lip color I know as well
that color pop has a lot of like more
crazy colored lip liners and they're
actually affordable as well so those are
I think they're five yeah everything's
five dollars they're five dollars and
then OCC also has lip pencils but again
those are going to be more sense that
they're going to be about like 19 I want
to say anyway enough about that those
are my five favorites and I absolutely
love all of them let me know in the
comment down below if these are colors
that you would wear or they're totally
not colors you would wear I think it's
always interesting to find out where
everyone else is like limits on comfort
with makeup are everyone has like a
neutral to them or a normal for them and
for me this is a little past normal but
totally wearable so I just wanna know
what your guys's level of wearable is
and i think that's it i will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
