5 video I haven't done one in a long
time and you know I just thought I want
to do something fun that I haven't done
in a while and that's just different
than just project panning and just
random crap so I thought this would be
fun this is going to be my top 5
drugstore base item so anything I use to
kind of make my not flawless but my face
so concealers or foundations or powders
or anything like that that's like skin
tone colored products that help me
create a great base for my the rest of
my color cosmetics to go on top of so
let's just get into it all of these
items i absolutely love I'm I love all
of them I repurchased every single one
of them over and over again and i highly
recommend them for you to try out
especially if you are a good candidate
for each product so the first product
don't want to talk about is this
foundation by number 7 beauty this is
the beautifully matte foundation this is
in the color cool vanilla which is the
lightest shade I absolutely love it I
love a matte finish foundation I don't
like to go to Dewey and if I never look
dewy it's because I'm greasy because I
don't powder throughout the day and so I
do get a little Dewey as you could say
throughout the day but I love the way
this is this is like my third or fourth
bottle of this product it's like 1399
you can get it at walgreens and target I
know for sure it's just great it's SPF
15 I just love it I love the way it
applies I like using it with a brush and
I actually love using it with a Beauty
Blender just because my skin has become
kind of combination oily so I find that
I get dry flakes around the edges of my
skin but in the middle I definitely get
oily throughout the day in my t-zone so
I find that this product just gives me
that really nice full finished face and
a lot of the times i will mix this with
a lighter colored foundation just
because it is so dark it's not like
super dark but it can be a little dark
on me depending so i'll do that but i
really like this definitely check this
out if you're ever like around the
number 7 beauty items i think it's a
great value for the money let me know if
you've tried it down below too and you
love it but i just love this foundation
i love
I love it I love it almost on the
opposite side foundation wise this is a
BB cream by Rimmel London I love this BB
cream I have bought this BB cream like
five plus x it's great I used to buy it
in the old packaging this is new
packaging and this is also the mount
formula not the original I used a ton of
the original and then when they came out
with the new formulations and then the
new packaging I decided to get Matt
because again i do get oily and I don't
touch up throughout the day I don't
personally notice a huge difference in
the matte formula versus the original
first dang power anything like that but
I just love this BB cream it's just so
nice I think this one's a little more
runny than the original one that's the
only thing i can think but i just think
this is a great BB cream it's way more
like it has a lot of pigmentation to it
although it is lighter coverage and it
just works really well for me I think
this is a great value as well it's only
like 5 99 maybe at the drugstore rimmel
london products are really pretty
affordable considering drugstore prices
um if you want to see a whole rant video
about the drugstore prices yeah I just I
can't even handle drug stores right now
but um this is something that I
absolutely love I know I can trust and
if I'm doing just a really like
seriously simple day I'll put a primer
on and put this on and I'm good to go
it's just great if you haven't tried
this and you love BB crimps I would
definitely give this a go and if you
don't like it it's not going to waste
your money or that much of it but I
think it's just a great product so
definitely love this product would
repurchase love love love let's brighten
things up a little bit shall we another
rimmel london product this is the stay
matte powder by Rimmel London this is
just in the translucent color I
absolutely love this powder I have
repurchases again a ton of times and I
just think it sets my face really well I
like a powder not like a powdery look
where it looks cakey but I do again like
a matte finish and this just does that
for me I just love it so it's a great
one it's a staple in my you know
collection I'm not saying that this is
just the best powder out there that it's
so
silky smooth I'm saying that this powder
gets the job done and is just something
I can rely on that I love to use because
I know ok that one's gonna work i'll
have like three powders and i'll pick
this one over other ones because some
powders although they may feel better or
look better on the skin initially this
one stays good on the skin the whole day
long so i love this powder and i will
definitely repurchase the last two items
are concealers and they're both by
Maybelline I think Maybelline does
amazing concealer so the first one here
this is my maybelline fit me this is in
the color fair this concealer is
absolutely amazing i love it i use it
under the eyes and i use it to kind of
highlight the face i just love it it's
so good um if you haven't tried this
concealer definitely get on it i buy
mine i try to buy mine on all cosmetics
wholesale only because i think i got two
on there for three dollars each which
usually this is like a 999 or buy one
get one half off or whatever but I just
couldn't beat that deal 246 yes please I
just love it I will probably always
repurchase this it's just great i don't
think i need anything else I don't
battle huge under-eye circles and this
just gives me enough brightness or the
brightness that I'm totally content with
and I just love it I love it and then
another concealer here this is the
maybelline dream lumi concealer this one
is in the color just ivory i've gotten
the color radiant though which is a
little bit more peachy these just are
again a great texture on the skin i feel
like these are a little thicker than the
maybelline fit me that's a little bit of
a thinner consistency but i just think
these perform so well they just look
great on the skin and i just love this i
have a backup of this and a backup of
the other Mabel anyone like obsessed and
I don't again I'm not someone who just
buys a ton of backups of stuff I don't
think like unless I really like it then
that's when I'm like okay yes get it but
other than that I'm just I love to buy
like tons of different products so for
me to go back to a product is a big deal
I absolutely love this get it try it try
to find out on sale again I got mine off
of all cosmetics wholesale I think for
really cheap too so definitely try that
out that website out if you want
products for cheap I
no I feel like there's like kids
contested weather stuff on there is
legit but um I don't have any like doubt
that they're Maybelline and drugstore
products are real it's more like their
Mac products but anyway again I always
get sidetracked guys always that is
everything for this video let me know if
you've used these down below if you like
them or if you don't or what your
favorite products from the drugs are for
the face let me know down below so maybe
I can find some new products I will see
you in my next video guys thanks for
hanging out with me bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
