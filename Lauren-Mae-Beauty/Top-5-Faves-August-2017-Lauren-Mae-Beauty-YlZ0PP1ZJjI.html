it's Laurie thank you so much for
watching this is going to be my August
top 5 favorites I can't believe the
month is gone but it has gone and we're
going into September it's turning into
fall
it'll be October the November then
December Christmas holiday I can't
believe how fast the air is going it's
freaking me out anyway though let's get
into you my top 5 favorites I only have
three beauty products this month which i
think is pretty nice I have been just
kind of using my collection I did buy
quite a few things kind of two months
ago or so and I've just been slowly
using those items enjoying them seeing
what I really liked first off I want to
mention the milk makeup bronzing stick
this is in the color baked they do have
two different shades and I am wearing it
today this is just such a nice product I
don't feel like cream bronzers get a lot
of love but this one is so nice I feel
like it blends into the skin so well it
looks like skin it's very natural it's
perfect for someone on the go I think
you get a ton of product for the price
you would I mean this would take forever
to go through and it just looks so nice
it blends out beautifully I love that it
doesn't leave like a sticky finish I
wouldn't say it necessarily turns in to
a powder though if you're more dry skin
you might not even have to really set
this that much I just think it's so easy
it goes with the brand so well with that
like simple effortless makeup and I've
just really been enjoying it so I do
suggest this if you're looking at it I
know they have a set to where it's like
this and their sunshine oil and if you
wanted to try a smaller version of it
that way you could see if you really
liked it that might be a good option as
well I will have everything linked
though if you want to find links to any
of this stuff next is another thing that
came from that Sephora haul this is from
bareMinerals and it's the gloss in sugar
oh my gosh I'm so sorry about my voice
still I was a little worried about this
color being a little too light for my
lips but it's been working out great
I've really been enjoying it
I really like wearing this with just
like a lip liner and then this or just
this on its own you guys know I like
really effortless lips so this has been
really nice I probably would get another
color maybe something a little bit
darker but this one's been great and I
do really like it the formula is like
right in the middle of something that's
not sticky and something that is sticky
so it doesn't feel too like oh my gosh
on but it does stand your lips a little
bit longer so I do really like it and
I've been enjoying it and the last is
something that I've had for a while this
is Smashbox a cover shot ablaze eye
palette I think I did a tutorial or
something with this if I did I will
leave it linked I have this in my makeup
basket for the month and that's why I've
rediscovered it I think the color
selection is really nice it's just great
I really love this color I love that has
a darker color this is such a pretty
I mean it's so pretty you could do so
much with this and something I've really
been loving lately to are just smaller
palettes I love that this is so tiny but
it packs so much in it you get so many
options you can do so much in here I
feel like this gives you just as many
looks if not more than the naked heat
palette so I really like this I think
the quality is great they're super
pigmented they blend really nice and
I've really been enjoying it
we got the beauty favorites knocked out
pretty fast my next favorite for the
month these are from Trader Joe's and
they're the just mango slices these are
literally just mangoes there's nothing
else in it ingredients dried mangoes and
it's so delicious I'm a little weird
when it comes to texture so sometimes
like dried fruit like us freaks me out I
can't do it I'm trying to eat one right
now
so they got anyway these are so good
because they aren't like extra sweet and
some of them are really sweet some of
them are a little bit tangy and tart so
good I think this is a great snack if
you're looking for something natural if
you're looking for something that's like
a whole food or if you're looking for
something that's more clean so good
these are $2.99 for a ton of it I've got
quite a few of these I have like two
more bags of these in my house right now
because I love them that much so you
really can wear like a healthy snack or
something to satisfy sweet tooth that
isn't going to be like chocolate or I
don't know processed sugars this is a
really good one the rest of my
favourites are kind of crazy so it's a
little bit more than five things but
we're just going to go for it next is
Instagram I've really been enjoying my
Instagram
I've been trying to post every single
day and just trying to put like better
pictures up something that's all just a
little bit more appealing visually and
kind of has a better aesthetic to it so
I hope you guys have been enjoying that
and if you don't follow me on instagram
maybe follow me on Instagram or
something I don't know that'd be cool
I've just been sharing a good mixture of
my life and like what I've been doing
with me and Sam but also some of my work
and stuff so I hope you guys have been
enjoying that because I really have been
enjoying putting up some good pictures
and um it just looks really good like I
really like the way it's going I also
have a few events that I've been
enjoying this month so it was Sam's
birthday month his birthday is August
24th and we went up to the Central Coast
so we took the 101 and to the one up the
Pacific Coast Highway and we went up to
Cambria and then ragged point just for
the day we drove up on a Thursday night
his actual birthday and then went to
this really really cute little beach
like Motel it was literally right on the
beach it's so pretty again if you've
seen my Instagram you saw a couple
pictures and you will keep seeing some
because we took a bunch of different
pictures it was so funny - like a little
photo shoot so we'd have some cute ass
Instagram pictures no shame man they're
so cute I can't wait to show you guys
more of them so that was so cute I will
leave the hotel we say that link down
below because honestly such a cute
little place I felt like it was really
reasonably priced and it was so themed
throughout the entire thing it was just
such a cool place I would definitely say
there again if I was going up the one
sadly because of all the rain we got
early in the year the one is shut down
right above ragged point you can't drive
it the like landslide is totally cut off
the one so you have to drive all the way
around so we couldn't go all the way up
to like fix or anything it's just so
pretty though I love the northern coast
honor 50-year anniversary we drove up to
San Francisco and took the one up just
last Christmas we also drove up to San
Francisco right before we went back home
for holiday and so going back again it
just it just brings a lot of awesome
memories up we really like nature we
love being outside and we just love
traveling - we love car rides and road
trips and all that so it was just a
really good time even though it was
really short the other event I really
enjoyed this month was seeing a short
film that I worked on premiere at
fest this is really recent again if you
follow me on instagram you saw pictures
but the film and natural that I worked
on it is finished and they showed it at
the half fest which is really awesome to
see it finally it was really fun too
because we hung out with like some of
the cast's and some of the crew like the
director and just other friends that
I've made I'm throwing find everything
we hung out afterward and that was
really just a good time too so I'm gonna
leave the trailer link down below for
that film if you want to check it out
and see a little bit more I know I've
talked about this on my channel before
so if you guys have followed me from
there and I've heard me talk about how
excited I am for it I'm excited for you
guys to be able to see the trailer and
just see a little bit more about like
what it's about a little more intrigue
you know but I'm just happy to see that
going I'm really happy for Amy the
director I'm so happy for the actors
they did such an amazing job and I'm
really proud of that so yeah those are
my events that are my favorites and
let's talk about media because there is
some media I got to talk about guys all
right first off Game of Thrones I'm so
sad that it's over I'm so sad I cannot
wait for the last season we watched it
last night with Sunday so I finished
watching it last night like midnight I'm
so glad I was like an hour and a half
long episode is gonna go down
though anyway I love Game of Thrones I
really enjoyed the season and the season
finale the other show we've been
watching is Ozark on Netflix that's
actually been really good as well if
you're looking for something suspenseful
Jason Bateman does a really good job I
know a lot of people are kind of like
questioning him being in a role that
isn't comedy but he does an amazing job
he's a great actor and he had a really
big hand in this I think he directed for
sure the first episode um but it's
definitely a project he's been very
involved in and I think it's really good
to apart we haven't finished it yet but
we are good like seven or eight episodes
in so I've really been enjoying it can't
wait to see how it finishes but you know
Game of Thrones definitely takes
precedence over like everything in our
lives there are these creepy noises
alright and then last for media we have
some music that I've been enjoying I
don't think it could mention music
without mentioning Taylor Swift in her
new song look what you made me do
I've been enjoying it I'm rocking out to
it I will also leave the music video
linked down below
since that was really Sunday yeah I like
it I think it's pretty good I mean it's
not like my favorite thing but I'm so
excited to see her new CD I I just love
her music so yeah I'm a fan I'm a fan
and then on top of that I've really been
enjoying Billy Joel I'm just like
obsessed with the song moving out I'm
obsessed with only the good die young
it's still rocking wrong with me Vienna
I don't know I've really been enjoying
it obviously piano man but the other
four kind of like more of my favorites
especially moving out like Anthony when
I accept the girl Silverstone obsessive
I'm so obsessively so yeah Billy Joel I
will leave my playlist for Spotify
that's like my new summer playlist I've
already lived it once before but I
continue to add things to it so if you
want to check out what I've been
listening to you can check out that
playlist and then the other person I've
really been enjoying is Miguel he's so
good he just I really like like more rmv
Raffy type of stuff and he just does
such a good job he writes all his own
songs too which i think is really cool I
really like the song coffee I really
like the song Shore thing I really like
know I like his stuff it's just so good
guys so check that out if you are
interested and then last I kind of
forgot which is horrible but I really
wanted to say thank you to everyone
who's new and everyone who's been here I
feel like my channel has grown a lot
this month and I'm just so excited I'm
so excited for where it's going and I'm
just really passionate about it I feel
like YouTube if you're a creator you
know its ups and downs and sometimes you
have a lot of success and sometimes you
don't and it always feels really good
when you're in one of those swells so
I'm just really excited for it I really
hope you guys have been enjoying the
