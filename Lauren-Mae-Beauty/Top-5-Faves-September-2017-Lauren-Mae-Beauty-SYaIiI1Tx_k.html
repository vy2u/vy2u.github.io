Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna do my top 5 favorites
for September I can't believe the month
has gone so fast it's so exciting that
it is finally cooling down in LA it's
still like hot sometimes but the
nighttime is getting cold we're gonna be
so close to the holiday season coming up
and it's crazy I'm like sometimes with
the releases that we get for a holiday
they come out so early that I almost
don't associate them like with actual
Christmas or Thanksgiving because by
that time a lot of the times it can
already be sold out so especially the
things that I want you know that aren't
like the bigger kits that are being more
mass-produced so anyway enough of that
let's get into my top 5 favorites for
the month first off I want to say that
my number one favor for the month and
like so far in my life for YouTube is
all the growth on my channel I'm like
frothing at the mouth I want to say
thank you to all the new subscribers and
I also want to say thank you to everyone
who's been here from the beginning or
you know has stayed with me and watches
my videos just thank you guys so much
I'm so excited for this new chapter in
my channel it's been very overwhelming
and exciting in a lot of great ways and
I just want to say thank you welcome and
I hope you guys continue to enjoy the
content I work really hard on my channel
and I know all creators do I try to do
the upload I've posted so many videos
and it is just so exciting and so crazy
to see such a boost in views and
subscribers and really the biggest thing
for me is the fact that you know what I
consider my message I guess or my
thoughts to be so well received by so
many people I really thought that my
channel is so nice that I didn't think
that I would ever get to too many
subscribers so although hopefully we'll
be at 15,000 soon although 15,000 is so
many it's also not like millions but
it's
exciting that there are so many people
out there that want to hear content and
related content to violence and trying
to shop your stash and just enjoy things
that you already have as well as talk
about new makeup and love it kind of
that mix so that's just so exciting with
things like the makeup addiction video
and just as my channels growing I'm
realizing that you know there are more
people watching it and this is going out
to so many more people and it still just
hasn't quite sunk in like I'm still in
the realization process it's really
crazy and I do I feel like there's a
little bit more pressure on me not from
you guys just like it's just thinking
about it that there are just so many
more people watching anyway I don't know
I'm delving into that it's still a
favorite I'm so excited and I just
wanted to say welcome and thank you so
much I'm so glad you guys are enjoying
the content and I'm trying really hard
of course though if you guys have any
suggestions for content you do want to
see from me leave them down below and I
will definitely make sure to do that
I think that's everything I really want
to touch on on that I mean I could go on
for days and days but I'll try not to
when it comes to beauty products I do
have three favorites this month and I
feel like that's pretty small
considering I just did a haul but I feel
like I haven't been able to use that
much of that stuff enough to like call
it a favorite and I'm still in the
process of reviewing some things one of
my favorites though that I just have
absolutely been loving is this gloss
from Fenty Beauty this is the Fenty glow
gloss balm I love this lip gloss it
retails for $18 so it is a bit pricey I
love the packaging and then just the
gloss itself it's not sticky but I find
that it stays on my lips pretty well the
color is just so beautiful it gives my
lips just enough color that they don't
look dead like after having a foundation
on but they also don't like too
pigmented it's just easy I don't have to
try hard and although I'm not wearing it
today this is what I have been reaching
for so much I even put it on Sam because
he was like he had really dry lips and
he didn't have a chapstick so I was like
oh well I happen to class and since it's
not like too colorful and we weren't
like getting out of the car or anything
also
who cares but anyway I've just really
been liking this product I think it's
really great it's one of those things
though that I feel like you're either
gonna really like it or you're gonna be
like it's just a gloss like who cares
and at the same time it is it's like
it's just a really great gloss and I'm
sure there's some from the drugstore
that are really nice but for me this is
just so perfect it's worth the money
because I'll use it every single day and
I like simple products like that so I'm
really happy to pick this up and I'm
glad I like it as much as I do
it's a great one next I wanted to talk
about a highlighter and I feel like I'm
not that into highlighters usually but
if I look at my last videos and my looks
I've been doing I have been using a lot
more highlighter than normal this one
here is from Lancome and it's the dual
finish highlighter in 0/1 shimmering
buff this is what it looks like it's
just so beautiful the reason dual finish
is in its title is because you can use
this wet or dry I honestly haven't quite
used it like wet wet but I really really
like the way it looks dry on the skin
and then the way I have been using it
too which i think would just amplify if
you use it like actually wet is I will
go over it and spray down my face with
my mac fix+ which is my next favorite
but I almost made my face down with that
and then I just feel like this really
sinks into the skin it looks very very
shiny but it doesn't look too much you
guys know what I like a more subtle
highlight I know that's not that trendy
but I find that this is just a nice
in-between I can go really hardcore on
it if I want to but I also can have it I
don't know just be a little bit more the
color on this is also just something a
little bit different than what I have in
my collection it looks almost like a
white gold but it doesn't have that
really like harsh gold to white reflex
which I feel like a lot of highlighters
can have I don't know it just has some
dimension to it I don't find that this
accentuates my texture even though it
can go a little bit more on the metallic
side I've just been really really
enjoying this and
I do suggest it if you were looking into
it not that anyone needs any more
highlighters but this one has been
really nice and I've really been
reaching for it this month and my last
beauty favorite is mac fix+
this thing is just so good I'm I want to
say that mac fix+ has been in one of my
previous like monthly favorites videos
but it's just so good I love the smell
of this this sprayer actually could be
improved to me but I'll take it it's
still good I used to not like this for
like setting my makeup at the end of my
makeup because I didn't want to get oily
and this doesn't like set your makeup
like something with a lot of alcohol and
it would but what I love about this now
is that I do like more of a skin like
finish
I do like more of a dewy complexion and
this just really does transform the
products that you have on your skin and
meld them into it it's just a beautiful
product and I have this in my kit but
I've been taking it out of my kit using
it on myself so I need to go pick up
another one so I have one and one and I
know I would use this everyday I also
think like seriously mac fix+ is the
best thing to foil eyeshadows like if
you're gonna foil eyeshadows not all
setting sprays are created equal when it
comes to that and mac fix+ does an
amazing job on really heightening the
shine and sheen of those metallic shades
that you want to pop on the lid yeah I
just love this it's just such a favorite
it's so good in so many ways so that's
it for beauty favorites and then I don't
really have any like music or movie
favorites just kind of the same things
I've been watching and listening to the
same playlist that I've launched before
for movies I saw it this month I thought
it was pretty good and it's not like a
favorite but I just like talking to you
guys I mean I didn't just like it though
I also liked the movie mother and I know
a lot of people didn't so if you've seen
that I'd love to hear your thoughts on
it
I really I don't wanna say enjoyed the
movie because there are a lot of like
really graphic things and I don't love
every single aspect like I don't think
the special effects were that good but I
then the story resonated with me and I
felt a lot of emotions from it and I
thought it was really good in that way
so I guess my
is kind of a favorite I also rewatched
Pan's Labyrinth and it's just so good
guys is so good I love that movie
and then just for like some cool
experience things that I've done this
month I wit karaoking for the first time
that was so so fun it was like Asian
style so we had our own room and it was
just a good night with friends and
celebrating birthdays and stuff
well one birthday not multiple birthdays
and we also went back to Arizona which
is really awesome it was just kind of a
spur-of-the-moment trip because I know
that October is gonna be a really busy
month when it comes to makeup for me it
already is like starting to kind of fill
up so I knew there wasn't gonna be a way
for us to really get out there without
like missing jobs and I can't do that at
the moment so we had last weekend and we
just did it and it was good to see
family we were there like 48 hours so it
wasn't a ton of time but it was good to
see family and you know just kind of
reconnect on that level and in person
and everything
anyway that's everything guys I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope you guys had
an amazing September and if you love
October I'm so happy your month is here
now that I don't it's just I definitely
am NOT like you know I'm not like
obsessed with October like December is
more my month January cuz my birthday
month so anyway but actually we're still
really cool and I'm excited for it so I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
