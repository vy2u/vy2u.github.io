Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be sharing with you
my April top 5 favorites I do my
favorites just slightly different I like
to try to keep it to like only 5 beauty
items or five categories of beauty items
I just try not to like bombard you with
just a bunch of new stuff that you need
and instead try to keep that a little
bit more minimal and then I also like to
share with you some of my favorite
experiences some of my favorite media
things like just other favorites in my
life because I don't only love beauty so
I like other stuff my hair is a little
crazy in this I curled it today to do
something a little bit different and I
don't know I like it but it's just kind
of a lot other than that let's just get
into my favourites the first item that I
have to share with you guys is the Too
Faced hangover RX three-in-one
replenishing primer and setting spray I
know I know I've talked about it a lot
so I mean it should be no surprise it's
in my favorites I used up a small size
of this it was like a 1 ounce and then I
repurchase the full size so this retails
for $34 it's pretty expensive but I
really love the smell I love the way it
makes my skin look it's not going to be
one of those sprays that's gonna like
lock in your makeup instead it's more of
like a refresher spray it kind of like
settles down any powders I find it just
gives my face and my makeup some life
back to it after you know you've layered
everything up so I've really been
enjoying this highly recommend it it's
like my favorite one next to mac fix+
the next beauty item that i have here is
a sponge I got this sent to me from shop
misae and this is one of the many items
I got sent so I am going to be doing a
video testing out dollar makeup letting
you guys know what's worth it and what's
not worth it but this is something I'm
giving you a spoiler it's totally worth
it this is so soft this reminds me of
the Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge obviously the shape of this one
is very similar to that but just in
texture this just bounces on the skin
this is one of the nicest sponges I've
ever felt for the price point this is a
dollar 55 I went on the website and it
does look like these are sold out there
was also a note on the website being
like we changed it but that was a bad
batch so we're gonna be getting a new
batch so hopefully that I don't know
hope
new ones that they're gonna have aren't
gonna be crappy but this one is so
freakin good so I really hope that comes
back into stock I can see myself
repurchasing this I can see myself
purchasing this for my kit and having
like multiple of them you just can't
beat the price for how great it is this
is a light pink sponge and so I was
nervous that like I wasn't gonna be able
to clean it but with my Beauty Blender
cleanser I've cleaned this multiple
times and was able to get out basically
all of the stains so it looked really
nice and fresh and new and not all dingy
like it does right now
and I haven't found do that it tears or
anything like that so just loving that
love in a dollar fifty five for sponge
you guys know I love my Beauty Blender
but I just you cannot be you cannot be a
dollar 55 next for a beauty favorite I
have a lotion this is the number seven
protect and perfect intense advanced
night cream this was also sent to me and
I've been using it now I would say for
at least a month if not like a month in
a week so a quite a bit of it is gone
this retails for $24.99 on ulties
website and its main claim is to like
restore the skin and give it hydration
and that's what I really love it for
this has a really nice thick texture but
it doesn't feel heavy on the skin it
doesn't feel greasy on the skin I just
feel nourished before this at night I
was using the first aid Beauty ultra
Repair night cream and I really do like
that it's a nice like thinner
I guess moisturizer but this just gives
me a little bit more especially when I'm
going to bed
I don't need to look beautiful I don't
care if I get a little bit oily and I
really like the way my skin feels when I
wake up with this on if you were
wondering about this I think it's really
great it says that it's also going to
fight like deep lines and wrinkles and
also firm the skin I haven't noticed any
of that I mean I'm 26 so it's not like I
have a ton of wrinkles for it to really
work on I will say I could maybe see a
little bit of firming like I definitely
feel it just feels so nice and silky
smooth on the skin while also still
hydrating and not just like creating a
barrier so I've really been enjoying
this it's something that I really like
so I'm excited to continue using it I
only have two more items to talk about
and they're kind of the same thing you
guys have probably been able to
tell that I've been in to painting my
nails more I've been doing more like
close-ups with my hands and just
different things and like trying to get
it together and you know not be
disgusting it's been difficult but I've
just been really gravitating to these
two colors so these are both OPI nail
polishes I'm not sure if you can get
these anymore but just in general take
the color inspiration the color that I'm
wearing right now this is coca-cola red
it's so beautiful it's a nice cream
color I really love a nice warm almost
like orange II bright red instead of
something a little bit deeper or a more
blue toned that's just my preference I
really like the shade Olay Caliente
I believe from Essie it's very similar
to this as well if you're looking for
another option and the other color that
I have here is life gave me lemons and
this is the color that I was wearing in
my like last set of videos it's the
color hat on right before this there's
just something about this lime green
that just makes me feel fun I feel
excited I just I like it it's like
lively and awesome so I've been enjoying
both of those colors and I find that
I've just been gravitating especially to
this green when it comes to makeup and
just in general I just have been really
liking this type of color in all aspects
of life really alright now let's get
into some other favorites for the month
first off I want to mention Oregon if
you guys didn't watch my get ready with
me where I talked about Oregon I'm gonna
leave it link down below but I did go to
Oregon this month for about five days I
was there with the AIFF festival which
festivals in the f but it's the Ashland
Independent Film Festival yeah I worked
on a thesis film a while back it's been
like over a year now
and me and the director really good
friends and she invited me to go with
her and since I worked on the film it
all worked out it was awesome because a
lot of what we were there for was taken
care of for us so we were able to have
our accommodations taken care of they
had food for us we got into awesome
events it was just a really great time
it was nice you know having a little bit
of girl time which is me and Amy and
yeah I had a really fun awesome time it
was great to meet other artists other
directors see some really great movies
get away to Oregon so yeah that's my
first favorite it's like the first like
Film Festival like that that I've ever
been to and I really enjoyed my time
there so yeah that's kind of that in a
nutshell so other like life favorites
this is the first month in my youtube
career where I have been able and been
invited to any events earlier this month
at the very beginning of April pur Lisse
invited me to an event it was like an
Ipsy event I believe and it was like
bikes and beauties so it was a spin
class and then at the end they debut
their body coffee
coconut oil scrub and that was really
fun
uh it was a really crazy workout and I
was so sore it was right before he left
for Oregon so I was like sore when we
were in Oregon because spin classes are
no effing joke okay just so you guys
know it's not a joke if someone invites
you know that you're going to work your
ass off and it's gonna hurt and drink a
ton of water before and after cuz I
think that was my biggest mistake but
regardless of all that it was super
awesome it's just cool to be invited
like that's an amazing thing to me and
then another thing kind of coming up I
have an event in May with covergirl what
so that's super exciting and I think
it's really cool too because if you guys
haven't seen my review on the covergirl
2018 spring stuff I'm gonna leave it
linked as well as much as I did that
review I mean I was 100% honest and
there were things in that collection
that I did not like or just things that
were kind of met you know what I mean
and so it's cool that you know
regardless of my honest opinions I still
could invited to that and I do think
that being in LA definitely has its
advantages if I was living in a
different state I couldn't just easily
go to these events whereas because they
were like basically in my back yard I
just have more access to them and so
that's just been amazing and it's
awesome that the community here is
growing and that I'm able to go to
events like that so I just want to bring
it up because it's super exciting and
super brand new to me and it's like a
weird thing because I don't consider
myself like an influencer or like a
youtuber but if you're doing something
like that I guess you kind of are it's
just really weird and the last I just
have some media favorites here at the
end so I have some music favorites
obviously postseason new album is in my
favorites video I know it just came out
but beer bongs in bed
if you haven't listened to it you need
to Stoney it's one of my favorite albums
ever I just loved post Malone so highly
suggest you give it a listen it has like
a ton of tracks I was like 18 tracks on
it so like you just have a lot of time
to spend a fit and to listen to it I
just I love him skrt skrt you know what
I mean I've been listening to that a
time and then I've also been listening
to Drake's nice for what and that's
basically what's been playing for me
yeah those are the two things that have
been playing for me when it comes to
like Netflix and shows I just finished
wild wild country it's like a
documentary series about the Rajneesh II
in Oregon and like everything that
happened I believe like what in the 80s
if you guys don't know what I'm talking
about I'm gonna leave a trailer link
down below so you guys can check it out
see if it's something you might be
interested in overall I really love the
story of this and love getting that type
of information these type of stories
really attract me the only thing I
didn't like is like as a documentary it
kind of was a little bit long it's like
broken up into parts and I wish it just
gave us a little bit more information a
little bit faster and it also felt like
the music sometimes like drowns stuff
out like I'm like okay like I just want
to hear what they're saying but at the
same time that's just a pet peeve of
mine like I'm not really down for when
music is like its own character in a
movie like think something like Punch
Drunk Love or Birdman I know everyone
loves Birdman Sam loves Birdman everyone
loves it and it's good I'm just saying
that the music it's a little much for me
okay and last on my list here is chef's
table we just started season 4 which is
all about I believe pastry chefs we
haven't watched any of the other seasons
we just started there number 4 one of
our friends actually did assist in
editing on the show so we were kind of
like oh let's check it out and it's
really awesome it's really inspirational
to see these different chef's stories I
don't know a ton about really expensive
like Michelin star restaurants and food
and stuff like that so it's really
interesting to watch on that aspect and
then you can relate to it even if you
don't like that type of stuff because
they're just humans and it's like
connecting with their stories and
everything and for me it's just a really
inspirational series to start I feel
like I'm learning things I like the
humanity aspect to it as well the first
episode is really great too because it's
all about the milk store in New York
City and
started and I believe her name is
Christine I think just kind of where she
came from and how she's created it and
that's every episode obviously with
different people I will leave a trailer
for that as well if you want to check it
out but if you haven't seen that I do
highly suggest it I think it's really
great and I've been enjoying it so
alright guys those are all my favorites
for the month I really hope you enjoyed
the video let me know what some of your
favorites were down below if there's
anything you think I should check out
whether it's music movies Beauty I'd
love to know in the comments and that's
everything thank you so so much for
