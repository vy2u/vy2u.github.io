explorin this is going to be my federal
top five instead of doing a monthly
favorites video I just do a top five
these are five things I was loving
throughout the month I try to include
mostly beauty but I also include random
stuff things that I've been loving I
really do like shows and TV so those are
usual at the end these are supposed to
be short and sweet and to the point so
let's get into it I feel like this month
I was very much into my old favorites so
I don't have really a ton of new stuff
to show you guys it's all senator like
if you've been watching my channel
you've probably seen and I just want to
give extra recognition to them because
they're just good I really have been
enjoying them the first product you have
to talk about is from colour-pop and
this is the lipstick and Lumiere this is
a matte formula which I don't it's not
mad for sure not mad it definitely has a
gloss to it but this color is so pretty
it's what i'm wearing on my list today i
feel like this is the more opaque and a
little bit darker version of my all-time
favorites up some lipstick in dolly i
just really like the color of this i
think it's a nice like plumbing in mob
neutral it would be awesome if this was
like an actual Matt and I'm excited to
try some of their like Matt X is that
what they're called Matt ex-formula I
think that's what it is where is like
ultra matte because they definitely
needed it this is not mad this is like
the cover girl Katy Perry lipstick matte
if that my sense if you drive those you
know those aren't that either so I
really like this I think the color is
really pretty I find that I gravitate to
warm tones but I really do think these
like more dusty cool tones looks better
on my skin I tend to like them more so I
need to keep that in mind if ever I'm
trying to buy stuff because this really
is what suits me and what I wear all the
time not the warm brown shades the next
product I wanted to talk about because I
finally got it back in my life this is
the butter bronzer from physicians
formula i got this when i ordered the
lorac palette which you guys will all be
happy to know that i did return that
palette it is back at the store i'm
really happy with that decision i feel
like i've talked about the lorac palette
so much and there will be another video
on the lorac palette it's not as already
it will be duping it so if you wanted it
but wanted more
penguins colors that is coming fly is
here if it's here already i'll leave a
link down below anyway with that order i
bought the butter bronzer again this is
just my favorite bronzer i love it so
much i'm wearing it today but I'm also
wearing who lets us a little bit deeper
than this would be on its own it is my
favorite I think this is just the best
friends or ever for my skin tone they
work so well when me it gives me a
little bit of definition and a little
bit of like color differentiation in my
face just brings me to life the bronze
booster is not the same I bought that to
replace this because they didn't have
this at the store when I went to buy it
long story short I just don't think that
is good i feel like that's more
pigmented started using to blend I felt
like I got a little carried away with it
whereas this is just so easy simple it
looks good I just love it I can't
imagine not having this in my collection
I really can't say that about any other
bronzer I've ever used so I highly
suggest this especially if you're fair
or life it's a great bronzer I love it
and the last beauty favorite i have to
mention is something i've been using a
really long time i've been using this
since my hard candy sigh first
impressions only does if you link down
below to if you want to check it out but
i've been using this a sense then and
haven't talked about it in a favorites
video i was thinking about mentioning
this in my yearly favorites for 2016 but
i don't i don't know why i didn't die i
just chose not to include this i really
wanted it to be things that I
repurchased and since this was my first
bottle of this I didn't want to mention
it for whatever reason that being said i
love this primer I think this primer for
the price is amazing to six dollars they
have a ton of different versions of this
but this is so silky smooth on it again
I really like the way it feels she
controls my oil pretty well I wait say
it keeps me crazy Matt but I find any
primer they use that claim to do that
just don't work on me and I don't like
the feeling so i would rather blot or
have to powder throughout the day and my
skin feel and look better for the whole
day if that makes sense i really love
this i highly suggest it i will be
repurchasing this one or i might try a
different version of this primer just to
see i suggested for all skin types I
feel like it kind of is the best of both
worlds is smoothing it's mattifying but
it's not so mad that you can use it if
you had dry skin
like I just really like this I think
it's really good and for my last few
favorites I'd have a show in a book so
I'll there was a show first I wanted to
mention this last month but I just
forgot which makes me insane because I'm
obsessed me and Sam watched the night
manager which has Tom Hiddleston in it
it also has to do from house I don't
know his name sorry but it is so good if
you have amazon prime you can stream
this for free I think it's just
available on Amazon it's a six-episode
story and it it's just so good I don't
really want to give anything away it's
about a guy who is the night manager see
some things go down and then that event
basically changes of life and I don't
know I'm really bad at giving
descriptions without basically like
telling you that every spoiler ever so I
entirely suggested it I was not really
into Tom Nelson like thinking he was
cute after that show i am like so down
he's so cute it was just really good
like everything about it was so
entertaining Pat action has like romance
it has just everything you could want I
like that it's not you know seasons and
seasons long but it's longer than a
movie so you can kind of buy into it a
little bit longer can show you more in
detail you can become more invested in
it so I really really highly suggest it
so good it's probably one of my favorite
like shows plus I don't know what it's
called like episodic I don't really know
what they're called because it's not
quite a TV series it's like the best one
I've ever seen if I was recommending
stuff that's probably a my top three of
anything I've ever seen TV show is so
good and the book I wanted to mention
was something that means ham read
together on audible and it is the subtle
art of not giving an S the S is actually
the word the cuss words I don't cuss on
my channel here I do custom realize like
a ton like a sailor but I to buy the
cuff on this channel because i know not
everyone's like into like an f-bomb all
the time and i understand that anyway
this book is really good i really
enjoyed it it's like an anti self-help
book it's meant to help you but it's
just more realistic than a lot of other
self-help books out there it's a little
more crude a little more craft I think
it was really good it was entertaining
and I'm
we feel like it does make some valid
points I think sometimes you just need
little reminders like that like a book
or just little things to remind you like
hey everything's cool don't worry so
much and just put things in perspective
for you it's a really similar idea I
feel like two don't flip the small stuff
there's like a book series i think on
that so it's inspirational but in a more
craft in sunny way i really liked it it
was good okay guys those are my top five
favorites I hope you're having a
wonderful day thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
