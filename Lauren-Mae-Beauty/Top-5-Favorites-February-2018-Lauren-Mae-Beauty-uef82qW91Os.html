Lauren thank you so much for watching
today it's gonna be a favourites video
we're gonna talk about the products that
I loved in the month of February I do a
top 5 on my channel so I'm gonna show
you five beauty products that I was
loving this month and then I'm also
going to talk about some like media and
movies and music and all that at the end
so let's keep it super sweet and short
and get into it
the first favorite that I have this
month is a brush this is from Sigma and
it's the 3d HD max kabuki brush this is
something that I didn't think I would
like they did send this to me and I have
a whole review on all the Sigma products
that I've ever owned in my life I will
leave that video link down below if you
haven't checked it out this is something
that I didn't think I was gonna like
though it seemed too gimmicky to me but
I actually really really liked it and I
think it's really great this is the
brush that I've been reaching for when I
want to use a brush to put foundation on
I love the way it applied to my
foundation and I like that it's dense
but still movable so it has a little bit
of play to it I also like the angle
which is the thing I thought was the
stupidest about it
I love the angle I can get into my nose
really easily under my eye I think it's
just really great this is the max kabuki
just so you guys know there is just like
a regular kabuki but I like the max one
I don't have that one but this one I
think is a bit fuller and bigger it's
just been great to apply a liquid
foundation I've been using my stick
foundation like basically any base
product I want to use this works really
nicely and I've really been enjoying it
it's kind of been my go-to brush since I
got it I love it next I do have a
foundation or BB cream type of product
this is from pur Lisse and it's the BB
tinted moisturizer eye cream it's pretty
lightweight on the skin but it
definitely gives you like a dewy look
which i think is really nice depending
on if you're super dry or not you might
not even have to really set this not
that it dries down but I think just
keeping that nice natural luminous glow
to the skin looks really good
again I'm in the shade fair and it's a
very light kind of gray almost color
which i think is nice like it works well
it's not too orange it's not too pink I
do know that this comes in five
different shades and for BB Creams
that's pretty typical to have a small
number of shades and on the website it
looks like it does go pretty dark so I
haven't seen those shades and
person but I do hope that does actually
work for people with darker skin because
this is a really nice product I love
that it's just moisturizing it's just a
nice easy everyday product to get you at
the door fast but you still feel good
and confident next there are some
products that are so fun these are the
supernova shadows from wet and wild I've
just been really loving these I think
they're really cool really fun I have a
whole video on the moonlight magic
collection I'm gonna leave that link
down below if you want some swatches I
did some swatches outside and those
looks so insane like I was like Flo I
can't believe they're coming off those
colors so definitely check that video
out if you want to see what these look
like and kind of me applying them and
what not if you wanted to know my two
favorites are the shade Lucky Penny this
is a really pretty like iridescent
duochrome white shade it tends to pull a
more blue green purple than it does pink
but if you see it on the hand and in
person it does pull pink still I love
this as a topper I love it on the inner
corner I like to apply this two
different ways one as like a topper over
something else just really lightly I
don't think this looks good opaque it
looks kind of scaly if you try to like
build it up too much but if you're using
it like how I have with like tapping it
or whatnot I think it looks really great
and then the other shape that's my
favorite is over again this is like a
pink but it pulls purple super-fun I
wore this out to eat for dinner me and
Sam went to movie and dinner and it
looked so pretty just over the shadow I
had just kind of spiced it up made it
fun
so those are the two I suggest but
honestly I think these are really cool
if they're too flaky I just suggest
using it as a topper and you could still
get that really cool fun effect without
all the scale enos because I did try to
use now-or-never like all over the lid
and try to build it up really opaque
like and ooh it was looking scary I had
to like take off my makeup it looked so
bad so definitely use these a specific
way play around with them but if you can
get them to work and I know that's
sounding like they're not good they are
I just want you guys to know all the
facts before I go into it I just I love
them I think they're so fun
they just spice up a look so fast so
cool love them the next product is
something from Becca this is the Becca
soft light blurring powder I got this
from octoly and I just love loose
setting powders first off like I don't
know
why I was using them before they're so
great this one has a bit of a radiance
to it I don't love that it's pink but I
love the radiance it gives I don't like
this to set under the eyes I just like
this to use as like an all-over setting
powder on the skin I especially like it
in areas like my forehead
like this part of my cheek and chin I
think it just looks so nice and it gives
a sheen to the skin but nothing like
highlighter you can like highlight with
this product it just looks like a soft
blurring effect it's so pretty really
enjoying it I wish this was just like
translucent or maybe like my skin toned
color like really lightly instead of
pink but I just find like don't use it
under my eyes because if I use it under
my eyes it just can tend to kind of look
a little pink so other than that though
I love the finish on the skin it looks
really pretty and the last product I
have to talk about is from Moroccan oil
this is the hand cream and my mom got me
this for my birthday we recently went to
Arizona and she gave me my birthday gift
and she gave me a cream I'm so excited
if you guys don't know Moroccan oil is a
brand that I really love I absolutely
love the scent I love the hair oil
I love the volumizing shampoo and
conditioner I love the dry shampoo and
light tones what else do I have from
them I think that's it I don't really
like the texturizing spray it's okay
but I really wanted the hand cream and
so the Beauty Supply stopped carrying
this for whatever reason probably
because no one buys it so my mom bought
everything that they had because they
weren't gonna buy them anymore
and she gave me one I love it it smells
really nice it does go on to the hands
really nicely as well it's silky without
being greasy I just think this is great
mostly for the smell but I also think
it's a nice product I have to kind of
like situational favorites I don't know
I recently filmed two videos with Sam
one was a Costco haul and one was like
testing weird products from Daiso and
you guys seemed to really like him which
was really awesome
um I don't film with Sam very often on
my channel and I just I don't know we
were just out and about having a good
time and I was like hey we should do
these two videos and it was really fun
and I'm
you guys had just as much fun watching
him so that was something really cool
and exciting I thought for the month
my other favorite for the month is
Hamilton me and Sam went to Arizona we
bought tickets like I think before the
year was out but we bought them to see
them at Gammage and it was so good I
loved it so much it was something that
kind of like I enjoyed it so much when I
watched it obviously but kind of like
the songs and the story and everything
just sunk in later for me and I find
that I'm like that with a lot of things
unless it's like a show that I'm like
just into I love the music my favorite
song is satisfied I love it so much
I'll leave that link down below if you
want to check it out but it was a great
musical I love that it's like more rappy
hip hoppy something a little bit
different it's definitely still a
musical though like you know it sounds
like a musical sometimes it sounds like
rent to me
I don't know apply but it was so great
just a fun experience and we're two for
two when it comes to the month we've
seen a show every single month we saw Oh
in Las Vegas the Cirque du Soleil show
for my birthday in January and then we
saw this in February and we already have
a show for March that we're gonna go see
so I'm just excited we're staying on
track of like seeing a show every single
month and then we already have October
plan to because we're gonna go see King
Lear in England you know no big deal so
that's really exciting so we have four
months already planned and it's just
great seeing live shows there's
something so different about it than
like a movie or a TV show or whatever I
feel like the hype is pretty real with
it like I know everyone talks about
Hamilton and it's like really hard to
get tickets in New York and everything
but it was worth it it's so good last
year for the favorites video I have some
media favorites so TV shows we were
watching we finished Westworld
really enjoyed it it just has one season
and then the second season I believe
will be coming out soon if you are
someone who really enjoys like Blade
Runner or that type of like Androids and
like are they real people are they not
and like dealing with those questions in
the future I think you would really love
Westworld it was one of those ones I
bought into you're really fast really
hard like I wanted to know all the
secrets everything that's going on in
this world so if you like sci-fi but
it's not like to sci-fi but um if you
like something like that I think you
would enjoy the show really great you
can watch that on HBO demand if you
don't have that you should because
obviously Game of Thrones and then the
other like kind of show
it's like mini documentaries are on
Netflix I believe overall this shows are
called dirty money it's a series of six
different documentaries basically
dealing with people who are greedy or
companies or whatever in stories that
deal with the dirty money and just
different aspects in the world it's
really cool they have one on president
Trump at the very end too so I mean I'm
not trying to like get political here
but that's something that's very
interesting to watch if you wanted some
different information they have one
about a guy who like ran a quick cash
type of place like a cash advance place
that one was really interesting they did
one on HSBC I can't I don't know the
right numbers but it's the banking and
how they take money from cartels they
have one on Valiant like the medical
corporation that kept buying like all
these other ones and then what was the
last one oh they did one on the VW's
whole situation with the defeat test and
everything and then there was one about
like maple like a maple highest in
Canada and the Federation of like maple
growers and like kind of the rebels and
stuff that one was kind of interesting a
little bit like lighter
I feel like than the other situations if
you have some time they're like about an
hour or so long each and you can get
some information and just like enjoy it
a good story and also feel horrible
because a lot of these are just like oh
my gosh why why is this happening so
anyway I really enjoyed them I really
love documentaries though they're just
something I enjoy so if you like
documentaries you'll probably like those
this is what my hair looks like and I
curled it this morning and now it just
is like and last I have some music
favorites so I'm gonna like try to add
clips if I can't like even just like
five seconds so you guys can know what
these sound like maybe I also always
leave stuff linked down below so you
guys can like find this stuff that I
talked about but first I want to mention
sorrow it's like the third time I
mention it I did a music video for him
earlier this month I did well we filmed
like four different ones at one time
besides that though I just have been
enjoying the music so that's how I was
introduced to it but I've actually been
enjoying it so his voice is really
awesome and he's kind of like this like
Justin Timberlake with like the
high-pitched voice but a little bit more
like The Weeknd
- I don't know it's really good I really
enjoy
music obviously I've been enjoying
drinks God's plan if you guys haven't
seen that I'm gonna leave that link down
below love a song so yeah I've been
loving that and then I've also really
been enjoying a song from Luna hora this
is a musical artist that I was
introduced to because I went and saw a
show here in LA from someone that Sam
knew and she was like the opening act
and she's awesome
I loved a lot of different songs from
her I love the song radio she has a new
song sucker punch and then this is in
collaboration with like a DJ I believe
but it's a song walk or a super-great
just fun Dancy exciting so I'm if you
like that type of music you'll probably
enjoy that and then last is just like a
boss song it's called a let me look it
up to make sure you get the exact name
right this is a recommendation from my
friend Liam thanks Liam he's like you'll
either love it or hate it and I love it
that's the song I see girl from Swati
it's just like a fun song to put on if
you just want to like I don't know just
feel awesome but anyway those are all my
favorites I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching guys and
I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
