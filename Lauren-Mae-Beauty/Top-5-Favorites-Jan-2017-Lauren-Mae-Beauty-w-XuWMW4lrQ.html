Lauren I'm going to be doing my January
top 5 favorites now if you've been
following my channel for a while I think
I started this last year but instead of
doing a monthly favorites video where a
teacher like a billion products I just
tried to narrow it down to the top five
things I was loving not always are they
all beauty I just think it's nice to
only feature the things you really
really love and I think five products is
that's still a lot of products i think
in our head sometimes we we don't say
five products is a lot because of
everything else we see on youtube but
five products can like easily add up to
over a hundred dollars so anyway let's
get started with what i've been loving
for january i will start off with beauty
products first the first thing I have to
show here is the Sephora airbrush
foundation I was not expecting to like
this as much as I do this is in the
shade of fair and i just think this is a
really nice foundation I feel like I'm
going through a change in what I like in
foundations I like something a little
bit more natural maybe not as full
coverage it's just what I've been into
something just a little less extra I
know that sounds kind of insane can come
in like a really dark lip right now but
that she's sort of been liking for my
foundation and this looks so great on
the skin I think and have a learning
curve learning how to use this product
because it is an airbrush like spray
foundation but I found successfully
cheese it for me is just to spray it
straight on my Beauty Blender and then
go in I'm sure losing some products that
way but that's the best way I can do it
and the finish on my skin and just so
beautiful the other thing that I really
love about the foundation is the fact
that it stays on my skin and looks great
controlling my oil like the longest I
feel like out of almost any foundation
I've ever used it's crazy i'm always so
surprised because of the consistency of
it that I don't look oily when I look in
the mirror it just looks great so I
really do like the foundation I can
definitely see myself and purchasing it
I don't know how long was just going to
last which is kind of scary like she
just does have two boyfriends blue and
Aljaz but because you're spraying it and
I'm putting on a Beauty Blender we'll
see if it actually lasted beasts amount
of time or not but I feel highly
suggested if you were looking
to this foundation I've really been
enjoying it and even for someone was
oily skin I've really been liking this
another favorite for me is something
that we're all going to get because this
is the Sephora birthday gift this is the
blush sumter in the color partay it's
just a really natural pinky and warm
mahvish color I don't know it's
basically the exact colors I love
especially from Tarte I realize the
formulas and the pigmentation the color
to me is just perfect so I love that
this was the gifts we got this year I
think it's just nice that it's such a
big sample item that's isn't it's going
to last a really long time and I've
related some liking the color so yeah
just before for giving us something
awesome for free for our birthday I have
two more beauty items to share with you
the next one is going to be kind of a
general one this is just what I happen
to know this but I've really been
enjoying showing my eyebrows in with
powder lately I did use a mix of pencil
and powder today but on days when I just
want like hurting it's just on or just
don't want to have any brow I've really
been enjoying using powder this is the
brow club that I had basically since the
beginning of time this won't die but I
really like using this darker a she
toned color I also do like this one
though too it's just a little bit warmer
and a little bit lighter I just like the
softer look to the eyebrows that the
powder has been giving me and it's just
something different I used to film a
dress on with powder all the time and I
just find that I can be a little
heavy-handed I'll say it and it's just
the nice job to something a little bit
lighter not as menacing um what's going
around their legs but it's just been a
nice change especially with the lighter
skin if you can't tell I've been just
into a lighter look in general once
again I'm sure you can't tell because
I'm in a block is almost in the last
beauty item that I have to share with
you guys this is a highlighter from
laura geller you guys know my love for
Laura Geller I will say that I recently
made a really big purchase on their
website I get a discount on the website
and they were having a sale on top of
that so I got the sale prices plus my
just kind of like crazy I will be doing
a haul in my new series the beauty
brands fault lines is showing us what I
got because I feel like you are killers
not talked about enough but anyway back
to the highlighter I like
is the Golden Rose highlighter this has
a very similar formula to the
highlighter in french vanilla which I
absolutely love it just gives such a
nice Sheen to the skin nothing to
metallic you guys know how I like my
highlighters this is just a little bit
more pinky toned and not as yellow toned
as the french vanilla one I have it on
my cheekbones today and I just really
really like this I know this is on sale
on their website for twelve dollars it
will obviously be linked down below but
I just have really been enjoying another
highlighter from her besides the french
vanilla one but this is a different
formula than their than her like gelato
swirl ones okay my last favorite for the
month is actually a food favorite beach
tamales from trader joes I'm obsessed
with these I probably ate these two
weeks out of the whole month like for
lunch every single day I'm so obsessed
with you so good they're pretty
inexpensive I think it's like 259 for
two of them and two of them definitely
like fills you up I wish you could just
have like one and a half of them but I
guess you could just have control and
just eat half of ones but you know so
great if you need like something to
bring for lunch that's super easy this
is it I am so specialist so if you have
a trader joes clothes and you shop there
often or you just have to pop in I
definitely suggest to be Smalley's and
you chef Lee try them out they're
absolutely delicious Russ everything for
my favorite I hope you guys are having a
great rest of your day i am going to be
filming my beauty favorites for 2016 i
know i'm really behind on it but i still
want to do it even though it's late so
hopefully you guys will still enjoy that
video even though it's like on my plate
what can I say um that's everything
though and i will see you guys in my
next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
