learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing my favorites
for the month I give a top 5 for my
monthly favorites videos I just like
paring it down a little bit more so I
have quite a few things to show you I
have more like categories this month and
a lot of things but I'm excited to show
you those and then I also like to throw
in other things besides make up into my
favorites which I will talk about at the
end but other than that let's just get
into the products that I was loving in
the month of January I have been waiting
to talk about this all month I'm having
another video which is either gonna come
up after this or before this but it's
gonna be about beauty products that I
get weirdly excited about and one of
them's freaking hand soap this one from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is amazing it's the
highest blue sage exfoliating hands up
and that's what we really want to focus
on exfoliating coz that makes this so
amazing I love it so much I love the
refreshing feeling of putting this on my
hands after I've gone to the bathroom or
whatever it is and I'm washing my hands
it feels so nice I really do think it's
been helping keep my hands soft and
smooth the smell of this is really
really nice as well I'm not usually
someone who would be into a sage scent
but this one smells so good on the hands
and I can tell a saml like come in the
room or whatever and I'm like oh you
smell good it's your hands and it's you
go to this soap so I've been really
enjoying this it's a limited edition
scent I think for holiday or whatever
but I'm definitely going to look at the
exfoliating hand soaps from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works in the future I'm gonna be looking
more for those in store and just in
different places because I think it's
something really small like a small
detail but it's made a really big
difference and I've really enjoyed the
addition of it in my soaps I know it's
like a boring one but like honestly
that's like my number one favorite that
I kept being like oh yeah that's a
favorite can't forget tonight video next
I do you want to talk about two pallets
now I've been getting a lot of makeup
palettes recently I feel like so I think
it says a lot that only these two are
making it in here it's not that I don't
like the other ones but these I just I
really really like and I feel like I'm
using them over those pallets and using
them more often than those pallets and
the first one here is from julius place
this is
harren palette and I just I love it it's
so pretty I did buy the Zulu palette
when I picked this one up too but this
one definitely is way more me I love the
colors in here I think it's cohesive but
still interesting I love it the quality
of these shadows is also amazing they
blend while they're pigmented the
metallics are super metallic and I've
just I have no complaints especially for
the price I think it's a great palette
and then the other palette that I've
really been enjoying I realized that
this is gonna be way more than like five
products but again we're kind of going
in categories this month because I guess
I did have quite a few favorites anyway
this is the electro-pop palette from
Kevin a Quan I did get the sent to me
from octa Lee and this was something
that when it popped up on the site I was
like oh my gosh I didn't ever think that
would be on there I would love to try it
and you could tell from the colors that
it's definitely a palette I would like
it's colorful and fun I am wearing this
shade all over my eyes today and this is
topped over it to kind of give it an
iridescent look I haven't get ready with
me using this on this look so that will
be coming I'm pretty sure that'll be
coming next or soon I'm filming a lot of
videos today I think there's an aspect
to this palette and why I like it so
much it's because I wasn't expecting to
like it as much as I do so maybe my
expectations were here and it really hit
up here and so that's why I love it so
much but I think this palette is great
it's definitely not for everyone it's an
expensive palette and I don't know if I
would have purchased this palette but
having it I think it's beautiful and the
texture of these shadows is definitely
interesting I find using my finger is
the best way to apply them for full
opacity and like the best shine which I
don't mind I prefer doing that like I
don't I don't mind putting my hands in
it and putting a long face I think
there's just like an extra sparkle and
just something different about all of
these shadows in here they look like
they're gonna be just like regular but
then they're just something
extraordinary and to me the way I like
this palette is how I expected to like
my Natasha to know no Leela palette
because it's so expensive and everyone
talks about it so much but I feel like I
got more of those feelings towards this
palette than I did I mean I didn't
really enjoy my Natasha - Fiona palette
so yeah that's how I feel this like I
think this is what I expecting Etosha
Genova shadows to be so yeah the
formulas definitely
it's a bit almost like heavy and creamy
which is is kind of hard to use with a
brush sometimes you definitely can still
do it but again I feel like a lot of
these are lid shades and you can use
them with your fingers and I really like
it I don't know it's just inspiring me a
lot lately with the eye shadow like I
have on now and just other looks I've
done with it so next is a single product
I have really been enjoying this
highlighter from Becca this is something
I picked up on sale at Sephora and it is
the light chaser highlighter in
Champagne dream flashes believe me I am
wearing it today but I'm wearing a wet
and wild highlighter on top of it I've
been using this so so much you can
definitely see somewhere in the pan this
is not the same formula as their normal
highlighters it's definitely like
heavier it's a little bit harder to pick
up on the brush but it just has a
beautiful flash to it I almost thought
this wouldn't work for my skin tone like
I thought it'd be a little too dark but
it does it works it's beautiful I really
enjoy it has like a pink orange flash to
it and I wear a lot of pink shadow so I
think it complements it really well and
for the price that I paid for this I
really enjoyed it I wouldn't have paid
full price for it but for the seventeen
I paid for it for this and the lip gloss
I thought that was a really good deal
and I'm very happy with my purchase -
more like categories to talk about I
know
lip glosses I've been really into lip
glosses lately I might have mentioned
this in a different video but those have
been like my go-to products the things
I've been wanting to put on my lips what
I'm wearing today is that lip gloss that
came with that Becca highlighter and
this is the champagne dream flashes
Bellini but in the lip gloss I've really
been enjoying that I have two colourpop
lip glosses I've been enjoying this one
is hustle love hate man this is the
color tight fit beautiful on the lips so
so pretty but it like bunches up and
gives me that like white ring and it's
kind of weird but it's so pretty it's so
hard so I'm still trying to make this
work because my god it's so beautiful
this is the Ponyland
lip gloss from My Little Pony and color
pop collection and unfortunately that is
sold out on the site you cannot get it
any longer but I've been loving it
Oh another color pop one this one is
Finders Keepers this is my favorite lip
gloss that I've tried it from them in
their normal range that's just like a
normal creamy lip gloss really really
good eye
been enjoying a bareMinerals sugar
lipgloss that's just in my purse right
now and then the last one here this is
from NYX it's the butter gloss in Eclair
this is something I put in a project pan
and wouldn't use it in the project pan
but of course when I don't want to pan
it I've been using it way more than I
did when I was trying to force myself
this is great I love the feeling of this
on the lips and this color is just a
nice pink that light brightens up the
lips and just looks really pretty and
I've just been enjoying the ease of
gloss it gives my lips a finished look
without putting too much product on it
can be still moisturizing I just don't I
don't like an opaque lip on me that's
something I've noticed unless I'm going
like really deep and dark or just more
intense when it comes to my lips I just
I like something a little bit easier and
I like the idea of a sheer color on my
lips I don't really like opacity so
something I'm just like realizing and
learning about myself but glosses are
where it's at and I'm so happy so many
brands are coming out with new ones
because I want to try them all and last
for beauty products settings breaks I've
been alone settings braised so I have
the Milani one here I've used quite a
bit up of this and that looks really
impressive but let me tell you this goes
by so fast
I remember mani talking about this and
he was like oh I've used so much of it
and he had like you know a quarter of it
gone or like less than this gone and I'm
thinking now like so you used it ten
times because I really feel like I
haven't used this a ton but it's showing
a ton of wear I really enjoy this my
sprayer is unfortunately I think messed
up because it like sprays in a line and
it's just not as even as everyone talked
about it being so I definitely think
mine's malfunctioned but I would
repurchase this cuz I do like the way it
feels on the skin I really like the
smell of it and I think it's a nice
drugstore setting spray my all-time
favorite one though is the Mac one just
so you guys know it's great amazing I'm
not gonna go into it because I'm telling
you in this group of videos and I feel
like my last group I'm talking about a
lot of the same products because that's
just what I've been loving and then what
I've been using and what I've been
inspired by lately so anyway I can't
wait to try more setting sprays and just
facial mist in general I don't think
that they necessarily keep my makeup on
longer but I love just the experience of
them I love the feeling of them on the
skin and I do like how they get rid of a
powdery finish so that's why I love them
most all right now let's get into like
fun stuff and things that I've really
been loving first off I want to mention
that hello we hit 50,000 subscribers on
our Channel
it's insane I'm gonna be talking about
this slightly and my get ready with me
as well but it's just such an amazing
huge milestone it's something I never
really thought my channel would get to I
remember thinking in my head like you
put caps on it you're like how could
50,000 people out there even want to
subscribe to me I just want to say thank
you so much everyone who's found my
channel and subscribed and left amazing
comments and just been so amazingly nice
to me I really really appreciate it
I know I'm not the best at commenting
back and it's something that I'm just
that's just me and my channel and I love
that you guys accept that and I really
love when I see people like having
conversation or answering each other's
questions in the comments section I like
that it's kind of this community like
that I just really appreciate all of you
guys and I'm really I'm feeling very
grateful for my channel I feel like I
have a sense of responsibility I mean I
always have felt that way with my
channel but it's exciting to be kind of
like moving up a rung a bit but yeah I
still want to be myself and put out the
content that I like putting out in I'm
just really excited to see where the
channel will go and it would be like
insane if I didn't mention how much
growth I've had this month in my
favorites video because I think it's
been like 20,000 subscribers this month
which it blows my freaking brain it's
crazy because you seriously channels
you just never know you never know what
videos and when the likes growth spurt
is gonna happen so I really just if
you're creator out there and you feel
stuck and you feel like you're not
growing I get it like we've all been
there
but like just keep going keep being
creative keep you know finding places to
improve your channel and work on your
channel and work on yourself and figure
out your niche and all of that at some
point randomly III think that you will
get a video that you know kind of gets
you more known and I promise that it's
not you or your content it's just that
no one knows about
yeah and that's the biggest thing that
I've learned is that it's like you know
my content some of my older content is
getting a lot of use and it's like I put
that up like a year ago and it's just
that no one knew about it it's not that
no one enjoyed that video it's that or
only a small amount of people would
enjoy that video it's just that no one
knows about it yet so just keep going
that's my little thing like I really
just
you just never know I had no idea like
why now why at three years or at this
point why would it happen now but um it
did and I'm really excited so thank you
guys so much it's amazing going off of
that it was my birthday this month and
if you follow me on Instagram then you
guys saw like a picture I posted but me
and Sam decided to take kind of a last
minute trip to Vegas which was super fun
um it was just the two of us we went and
saw the show oh um it's like a Cirque du
Soleil show in the water and it was
really cool I'm a video talking about
things I want to spend my money on this
year instead of just makeup and one of
them was tickets and so I was really
excited to buy the tickets to that show
I think I want to try to make one big
ticket purchase every single month so
last month it was oh this month we're
seeing Hamilton in February we're going
to see Hamilton in Arizona said that's
super exciting and then I think we have
something almost lined up for March for
some show Sam wants to see some live
theater things so I'm just like really
happy that I'm making that happen and it
was just a cool show as in Vegas and it
was for my birthday and it was so cool
and I think I hit like 40,000
subscribers when we were out there and
that was really fun and I don't know it
was just I'm 26 and I know I'm not old
but um yeah it's definitely strange I
feel like LA is just weird too and and
it just like messes with how old you are
and all of these things I don't even
know where I'm going with this because
it sounds negative but it's not it's
just I like to ponder things imaginet I
know you guys can't imagine me just
thinking about stuff can you look anyway
someone to get off of that birthday was
fun Vegas was fun it was great lastly I
wanted to talk about some media
favorites because if you didn't know me
and Sam my husband loved to go to the
movies we love to watch shows we like
everything
the movie and TV industry it's great
besides a sexual harassment stuff could
that stop please my god anyway so I'll
talk about music first now that I gave
that long intro I've really been loving
t-swift I got her CD for Christmas and I
basically haven't stopped listening to
her album reputation since I got it so
it's been great I love it my favorite
song on the album is dressed that's also
Sam's favorite I love the last song I
love them all I think they're really
good it's definitely more poppy it's
just a fun listen really enjoy it I also
like the song delicate those are like my
two favorites probably I also have been
liking a song from Harry Styles called
meet me in the hallway I'm gonna leave
links to these either Spotify playlist
or leave a music video seriously like
listen to them if you're interested but
I love Mimi in the hallway it's so good
I just have been so into that song
lately and I didn't think I would really
like a bunch of Harry Styles stuff I
used to work at justice so when that's
wrong yeah oh that's what makes you
that's what it is that's what makes you
beautiful when that Sun came out from
One Direction like we were selling the
CDs and shirts with one direction and
socks with one direction and dog tags
with one direction like I was there for
the whole one direction crazy so I
didn't really think I'd be into Harry
Styles too much I'm not hating I like it
I can get down with some one direction
but I love that song and then the last
song is from ansel elgort is how you say
Ansel Ansel now on til it's way better
on til Elgort hopefully that's how you
say it
this song super nova it's a new single
from him I've been enjoying that song as
well I've just been enjoying a lot of
his music though I think it's like good
but he has a nice boys and I just like I
follow him on Instagram and I love
seeing him and Violetta and I'm like
into it so yeah I've really been
enjoying that
so those are my music favorites and so
when it comes to like actual movies and
TV shows let's talk about that favorite
movie in the month that we've seen
because we have movie past so we see a
lot of movies call me by your name my
favorite movie of the month my favorite
movie of the year I really hope it wins
Best Picture it's a slow movie if it
almost feels like a foreign film because
they are speaking Italian a lot and
there's also some French I think being
spoken in it
anyway there's subtitles and it's mostly
in English really great movie highly
suggested I think it's a really
important movie I just really enjoyed it
so much about it it's definitely my type
of movie it's like slower but there's
tension and it's gritty and it's sexual
and I just like it I like it a lot
highly suggesting that it's great great
great movie and then the other like
media or TV thing it's from Netflix and
it's called I think the end of the
effing world it's like an 8 episode
series I think it might have a second
season at some point but it's really
fast you can watch it super super fast
we started watching it in Vegas we were
just like waiting for our show to start
so we had been walking around all
morning cuz we went to this crazy buffet
in Vegas ok there's way too much talk
about this is like a long-ass video we
went to the Caesars Palace buffet and it
was crazy I might I think I have some
vlog footage I might trying to put some
of that up but it's like oh my gosh like
the food and everything it was like $50
a piece which really isn't even that bad
cuz they can get kind of crazy pricey
umm but yeah it was like a super fun
experience anyway we're out all day
we're walking and we got home we watched
the show that's what we're talking about
until we started the show there and we
finished it really fast it's only 8
episodes and I really enjoyed it I don't
want to give too much away about it so
I'm just gonna leave the trailer down
below and you might watch the trailer
and think like great cool I know what's
gonna happen the entire season but it's
not it's mostly just like the first
episode ish of that so there's a lot you
don't know from the trailer it doesn't
like spoil at all cuz I remember
watching it and being like cool I think
I'm gonna know everything that happens
but then I was watching and I was like
oh I'm so glad that I don't I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I know it's a
bit longer I tried to make these short
but like sometimes you just a girl has
to talk okay anyway thank you so so much
for watching guys I appreciate you so
much and I will see you my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
