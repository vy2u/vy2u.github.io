learn thank you so much for watching
this is going to be my July top 5
favorites I do a top 5 favorites as a
monthly favorites video every single
month just talking about five things or
groupings or whatever that I like it
could be beauty it could be life stuff
everything in between
I don't discriminate I just want to talk
about things like so that being said
before we start really really fast I
just want to say that I am wearing my
glasses today sorry not sorry but I just
wanted to see so you will see a bit of a
glare I think that's it for disclaimer
it's pretty good I'm going to start out
with some beauty products that I've been
liking and then we will move on into
other things I'm really excited to talk
about some things at the end with my
life and just mindset stuff so yeah stay
tuned for that warning I have a lot of
products here on my list from kiss
that's my first favorite just like kiss
products you guys know I tried a lot of
things out from octoly and sometimes
they really like the product sometimes I
don't and out of all the brands I've
tried if you like Eden minerals and kids
are the two that I've had the most
experience with and not everything that
I tried from kids do I really really
love not everything is a win but these
products are things I've really been
enjoying I've actually been reaching for
besides just kind of trying them out for
reviews sake or you know just to like
tell you guys how I feel because there
are new products these are things that
actually been reaching for and been
enjoying them so I want to try to run
through them fast because there are
quite a few first is a face palette this
is the ombre radiance palette in the
color grenadine it has a bronzer a blush
and a highlighter in it and the thing
that I'm most impressed about this
product is that they got the finish
right these are very popular you seen
from Kevyn Aucoin you see in permit
cosmetics and I mean other brands doom
too but I think that they just did such
a great job of actually making these
products workable and not just beautiful
and kind of gimmicky the bronzer is
matte is what I'm wearing today I'm also
wearing the blush and that's like a
satin and then the highlighter is really
pretty it's not too metallic but it
definitely gives a nice shine to the
skin I just really do think that this
works well I've been using it all month
I really like the color of the blush I
even kind of mix a little bronzer and it
just gives a really nice warm flush to
the cheeks the only negative I guess I
could say is that it is
cautery so that's a like turnoff for you
you probably won't like that about this
but it's nowhere near like the Anasazi a
subculture pellet so I think we're all
good another face palette that I have
here this one is a highlighting palette
and I know I'm talking about a
highlighter palette right now guys can
we take a moment this one is so so
pretty it's in the shade light and I
wanted to try this out because my
biggest gripes with highlighting palette
especially for personal use is that you
can't use all the shades in it like your
one skin tone how are you supposed to
use a million different highlighters
that suit different skin tones but I
feel like they did it right once again
with this light palette every single
shade in here I can use on my skin and
use as a highlighter I don't have to use
it as a blush topper or like a bronzer
or as an eyeshadow they all work at like
cheekbones highlights I am wearing the
darkest shade today on my cheekbones and
it looks absolutely beautiful my
favorite shade would be the middle one
but they all are stunning I really like
that you can get a nice subtle look on
the skin if you want that's kind of more
my preferred route you can also get kind
of like this what look where it's
invisible until you turn it to the side
and then you see the sheen nothing's too
metallic but if you wanted to you could
use like a setting spray and get a
really high shine I just think this is
really nice I've been reaching forward
all month over some of my other
highlighters and it's definitely
something I'm really glad to have in my
collection I have a loose setting powder
here this is just their translucent one
now I feel like a lot of brands can do a
pretty decent loose setting powder but
if you watch my disappointing product
video you know that not all setting
powders are good this one is just so
finely milled it's translucent it looks
really nice on my skin it mattifies
without leaving a really thick layer
which is exactly what I want I really
like that fresh look and I don't like a
ton of products on my skin I've still
been into that glowy whole situation I
highly suggest it still it's just so
freeing to actually see your skin I just
really fit into the beauty of skin
anyway I do suggest this I think it's
really really good
two more products and setting spray here
now I'm not someone who uses makeup
setting sprays to really lock in my
or lock in my products of the whole day
I just don't really think they work that
way I've never had something really just
like keep it on from a settings right
but I do like setting sprays just to add
a bit of a glowy Sheen to your skin also
to just kind of tone down any powder
maybe you use a little bit too much this
can really kind of just take down the
topper enos and add some more glow I
really like this it's nice and
affordable and the spray is really
really fine and then last year this one
is the pro touched moving primer I use
this in a get ready with me for a first
impressions type of thing and in that
video I didn't quite know how I felt
about it I didn't love it I didn't hate
it it was just kind of made me but the
more I use this the more I like it I
also feel like I'm kind of stepping away
from really porcelain primers things
that are adding a sticker layer on my
skin and going for something more
moisturizing I've really been loving
this I've been loving the first day
Beauty coconut primer which is kind of
just like a moisturizer I just feel like
they give me a nice hydrating booth this
is a bit more mattifying it almost
leaves like a powder finish on the skin
but it doesn't feel really heavy
although when you squeeze it out the
tube it kind of seems like it would be
overall I have really been liking it I
think it's really good
yeah I've been enjoying this that's
everything for the kids products I know
it was a lot but I just feel like it's
nice to see an affordable makeup brand
coming out with some really good
products like I said I've tried a lot of
things from kids and I do like other
products from them but those are kind of
my favorites these are things like I on
my own and like who I want to use that
because I think they're that good
and last kind of for products they
really don't have a ton this month it
did brush and you guys know I've been
like in the daily skins all Oh blah I
know I'm such a broken record but this
brush has been amazing this is the even
mineral stippling brush I talked about
this in a video where I first used this
brush but I remember when stippling
brushes for how you put your foundation
on like everyone use disciplined brush
there is elf stippling brush and it
definitely gives you a lighter coverage
which you get that I really like and
I've been loving this with so many
different foundations I love it was my
Make Up For Ever HD it just looks so
good on the skin I also love it with my
vessel and cream foundation with mine
are
playing foundation it's just so good and
honestly I really didn't think that I
would like it brush over a sponge you
guys know on a sponge girl I love the
Beauty Blender so much but this brush
doesn't pack too much product on and
because it's kind of wispy and not super
dense I don't feel like I'm picking up a
lot of like flakes on my skin I also
feel like my skin is in a better
condition than it's probably ever been
or then most recently I don't know if
that makes sense it is just so good you
don't have to have this specific
stippling brush I really just like this
kind of like not dense brush to really
buff in foundation just get a light
layer on the skin kind of even out any
redness you might have our discoloration
but you're not just completely covering
everything with a really thick layer I
just love it moving on let's talk about
some other things so I have a whole list
here I always write lists I love them
we'll start with just like media
favorites a baby driver duhhhh it's so
good I really love that movie man Sam
salt like a double feature one night and
we saw that in the beguile I really
wanted to see beguiled I was hoping
you'd be so good and it sucked
I hated it um oh so disappointing
anyways the baby driver was so so good
super enjoyed it highly recommend it
it's just like a fun really good movie
also Game of Thrones duh so so good I'm
so excited to see this I believe it's
the last season right and I like don't
want to end already the first episode
was a little bit disappointed I loved
the first scene and then after that I
was like okay can we get to real action
I've waited so long but yeah Game of
Thrones if you haven't been watching
that definitely get HBO go watch it you
will have the best time of your life I
think except when you're crying cause
everyone's dying but um no I just really
love Game of Thrones it's so so good for
music I've really been enjoying the song
fields by Calvin Harris I just think
it's really good and just kind of a fun
poppy King I'm enjoying it and then also
kind of a throwback I feel like most of
the songs that I enjoy are like
throwbacks because I just like old older
music and by old music I mean things
like circa 2005 ariana grande her first
CD it is so good I've been enjoying that
when I just
I put on something and let it play for a
while and it start from beginning that
city and go through the end I never
owned that CD but I did work at justice
if your og subscribers you guys know
that I used to work at justice I was a
store manager it was my first job I
started their work there like five years
before I moved out to LA but we used to
sell that CD and play those songs in our
store and it like brings me back to this
weird time but I really just enjoy the
music I think it's really good so that
was number three if you're keeping track
with two more things to talk about next
I wanted to talk about just kind of a
health journey I mentioned this briefly
in one of my updates I believe it was my
project you stood up all I went down
below I am in a different mindset with
my body and just what I want to do with
my life
I told you guys things were changing I
felt change coming and I'm really
excited to say that I am trying to get
my health in a better place I don't talk
about being overweight or plus-size a
lot on my channel one hello just you can
look at me there's nothing to say I
don't feel like I'm super a part of the
body positivity community or anything
not that I don't love myself I'm a very
confident person I do love myself but I
also don't let things that define me
it's not something that I like to just
be like hi I'm Lauren and I'm fat and I
love myself that's just not my style of
person I'm not saying anyone else that
does that is wrong we're getting so
controversial this is going to make this
topic so long I can do tube talk if you
want more on it but anyway I've just
been just wanting to lose a little bit
of weight I want to be healthy from the
in Sam Sam is like getting it tall and
hot and enough that I'm not hot but I'd
like to be a little skinnier I'd like to
just be healthy I want to be able to do
fun things
and not feel self-conscious in ways that
I feel like I shouldn't I'm at the
highest weight I've ever been at in my
life and I just wanted to get on track I
just was mentally there I think
sometimes it's like mental rock-bottom
essentially like a feared drug addict
but you just have to be there mentally
no one can do it for you you have to do
it for yourself and I'm really happy to
say that I'm in that space right now and
I am really excited for us so I've used
YouTube as a tool
kind of help me along with that I really
been wanting to do a keto diet and I
have been following that just not as
strictly so I don't believe I've been
into ketosis but but I did buy some
extra I'm opening them now in front of
you these are strips to test your
ketones to see if you're in ketosis I
will leave some videos linked down below
I'm not really wanting like feedback on
it in the sense of like oh don't do that
you should do this you should do that
there's a million things everyone can
choose to do what they want when they
want to get healthy this is what I'm
choosing to do at the moment and it
seems to be working for me I have lost a
little bit of weight which is exciting
definitely it feels really good and I'm
excited to lose more I've also been
doing some intermittent fasting I will
leave some videos linked on Matt and
that's been really great for me
personally it works with my schedule for
the most part and it just kind of takes
the stress out of like dieting away from
me I just I just clicked with me so
again everything clicks different with
everyone else not really trying to hear
anyone say don't do this don't do that
I love you thank you if you're really
looking out for me I do appreciate it
but I also I'm doing me homie and I'm
just telling you about it I'm not
necessarily open for suggestion not
trying to get me and just trying to be
honest okay so back to what I was saying
I've been using YouTube as a tool to
kind of keep me motivated just like I am
about beauty product like I want to feel
as excited about health and fitness and
just different things like that so I've
been subscribed and do some new people
I love mind over munch I will leave a
link down below she's so good I believe
her name is Alyssa she is just so fun
and so cute she's a little quirky and I
kind of love it it's just so good she
makes meal prep seem so easy
she makes being healthy seem just like
like it's easier than it it feels like
it is I just I love it I love everything
about it I got my mom started watching
it she's telling all her clients about
it she's a hairdresser that's why she
has clients but um yeah I just I think
she just does a great job with her
channel and it doesn't feel preachy it
doesn't feel too overwhelming or scary I
just love it I have been watching some
other people too dr. Bergin wand but
the more I watch them the more I'm not
necessarily into a personality like I
like the information potentially but
sometimes it feels like you just got
into a lecture halfway through when
you're supposed to be like caught up and
you aren't so I'll even linked but you
know take take that with a grain of salt
I think I'm just talking about that for
now if you want more videos oh no I
really started this whole thing I really
feel like Christie Vetter
I believe that's her name she's like an
OG youtuber she used to be a part of the
beauty community and then she did like
college stuff is long and she started a
health journey as well recently and I
just started watching some of her vlogs
and it's just motivation I just really
enjoyed it so leave her link down below
too but she kind of got the ball rolling
for me and I can talk more about this
whole thing in a different video because
it's a lot to talk about and this is
supposed to be a short little video and
it's not so let me know if you want me
to like update you guys I don't know if
I really want to make it a part of my
channel or not or something that's more
infrequent but still kind of updating
you kind of know let me know okay
all right let's talk about the last one
my gosh I think that's enough on that so
this one's going to be long - and I
apologize but it is what it is I feel
like I'm in a happy place right now I do
feel like I struggle with some mental
issues when it comes to depression
moving out here was really hard for me
I'm being like crazy honest in this
video it was really hard for me moving
out to LA we left our family left our
friends I just had Sam which I love and
he's awesome but it's just you know
different I changed everything when I
came to LA and it was kind of a lot for
me so I feel like it's a daily struggle
some things I'm really happy some days
I'm not and motivating myself it's
sometimes very difficult but I feel
really happy when I looked back at July
I've had so many amazing opportunities
so I wrote him down and I thought it
would just be a really great way for me
to kind of ring them true to myself and
just to talk about it not necessarily
brag but a little a little bragging I'm
really proud of it so first off I've had
a lot of gigs this month I try to talk
about these you might get ready with me
so I hope nothing is too repetitive but
I had a show on Disney premiere this
month its polaris primetime I didn't
make it mostly for Megan
show not all the time I don't want to
say I'm like the only one who did our
makeup ever so anytime you see here but
a lot of the time when she's been
skipped and all of that I did her makeup
anyway I worked on the show we has a
wrap party for that which is really fun
and I'm really proud of that I'm really
happy to be a part of that I've also had
some other gigs I just got off the short
film literally yesterday at 2:00 in the
morning it was a really late call time
but that was really awesome and from
that gig and aggregated earlier I'm
doing quite a bit lined up and obvious
which is awesome
I'm just really happy I also worked on
botched for a couple of days last month
which was great so I just it just feels
good to have quite a few kids come
through last month and have quite a few
kids going into August and actually know
I have them that feels amazing they're
paid which is awesome like it just feels
really really good I also I'm really
excited to be at a point where we have
quite a few friends out here finally
we're building up our network of not
only like you know work network but just
friends people we get along with that we
can hang out with have a good time with
and just genuinely click 4th of July we
were able to like go to a fourth of July
barbecue party which is really fun we
went to the Hollywood Bowl this month
which was the first time I've ever been
there to see a concert we saw blondie
garbage and sky ferreira in concert
which is really cool I mean we went with
a girl band met on set which is really
fun I had another rap party that I
wasn't actually a part of I just got
invited to because I'm friends with
everyone and that was really cool that
it felt really fun it was a good night
and it was just nice to genuinely you
know hang out with people and it's just
continuing into August I'm going to Film
Festival to see a short that I worked on
a year and a half ago at this point so
that's really awesome I know I'm just
really happy I'm in a really good
mindset right now and I wanted to share
that with you guys and I hope that if
you know wherever you are
Justin Avila shamed and hopefully you
know if you need help or trying to
figure out what it is and trying to move
forward in your life and not let it get
to you as much I know that's whatever
I'm not
trying to diagnose anyone or tell people
how to get help
I obviously am NOT a doctor but I just
hope sharing this with you will let you
know that like we're all human and just
because whatever I post on Instagram or
whatever you see on the screen isn't the
whole story and you're not alone if
you're feeling down sometimes and I
don't mean just down I mean like legit
down you know think recognizing it and
trying to get help in whichever way you
can it feels right for you is really
important and that you are important and
your health is important and it feels
really good when you get to a place that
will hopefully continue and be good I
don't know anyway I'm going to stop it
there way too much really heavy topics
today I hope you enjoyed this thank you
so much for watching guys a few more
videos to tell today one of I was also
kind of chatty and like similar to what
we just talked about in a way so look
forward to that if you watch this
portion of this video and that's
everything I'm ending it good bye thank
you bye the Vice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
