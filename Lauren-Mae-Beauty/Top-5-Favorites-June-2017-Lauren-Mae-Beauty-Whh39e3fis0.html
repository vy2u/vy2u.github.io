learn thank you so much for watching
this is going to be my June top 5
favorites video I like to do my
favorites as just the top 5 something
that's a little bit smaller a little bit
more concise I'm not trying to just
bombard you with a ton of products you
need to buy and these are really just
choosing less of mine I don't have a ton
of like actual product to show you
so we'll just get into it the first
thing I wanted to mention is the Kat Von
D Alchemist palette now I bought this a
long time ago I think I got this at the
beginning of the year slash the end of
2016 I believe it was part of holiday
you can still get this on the sephora
site if you were interested I really
just didn't give it a chance when I
first got it I was using the honest as
via moonchild palette and I don't know I
just didn't really get into this I do
have it on as a highlight today I used
the color sapphire which is like the
blue reflex I just feel like this is
such a nice palette I love that
everything so small and concise I really
like that these don't have any glitter
to them which the Moon child does have
they work as eyeshadows they work as
highlights you just work wherever you
want to use a duochrome powder and
honestly I find that I use all of the
colors equally I'm really into the blue
one lately I also really been liking the
green on the inner corner and what I
like about these two is that you can use
them on their own oh wow let me swatch
them you can actually see them that's
the green line above it is the blue one
it looks more blue in real life
underneath the green one is the purple
and then the pink one which is
absolutely beautiful as well is
underneath that it just looks white but
it does have a pink flash to it anyway I
just really like these I like that you
can put them over any other color of
shadow and it kind of they can transform
it they just look so pretty on the inner
corner too that's really where I love to
use them all the time I know the shadows
are very tiny for how much you're paying
for this palette but I do think that
getting a palette with duochrome that
it's something that you're actually into
is worth the money as opposed to buying
a bunch of high-end single pans of
duochrome highlighter next is something
that I put in a haul video I will leave
that video linked down below and I was
pretty sure I was going to love this and
I really really do I will say though my
mom was
town recently she just left today like I
dropped her off at the airport a couple
hours ago but my mom and my husband Sam
they just don't they don't like it as
much as me which I mean more for me I
think this smells really really good has
a very nice like sweet tropical it's not
like a bakery scent but in the shower
definitely it has a very like sweet
scent I love the packaging first off it
just makes me happy I don't think that
this is necessarily worth the price I
don't think this is something for
everyone I don't necessarily think that
you should go out and buy it I did get
that sent to me via octa lease so that
is part of the awesome part about this
but I can see myself for purchasing this
in the future it wouldn't be something I
have in my collection all the time but
it is a nice treat this feels really
nice on the skin I put it in my loofah
and I do feel like it doesn't set up as
well like my Bath &amp;amp; Body Works ones I
just need a little bit more product but
I really love the way this smells in the
shower the way it feels on the skin this
is a cream gel formula and honestly this
is one of the only cream or moisturizing
shower gels that I feel like actually
does moisturize and doesn't just feel
like anything else I've used it leaves a
little bit not on oil it just feels more
moisturizing it really does and when I
get out of the shower I can tell that my
skin just nice in a nice place not
greasy not oily there's no there's no
like residue it just feels hydrated and
then on top of that my skin smells great
throughout the day I can definitely
smell this on my skin which is something
that I love so I really really do enjoy
this if you like the sol de janeiro
products you might really like this I
definitely think you should maybe check
it out smell it while you're in Sephora
see if you would like it oh it says this
is pistachio caramel that's what it's
supposed to smell like mmm I guess I can
see that because I like this product
it's definitely making me lean more and
more towards buying the spray version of
the like mist I believe they are coming
out with a travel size of it so I will
probably purchase that when it comes out
just so I don't have to have the big
size in case I don't love it
much as I seeing I'm just okay with
having less product like I want it but I
don't necessarily want a huge one anyway
I've liked every product that I've tried
for them so far and this one is no
exception I do really like it and it's a
favorite I feel excited to pick a shower
because this is on there my last like
beauty product favorite are my color pop
products I just bought some color pop
stuff and it came in the mail so this
isn't like old I haven't had this for
forever but girl I like it and it's in
my favorites because I do truly like it
the first thing here this is the yes
queen palette and this is the first time
color pop has done a legit palette the
reason I bought this I didn't know was
going to be this tiny which it's not
that tiny it's just not normal size its
eyes shadow pans anyway the reason that
I bought this is because this was
sixteen dollars which is so inexpensive
that is just such an amazing price and I
just couldn't resist it was like yeah
I'm getting it so I picked it up this is
what it looks like on the inside I'm
sure you guys have seen this on
Instagram also videos are starting to
pop up about this this popped up out of
nowhere though like this was like on
Instagram and it's like it's launching
in three days they're like something
like that it was not a kind of time to
like really hype it up I think that
these shadows are really nice I really
like the color pop press shadow formula
I think that they're really good I think
they're super pigmented they blend for
me they're inexpensive like they tick
all the marks for me which is awesome
I'm extremely surprised with how this
yellow shadow performs I feel like it is
so good for yellow I did end up buying
their single shadow and T key and it's
just not as good so I know this is
limited edition and it is sold out I
think they're restocking I would
definitely follow a trend mood if you
don't if you want this palette or if you
just want to know about when things are
relaunching and all that they are my
like go to to figure out what's going on
in the makeup world but I highly suggest
this if you want it I will be making
sure I get basically every one of these
pallets when they come out unless it's
just something I just do not like you
cannot beat the price for how many
different eyeshadows you get to test out
and try I think they're really fun and
personally I love this small little size
I think it's perfect it's not too much
shadow I'd rather the price be less then
get full-size and it'd be more expensive
like everything about this I am loving I
am going to stop talking about
this now because I do want to do like a
review and a haul and just talk about it
more in a separate video so I'm thinking
for that but yeah I have been liking it
so if you see it and you want it I mean
you need to wait up and get on it
because it's sold out really really fast
and then while I was all excited I got a
couple other things but the only other
thing I want to mention in my favorites
video are different color pop shadows I
picked up the $10 palette now this holds
24 eyeshadows and I picked up two of
them actually and I have a few different
color pop shadows in here some of these
I've had before and some of these are
new to my collection
I picked up quite a few from the new
summer collection and I really like them
I'm just very happy
I bought some shadows when they first
launched I really did like them I use
them whatever but I feel like now that
I've gotten a few more and have that
palette I'm just definitely into them I
think they're really nice they're on
sale for four dollars right now if you
wanted to try some outs you could get
them for a discount and I do really like
the palette as well I don't like that
you can't see the shadows through them
that's the only like negative besides
the fact that these also get dirty
really fast they're like a light gray
and they're kind of almost rubberized so
if you have an issue with packaging
being dirty and not like driving you
crazy you will hate these but the shadow
formula and just that you can fit 24 in
here perfectly is awesome because you
know the Z palettes don't quite do that
so I definitely think for the price and
everything about them they're definitely
worth it I'm going to be keeping all my
color pop shadows in these palettes I'm
just I'm into it I brought them on a gig
recently like I'm very much into this
for the next product I'm going to be
moving the camera a little bit so here
we go it's still plugged in a this is
something I've been wanting to talk
about on my channel for a really long
time I just haven't had the time or the
chance to put in a favorites video I've
had other favorites or whatever but this
is a Himalayan salt lamp salt crystal
lamp I got mine at Marshall's or
HomeGoods for like $25 I got this at
Christmas time so houses
in my house for at least six months now
for about six months
yeah I've already had to change the bulb
once but I absolutely love it when it
comes to the healing properties and all
the claims of salt lamps I'm not sure if
I believe it I could see it totally
being true I could see it not being true
at all so that to me isn't necessarily
why I love it but I just think it's
absolutely beautiful it gives off such a
nice like warm glow in the house when
it's the only thing on I like to believe
that it keeps positive energy in my
house though I also like it for that
regardless of that it's just such a
beautiful addition to your house it
looks beautiful so yeah it's just a
favorite it's been a longtime favorite
but I thought I would mention it in this
video here I'm going to go put this back
now because it is super fake all right
and then last for my top five favorite
because we've only mentioned four things
I thought that I would just mention some
music favorites that I've been enjoying
I've still been loving post and alone
like I don't think I'll ever get over
Stoney album I just love it that album
is just so good like you can listen to
the whole thing anyway I really like
that I really like Justin Seto the remix
with Justin Bieber I've also been really
enjoying Drake I loved heard so much I
haven't really been giving his newer
album a chance because I was listening
to Stoney for so long but I really like
the song Blum so good what else
oh I've also been loving like old Akon I
have like a summer playlist going right
now I'd only have like seven songs on it
but that's like what I'm into always
that playlist link down below if you
want to check it out I'm so paid by Akon
I've been really enjoying that song like
feels good summer vibes to me like I
like blasting that in my car I just
pulled up my playlist so I could tell
you and then the last thing to I'd like
the song sunset lover by petite biscuit
which sounds like Sam Justin Kai so
instead of saying like the B word the B
word he says this kid like you know like
that's like his form of cussing I guess
because I sell petit biscuit just sounds
hilarious to me and my experience with
the word that's good so anyway it's
called sunset lover it's all like
instrumental but that was like a really
good just kind of like chill song as
well I really like it too so how will
leave those all linked down below if you
want to check them out I'll try to find
them on YouTube too so it's just easy to
find it
and that's everything guys I really hope
that your month went well I cannot
believe it's already July July 4th
that's crazy
we moved into this apartment two years
ago on the 1st of July so that's really
insane that we've been in this apartment
two years our last apartment six months
oh and you know it's always so weird to
me that like la always feels so new
still to me but you know it's also not I
have a lot of friends here now I
actually have like people I know if I go
somewhere I could be like oh hey like
which is a weird feeling yeah anyway and
I'm talking about time and how it passes
and how we're always so shocked about it
that's everything thank you so much for
watching guys I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
