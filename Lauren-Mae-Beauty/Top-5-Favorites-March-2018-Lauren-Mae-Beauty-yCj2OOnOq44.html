learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing my top 5
monthly favorites and this is going to
be for the month of March so I do mine a
little bit differently I only talk about
about five products or five categories I
try not to bombard you with a bunch of
new beauty items but I still like to let
you guys know what makeup items or
beauty items I was loving in the month
and then on top of that I also like to
talk about just other things in my life
whether I've done something fun or I've
been to a show or just whatever it is so
I want to talk about that as well I want
to start this video off with a saying
that I just in general feel really
grateful this month it was just like a
hard month for me I feel like mentally I
don't know why but just with social
media and just different things it was a
little bit more taxing than normal I
feel like I try to be pretty good about
keeping a nice balance and this month
was a little bit harder than normal but
toward the end here I am feeling just so
much better and I wanted to say thank
you guys so much for all of your support
all of the kind comments you guys just
watching my videos it really means so
much I cannot believe how many
subscribers that I have it's just
mind-blowing I've had so many
opportunities this month because of my
channel which has been amazing I've
gotten reached out to you from a few
brands that are some of my favorites
Moroccan oils reached out to me sol de
janeiro has reached out to me and has
sent me PR so that has been just like
such an amazing thing and I just want to
sit here at the beginning of my video
and just let you guys know how grateful
I am
that's always a favorite I mean my
channel and YouTube and this community
we have here is always a favorite but I
just I want to remind myself and I want
to just always remember that I am just
so lucky and this is so amazing so
that's kind of like my first favorite
just all the opportunities just my
channel in general it's been a great
month and I feel a lot better I really
tried pushing through this month when it
came to videos and just different things
I'm really trying to stay inspired I
feel like the content on my channel is
changing a little bit which I love I've
been doing a lot more tutorials which
has been kind of fun and I'm just
exploring that a little bit so I'm glad
you guys are enjoying it anyway let's
move on to some Beauty favorites then
we'll get into some other favorites
because I have a few like media
favorites
like obsessed with speaking of sol de
janeiro i have a few products from them
i got sent a few items in PR and the
whole package was revolving around their
new product which is the brazilian bob
buck this is a body scrub that you can
use in the shower you can also use this
as like a full-body mask and this is
yellow like it's yellow BL i'll just put
it on my hand i was gonna not but this
is a yellow product if you guys follow
sol de janeiro on their social media
you'll see like all these hot models
like covered in yellow paste like they
look so sexy on the beach anyway this is
a really nice scrub and i'm surprised i
like it honestly because i like
something that is like insanely gritty
and i feel like this is kind of a medium
maybe high medium grit it definitely has
a lot of like the mixing medium the
yellow paste will call it but the pieces
in here are really nice and exfoliating
they aren't anything that's going to
dissolve because they aren't sugar let
me tell you what they are
i'm not sure what it is the yellow is
like amazon river-- clay or something
anyway this smells amazing it smells
like all their other products which you
guys already know i freaking love so
much this just feels so nice in the
shower and i really love the fact that i
can just continuously scrub because the
particles aren't dissolving in the
shower like they do with the traditional
sugar scrubs that i use those ones are
super gritty but as soon as they start
melting they're gone you know what i
mean so i really have been enjoying that
this has just been a really nice product
i will say that i like to scrub my body
before i go in with my shower gel
because I do find that this yellow
pigment will stay on my skin if I just
like wash it off with my hands after I
scrub my body with it you can see like a
tinge of yellow like there's the tint of
yellow on your skin so once I go over
and like scrub my body and actually
cleanse it with a loofah it doesn't stay
but that's just something to note I was
thinking about it though I thought that
might maybe look good if you have a tan
and like kind of just give you like an
extra radiant glow if it's not too
heavily yellow but anyway yeah you
definitely wanna make sure you get this
off really well because it will leave
your skin just the tiniest bit like a
tinge of yellow if you don't completely
completely remove it off the skin but
anyway I've been loving it I think it's
really nice I think this retails for
like $25 so it's expensive all their
products are expensive
they're a luxury brand and I love it
it's been really great and I've been
enjoying my shower even more than normal
and that pairs so nicely with their
shower gel too so it's just like heaven
in your shower and the other sol de
janeiro product that i have here is a
hand cream actually bought this myself I
really have been wanting to get it and I
finally was like I'm gonna buy it
this has the classic caramel pistachio
scent it smells amazing Sam like knows
what this scent is so he'll always be
like oh boom boom like yeah yeah I have
it on my hands I think that this is
pretty strong like I find that the scent
stays with me throughout the day so I
definitely suggest like you have to
really I feel like love it which I do it
smells so so good this is a very very
fast sinking in hand cream this is not
something that's going to give you a ton
of moisture this isn't something you
want to use us like an overnight
treatment this is something just to like
quench your hands at the moment but you
can easily go into doing work touching
papers touching your computer touching
your electronics you're not gonna get
them greasy and that's something I
really love about it so keep that in
mind when you're buying it if you're
looking for a deep deep hydrating hand
cream this is not gonna be the one for
you
but if you want something that's going
to be nice in your purse has a nice
scent to it and then it's going to give
you some moisture without completely
rendering your hands useless you will
really love this and I felt like the
price on this wasn't too bad it's $15
which is expensive but I think it's
worth it next I have a few products from
scent bird now I did a whole Sanford
review so if you want to check it out
I'll leave it link down below the first
item that I have here is a candle and
there are two reasons this is in my
favorites one this candle is like so
tiny and you think this is going to be a
shitty candle but it's not it's super
good I was so surprised
I thought that this candle is gonna have
no scent throw I thought that it was
going to burn out in like four hours
this lasted the full 40 hours that they
said it would the center on this was
throughout my entire apartment just like
it would be with one of my Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works candles which I was so happy with
and then specifically this scent is
amazing this is Siberian fir and cedar
wood it smells exactly like my Times
Fraser Fir candle which is one of my
all-time favorite scents for the holiday
so I can definitely see myself picking
this one up again this
was sent to me along with the hand cream
actually everything we think in my
favorites was sent to me except for the
sol de janeiro hand cream I just I got a
lot of good stuff this month but I would
consider purchasing this in the
subscription of scent bird which would
make this $14.99 and I think that's a
really fair price for this candle
because I think their scents are
definitely different and unique and it's
such a good quality candle I was just
very impressed with this I'm not easily
impressed with candles I feel like
because I just feel like bath and body
work their scent throw is so good and
you can usually get them out of pretty
affordable price when you use coupons
and sales and stuff like that but this
was worth it I really enjoyed it I think
it's cute I was very pleasantly
surprised
I think this retails for 22 on its own
so I definitely suggest the subscription
if you're gonna do it but that was a
product I really really loved and when I
saw it initially I was like oh no but it
surprised me in a good way and the other
said bird product that I have here is a
hand cream and specifically I'm putting
this in because of the scent I do think
it's a great formula and I love the way
it feels on the hands but this is just
too expensive like I wouldn't purchase
this product but this scent is what just
gets me this smells so good I really
love a good fig scent and this one is
one of my favorite ones I've ever
smelled I'm not sure if they make a
candle in this but if they did I would
that would be the next candle I ordered
I just I love the scent so much it
smells amazing if you like a fig scent I
think you would love this I think this
retails for sixteen dollars just for the
hand cream but then you can get it in
the subscription for $14.99 I think
that's a little bit pricey for it being
scent birds but I do love the scent so a
candle would be like the perfect combo
for me I only have two more products to
talk about the next one is a highlighter
and this one is from Dior this is the
Dior skin
nude air Luminizer in the shade zero two
I think it's called pink glow and this
is just so pretty this is the one I've
been just gravitating to I really like
how kind of icy it is on the skin but it
doesn't look too pink where you can't
wear it with a bunch of different looks
I know wet and wild has a highlighter
shade that's supposed to be a dupe for
this and I think that they are very
similar the difference for me is that
this is more of a really just pretty
sheen on the skin whereas that one has
just a little bit more of like a sparkle
it's still shiny
and I think with like a setting spray
you can make it work definitely and if
you're in a budget I get it but this one
is just so pretty and I prefer it I have
both of them and this is the one I
prefer over that one I like this kind of
baked gelee formula a little bit better
than the wet and wild but again if
you're ballin on a budget I get it the
other one definitely works and is great
but this one if I had to choose I do I
like this one better and the last
product that I have here is from Kiko
and this is the free salt blurring
iPhone I have a review on this product
and a bunch of other things from the
free Sol line I'm gonna leave that link
down below too if you want to check it
out it was supposed to be a testing
testing 1 2 3 video but I deleted all
the footage from 1 &amp;amp; 2 so it was just
the final review which is still great
information but it was a lot of work
that was deleted anyway this is an
amazing product I really love the way
this feels under the eye I've been using
this as kind of an under eye primer I
know that sounds so extra but I promise
you this is really really nice this
smells like roses and it does have a bit
of an illuminating aspect to it but it's
nothing you can detect the only way I
can detect it is if I'm like looking at
my finger afterward but I do not notice
any shimmer or anything like that
under the eye this has a like kind of
silicone type of feel but it doesn't
feel heavy under the eye I find this
gives my under eye some moisture it kind
of like fills in any fine lines but it
doesn't make any products if put on top
of it where weird it doesn't make them
crease it's not extra moisture that's
like causing any issues I just truly
love this product I think it's great if
you were looking for something that
sounds similar to this product I really
think you would enjoy it
it is $20 which I think it's pricey but
at the same time it's for the under eye
so I kind of give it a bit of a pass
I've really been enjoying it I will be
sad when it's gone I mean I still have
quite a bit of product left but it's
definitely something I'm like oh I'm
gonna want more of this and that's
everything for products for this month
for some like media favorites I have to
talk about a show first I've been loving
queer eyes so much Netflix rebooted the
show and I just love it I think it's
amazing there are so many reasons why I
love the show it's fun it's reality TV
but it doesn't have that like nasty
feeling of reality TV it's
uplifting message if you don't know what
the show is about it's about five gay
guys who go in and they make over a man
doesn't have to be straight man doesn't
have to be a gay man they just go in and
kind of do like what we see a lot of
times with women where they like change
their clothes and give them a makeover
in whatever they do that to men and I
think it's really cool because it's
bringing together so many different
people that are from different walks of
life and just like showing the humanity
and it all on top of just being a fun
sassy little show it just blends so many
amazing parts I think all the men on the
show are just amazing and funny and
talented and beautiful and it's just
like such a feel-good show I've
literally cried my eyes out every single
frickin episode it just feels good to
watch it it feels so good it makes you
so hopeful I just really enjoy the
message and the positivity it's just so
good just trust me if you have Netflix
and you haven't seen the show yet watch
it it's amazing it's still reality TV
but they just do it in the right way
like it's the it's just the perfect mix
of reality TV you to me so I've been
loving that so much even Sam really
loves it like we're just into it I'm sad
that I finished it and I want more
episodes like now for music I've been
loving a playlist that I made on my
Spotify so I'll leave that link down
below but it is called woman power I've
really been into like strong female
vocals I really loved the artists sacred
I think that's how you say it she's a
Swedish artist I believe and she just
has some like bomb songs she's super
young but she has just like great music
so I'm gonna leave some of her songs
just down below if you want to check
them out basically been obsessed with
her I've also been loving another
Swedish artist which is so weird because
then I did a music video for Swedish
artist this month too so that was all
just kind of weird how that connected
this month but I'm gonna leave this song
it's called say my name and it's not
like the Destiny's Child like it's
different but it's the same title and
I'm gonna leave that song linked down
below I think you'll really enjoy it but
if you want the whole playlist I will
leave that linked as well Lord has been
a favorite and I just love Lord and then
mixed with that I also have just been
loving Kanye like life of Pablo has been
my jam so much I love the song waves I
love all the songs on there I just
sometimes feel like you need a little
Kanye in your life no matter what you
want to say about Kanye he just makes
some bomb music that puts
in a mood that makes you want to do some
 like whether that's giving you
confidence whether that's like making
you want to take on the world which is
confidence um for me it's just some like
good pump up music it makes me feel good
I love singing it I just I love the vibe
and feeling I think he's a really great
artist and yeah I've been loving that
album so very much I don't know if I
have a ton of other favorites I've hung
out with friends a lot this month which
has been really really awesome that's
been something that's been missing from
my life a little bit and I've really
been enjoying it we've gone out a couple
of times I partied a little bit just
totally not me but that was a good time
and yeah I've been enjoying myself I
also started Weight Watchers this month
I definitely wouldn't say that this is a
monthly favorite in the sense that I've
been doing it all month and you know
it's been a month of results but I have
been doing this I think I'm on my second
week now and I'm feeling really great
yeah I still feel really positive and
it's just been working out for me I
really like the point system and I love
the fact that there doesn't feel like
you can't have food like there's never a
time where you like run out of calories
because they do a point system where
there are things that are zero points so
if you're hungry you're encouraged to
eat better foods instead of you know
kind of feeling like you just can't eat
anything and I really enjoy that about
it I also love that the points take into
account other things than just calories
so something that I think is really cool
is like they show you like a doughnut
like a yogurt and berries and some other
breakfast maybe eggs in something
they're all 230 calories but for the
points they are not the same amount of
points the doughnuts like 10 points and
I get like 30 points or something like
that
so that would be a third of my points
for the day but the yogurt and the
berries is only like three points and
the eggs and something is like four
points or something like that and for me
I just love that it's encouraging you to
eat better like make actual better
choices for you instead of just looking
at calories because I think that a lot
of us if we've ever been on a diet or
whatever sometimes it's like you just
are going off of calories and not
necessarily the actual nutrition you're
putting into your body and I love that
they calculate that into the points and
it just makes it kind of easy to train
yourself into eating better things I
also love that like bread and
are not like considered the devil
chocolate for sure is the devil
don't you dare try to eat yourself some
chocolate lots of freaking Weight
Watchers unless it's like specific and
you made it to be low points I'm telling
you if you go to the movies and you just
like eat some chocolate you will
probably go over in points but you can
have rice you can have bread and it's
not insane amount and I love that too
because again it's just enforcing that
you can still eat things it's just
eating the right things with the right
nutritional value and even bread has
good nutritional value especially way
better than chocolate but in my head and
how I've like seen food it's like bread
and rice are on the same scale as like
peanut M&amp;amp;Ms and that's not the case
anyway enough about that I can do some
more videos after I've done Weight
Watchers for a little bit longer if you
want me to I just let you guys know how
it's going or whatever but other than
that I'm gonna leave my favorites video
here thank you so much for watching guys
thank you so much for all of your love
and support all the time it truly means
the world to me you have no idea and I
will see you in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
