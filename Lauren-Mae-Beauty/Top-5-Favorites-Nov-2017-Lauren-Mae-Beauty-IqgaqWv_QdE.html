Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be going into my
November top 5 favorites this is
basically my take on a monthly favorites
I like to have these a little bit more
short and condensed not so product heavy
necessarily I'm just letting you guys
know the things that I loved and enjoyed
during the month of November I like
looking back at these as like almost
little like monthly scrapbook so that I
can remember how my month was because my
goodness things fly by and I cannot
believe we're into December already I'm
so excited although I really feel like
2017 was the fastest year that I've ever
experienced so we'll start off with
beauty products first I have 3 different
things and then we'll move into yeah
other favorites because I got a lot of
those too the first Beauty favorite that
I want to mention are these hand creams
from Crabtree &amp;amp; Evelyn
now in a haul video a while back I had
mentioned that Sam had purchased a like
pack of I don't even know how many there
were maybe 16 hand creams from Costco
from me that we're all Crabtree and
Evelyn I was so excited it was for my
anniversary so I was like yay and I love
them I love the formula I had never
tried these before and always wanted to
because I love the L'Occitane ones that
are in the same packaging and I've
already used up one of them it was the
lavender one which I showed in my most
recent empties video I will have any
video I talked about linked down below
but I think they're great they're very
velvety on the hands they actually
moisturize though it doesn't feel like a
barrier on the skin I personally like
using hand creams at night because I am
NOT someone who really loves lotion I
love the effects of lotion I just I
don't like feeling like there's a film
on my hands I just don't like the
feeling of having like grease or just
stuff on me but these do not feel that
way they just feel great on the skin so
I highly recommend these I don't know
how much they retail for individually I
think the pact that I got was like 35
for all of them so I thought that was a
really great deal these will last me
probably into next year I haven't
started a new one yet because I am
finishing up my last locks of town one
that I've had for like ever I don't know
how it's not bad yet but it still smells
great so once I finish that I can move
on to these and I'm really
to do that my next favorite when it
comes to beauty products is this bronzer
from Estee Lauder this is the bronze
goddess bronzer and this is in the shade
0-1 light I did receive this from octoly
and it's funny because in my initial
haul video I had mentioned that this
looked like it would be maybe a little
too red or too dark like I don't know I
just was like I don't know about this
but every time I've used that I love the
results on my face it just looks so
subtle and nice every time I use it I I
just really love the results and I find
that I've been reaching for this over my
other bronzers like I'm like oh I wish I
wasn't working on that in a project cuz
I want to use this so I think this is
really great I don't know how much it
retails for so I will put that on the
screen somewhere I'm not saying that
this is necessarily worth the price or
you should go out and buy it you do get
a ton of product but for me I am just
I'm really liking it so since I do have
it I do like it I really enjoy it so to
me this works as a matte on the skin but
it does have a little bit of a sheen to
it it reminds me a lot of the NARS
Laguna bronzer honestly like the way
that one is it's very similar to that
but I do like this better than the NARS
one because I have been trying to use
that up and I just like this better so I
thought I would mention that because
I've really been loving the way this
sits on the skin and I really have been
loving the way my bronzer and makeup
turns out when I use this product and
last for Beauty favorites this is the
Sephora perfection mist airbrush
foundation now I've rediscovered this
because I do have it in my 12 pans of
Christmas video which I will leave the
update to that I believe it's up already
down below this just looks so good on
the skin this is the shade fair yeah
fair the shade range on these is
horrible I think they finally added a
few more but it's still pretty bad even
this is a bit light for me I find I
really can only use it in winter but the
finish of this on the skin is so
beautiful sadly mine is expired it
expired basically like eight months
after I bought it now I
that's because it was sitting on the
shelves a really long time and I didn't
realize that when I had purchased it it
was like close to being expired it
doesn't have any type of sunscreen in it
so it's not like this sunscreens off you
know how we always say like oh the
sunscreens bad but the product isn't
there's no sunscreen in this so that was
kind of disappointing to me but I
honestly feel like this looks so good on
the skin it is very similar to the Dior
while I'm like that's what it's doing
essentially and what I like to do and
the best way I found to use it is I will
take my Beauty Blender that's already
what I'll spray this on and then I'll go
in and Pat it on that way
I don't like spraying this on my face I
just find that it's kind of messy and I
also don't like spraying this on the
back of my hand and then going in
because this is in a like aerosol
container when it comes out it is like
ice-cold and if you just do a little bit
it's not a big deal but if you're trying
to like build up some products like a
reservoir of product on your hand you
are going to burn yourself like this is
especially if you're putting it too
close it like hurt me once and it's like
really cold so I just I don't do that I
just spray it on the thing to have it
where I wanted I find I can barely use
any of this product it looks so good on
the skin the coverage I would say is
about a medium but that's something that
I really like I can just even out the
redness I don't feel like I have to have
like this huge layer of foundation I
just I really do like it
I would potentially consider
repurchasing this it's something I do
really enjoy having in my foundation
collection so those are all the beauty
products guys let's move on to some
other favorites now I had to like stop
myself from talking about this first but
I was like it's a beauty channel maybe
talk about beauty first I don't know but
if you guys know I mean I talk about
this all the time but me and Sam are
movie people we love movies we both want
to work in movies like we love the
movies so that's something that as we
move to California we weren't able to go
to as much because the movies are so
expensive here I mean a ticket is easily
at least 15 dollars a piece so that
makes it 30 I mean it just starts
getting crazy and we have found movie
paths if you guys have heard about movie
paths I'm gonna leave links down below
so you guys can check it out but movie
path is basically a monthly subscription
service where you pay nine
995 a month I believe is what we pay
each and you get to go to unlimited
movies a month there are some
stipulations so I will again just leave
the link because I don't want to get too
much into it but basically you can go
see one movie a day you can only see the
movie once but you can see a movie a day
every day of the month if you wanted to
with your card and you only still pay
the $9.99 a month you can only go to
select theaters that work with movie
past all the wala bla but it has been
life changing it's been so amazing last
year for the Oscars so for the 2016
Oscars is that how it works it's like a
year behind like they do it in 2017 but
it's for the year 2016 pretty sure
anyway that was the first year we had
seen all of the movies in the nominated
like Best Feature Film category it was
the first year we had done that and I'm
so excited that we'll be able to do that
again and not have to like pay a million
dollars or drive like way out of town to
find really cheap theaters see the
movies we want to see so I haven't
suggested just to give you an idea they
have an app on your phone where you like
check into the theater you have to be
close to the theater to do it but it's
so great if you want like a whole video
on it I can do that for you I also want
to make another mask in a movie because
we've seen so many movies recently I was
thinking about having salmon and kind of
doing like a bunch of different movie
reviews and just kind of like chatting
about movies but we have seen oh so many
movies I'm just gonna like read off all
the different movies we've seen because
it has been so much it's so weird cuz
only some show up but we've seen all I
see is you that was technically at the
very very end of October we saw happy
deathday and we saw three billboards
outside of Epping Missouri now let me go
into my AMC app because using the movie
paths of AMC is like the best thing ever
because you still can get your points
now last night we were gonna go see the
disaster artist but it was like the
first night and it was super packed and
it was sold out so but that was the
first time the guy had been like oh you
can't use your steps card with the movie
pass but you can just go to a kiosk and
do it separately so whatever but we had
always been using the steps card with
the movie
so you're getting points and getting
rewards back so that you can you know we
get a discount now on getting some
popcorn and so usually we're not the
type of people to buy things at the
theater but then getting that
five-dollar award in getting that
discount we're like oh let's get an Icee
or let's get a large popcorn so it's
been making the movie experience just
like the best so at AMC let's see what
we've seen we saw Coco with my mom when
we were in town that was like so good I
cried my eyes out
we saw Murder on the Orient Express
killing of a sacred deer that one's
really Indy
I know we've seen more than that though
oh we saw my friend Dahmer yeah just so
many movies and it's nice because we can
kind of go out of our comfort zone and
see movies that maybe we aren't like in
love with or we were like I kind of want
to see it and it's not like you know
gonna put us out financially to do it so
absolutely suggested it took a little it
took like a week to get our cards I know
some people are waiting a really long
time but if you've heard about it if
you're interested if you love going to
the movies I highly highly recommend
getting movie pass it's amazing it's
like literally changed my life I know
it's not so dramatic but like seriously
it has another media I think the rest of
these are mostly media oh no no no okay
before we go into the rest of the media
favorites I just wanted to talk about me
and Sam day trip to Horseshoe Bend if
you guys follow me on Instagram you saw
like the shot of me like on the canyon
and like the cool Instagram pic we took
but that was just really fun to travel
from Arizona up to Arizona I mean it's
in Arizona huh what am I saying I feel
like I'm not making sense but um we
drove up to it's right outside of Page
and it's just like a part of I think
like Powell maybe I don't know I just
wanted to go somewhere cooler in Arizona
and it was either that or antelope
canyon and Horseshoe Bend his free baby
so that's why I want to Horseshoe Bend
and it was really awesome it was
beautiful and it just inspired me again
like I was saying in my get ready with
me which is where this look is if you
like it you can check it out there it
just has inspired me to want to go
travel and I just I love seeing nature
it really does inspire me I I just love
it so so much so I really want to try to
do a day trip every single month next
year and just make that a priority
because yeah you only live once and I
want to see some cool stuff so anyway
that was such a great trip and I want to
continue doing stuff like that okay
moving on to the last couple of media
favorites so I have a podcast this month
because we traveled Arizona we drive
there so it's not too bad of a drive
it's like a five to six hour drive it
depends on if you stop and how fast
you're going and all of that but we
listen to a podcast on the way home and
it was so good we finished the entire
thing it's called dirty Jon now I've
talked about podcast before I'm not
super into podcasts because I don't know
I'd rather listen to an audiobook or
just listen to music I just once I'm
into the podcast I like it I'm just not
I just don't reach for it immediately
but some podcasts that I've liked in the
past
I loved cereal this American life Sam
listens to all the time and then we also
listen to s town so those are the all
the ones that I've listened to and dirty
jon is very similar to those so if you
like any of those podcasts that I've
mentioned you will like this podcast as
well it's like a six I think it's a six
episode maybe it's an 8 episode kind of
like serial where they're like digging
into a situation that's happened I
really don't want to give any of it away
so I'm just gonna link it down below if
you want to check it out but I am
excited to listen to some more podcasts
when we travel back to Arizona for
Christmas I've had recommendations of
what is it what is it my favorite
murderer I think is one that people have
recommended to me and so I want to try
that one out and see if I like it I kind
of want to see what lore is about
because I watched the Amazon like the
first episode of the Amazon series that
they made and I just was not feeling it
but people tell me that the podcast is
different so I want to listen to lore on
the podcast I don't know if you have any
suggestions so leave them down below for
me I would appreciate it so much
if you think that they'd fit into like
what I've already talked about I would
love to know one but yeah highly suggest
that check it out I think you would like
it again if you liked any of the other
ones I've mentioned and then for me
music I have some music favorites i
always do i will leave my Spotify
playlist linked down below that I'm like
listening to the most which is my now
7000 playlist because I'm hilarious
anyway I've listened to a lot of chance
the rapper there's only one song on that
playlist but just in general chance the
rapper I love this song I think coloring
book is that what his album is called
just a great album so highly suggest
chance to rapper so good I've also been
listening to quite a few songs from
Lords new album now I don't think it's
that that new but I really like the
homemade dynamite song the remix I
really like a green light I like perfect
places I really like Liability that
one's so good so highly suggest that I
love cheese Swift's new songs although I
don't have the new album yet it's like
on my list I think I'm gonna ask for it
for Christmas because it's like you know
something that I'll really love and
enjoy but it's pretty inexpensive as
well
I love call it what you want to or is
that what it's called I think so
gorgeous
the ready for it and what's the first
one that came out look what you've done
or whatever look what you made me do I
think that's what it is
I just loved those songs so I know I'm
gonna love them and I cannot wait to
listen to it also you know I don't know
if you guys have heard of this this guy
his name's Billy Joel still totally into
village folk I just love him so much
he's so talented his songs are so good
they work in every situation if you want
to like like seriously just like jam out
you can if you're like listening in the
car with like an older audience they're
gonna love it a younger audience still
gonna love it like he's just amazing and
I love his music so I don't know maybe
check out Billy Joel the new guy in town
you know like a new person on the music
scene a lot of people haven't heard of
him but if you check them out I think
you'll really like him Billy Joel and
that was kind of everything for my
favorites I did want to mention though
