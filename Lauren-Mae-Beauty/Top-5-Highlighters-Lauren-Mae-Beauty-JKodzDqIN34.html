favorite highlighters I wanted to just
kind of keep going with my top 5 and
show you some other products and
categories that I've been loving now
disclaimer all of these highlighters are
high and I don't know what it is I was
looking through my collection and I
don't think I even own one drugstore
highlighter I don't even own one and I
don't know why that is I don't know I
don't know so these all are high-end so
you know just letting you know that now
before we get into it but I love them
all so so much these really are my tops
I do love highlighters and these are the
ones that I feel like I'm gonna say
that's it every top 5 these are ones I
reach for it the most and they're just
beautiful and I feel like they're all
slightly different except two are really
similar but I feel like they are all
slightly different and can give you a
different look or result so let's just
get into it let's just start off and
let's go with your so this is your this
is not amber diamond this is rose
diamond I have the pink tinted one that
is what it looks like
and I really like this one because
because it's pink toned there's a swatch
of it I hope you guys can see that it
it's just so beautiful I love that it's
pink toned because I do feel like I have
cooler skin and I just I really like a
pink toned highlight like a frosty pink
highlight I think that looks really good
everyone loves gold and like champagne
and I like I like pink champagne and
like pinky ones so this is perfect for
me I also love that there are so many
different sections if you wanted to you
could use these ones as like a really
light blush or you could just use these
ones as your highlight or swirl them all
together and have a more pigmented
highlight I love that you get the
options you could use these as
eyeshadows you could do whatever you
want with this I think the quality of
this product is amazing and you're never
gonna run out of this ever so it's
expensive but it's gonna last you your
entire life basically so this one's a
great one I wanted to give this one I
mentioned too because I know amber
it is so popular but I think rose
diamond is so pretty too I like it I
like rose diamond I'm into rose diamond
the next one I have to show you guys is
this 1 by 2 face this is to face
candlelight glow highlighter now this is
like a duo double-sided oh you can't see
it it's like double sided so there's a
lighter side and a pinky side what I
love about this one and what makes it
unique
I just swirl them together but is that
it kind of has this iridescent glow to
it none of the other ones here are like
iridescent like they're shimmery and
they're beautiful and they have this
great highlight to the cheekbones but
this one like has an iridescent and I
love that about it this one is just so
pretty
umm I highly recommend this one and I
don't feel like I see this one a ton I
just saw recently in someone's video but
it's a good one it's a really good one
and um I don't feel like the two sides
are different really they're slightly
different but I just roll them together
we're like put it in between and I've
gotten a lot of use out of this one I
really enjoy it and I think you would
too I think you'd enjoy it especially if
you like a shimmery highlight I think if
you blend this out really nice it could
be less you know intense or you could
really build it up this one is just a
really nice one I have to mention it
guys this is Becca's highlighter in
moonstone it's a shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone you know I really
don't need to mention it because
everyone's mentioned it but I really do
like this this is a gold toned highlight
but this is one I actually think looks
really nice on the skin it just is great
this is I mean it's worth the hype
everyone talks about it for a reason
because it's great it's a really great
one um the quality of it is amazing and
it's not to cold tone I mean it just has
like a gold tint to it but it's not like
gold on your skin so I think that's why
I still really like it and it is quite
an intense one umm but you can also I
mean
again any of these products I feel like
you can kind of shear out and make them
less intense just depending on you know
the type of brush you're using or how
you're applying these products but this
one's great it's great the hype is real
the hype is real this is a classic one
here if you like the Becca highlighter
kind of took this one's place but guys
this one still exists and I think it's
still great this is mary lou manizer by
the balm and it's a beautiful highlight
they are quite similar I don't know if
you can see the difference the tone is
just slightly slightly different in them
I feel like the amount of shimmer from
these is very similar
this one just is more gold tone and
slightly darker so if you are super fair
potentially the BEC one might be better
for you but I mean I feel like for
anyone these are gonna have a really
similar effect I don't think you need
both I have both but I think they're
still great and I really still love this
one I also loved using this one as an
inner corner highlight I thought it
looked really good there cuz it wasn't
too bright but it definitely still
brought light and opened up the eyes so
this one's also really great and you can
definitely get the bomb one weight
cheaper if you go on HauteLook or
whatever you can just definitely get
deals on the bomb I feel like better
than you can on the back of stuff so
that's something to consider last but
not least I have this tiny little laura
geller baked highlighter in french
vanilla I really like this one I got
this in a set and so this is a small
version of it now this is gonna be the
most subtle highlight I have going on
here and there's just something about
this one it's if you can see it it's
this one right here and it just looks
like your skin is glowing from within
it's definitely not like these other
ones it's not super shimmery it just has
I don't even know how to explain it I
just took glow I could see someone
potentially using this like to set their
under-eye or even like in the center of
the face like set the face it's quite
subtle I mean it's subtle enough I feel
like to do that I also love putting this
one on the inner corner of the two
I feel like it just looks the inner
corner at the inner corner of the eye it
looks really nice there as well
I really just I'm like watching this
like oh yes this one is quite wonderful
but again this is for someone who
doesn't want like actual shimmer
none of these are glittery but real
shimmer on this is not going to do that
this is really gonna look more subtle
and um just I can't my brain is
exploding from all these just really
great really great trust me anyway I
really highly recommend this one
especially - I feel like for potentially
mature scanned I think that for the most
part people can do whatever they want
and there's no rules but sometimes you
got to be careful about what you're
doing and if you do have a lot of fine
lines and you don't necessarily want to
bring attention to them I think this one
would be really nice just because it's
not super shimmery but it's still gonna
give you that glow so potentially like
you know for more mature skin I would
try this one first I mean you can still
try those ones and everyone's skin is
different so it might look great on you
but this one will probably for sure look
like amazing on you guys anyway that's
everything so those are all my favorite
highlighters my top fives my
tried-and-true the ones that I just
can't live without I love them so much I
hope you guys enjoy this video leave a
comment down below if there's like a
specific top 5 video you want to see I
don't know what I want to do next but if
you have something I'd rather do that
one first so let me know about that guys
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
