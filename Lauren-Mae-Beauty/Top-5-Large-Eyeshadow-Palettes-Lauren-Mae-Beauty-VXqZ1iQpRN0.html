just stick with me these are going to be
top 5 videos i'm going to do this video
here which will be my top five favorite
large i shadow palettes and then i'm
gonna also do my top five small palettes
I just wanted to keep this series going
if you have any requests for anything
else that you want to see my top 5 on
let me know in the comments down below
I'm kind of not like running out of
ideas but i don't have a ton of
categories left that i can think of so
if there's something you want to see let
me know I'll also link down all the ones
that I've already done down below so
let's get into this these are my top
five large eyeshadow palettes in no
particular order let's do this also
another disclaimer these are my specific
ones that I like that doesn't mean that
everyone will like them everyone has
different tastes I also do a lot of
makeup I'm like gonna be a makeup artist
so I get that not everyone would pick
all of these some of them one of them is
not a neutral palette at all so I
realize that but these are mine these
are my favorites I've got two started
out with the Naked palette everyone
loves the Naked palette this is my
favorite palette out of all of them and
now there's even the smoky one I don't
own it but this is my favorite one I
feel like there's a reason this has so
much hype I know there's a lot of other
palettes out now whereas when this came
out I feel like there wasn't a lot of
other stuff like this on the market but
I do really like it I know there's only
two matte shades which are naked and
fuck but I just love the way this
palette makes my eyes look if there is a
look I want to do where I just want to
feel pretty I want to know i'm gonna
look pretty i know i want to know that
i'm gonna love my eye look i will always
go to this palette and i will use i'll
use sin on the lid i will use naked in
the crease I'll put buck on the crease
as well and then I'll put virgin ama
inner corner and I absolutely love it
every single time i usually get
compliments to when i wear that look so
i absolutely love this palette next in
line we have the lorac Pro palette this
is the original palette and mines super
nasty so I apologize but I absolutely
love this palette as well the concept
behind this palette is so simple but
also just so genius so half of it is
Matt half of it is shimmer it's just
perfect I love nude I've already hit pan
on that and I
wasn't trying to pan this palette I just
did because I loved it so much i also
love mob in the crease it is such a
beautiful unexpected crease color it's
just so gorgeous garnet stunning that
gold in here is beautiful it's just a
great one I love that they are more warm
toned colors I do have the lorac pro 2
but out of both of them I definitely
prefer this one as a whole more than I
prefer that one so this one is a
must-have for me i would definitely
repurchase this palette if I ever ran
out of it because I love it that much
sticking with lorac I also really loved
the unzipped palette this is a rose gold
Rosie neutral palette I love this
palette so much it's just absolutely
stunning there's a matte cream color for
your brow bone which I absolutely love
unspoken as a nice matte so is unbridled
it's just a great palate I like this and
I prefer this palette over the naked 3
palette even though that one is like
Rosie toned this one definitely beats it
out for me in the naked 3 palette I
don't love every single shade whereas I
love every single shade in this one it's
a great one if you're looking for those
rosy neutrals this is definitely the
palette I suggest it's just absolutely
gorgeous get it and I do suggest this
one over the gold one if you're going in
for one if you're going in for both just
get both of them because they're both
great but I love this one the best this
is my tart rain forest after dark pellet
I absolutely love this palette now this
has more than just I shadows in it this
also has a blush or bronzer and
highlighter so it's just like the
perfect palette for traveling for me I
love the shades that you get you get six
eyeshadows this is a matte like creamy
pink color you can use it i would use it
as a transition because i'm so fair but
it does also have these two shades as
matts as well this like topi purple
shade is absolutely so stunning as I go
one shadow of look and then these two
this gold and purple pear so nice
together I just love it it's just a
great palate it came out during fall I
believe last year but I think they made
it permanent because of how much hype
and how many people love this palette
it's super great if you were thinking
about picking this up I think it's
wonderful the blush in here is also just
so beautiful by itself it's definitely a
kind of blush I would buy
just in a single form it's like a dusty
rosy pink color the bronzer is I believe
tarts Park Avenue princess which is just
a great bronzer and then this is like a
nice just basic golden highlight it's
just perfect i think they did they just
nailed it with this palette and i don't
really love cool toned colors that much
and this is pretty cool tone but i just
something about this palette makes me
love it and i've gotten so much use out
of everything in this palette it's not
one of those ones where yet has the face
products but i don't use them i use all
of the items in this palette this is
definitely one I suggest if you're
looking for something that can do
everything for you this is like all your
color cosmetics in one and last but not
least is the Urban Decay electric
palette now this is the one that
obviously not everyone's going to love I
think this palette is absolutely
beautiful and I'm so glad it's in my
collection it's so nice to have all of
these colors all in one palette it
really hasn't been anything quite like
this I don't think the thing that's so
great about these shadows is that
they're not like a hot pink that you you
know think you're gonna use and then you
go to use it and it just sucks these
deliver so I love that I can count on
these shadows when I want to do like a
hot pink in the crease it's gonna turn
out the way I wanted to look it's not
gonna be like muted or faded or like
more gray toned or just chalky looking
it's gonna look like what it looks like
in the pan I'm sure you guys have all
seen this before but this is just me
rubbing my finger in them and it's gonna
stain my fingers that's one thing about
this palette is it does stain so I
definitely think you should use like a
primer on your lids or wherever you're
going to be using this to kind of keep a
barrier between your skin and the
product just so if you are gonna do
something after and you don't want like
green eyelids that will help with that
but these are just amazing I still use
the like pink and purple shades around
my eyes and I haven't had any irritation
even though technically you're not like
they don't legally say you can use them
around your eyes because of the dyna
manned the FDA but anyway I love this
palette I think it's absolutely
beautiful and super unique and for me
it's a must have in my collection those
are my favorite top five pallets that I
own I absolutely loved every single one
of those let me
know down below what your favorites are
if I didn't mention them or if any of
these ones are your favorites I hope you
enjoyed this video and I will see you in
the next one look out for my small
pellets because that will be up next bye
