great things happen in March and I have
a lot of talk about I have a little bit
more than 5 things but they range from
beauty to life to like fashion I don't
know it's a lot of different things so
I'm giving it a pass because there are
only three beauty products so it's not
like guy I'm just Bob Barton you with a
bunch of beauty stuff there's a few
things I want to get out of the way
before we bring up beauty the first my
number one favorite of March is so so
freaking exciting if you watch my
palette bingo then you already know if
you follow me on Instagram than you
already know but one of the shows that I
was working as a makeup artist on is
announced it's going to be premiering on
e on the 4th of May it's called second
Wives Club I'm so freaking excited I go

excited to finally see my work like on

doesn't mean as much because there's
nothing for them to really go off of and
so finally seeing like the teaser

and it's like a real freaking thing it's
so exciting but I told you guys in that
video that I'd have another announcement
coming soon and here it is it's already
here so I am also happy to say that I
was a part of a different show that's
going to be premiering on II called what
happens at the Abbey now if you thought
that second Wives Club seems like juicy
and dramatic honey you're in for a
surprise let's say that because this
show has a lot of drama it's a lot more
I guess Rocchi it's a younger audience I
feel like that they're going toward I

and I just love the community that we've
built here on my channel and I just want
to say thank you it means so much to
share it with you guys and that you guys
are so just so happy for me and excited
for me it feels amazing so thank you
thank you thank you let's move on to
another favorite I'm wearing it on my
face and I freaking love these glasses
again if you follow me on Instagram blah
blah blah I posted a picture of these I
got them in the mail like that night and
I was like I like cute these are a
little bit like I'm digging for fossils
like I'm gonna get cursed by an old
mummy curse because I went into the
temple and I'm discovering things like
that's what these glasses are I am
obsessed with them I think they're so
cute I was a little nervous because I
have a round face to get round glasses
but like I am obsessed with them I've
only had them for a couple of days I was
just gonna mention these because I got
sent them from Fermi oh my I'm not
worked with them because this isn't
sponsored but they've sent me to other
pairs of glasses in the past so I feel
like you guys kind of already know about
it anyway I was just gonna mention it at
the beginning of a video and I decided
to throw in my favorites because I love
them I saw a picture of Kim Thai from
her Instagram wearing a pair of round
glasses and that was the picture that
sent me over the edge that I was like I
really want a pair of like circular
glasses and so when I went on the site
they have a ton of different options I
do have a link for you guys if you want
to sign up you send your email you'll
get sent a link so that you can get a
free pair of glasses and you
have to pay for shipping which is
awesome they have really affordable
glasses if you've already signed up they
always have different deals going on
like buy one get one free all this
different stuff anyway I saw these on
the site and I was like those are the
ones I want they have a bit of a pattern
on them I'll do like an insert shot so
you guys can see because I feel like
from far away it's hard to tell but they
aren't like silver they're almost are
like I don't know they're just like
spring and summer and I feel freaking
cute in these I feel like myself like my
hair makes me fun and it feels like
myself and these glasses feel fun and
feel like myself if I'm not wearing
makeup
I still feel cute Sam really likes them
he's so cute he thinks I'm cute all the
time but we went to the grocery store
the other day and I was wearing like no
makeup and just the glasses and he's
like you're so cute oh thank you so
anyway I just feel really cute in these
I feel stylish one thing I really like
too is I always get the ones with the
like feet on the nose instead of like
stuff that just rests all on it because
I try to have glasses that touch my
makeup as little as possible and
something I really really like about
these two is that I can smile and
they're not touching my cheeks which is
irritating because then you have like
you know I've to pad out foundation and
then it can kind of rub off throughout
the day so it's just kind of if I can
find glasses that touch my face as
little as possible it's it's a win-win
and these are just so perfect in so many
ways these also are insanely lightweight
which makes them feel a bit cheap and I
mentioned that in my last for a new
video which I'll link down below if you
want to check out my collection I did
like a glasses collection plus my new
glasses but my last glasses I got we're
also very flimsy but I ended up loving
them more than my other glasses because
they're so light so although they feel
like they could break and those ones did
break because I would hit my head on
things like they're flimsy but then me
just being the klutz I am and just like
smacking my head on the door when I get
into the car just like different things
I do they couldn't really withstand the
fight I put them in with everyday wear
and everything so anyway those are gone
but I ended up wearing them at the most
because they're just so light and they
don't give me a headache I'm really
sensitive to getting headaches because
of my vision and I don't wear my glasses
if I'm inside my house I don't wear my
glasses for the most part
I've been wearing these ones and it just
depends on what I'm doing if I'm editing
I try to because it's like better for my
eyes I'm very rambling in this video and
I apologize but what worries like going
I don't know where it's going cuz I'm
just like Warren you're talking so much
anyway I don't really know is going
these are just really lightweight and
although they I have to feel like I have
to baby them a little bit and I want to
baby them because I want them to last I
love that they're so lightweight because
I can just I just feel free in them I
don't feel like there's like some heavy
thing on my face I don't feel like I'm
about to get a headache they're awesome
I love them I'm really into fur mu and
just see you guys in for to my
prescription so messed up that even
though I get these sent to me for free I
end up paying $10 every time so I paid
$30 I know it's not like a ton of money
but I've paid $30 over the course of my
three glasses because my prescriptions
that messed up that it costs $10 extra
and they don't cover that oh I have
spent kind of my own money on it and I
do wanna have a little bit of extra cash
want to get a couple more pairs because
I think they're just so fun and I feel
like I always feel so refreshed and
rejuvenated when I have a fresh pair of
glasses that I feel super cute in I just
want to take selfies and I want to like
I don't know I just when I look in the
mirror after like you know working all
day or whatever it is I'm like oh girl
you cute alright alright like okay cute
so anyway glasses another favorite I'll
move on to beauty things and then I'll
get into the rest of my other favorites
if you watched my lip product video that
I recently posted I will leave a link
down below this was mentioned in there
and this is something I've just been
really really liking this is the color
Finders Keepers in the colourpop lip
gloss I talk all about this lip gloss
there so I'm not gonna go too in depth
about it but this is just such a nice
gloss their formula is so nice it's not
sticky there's a lot of color payoff for
it being a gloss and I like wearing this
just by itself if you want more lip
product suggestions from me I definitely
suggest that video I'm someone who
doesn't like a very high-maintenance lip
and this has just been perfect to give
my lips a little bit of color when
foundation gets on them from doing my
face but nothing too much I love it my
next favorite is something that's
basically all used up which makes me
super duper sad but this is for
the body works in it's a shower gel in
wild berry and chamomile with natural
tea oil now this seems like a boring
scent it almost looks like a guy shower
gel this smells so good I'm basically
just talking about the Senate here I
don't think it smells like what I would
picture wild berry in chamomile to smell
like at all it kind of smells like
walking into Jamba Juice so it's like
fresh but it has like almost this creamy
coconut under note to it it's absolutely
divine I want to get another one of
these I really like this this is not a
part of a limited-edition collection or
anything or like seasonal collection I
highly suggest that if you're in there
you just check it out you smell it let
me know what you think it's good it's so
good I really really like this I've
enjoyed showering with it and obviously
it's a true fit because it's gone and
I'm gonna put in my empties and talk
about it again because I like it that
much last like beauty type of favorite
this is a stick foundation from outer
box
I was actually sent this from love
Heatherette she sent me some of her
products she was decluttering so thank
you so much Heather now I have some not
disclaimers with this product but this
might not be the best for oily skin but
this looks so good on the skin and
that's what I love about it this is a
super creamy stick foundation like this
is me just touching it against my skin
and product comes off it's crazy how
creamy this is this is in the color
linen which is slightly dark for me
that's one of the reasons that she sent
it over was because it's too dark for
her skin and I feel like I'm about like
a shade or so darker than her so she
thought it'd work better on me I just
think this looks so good on the skin I
like to actually buff this in with a
brush which is like whoa who are you
Lauren I don't like the way it looks
with a Beauty Blender the sponge when
it's what tends to like pick a product
to make it splotchy
but if you buff this in with a brush it
looks so beautiful it looks like skin I
also think using your fingers to jab
this in is a really nice method because
it's already so creamy but then it warms
up with your fingers and it's just
beautiful
now having oily skin this is not last I
mean I definitely get dewy mm-hmm and
oily throughout the day but I just think
it's such a nice product I feel like
people with normal maybe combination
skin who have like a good primer would
really like this if you have really dry
it might cling to some patches I mean if
you're really oily it's definitely gonna
have some oil seeped through throughout
the day but the finish on the skin is
just so beautiful I'm definitely
considering buying these for my kit
that's how much I like them I just think
that they look beautiful on the skin if
you were thinking about trying this it's
just really good guys I feel like even
if you have dry skin like try to get a
sample or something because this is such
a creamy stick foundation it really does
kind of remind me of the makeup for
everyone it has really good coverage but
again it just looks like skin on the
skin which is what we're looking for
okay on to my last couple of favorites
the next thing I wanted to talk about
was an album some music favorites I've
been loving post Malone's new album
stony it's very good it's like what I
want to listen to all the time which is
crazy because Drake dropped his album
and I'm still a zoom to posting alone
and I'm obsessed with drink if you don't
know anything about me know that
girlfriend
I love Drake so much okay some songs I
recommend I fall apart so good I love
this song go flex I love the song
congratulations that one just makes me
feel like no it's just so good I also
like the song deja vu a Justin Bieber
I'm just into his whole album though
like I feel like it's a great one to
listen through all the way it's a great
one to like have on shuffle it's a great
one for any time any day no matter what
you're doing chilling doing dishes
driving around whatever it may be this
album is super good two more favorites I
promise that's it um I wanted to mention
a show that me and Sam recently saw
called fun home Sam is the one that
wanted to see this and I'm just like
okay cool and he got us tickets it's
like kind of a complicated story to talk
about I mean it's not really it's very
musically so if you don't like musicals
you will not like this but I thought it
just was really good it's a story of a
woman who's a lesbian and kind of you
you watch her watch herself grow up and
like visit past parts of her life Sam
told me that this is based off a graphic
novel which is really interesting and
cool I'll refrain from singing I kind of
want a thing but I won't it's a great
mix of being funny and sad and just real
like this is real life you know you
you're crying but you're trying to make
yourself laugh you have to
look at the bright side and I just
really thought it was a good it was a
great play and musical and I think
everyone did a great job so if that's
coming to your town and it sounds like
something you'd be interested in
definitely check it out it was super
good and it was nice going in not
knowing anything and then enjoying it so
much last favorite I know this isn't a
lot of beauty stuff I'm sorry I've just
had like more like life things this
month than normal
my last favorite of the month is going
to be my new car if you guys watched our
car vlog we bought a new car me and Sam
have had we've had not too many cars in
our life we bought our first car
together when I was in high school I was
graduating in senior he's two years
older than me so he was a sophomore in
college right we bought our first car
together at Mildred it was in 1992 Buick
Buick Park Avenue baby and we loved that
car it broke down then we got Seymour
which is the car that broke and made us
get this new one and it was a 2004 I
think Elantra Hyundai Elantra and not
recently died on us which was very
stressful we were down to one car and
then our car that we had our other car
freaking broke down and that was a huge
repair bill I mean over a thousand
dollars on top of our other car dying it
was just it's been a month on the car
front so it was really exciting that we
were able to get a new car this is the
fanciest car we've ever had the newest
car we've ever had we have a 2013
Hyundai Elantra I know we're really
fancy um but no for us this is like
crazy you know we went to a dealership
we bought it from a dealership which is
very strange for me um when we were
shopping I was like telling Sam like I
never thought we would ever buy a car
from a dealership so I feel really
blessed that we were able to do that and
that we were able to get a car that's so
nice I feel like we don't really have to
worry about it breaking down obviously
things happen and cars need maintenance
and repairs but you know we should be
good for a while and it has Bluetooth
guys we are so fancy I'm telling you in
our other car we had like the tape
adapter that had like the cord going
down like to plug into your phone like
that's the level we were on the other
carbon
even how that just how like a CD player
so I'm feeling very fancy and I'm loving
it I'm very grateful and very happy with
it so that's really awesome that's it
for my top 5 favorites which was more of
like a top 7 or 8 favorites I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
anything and everything will be linked
down below you guys know how I do and
that's everything I'm gonna film like a
ton more videos tonight and I will see
