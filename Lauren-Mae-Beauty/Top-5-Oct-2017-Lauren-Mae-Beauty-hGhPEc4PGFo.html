Lorne thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be talking about my
October top 5 favorites
I'm gonna leave my favorites playlist
linked down below but since I have quite
a few new people to my channel I thought
I would let you guys know this is my
version of a monthly favorites video I
like to talk about at the max 5 beauty
products that I enjoyed for the month
and then other than that I'd like to
bring out just like events and just
things that I've done throughout the
month I like to include other favorites
besides beauty products because it's
almost like a little diary for me to go
back and watch these videos but I also
think that there are more important
things than just beauty in a whole month
that happened and I'm going to try to
keep this short it ever is but we're
gonna try and so let's just get into the
products I was loving so the first
favorite is something that I was tempted
to put in my last month favorites video
but I just thought I'm gonna try it out
a little bit more and I still love it
it's so good guys I did get this sent to
me from octa Lee but it's so amazing but
if you've seen any of the demo portions
of my videos you know that I've been
using this a ton and this is the Lancome
tante idole ultra wear makeup stick I'm
pretty sure I said that one right guys I
think I did it
anyway I have the shade 110 I've wore
this is a little bit light for me at the
moment but when we get into winter it's
gonna be perfect I still totally wear
this on its own though this month has
been crazy busy for me with work and
just different gigs and jobs and a lot
of the times I don't have a lot of time
to get ready in the morning and I don't
want to bother putting on a ton of
makeup but I still want to look
presentable since my entire job is to
make someone else look good and I want
them to feel comfortable and not be like
wait this girl's gonna do my makeup so
this has been perfect for just like easy
where I won't even set this with a
powder sometimes like I just I really
enjoy the ease and the way this looks on
the skin that's all I have left
humm I'm almost done with it it's crazy
like I've used so much of this this
started out above the stick so I just
super enjoyed this if you're looking for
a good stick foundation I highly
recommend this and check it out I also
love the hourglass one and I have been
using them together but this one is
amazing on its own as well really the
last like beauty product is this hair
product that I picked up last month I
did show this in my hair care haul I
will leave that link down below this is
me more
boiled dry shampoo in the light tones
and it's amazing I freakin love the
smell of Moroccan oil it's all so
freakin good guys so honestly a big
portion of why I like that is because it
smells absolutely amazing but the dry
shampoo itself works amazingly well too
but cheese is my all-time favorite it's
inexpensive I get it at Marshall's it's
great the smells for me are not that
amazing though I do like the tropical
one it smells like coconut but it just
smells a little bit cheaper this just
smells like high-end I just feel so good
using this I love using it so I actually
would consider repurchasing this I am
lucky enough that I can get mine at a
discount because my mom's a hairdresser
so I can get it at like wholesale value
so when I get the opportunity to get a
couple more of these I probably will buy
a couple it's just it's so good and the
fact that it smells so good and work so
well is worth it to me I don't know if
I'm gonna always have this in my
collection because it is pricey and
batiste is just so much cheaper but if I
can afford this I won't be using this it
is just so good I love it so so much and
it's weird because actually like on this
brain also comes out purple I don't know
what that's about but this is like
tongues they do have a dark tones one if
you don't want a white cast in your
roots just to let you guys know - and
the last like product I have to show you
guys is actually a pair of shoes I hope
that they're not too dirty I'm sorry if
they are but these are my Puma slides I
got these at Ross for like $10 the are
the men's I don't know what sizing them
good pretty big Oh a 11 and men's I love
them so much I've been really wanting a
pair of Adidas slides and I just haven't
gotten around to getting them and then I
saw these at Ross and I loved them they
do have some girl version ones which
they're like a little bit smaller here
like they're like half the size and I
did buy those before I bought these
they just don't stand my foot very well
because they don't have that like white
or strap and I just like the classic
look of these better I'm a very chill
person and I've really been liking that
sporty look so I have been loving those
I wear them all the time if I don't have
anything like special to go to I'm a
salesperson if you guys didn't know so
yeah I love those I love that I got them
at a good deal they're so cute and like
for less sporty easy comfortable love
them so the rest of my favorites are all
a bit more personal they don't have to
do with like specific items but the
first one I want to talk about is my
anniversary me and Sam had our 10-year
dating anniversary this month on the
13th I know I've talked about it a lot
I'm sorry it's just very exciting to hit
such a huge milestone we started dating
when I was 15 so that's how we have 10
years I'm 25 now so yeah we started
dating really really young that's how we
can have 10 years already and it's just
super exciting it's so crazy to think
back about where we used to be how much
we've grown and changed and you know
it's really exciting to see how our love
has evolved throughout all those years
and I'm still just as in love with him
in so many different ways though as I
was back then it's crazy anyway I'm just
excited for more years to come and our
three-year wedding anniversary this year
so I can't wait to look it to like 10
years married and so on and so forth
it's just exciting and um yeah it's a
favorite of mine okay next favorite
again like I was telling you guys at the
beginning I have been so busy with work
this month and it has made the month fly
by it feels like the longest month and
the shortest month all in one because
I've done so much I did a short film I
did like a spec commercial where I
filmed up north and I actually didn't
vlog them so I'm gonna leave those vlogs
down below if you haven't checked them
out but if you want to see what it's
like on set I tried to give you guys
kind of like a sneak peek of that and I
know I wasn't uploading a lot kind of in
the middle of the month because I was
just so busy I didn't have the time to
sit down and film like I normally do you
um so I tried to get those out just so
you guys could see what it's like on set
for me and just kind of see them behind
the scenes it's just kind of fun the
footage is not the best I was filming in
some low light situations a lot of the
time but I'm still really proud of those
vlogs I think they're kind of fun and
something a little different for my
channel so if you want to check those
out they'll be linked down below
I did some photo shoot stuff this month
I also did a pilot this month so it's
just kind of exciting and
yeah it's fun to work it's fun to like
have the time off to film and do stuff
but it's also really fun when I am you
know just working a ton another favorite
of mine we have been kind of going out
more than we normally do this month we
did some stuff at the beginning of a
month and then last weekend was like the
weekend before Halloween so like
Saturday like I'm filming this on Monday
just you guys now and this one will
probably be up-to-date so we're in real
time and then on Saturday I did a couple
makeups and then we went out to a party
and it was really really fun we were out
super late like the Sun was almost
coming up type of late and on the way
home we took an uber home and it was the
most pimp uber I've ever been in in my
life actually it was he was technically
driving for lyft at the moment if you
guys don't leave me an Instagram I
posted just like a really crappy photo
of us but he had microphones
he had like you could pick your own
music on this little tablet on the back
of a seat
he had it like decked out with Halloween
decor that like glowed in the dark he
also had this like projector shooting up
like fun fancy lights and stuff like
while we're driving it was super cool
super fun it was like hilarious that
such a weird random time in the morning
we were in this weird uber anyway it was
super awesome I've never been in an uber
that was that decked out and it was
awesome definitely a favorite and last I
wanted to mention some music favorites
because I kind of always do this I'm
gonna leave my most recent playlist that
I've made on Spotify down below in case
you guys like that I do that but my
first song they love miguel's
Skywalker love it I'm Luke Skywalker on
these haters like yes I love it I love
like really punny raps and stuff like
that so anyway love that song so good I
just love Miguel you guys know that he
was in my favorites last month and then
the other song that I've been loving is
Ansel s L quartz Ansel Elgort I believe
that's how you say his name he's the guy
in baby driver he's in The Fault in Our
Stars that actor he sings to if you guys
didn't know and the song you can count
on me has been my favorite ever I think
him and his girlfriend have been
together for like a really long time
it's super cute and I'm pretty sure it's
like about
so cute anyway the opening of this song
sounds like a Casey Neistat vlog like
there should be some like you know time
lapses going on with the beginning of it
but uh it's so good I really enjoy that
song so definitely check those out I'll
leave them linked down below and guys
those are all my favorite to help you
enjoyed this I'd love to know what your
favorites were for the month it hasn't
even technically been Halloween yet when
I'm filming this but I don't think I'm
doing anything that that special anyway
I feel like I really celebrated
Halloween on Saturday so thank you so so
much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
