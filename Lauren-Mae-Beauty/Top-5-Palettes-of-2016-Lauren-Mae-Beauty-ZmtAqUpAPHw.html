Lauren since 2016 is coming to an end I
thought I would do a couple videos on my
channel about my favourites for the year
so this is going to be my top 5 palettes
of 2016 most of them did come out this
year I guess it's like a spoiler but
there is one that I just love and I just
wanted to mention so let's just get into
it there is a huge thing with all of
these they're mostly all warm toned
palettes so yeah sorry guys it's what I
like obviously I just gravitate to the
warmer colors I'm sorry
the first palette here is the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette it's the
first palette I purchased this year in
2016
I believe this came out in February or
so and I absolutely love it so inside
this is what it looks like lots of warm
colors and then it has this pop of
purple I think this is a great palette
especially for the price I love the
packaging I love the concept and I just
love the shade selection in here I love
that you get that pop of purple I
obviously really like the idea of doing
neutrals with a pop of color and this
just inspires me and it's fun to me
there are a few things I don't like
about this and I just want to suggest
and tell you about it front these two
shadows here do have quite a bit of
glitter in them so does the color soft
and sweet but I find that that kind of
like flies away so if that is like a
total buzzkill for you this might not be
for you but I love this palette for the
other colors enough that it works for me
obviously I have a bit of a dent in
bananas and I really enjoy putting that
all over the lid I love that this color
here extra creamy is a matte shade to
put all over your lid to set your base
and then peanut butter and nuts about
you are just perfect transition slash
crease colors for me overall it's just
one of my favorites and I really do like
it
I feel like two-faced has put out a lot
of palettes this year that let me down
and this is one that I actually liked
and I actually feel like it's worth it
and I'm just gonna mention right now I
just saw the like reveal of the honey
palette and I'm so disappointed I'm
really disappointed with that palette I
just feel like I want some clear
concepts like I am okay
with getting behind uh anyway it best
should go into a different video but
anyway let's move on let's move on to
the next college the next pellet I
wanted to talk about is the dose of
colors ice-cream palette I do have a
review video and swatch video on this
I'll leave it linked down below I think
I also have a 4 looks 1 palette so
anything I have relating to these
palettes I'll leave a link down below if
you want some more info or looks or
whatever
obviously this palette is super fun and
colorful and that's something I love
about it I just think this has a really
nice composition of matte and shimmer
shades I feel like the quality is really
nice and I love it it's an indie brand I
just in general really liked it so my
favorite colors out of here I've
mentioned before but the color cone and
sherbert are just like easy go tunes for
me but I love that it has the pop of
mint there's a gold you can use very
swirl is also an amazing color it's also
matte if you want something to kind of
switch it up lavender honey is so unique
and it also gives you a couple deeper
options in a matte and a shimmer in case
you want that so the only color that I
don't like in here is bubblegum but it's
still workable it's just you know not my
favorite color so overall I love this
palette though I think it's really great
and I do suggest it plus the packaging
on this is just absolutely adorable you
cannot you cannot deny it the next
palette I wanted to mention is the lorac
mega Pro I'm not sure if you can still
get this this did come out for holiday
2016 and I just love this I think this
is such a beautiful palette obviously I
feel like a lot of people have these
colors but I do love the lorac Pro
formula and I love that they're just all
in one palette for you I feel like I
could do so many looks with this palette
and just enjoy it so much basically
every shade up here absolutely love so
many of the shades down here absolutely
love mine's pretty dirty I do use this
in my kit and so you know how lorac
shadows are they do have a lot of like
kick up so sometimes it's hard to keep
it clean but overall quality wise
absolutely love it cider and rose quartz
are still some of my favorite shades
I'll swatch them really fast they're
just absolutely beautiful I love it so
this is one I highly suggest again
holiday palettes can kind of be hit or
miss
and I did get the Kat Von D metal mat
and I just definitely suggest this over
it I do I like this palette better than
that one so I just love that I'm so
excited to have it I really think that a
lot of people would get a lot of use out
of this palette and enjoy it and I know
I have I don't think anyone making a top
5 favorites on palettes would be
complete without the modern renaissance
everyone loves this palette I don't
think I've seen one bad review on this
palette maybe because of the size of the
shadows like that's it that's the one
bad thing we wish we got more I
absolutely love this I have it pan on
actually two of the shades now it's such
a great palette obviously super warm
toned I do have a 4 looks 1 palette on
this I'll leave a link down below if you
want some inspiration I don't know how
to use it or how I like to use it but
it's just great the quality of these
shadows is amazing I love that so many
of them are matte which is I mean just
so much is right about this palette I
highly suggest it I love that it's
permanent and I can see myself almost
you know getting another one or getting
singles to replace the ones I use up in
this palette it's so good
most of you probably have this already
but if you don't any were wondering yes
it's still amazing yes it's worth the
hype it's so good I absolutely love this
the last palette I wanted to mention
this year is something that I feel like
I keep turning to to just do fun looks
and just something that I really feel
like I would miss if I didn't have this
in my collection and that I really loved
this year and I'm sorry to say that it's
the electric palette only because it is
being discontinued I know this was on
sale on a lot of sites like Sephora I'm
sure on Urban Decay's site maybe even on
altas so hopefully if you really want it
you can pick it up on one of those sites
before it's gone forever but I love this
palette I'm so sad they're getting rid
of it I have seen the newer palette
which is beautiful but so different I
mean it's not replacing this in any way
shape or form I love the color savage
obviously I'm wearing savage right now
and I love it in my brows I just love
that color
I love jilted I just I think this
palette is a beautiful palette and I
think it goes so well with neutrals or
just doing something fun I really don't
feel like there's anything on the market
that's this fun on
like I mean sugar pill has some nice
stuff but I just love that this is all
in one palette and I just am I'm in love
with this I love it so much
definitely trying to pick it up for like
$24 I think that's a great deal the
thought of getting a backup on this has
crossed my mind not gonna do it but I
highly suggest this if you are wondering
about it and I do use this so much and I
pack it with me when I travel because I
want to have it with me
okay guys those are my top five pallets
for 2016 I hope you enjoyed this video
these are basically just like the
pallets I go to all the time like these
are the ones that I use all the time let
me know if you have any of these down
below or what some of your favorite
pallets are so that way I can maybe look
into them I don't know I'm an eyeshadow
junkie they're my favorite part of
makeup they're just so much fun I love
them alright guys that's everything I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
