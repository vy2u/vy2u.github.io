small pallets let's get into them these
are my favorite eyeshadow palettes that
I own and these are the ones that I
actually get use out of or that I just
love the configuration or the formula
they're definitely something that sets
them apart from everything else I own
and I did try my best to pick things
that weren't limited edition but some of
these you're not gonna be able to find
them but maybe you can find the same
colors in a different way or something
like that so I'm sorry I did my best but
I wanted to be as true as possible so I
didn't just want to pick things that
were not limited-edition that were like
permanent just because they're permanent
even though they weren't my favorites so
I wanted to be a hundred percent with
y'all I'll start with the ones that are
permanent first these are in no
particular order of like what's my
favorite but I'll just do the ones that
you can actually still get now this is
one of my absolute favorite like this is
I mean if I had to pick a favorite out
of these this is probably time with one
of them in here so this is the Wet n
Wild walking on eggshells trio I love
this palette I think it's an effortless
palette there are no matte but something
about this palette I'm totally fine with
it if you love neutrals this is like the
perfect palette for you the quality on
this palette for the price this is $2.99
at Walgreens is absolutely amazing I
love this like lit shade so much I think
it looks really close to like it's like
a drugstore dupe for soon or kitten or
any of those like more champagne pinky
champagne eyeshadow that are high-end if
you want something that's like an
alternative I'm not saying its exact but
it's a very similar look that one is
it's perfect so I love this and it's
just a very simple look for cheap that
looks effortless and chic and just
beautiful this one is my NARS duo this
is in kalahari and I love this duo I
think it's so pretty I love both of
these shadows on their own and then I
also like to pair like this one on the
inside of the lid that's on the outer
part of the lid and then be done
it's a beautiful duo again no mattes but
I just there's something about these two
colors that just look so beautiful and
though they are like not super warm
toned they still make my blue eyes look
really blue and I just love them so this
is definitely one that I love from NARS
it's my only duo I own and I'm totally
satisfied I love it I love this palette
or duo more our duo the last permanent
item in half here is my naked basics
this is just exactly that it's just such
a basic palette how can it not be your
favorite it has five matte shades and
then one shimmery shade I love the fact
that this Naked 2 color is so versatile
I can use it in my crease I can use it
in my brows it's just great you can do
so much with this you could use these
like matte cream sheets to set your
under eye or highlight you could use
this this to contour or as a bronzer you
can use the black as a liner and a
shadow like there's just so much you can
do with it it's a great one to have I
like these colors I think better than
The Naked basics too
I don't have that palette but I'm
totally against satisfied with this one
that I don't even need to really think
about getting that one at least not
right now and it's great if you need
something with just some neutrals I can
basically pair this with anything any of
those palettes that I've already shown
you that don't have the mats I can pair
this with it boom done so when I go on
vacation I always bring this and then
whatever else I want to and I know I can
get such a beautiful look I love it even
that shimmery color can double as like a
highlighter for your face I mean so many
multiple uses from these powders so the
last two are the ones that are kind of
like a limited edition so again I'm
sorry but they're my favorites this one
here is a two-faced like little compact
this is the natural beauty collection
although there are three products in
here there's only two eyeshadows and
then there's a bronzer this eyeshadow
here silk teddy is just absolutely
stunning it's so beautiful
I mean look at that Sheen look at it
it's so pretty I love this as just a
really simple I look and then usually
I'll use the bronzer and my crease kind
of as like a matte color although it has
a little shimmer I'll use it in my
crease I'll use this on the lid and then
I'll use this color on my outer corner
sorry Sam's just out the door but I
absolutely love this if you can find
silk teddy and other palettes they often
remote stuff I think the silk Teddy's in
one of
permanent-like palette definitely get it
it's absolutely beautiful I'm keeping
him outside well I felt last palette
this is smash boxes Santi gold like
collaboration they came out with two
pallets when this came out or like one
two three four five quince there's five
shadows in here it looks like a snake
these are so beautiful although I'm not
saying I wear this every single day I
just love the colors in here I love the
combination of colors one the only thing
I would change is the fact that this
middle part is just a freaking matte
black that is so much matte black like
have you ever seen that much black in
your life but it's super pigmented you
know at least it's good quality I just
think these look so nice together and I
just love it I love this palette I can't
tell you why more than just like look at
it and I love it this thing is in my top
5 it's a great palette if you can find
this for a cheaper price I know they
were like on sale for 18 that for a
while if you can find this at like in
CCO or anything like that I definitely
would pick it up and enjoy it if you're
if you're into colors like this that is
everything for my top five small
palettes I hope you guys enjoyed let me
