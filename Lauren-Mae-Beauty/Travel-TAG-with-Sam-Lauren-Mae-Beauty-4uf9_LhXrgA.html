older video I'll leave a link down below

one of our favorite things to do so
honey compiled about 15 questions kind
of give me a long video you might want
to get dinner - we're just gonna answer
them hopefully you guys enjoy this I do
want to do like more videos with Sam so
if you want to see you already on the
salmon them let me know in the comments
down below so first question I'll have
them all listed down below if you guys
want to also do this tag but the first
question is going to be how many
countries have you traveled to America I
don't know if America counts and not
really I know what we live here so let's
do other countries you don't live it
France Ireland Ireland Scotland England
waste of the UK Mexico Mexico Peru oh
yeah
is that it wait Italy Italy so seven
we've been to seven countries hopefully
more to come
we've been together for a really long
time so a lot of our traveling also oh I
wanted to show them your finger his
finger is filling every window I got a
lot of them were concerned that's pretty
good now no it's not that one that's
what it looks like now it's wrapped up
but it's definitely doing better so the
tsardom picture no we're not it's
horrible you guys have already seen the
worst of it if you don't know anything
about Sam's hand I'll link to that if
you want to see pictures and if you want
a picture please
an entire video take it I'll set it to
engines music but only a few seconds so
that we don't sleep like on video I'm
getting you like I'm so sorry
okay these are gonna be kind of out of
order cuz I was just pulling them from a
bunch of different sources so let's just
go with where's one place you've never
visited but want to go and why oh geez I
don't know I know why I really want to
do Southeast Asia that's like something
I want to do for a really long time I
want to go to Angkor Wat so bad that's
in Cambodia but I want to do a tour of
like Laos Vietnam Thailand Cambodia
Myanmar or Burma Burma Myanmar that's
like something that's like on my list to
do next like that's what I really really
want to do I want to go to Australia
I know Zealand yeah we'll just just do
everything everyone everywhere Australia
New Zealand those are all so cool those
are probably are too maxi's this is the
third question that of the places you
visited which is your favorite and why I
liked Peru is really fun everyone was
super nice has a really good experience
for a trip to San Francisco for our
five-year anniversary that's one of my
favorite trips I just really enjoyed it
was one of our first trips that we just
like went on our own we drove there it
was just like a good memory I really
liked that trip even though it's not
like out of the country and I've been to
a lot of really cool places so far I
just really liked that trip I don't know
something about I just really like San
Francisco to to so that's probably yeah
one of my favorites number three what's
your favorite foreign dish oh this is
hard for me still
there's I think I know you oh yeah you
do my favorites probably gelato yeah you
loved a lot but no we're in Italy we got
a whole bunch of different gelatos I
tried everything is just like frozen
mashed up fruit and stuff and it's
pretty good for me it's hard because I
don't like seafood I don't like really
anything from the sea and a lot of
places you go it's like a big part of
their dishes so I think I'm just going
to pick Lomo saltado my favorite Helen
what it is Oh
Lomo saltado is like a Peruvian dish
it's like steak and fries and big pieces
of tomato and onion and cilantro with a
scoop of rice it's so good
all stir-fried together oh it's
delicious and it's something I ain't got
while we were in Peru like the entire
time we were in Peru but it's also
something that I would eat here in the
States and like would want to eat just
like on it every day like oh I want to
go get that so yeah if it has to be not
so foreign the dish I don't actually
pick gumbo because I love Asian cooking
and see I can't handle it gumbo is
delicious I'm sorry if the eating is our
shark going but we're gonna do we're
gonna do I work a lot right now so we're
doing it I'm sorry
number 5 I think if you could only hell
I don't really want to do that one we're
gonna cut that question if there were no
limits on ways to travel how would you
get to your destination I already know
my answer
go ahead not by boat I would if we could
do whatever I would totally like
teleport because I I would I would
teleport to like long distances so I
don't have to be on a plane for forever
if you know you had to pick something
that wasn't even though the questions
like you can do whatever I would
probably do like a road trip I really
holy crap so I'll continue this yeah I
guess by the way I would get to it
anyway I was saying that yeah I don't
know what happened
I would probably though choose to road
trip
I love road trips I think they're so fun
I like listening to music gonna like
listen to audiobooks we just have a good
time
Roadtrip we've taken two really big road
trips I forgot about teleporting that's
pretty good I did the good one I know
that's nice I would not want to do a
boat that sounds horrible it's like
scary Titanic all over him it depends if
you're already in the destination though
so if you teleport somewhere but then
you still have to get around you know
usually we just take our feet or public
we always yea we don't usually take
public transit where we live but when we
travel it like we only take public
transit I guess we'll just answer this
one which accent do you find most
appealing there's a lot of nice ones I
think so too I think the southern US is
cool I like Scottish I was gonna say
Scottish is like the hardest for me to
understand like when we were in Scotland
and I like seriously yeah I was so bad
it took me a long time to kind of adjust
like understand even though it's English
my favorite I like Australian I do New
Zealand I don't know I just like it next
discuss something embarrassing / crazy
because we don't really have a bunch of
embarrassing cause we're so cool no um
we start having bear sings right so I
thought crazy you can get more
embarrassing story I don't know you're
way too cool no I'm just kidding um
embarrassing or crazy situation or
something that happened on vacation we
got trapped we just traveled to Peru
I'll leave the video link down below
where I talk about Peru and agar trendy
with me but we just traveled to Peru
last October and while we were there
there were like what is it gone yeah
there's like riots
now you're protesting right
so they shut down the roads and so the
the only Road in and out of a town that
we needed yeah well there's a road than
a train track but the only light road
out of town was like blocked with
boulders and people throwing rocks and
stuff it's kind of a it's not like a
create that crazy of a thing is like
it's fairly common that they do it and
so yeah we were like stuck in this town
we didn't have a hotel room booked
obviously because we were was we were
expecting to be to go all the way back
to cusco but we were stuck and basically
happened halfway between machu picchu
and cusco goes it was kind of crazy
changed our plans a bit so made our
flight out and stuff so it could have
been worse we could have missed flights
or it could have been dangerous luckily
none of that happened so but it was
crazy man is it not we're expecting
Goodman on the way out we're in this
tiny little like so time for door you
know on the Civic or something and with
the weight of all three are all for
adults the driver and three of us Oliver
my mom do not pack like it was already a
low riding car and souped up going over
the bumps it would like scrape and stuff
is kind of nuts but yeah we had to get
out of the car at one point so like get
over to Matt Rock the car was so neat
down it was crazy if you could ever live
anywhere in the world for the rest of
your life where would you live in life I
like where I'm living because of you
know you're like one other place
California is the best like one has the
beach the weather's amazing you can also
go like up north though there's a lot of
things going on a lot of industries you
just have something there eight biggest
economy in the world so there's a lot
happening for sure yeah so if I had to
live like one place I would choose here
because I feel like I could do anything
I wanted to hear but it has to be a
different place I would say maybe Paris
or maybe New York it had to be a
different place I don't know I still
choose here okay I love California next
where was your last trip to and that was
per girl we went to Peru in October and
we didn't go down for well our big trip
that was our last big trip but we have
done a couple day trips to Sylvain which
is in California oh hi
which is also in California oh yeah I
guess that's the big one yeah that's one
that required a plane we've gone to
Arizona back to Arizona
once Kim but yeah our big trip was Peru
it was awesome number ten which it's not
actually ten it's just listed as 10 on
my sheet which I've just done whatever I
wanted I'm like whose line is it anyway
with points or something next question
your most memorable experience on the
trip which we kind of already I mean
like our crazy ones I guess but I
already know my answer for this one
obvious be the same when we got engaged
got engaged in France and Paris at the
castle oversee our Palace of Versailles
not really a castle that's a chateau
it's a palace that you Castle it was
great it's a good time feels good it was
awesome yeah that's my most memorable
time for sure
because it's lovely next question what's
the best item you purchased abroad I
already know all my answers to this as I
wrote all the questions so it's kind of
difficult I got a gift for my brother I
got a gift for my brother in Peru that's
a dagger and it has like it's like
carved at the handle and it has a like
llama teeth in it and it looks like a
face of this I'm gonna tea yeah it's
pretty cool a weapon my favorite are
just like the different ornaments we've
got on our trips I just I love ornaments
I love Christmas so much if you want to
see my wearing the collection video I'll
leave it link down below but I just love
ornaments so all our ornaments is so fun
to unwrap in my Christmas time and just
remember all the places we've been and I
just I just love it over two minutes
they're my favorite next question is
there any place you don't want to go you
just don't want to I don't wanna go to
Antarctica maybe don't want to go there
I don't care but like glaciers you're
gonna die I just don't
nothing works it's like no there's some
places I don't want to go right now yeah
I think that's true but like I would
love to go to Damascus but I don't want
to
to Damascus right now because it's in a
bit of turmoil to put it extremely like
yeah yeah so eventually but not right
this minute by an article never good go
space you know I would never go to say
never ever no we're not meant to be in
space
anyway we shut down settings they go to
the Royal Academy I found a new way to
fly shut it down no I just I just get
I've heard this flap you can't breathe
it's just very scary that is just so
freaky to me next question 11 or not
really but yeah why do you travel for
fun yeah but relaxation is work yeah
work usually for fun it's just so cool
to see other places and what you've
grown up with and known and to see what
other people have grown up with and it's
just cool to see all the difference like
I love architecture I love seeing really
old buildings and just like the history
behind other places and I think - in
America our history isn't nearly as long
as so many other countries so it's so
cool
to go to places that just have so much
history meeting new people
kind of observing or maybe hopefully
taking a small part in other cultures
helps to kind of expand grow your
empathy for others I think and that's
nice I think it's helpful this is the
last question wrong the last question
guys
we did it I'm proud of us number we'll
call it 14 do you have advice for anyone
who wants to travel but don't think that
they can or just advice for anyone wants
travel I mean I think we're really
blessed we all really have too many
physical limitations and things even
with I mean if you can't I mean that's
yeah I think it's more it's like you
know you feel like you can or you're
like over one you're overwhelmed or
stuck or you know what I mean like I
don't know for me personally sometimes
it feels like these people are just
going to this place like they're going
to I don't know India
well like what like you just do it you
just buck a plane flight you know
obviously have to save up I'm not saying
money isn't an issue or something but
you save up your money and you just book
it and you go and you just have a good
time I don't know perhaps some thing
I've learned like as I get older it's
like you have to make things happen you
know you have to like put importance on
it make it happen yeah I think to
prioritize is really helpful and
anything that you want to do in life you
know writing down your goals and trying
to you know breaking them down into
smaller daily goals like or weekly like
I'm going to save this much per paycheck
or whatever it is or to be able to
travel and do do that you know that's
how we have to do it yeah and also it's
like you can take so many different
types of trips even if it's to the same
place you can like if it's somewhere
where you don't have a language you can
take like a tour trip or you can go
yourself and try it or you can go with
someone else and you could do different
levels of like pricing too you know you
can do something more like backpacking
in hostels or you can do something more
like middle ground or even lavish if
that's in your price range so then we
have so much information now you know
there's probably a blog or you know tons
of information for any place you want to
go so you just spend time looking it up
which also kind of energizes you and
makes you excited yeah I'm wanting to do
it or not something too it's like making
sure like you're planned but still give
yourself enough time to actually do
things because we plan we're the people
that like early we're gonna do seven
hundred things oh no like in the next
two hours like that's our plan and that
doesn't always work out but I also think
it's good to have a plan so that you
don't like waste time either and you can
see as much of the things that you want
to obviously a great trip though is
different you might be taking a trip
before relaxing on a beach but you might
be taking a trip to really sightsee and
like hike and do all those things do I
don't know we kind of just started
talking about traveling at us well
that's everything guys I hope you
enjoyed the video I hope you enjoyed
sanding in my video I hope it wasn't too
crazy
that's everything I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in my next video oh my gosh I almost
just fell all our dinner okay bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
