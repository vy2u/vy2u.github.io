Lauren I wanted to do another episode of
my tube talk so this is just a series on
my channel where I talk about just
different things YouTube related kinda
dismay like version of a chit chat yeah
today I wanted to talk about kind of
life beyond the beauty community I was
really inspired a couple weeks ago to
talk about this and it's been a little
bit so hopefully I can still have that
same like fervor
and excitement about this topic I still
wanted to talk about it so that's why
we're still talking about it I don't
have any notes or anything so let's hope
that this makes any type of sense at all
as I you know go into discussion we'll
start off with kind of how this all
started
I'm someone who's been a part of the
beauty YouTube community for a long time
it's how I got into YouTube and it's
basically all I ever watch on YouTube
like I don't branch out I don't watch
other things like it's been Beauty a
hundred percent of the time all the time
honestly I don't know how many hours of
freaking beauty tutorials and reviews
and hulls and favorites that I've
watched over the years it's crazy
my husband can tell you he knows like
different youtubers and like terminology
that people use on YouTube because I've
watched so many videos but anyway
recently I've been kind of delving out
into other areas of YouTube and it's
been so refreshing and that's kind of
why I wanted to call this like life
beyond the beauty community because
there's so much out there besides the
freaking beauty community on YouTube and
I just highly suggest people to explore
other things obviously everyone's into
different things so gaming might not be
for you and you know you have to find
your other communities out there but um
I really just think it's so refreshing
to be kind of more well-rounded and not
just so stuck in the beauty community
because I'm telling you this is its own
beast and how I kind of got started on
this well first I'm like a couple months
ago I got started in the booktube
community and that was kind of fun and I
still enjoy watching a few people from
the booktube community but I did grow a
little bit tired of that fast I feel
like it's kind of similar to the beauty
community where it's like they're
talking about the same stuff everyone's
talking about the same stuff everyone
does the same stuff yeah so there's a
few people I really enjoy but it's it's
deaf
a little too much to watch it all the
time I'm not that into books to just
like here about the same one so I can't
connect everyone but recently I
rediscovered like other communities
because of the whole Tana drama
I was watching tannaz apology video
about all the racist stuff I'm just
gonna assume that you guys know about
you know all the drama stuff Oh from
drama channels and whatever and just if
you don't know like look it up and
anyway I was watching that Tana video
and obviously like the whole thing with
her and I don't and so that's how I got
idubbbz and I guess it's not gonna be
for everyone but I started watching his
content I first watched the content cop
that he did on Tana and then from there
I watched all the rest of his content
cops and then from there watch his
Kickstarter craps and I was watching
just like a bunch of other stuff from
him and I just think he's hilarious and
he's so non-pc like it's gonna be a
little bit like alarming and kind of
like whoa um for a second there's just
something so refreshing about it to me
though because so many people in the
beauty community I feel like they feel
like they have to be very you know PC
and can't just talk about how they feel
if they say one bad thing then people
are gonna blow it out of proportion and
I've seen it and I totally get their
feelings of not wanting to do that but I
think because of this like community
we've created um people can't talk and
speak their mind freely without getting
so much ridicule that it's just not
worth it and I think that's so sad I
just wish that the comments section and
that we could all be more playful with
each other even if we're kind of like
goofing on each other or you know
calling each other out but it could just
be more in more of a fun spirit and more
of a like loving like your sister called
you out like hey don't do that but I
still love you type of way and just not
so much just hate and malice behind it
so many of the comment sections on these
bigger youtubers and videos are just
they get so nasty so fast and I mean I
think you should have a thick skin and I
really do want people to just like
ignore the haters now I've been super
lucky and I haven't gotten like really
any hate so I know it's really hard for
me to talk on it but it's like I don't
know I just hate all the drama like I
just want it to be more fun and just
more like just chill that
out everyone even if someone's like
being a hater like why can't we just be
like dude you're such a hair or whatever
move on you know and like I just wish it
didn't have to get so personal and that
people don't take things so personal in
the comments from other youtubers that
youtubers intake the comment so personal
I just wish it could all be so much more
carefree and just a bit more fun you
know and just like just fun another
channel that I've really been enjoying
lately as h3h3 productions Ethan and ela
they're so funny and I just I love their
relationship I love watching their
videos again it's just so refreshing to
watch them people be funny they like to
call people out but it's in just so much
more of like a loving way even if it
they're being like serious they're not
just being like hateful and malicious
and they're not just doing it to be
bullies they're doing it for everyone to
have a laugh and there's also this like
serious undertone to it but again it's
more in fun and even their comments
section if you look at his or idubbbz
it's like the comments section can be
rude but they kind of embrace it and
it's kind of more of like a roast
situation than just like evil you know
what I mean and that's just something I
really wish that the beauty community
had and I I don't know I don't know I
just something like that's been on my
mind lately
and and watching those other channels
has really inspired me and my channel I
feel like a lot of the inspiration that
I've had for the new series on my
channel I'm husband because I've just
kind of like stepped outside the beauty
community and just decided to do crap I
want to do and then I think will be fun
and that I think is true to myself in my
channel and it's been working out really
well you guys seem to really like it too
and I just wish more people in the
beauty community would do that would
take a chance and not just make the same
type of videos that everyone's doing and
just was a little bit more creative with
their content and just gave a few less
shits sorry but like about what other
people are gonna think and just did what
they wanted to do and we're more
passionate and I think that would come
through and people would be more excited
to watch that content but I think that
comes from both sides like as people
watching we need to be not so rude and
not like get on people's throats so
easily because they
one thing and like give people the
benefit of the doubt let people not be
so politically correct let them make
mistakes like and not just immediately
assume that these people are like evil
and trying to take advantage of you and
if you do feel like that then just like
don't watch them but like don't have so
much hate I just don't understand why
the beauty community can't be more fun I
don't know I just think it should be
more fun right I find a one eight on one
more topic while I'm here kind of in the
same time of this I was looking on guru
gossiper now I never have really been on
it I've heard people talk about it for
like years and I finally was just like
I'm gonna check it out and do what it's
all about
sorry Sam got home so I don't know
exactly where I was leaving off
something about goober Gosper I never
really looked at the site before and me
talking about it isn't necessarily
promoting it and like one of you guys go
check it out but I mean I think we all
know it's there and you guys are all
grown women you can go look at it if you
want to or not whatever you know like
either way I'm not trying to promote it
but I also it just exists so like I'm
not gonna not talk about it thinking
that that's gonna like stop it from like
being this evil thing that it kind of is
anyway I was looking through there and
there is like if you've never been on
the site there's like a there's a bunch
of different threads it's like old
school like I don't even know how to
like use this type of forum I've never
been super savvy with like social media
I was someone like my mom didn't let me
have a facebook or like a myspace or
anything like YouTube is my social media
and I finally got an Instagram like
those are the two things a half so this
is like really old school for me but
there's like a trashy guru rave about a
guru and then there's all these
different ones obviously the traction
guru is I feel like where everyone goes
and there is some stuff on there that's
it's hateful there's a lot of hateful
stuff and I don't think that people
should be hateful and bully people I
think that's horrible so part of like I
don't like that part about the site and
I don't want you guys to get me wrong
like again I'm against bullying and I
don't think people should be hateful but
I also feel like there's like or like
people can talk about whatever they want
and I don't know like people just
shouldn't care as much like again I know
that's easier said than done and I
haven't dealt with like a huge amount of
hate so
I really can't put myself in people's
shoes even if I want to say I can but
you know it's a way for people to kind
of just like talk about things that they
don't like about gurus and if you read
it I bet you if you go read someone
who's like a bigger youtuber you will
agree with a lot of what they're saying
you know so I don't know there's a part
of me that's like I get that people want
to ride on it I would never ride on it
cuz I'm just not a comment or like that
we've discussed this like I'm a silent
creeper that's me
but it's interesting to read through the
threads and just hear people's point of
view and sometimes it's really nasty and
then sometimes I'm like oh yeah I can
kind of agree with that or I kind of see
where you're coming from or like that
was kind of savage and maybe I wouldn't
word it that way but yeah I kind of feel
that way too or whatever I don't know I
was reading through that and I feel like
all I've heard about guru Oscars like
horrible things and again I see exactly
where everyone's coming from and I don't
think that people should be like doing
malicious things like giving out
people's like a dress or you know things
like that like that's like way too far
but again I just wished that on both
sides like as beauty influencers we just
didn't take things so seriously in the
comments and kind of just just we're a
little bit more free to do whatever you
want and kind of just like have the
attitude of like who cares like I don't
carry thing like a few you know a little
bit of the book I read like how to give
you know zero after what was that book I
read the subtle art of not giving enough
you know kind of like have that
mentality and I kind of wish the same
thing for the commoners that comment
that people who comment and watch
wouldn't get so worked up about stuff
and like let things roll off their back
in the similar way I think it would just
be just so much like just a community
that could breathe in a community that
could be more fun and more creative than
we are now because I honestly think that
there's a lot of creators out there who
are scared to come up with new content
or scared to really put out how they
feel about things because they don't
want to get the hate and they just don't
want to deal with it and I understand
that and I just I just wish we were more
open like other communities are anyway I
hope that this made sense I hope I hope
you guys get where I'm coming from
lately I've seen a lot of people like
the hates getting to me videos and all
that in like
I'm not trying to be insensitive but
part of me is just like I just want them
to like I just want to be like dude just
say fu to all of them who cares what
people think
who cares that someone thinks that
you're like scamming people or who cares
that some of the things that you're
doing this or that it's like one person
out of like the entire world and I don't
know I I really don't think that they're
ruining your career they're ruining your
like life you know I wish they didn't
have to deal with it first off like I
really wish that they didn't have to
deal with it but since that's life and I
really do think that's effective just
online and exactly where online has is
going to and will always probably be at
it's like you got to just get over it
and just be like I don't really care
what you think like and not even in a
life I don't care what you think but I'm
still mad just like in an actual like
okay cool like I don't care I'm gonna do
whatever I want you know you don't know
me and to tie this all up I feel like
this kind of goes back into like all the
drama channels and I feel like the drama
channels are kind of exploding and like
more imploding maybe that's a better
word for it some of the drama channels
are kind of getting a lot of backlash
and I kind of feel it too I think that
they're fun but they were fun when they
were poking fun and and that was it and
it was just kind of calling things out
but being a little cheeky about it being
a little fun about it but when it goes
too far it's just like that's not fun
anymore you know what I mean and that's
what I I want it to be I want it to be
this like balance of like I'm gonna call
things out but we don't hate you like
you know and I think two people need to
stop just like hating these gurus that
you don't even know like do i watch man
hammy way sometimes like sometimes his
videos intrigue me or I watch them just
to like see what they are cuz it's an
outrageous title but do I hate him like
no I don't hate him um do I agree with
everything he does no not necessarily
but do I know him
no so I I don't hate him I don't know
him like I don't know him I don't know
Geoffrey
I don't know Kat Von D I don't know any
of these people all I know is what is
put online and I think that we should
all remember that what you see online is
only a portion of these people and that
everyone's a human and yeah people make
mistakes and they might be horrible
people or they might not be in
everything's being twisted or it might
be just something in the middle it might
not be you know extreme either way and
she's just like treat people like humans
and just have more fun in life and not
care so much not get so worked up at the
end of the day it's a makeup and how you
want to apply it and where you want to
apply it to and my god it should just be
fun and you should have more fun and be
more creative and not be afraid to do
that as creators and also I feel like we
should not be scared to like comment
either how we actually feel um
especially if it's and it should just
come from more of a place of like love
and in fun I feel like I've repeated the
word fun like 700 times if you want to
check out the channel as I mentioned
I'll even link down below but just like
watch their videos and check out their
comments and it just it just is more
it's just more of like how I would want
my channel to be then what I feel like
some of these bigger youtubers and the
beauty communities comment section look
like like I'd almost rather have people
like goofing on me in a fun loving way
then have people like praising me for
like slaying al eyeliner and thinking
I'm perfect because I think that's
something that maybe helps like create
this weird thing like you're perfect
you're perfect you're so good at this
and then when they aren't perfect one
time it's like everything turns against
them and it turns into crazy town and
it's like instead like no I'm just a
human thanks my eyeliner did look good
that day cool thank you like yeah your
eyeliner can also look that awesome like
we're just people okay this is super
long and kind of rambling and totally in
a million topics so if there's anything
you want me to touch more on let me know
down below
hopefully this made sense like I said I
just was talking off the top of my head
let me know you guys think about any of
these topics down below and I think
that's everything I think I'm gonna end
it there
also let me know if you have any other
topics for tube talk down below I'd love
to talk about what you guys want to talk
about but I also have just you know this
is my place to kind of just rant about
what I want to so that's everything guys
thanks so much for watching I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
