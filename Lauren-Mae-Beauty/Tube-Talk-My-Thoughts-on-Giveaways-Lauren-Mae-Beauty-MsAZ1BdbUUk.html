Lauren thank you so much for watching
we're doing another to talk today I was
going to do a whole another topic but I
was scrolling through my feed and I just
got all this kind of like rant I was
talking to Sam about it and I'm not
going to go into the full rant here but
we're going to talk about giveaways and
why I don't do them before we get into
that though I'm going to read my play
list for my tube top series down below
if you like this video you can check out
the other topics I've covered I think
it's just nice to be able to have a
really open dialogue with you guys just
be myself 100%
this isn't like scripted or SuperDuper
thought-out I'm just kind of talking off
the cuff and you guys seem to like it
too so anyway giveaways why I don't do
them I have never been into giveaways
and I'm not trying to start drama with
anyone who does giveaways I don't think
that giveaways are inherently bad and I
don't think they're always bad but I
think that there are some things about
giveaways that people don't really talk
about and when I see giveaways
especially from a lot of bigger
youtubers and whatnot Oh kind of like
medium channels
it isn't always as just give Becky as it
seems so I have done one giveaway on my
channel in the past I did it when I hit
I think it was like a thousand
subscribers or five hundred subscribers
it was when I channel was super duper
small and I wanted to give away some of
my nail polishes that I had to cluttered
and I thought it'd be a good way to kind
of give back to you guys I was really
happy obviously about hitting that
number it was like so amazing I mean
it's awesome to have any amount of
subscribers so my only two rules were
where you had to be subscribed to me and
you had to comment down below and so
what that video I did pick on someone to
win it was open internationally and she
happened to live really really far away
like I can't even remember the country
so when I was trying to figure it out I
could not shit the nail polish there for
whatever reason because of whatever is
in nail polish and everything it was
either I couldn't do it or was going to
cost me like an insane amount of money
I'm talking like well over $250 so I was
like no that's not happening so instead
I sent her some other like high-end
makeup that I had to cluttered and was
gonna potentially send off to glambot
but instead just sanitized and sent off
to her and she was super happy she was
like oh yeah that's no problem whatever
anyway one of the experiences that I had
while the giveaway was open is that
someone emailed me or private message me
on youtube and was like hey I really
love to win the nail polishes and I can
get you a ton of subscribers if you let
me win
and I didn't respond back at all to that
but when I woke up the next day I had
jumped up a ton of subscribers
especially in comparison to how many
subscribers I had at the time it was
like almost doubling I was like insane I
just like got weirded out and creeped
out by that I think people get weird
when you like have free products and
they can win and all that so that was
like not the best experience room
personally I have not done a giveaway
since then and I'm not saying I'll never
do a giveaway in the future but some of
the reasons I don't like giveaways are
ones that experience - I personally have
never been into giveaways I never enter
them it's just not something that I care
about and I don't mean that in the mean
way again if you offer giveaways for
your subscribers but I feel like I have
to do too many things especially when it
comes to these big giveaways or
Instagram giveaways or all these other
things I have to do so many things to
potentially win something and that's
when it feels like this isn't for me
this is for you
and that basically is what my hate boils
down to and why I don't like giveaways
is because they aren't for really you
guys like giveaways are used as a way to
generate subscribers generate views
generate growth on their channel and
then one person potentially win this
gift you know um or three maybe it's a
crazy one and they have three winners
but that's what it is that's why they
want you to subscribe over here and if
you want another enter you subscribe to
their Instagram and oh if you want a
third entry go to their Twitter and
comment something down below it's like
they want their engagement up they want
their interactions up they want to gain
subscribers and I
that just doesn't sit right with me you
guys know I'm a really honest person is
something that I really pride myself on
is my subscribers and that I grew my
channel from nothing I didn't tell my
family even if they held it and have
them all subscribe to me at the
beginning like I don't really promote my
channel in that way I try to just put
out really good content I do my best to
make it something that people would like
to watch but also just things that I
would like and that's it if you want to
subscribe to me awesome please subscribe
to me I would love it obviously I'd love
to have you as love for you to enjoy my
content but if you don't like me if you
don't like my content it's okay
that's totally fine you don't have to
subscribe to me I'm someone who hates
sub4sub if you want to see my whole tube
top on that I will leave it linked down
below it's just like I'm not I'm not
about that don't promote yourself on my
channel I'm not going on your channel
and promoting myself like I'm just not
down with that I think that your content
should stand for itself and I think that
YouTube is something that you know it
takes a lot of hard work it's super
saturated at the moment I wish I'd gone
into YouTube when it was brand new and
there weren't as many creators and you
could put out less quality stuff and
people would still watch it because
there just isn't as much of it but
that's not what we live in now and if
you want to make it on YouTube you need
to put the hard work in and it sucks at
first it totally does I was talking to
say I'm just the other night about how I
remember when I had 19 subscribers and I
had just started school I was in my
first class of school and I was so
incredibly excited I couldn't believe it
and all that and now I'm kind of used to
the numbers that I get like you eyes and
subscriber wise and all that so it's
sometimes you have to take yourself back
to being excited about 19 subscribers
and only getting X amount of views on a
video and all of that to really remember
what it's like to be at that place but I
don't regret anything I've done I've
worked really hard on my channel you
look back I haven't deleted one video
I've ever posed
and I have a lot of videos on this
channel let me tell you I've put on a
lot of work guys I try to upload as
often as I possibly can because I just
like it I like posting to uShip I have a
lot of ideas I have a lot of things I
want to say and so I just enjoy that I
like daily uploading especially when I
can
so anyway seven four seven all of that
it just what it does is it generates
false numbers so it makes your
subscribers go up but your review to
subscriber is you know usually doesn't
and it looks really horrible you might
have let's say twelve thousand
subscribers but you're only getting 500
views on a video that's not necessarily
normal now everyone's channel is
different everyone's growth is different
I've talked about this before to where
you have some content that is really
popular and people are going to watch it
immediately
and then you have some content that's
more evergreen content so reviewed on a
specific product especially if it's not
limited edition those pieces of content
can potentially be evergreen material
meaning that in a year and a half people
can still be searching about that
product and find your review and watch
it so it's not necessarily going to get
a ton of views up front but over time it
can collect views and continue to be
watched where you're doing something
that's really relevant to right here
right now it probably won't get to use
later on I'm trying to think about where
I'm going with what I'm saying here
so anyway I'm not trying to say that if
you get not that many views and you have
a lot of subscribers that you're doing
something wrong because some people
happen to get a really big hit or get a
lot of views on one video and get quite
a few subscribers from that but those
subscribers aren't belittle followers
they just saw that one video and really
liked it so then they're not necessarily
watching all of the content that you put
out because they don't have it they give
a connection with you as they what if it
kind of grew more organically then super
more viral anyway so to me giveaways
kind of are similar thing they kind of
pad your numbers because a lot of the
times the number one thing that you have
to do is you have to be subscribed to
someone so there are a lot of people who
search out giveaways just to subscribe
to you to be a part of that giveaway and
they want to win potentially a lot of
cool stuff and all of that so they'll
subscribe to you so your subscriber
number goes
and then hopefully they forget to
unsubscribe to you or because of that
they'll start watching you or whatever
and you keep going from there I know
there are a lot of people who
unsubscribe immediately after giveaways
which so that doesn't even really make
sense to me I just don't like the whole
idea of it being a fake way to increase
your subscriber count again this is not
the goal of everyone who's ever going to
giveaway in the entire YouTube world
there are ton of creators who are
actually celebrating a milestone in
their subscriber numbers or they
genuinely want to give back to their
subscribers for watching them to thank
them or what not but there are a lot of
bigger channels to use these as
opportunities to just grab for
subscribers grabs for views and it's
just kind of frustrating to me I just I
hated I don't like to be even remotely
near it I think the reason I bring this
up well one I saw something in my feet
but um what's back-to-school there are
so maybe back-to-school giveaways that
just are like when you see the thumbnail
they just look chaotic attack it's just
like so many products it looks like so
kid-friendly
they're trying to get these kids to get
round up and excited to potentially win
this stuff and subscribe to theirs to
comment down below to then go to their
other social media channels and
subscribe there so that they can
potentially win this stuff when you know
they'll be how many entries hundreds of
thousands of entries especially if it's
like a bigger YouTube or even if they're
not big but that video itself not goes
viral but it gets searched out a lot and
gets a lot of views there still can be
tons like thousands of you know entries
on to this giveaway and only one or two
or three people are going to win all
this stuff you know it just doesn't sit
right with me it's just not my style I
don't really enjoy watching it and I see
some people who consistently do
giveaways over and over and over and it
just seems like when it becomes like
over and over and it's like I don't know
man or not about it like please I know
what you're doing like we all know what
you're doing it's so transparent it's
not just about wanting to give back the
one way I really do enjoy giveaways are
when they aren't super publicized so
maybe they're at the end of a video
that's not in the title it's not in this
you know tags it's just for people who
actually watch the content and wait
until the end to see it so I like
giveaways like that I feel like those
are the most genuine giveaways or I've
heard of someone doing something where
they'll just randomly pick subscribers
to comment on their videos a lot and
just give them stuff I think that's kind
of cool too but when it when you're
using a giveaway to like act like you're
stinking everyone but really the most of
the game is you getting the game I just
feel like that is so just weird and icky
feeling to me and I think this also goes
into Instagram
we all have been tagged on the Instagram
giveaways and I'm not saying if you've
tagged me because I have the text
sometimes I'm not trying to be rude or
mean I'm not saying you shouldn't tag me
I'm just saying they're just not my
style and again you see it with the
Instagram and how it's you guys it's
just enough they can get more
subscribers so they can get more
followers and then they can kind of blow
up or be trending or whatever it is it's
not for you and I think that's the
biggest thing if it was like I think I
can do a giveaway so that I can kind of
get my name out there I kind of want to
like get a few more followers and I'll
talk about when you guys will win
something that will be really cool so
this is what you need to do I feel like
I could respect that so much more but
that's not what it's about it's like so
so fake you know if I still in being
like I don't know I don't even know if
that example was going to be good so I'm
just not fit yeah I don't know I think
there's a lot to say about giveaways I
just can't stand when it's just multiple
times there are a lot of channels that
I've seen that are kind of in the mid
range you know like maybe between like
50,000 subscribers and like 150 or 200
thousand and they just consistently do
giveaways it's like oh I hate it I hate
it I mean I'm happy for the people the
one person who won those giveaways like
that's awesome I'm happy for them but
for everyone else you got suckered into
subscribing or giving them their
information or
for an email for this or whatever it is
that you can potentially be one of the
potential people to win um I don't know
I just don't like it let me know what
you guys think about giveaways I know I
have kind of a negative perspective on
it and I know that a lot of people
really do like them they're just not my
style particularly you guys know I'm
kind of a weirdo though I don't do
comments very well and I do have a lot
of new subscribers so hi thanks guys I
hope you enjoy my channel I definitely
suggest you checking out other like tube
top videos and just different things
just to get to know a little bit more
about me kind of like backlog
information but with my comments I'm
just really bad have a lot of anxiety
around responding to comments it's not
just with social media it's in my
everyday life calling people back
texting people back emailing people back
I'm pretty good when it comes to like
it's business emails because I'm not
going to like to miss work or do things
like that and I don't want to like look
horrible but I have a ton of anxiety
around it so if you're wondering why I
haven't commented back it's because I'm
like working on that issue I'm doing my
best
sometimes I just have the nerve and just
do it other times it just become so
overwhelming and then I just get stuck
in this like you know thought cycle of
like I should do it I feel bad but I
haven't so long so I mean what am I
going to do and it's horrible
anyway I don't know why I'm getting on
that topic problems because I'm worried
about it cuz they have so many comments
on my most recent videos so I'm just
like oh no I feel horrible and I feel
like I have to talk about everything
because I'm super honest and I can't not
okay that's enough of this video and let
me know what you guys think about
giveaways down below what your
experiences with giveaways are I will
say I think that in the smaller
communities like the project panning
communities and things like that there
are bigger potential for you to win
because the people giving things away
don't have maybe a large urban audience
you have a better chance of winning
which i think is nice and I do think
that those are more genuine you know
they're buying it with their own money
they're not using PR products that they
got sent for for free to give back to
you I mean if they're putting all of
this stuff in there and they didn't
really pay for it how much of that is a
real
thank you I mean it didn't cost them
anything and again they're just gaining
more than you guys are getting anyway I
near a best everything else I'll stop
talking in circles and talking about you
boys but I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
will see in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
