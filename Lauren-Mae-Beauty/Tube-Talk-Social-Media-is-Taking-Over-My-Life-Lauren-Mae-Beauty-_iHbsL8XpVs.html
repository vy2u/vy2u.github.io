Lauren this is going to be another
episode of tube talk I mentioned in the
last tube talk I did which I'll leave
link down below about the Z palettes I
mentioned that I wanted to talk about
just how I felt about social media and
how it's like taking over my life and
just kind of express some thoughts on
that tell you some of my anxieties cuz I
have a lot of anxiety about social media
I feel like and this is just a place
where we can talk on different things I
don't want anyone to attack anyone for
their opinion I do want it to be more of
like a safe zone it's okay to have
different opinions we can talk about it
and it doesn't have to be rude or mean
in the comments so I just want to say
thank you to everyone who watched my
last video and left a nice comment I
really do appreciate it and it was just
nice to see everyone on all different
levels on how they felt about that topic
where we could all just like to talk
about it and it didn't have to be just
like hateful and evil I've really
enjoyed that so thank you so much for
keeping that like a great space and so
many of you guys were saying that you're
happy that we can do that let's get on
to this topic I guess a little bit of
background on me I don't know about
social media my mom never let me have in
my space I did have one I like snuck one
a little bit you know but I really I
really was never into my space because I
wasn't allowed and I'm the type of
person I have a lot of anxiety if you
guys didn't know and so I'm the type of
person like I don't jaywalk because it's
like illegal you know I don't sneak into
movies I snuck into one movie once and
we bought the tickets for it
it was just rated R and I wasn't old
enough it was Sweeney Todd like yeah I'm
a theater kid can you tell I've never
been the type of person even from a
young kid that just posts whatever they
want to online you know makes a bunch of
friendships online it's just you know
I'm eating lunch today and I'm eating
this or all this really irked me I've
never really done that in text form so I
do have a Facebook but I really don't
post on it I mostly use it to creep on
people and to stay in contact with
friends who do post so you know I feel
like I know what's going on with friends
from high school because they post on
there constantly so I feel like I'm
still involved in their life which I
really enjoy but personally I do not
post on my facebook except for Instagram
posts I will let go to my Facebook if
that makes sense so my only two forms of
social media that I do are YouTube and
Instagram and Instagram I started a
little over a year ago now I didn't have
an Instagram for the longest time which
is so weird now because I like Instagram
so much YouTube is kind of like the big
one for me and a little of my history
with YouTube I was watching YouTube a
long long time before I started my
channel it's gonna be I it's just over
two years that I've been posting videos
but before that at least three years I
was watching videos all the time
consuming a ton of content but I was
never someone who commented and if
you've been with me a long time you
already know this story you already kind
of know how I feel about commenting but
I have so much anxiety about it I feel
like with every new subscriber I want to
explain to them because I do read other
people's comments and I know that for a
lot of people you know responding to
comments and all that is a big deal
anyway I was always a silent creeper I
was someone who never like before I had
a channel I entered one giveaway one
time and that was really weird for me
because I'm not someone who enters
giveaways yeah I'm just I'm not someone
who comments that way that's not how I
like to use my social media it's just a
little overwhelming for me that way so
for me even though I post a lot on
YouTube I like I choose that form of
social media because I enjoy making
videos I enjoy consuming videos and
watching people's messages through a
video format and I enjoy giving people
my message through a video format and
then for Instagram it's very similar but
instead of it being like a movie it's a
picture so I enjoy maybe telling people
something about my day but in the form
of a picture or attached to a picture I
just I just don't like to just have a
text I just don't feel like I'm
important enough that anyone would give
a of what I'm doing for the day or
what I'm caring about does that make
sense like I I really don't see myself
having a Twitter because it's like I
don't have anything to tweet about
there's nothing that I just want to like
you know send off my chestnut fast I
like doing something more like this
where I'm you know sitting down talking
to you in a video format so anyway
everyone has their different way of how
they liked
social on social media some people like
it all some people prefer Twitter some
people prefer Facebook you know everyone
has their own way but I wanted to give
you that little bit of a background I
guess on me just so you guys can
understand where I'm coming from because
honestly I feel like with becoming a
creator and posting videos and you guys
know I post a lot I tried to get out
content for you guys very often I just
enjoy it I like putting out videos I
like being creative and when I have a
lot of video ideas I want to get them
out for you guys as fast as I possibly
can and you guys enjoy it too but that
takes up a lot of time it takes a lot of
time and on top of Instagram and then
just being living a normal life having
also jobs and all of that it can take up
so much of your time and then on top of
that there's the comments like I said
I've talked about this before because
again I just I feel so bad when someone
takes the time out of their day to write
a comment to me and it's just so hard
for me to write back I feel like so much
of my time has already spent on YouTube
to give you an idea you know you're
constantly in your mind and at your
house and when you're not doing
technical YouTube stuff you're thinking
about videos you're buying products for
videos you're coming up with ideas
you're you know still thinking about
YouTube then there comes the time where
you have to get ready so you have to
make yourself up or put set up your
lights and set up your camera make sure
all your stuffs charged make sure that
your you know footages onto the computer
so that you can format your card or
whatever it is then you film and I like
to film a lot of videos at once so that
I can like spend a day get that done and
then I can edit throughout the week and
still have videos up every day but
filming can take anywhere from like I
don't even know if I'm only filming one
video like sitting down filming that
usually is only like 30 minutes but it
can go all the way up to like two hours
of me just sitting in front of the
camera talking then I have to take my
footage and put it on my computer and
that takes forever it takes so much time
I know a lot of you guys are creators
watch my channel too so I know you guys
know what this is like I have an old-ass
computer okay I have a Mac but it is old
and so if I fill up a 32 gig card
we'll take it'll say like an hour and a
half word to just take all that footage
and put it on the computer then I have
to edit that footage render that footage
export that footage and that's just for
one video for one day and I try to have
a video up every single day so it's a
lot and I'm not complaining I don't want
guys to think that like I don't like
doing it I do I love doing it it's just
the comment section is the hard part for
me it's just so much I'm already doing
so much and I'm trying to also post and
stay consistent on my Instagram so I
just want you guys to know and I want to
get this off my chest that just because
I don't respond to you does not mean
that I don't read it I read every single
comment and I also allow every single
comment on my channel so any coming
again even if it's spam unless it's spam
and it has like a URL sometimes I won't
let that through just because I don't
know if it's like a a link that will
like give someone a disease on their
computer but other than that I do let
every comment through I read every
single comment I appreciate every
comment and I hope you guys noticed that
like when I'm filming I will mention
comments and be like oh someone come to
this Oh someone commented that and
that's kind of my favorite way to
respond to comments because again I'm
putting out a video format and that just
is easy that's the easiest for me that's
what I enjoy to do so I just want to put
that out there that I read everyone's
stuff and I would love to hear from you
guys what you think is the best way I
know that they just started doing like
where you can heart people's comments so
would you guys like me to heart the
comments even if I don't respond to
everything I talked about this with Sam
all the time because again I just I get
a lot of comments which I love and I
asked for like I wanted on your guys's
opinions it's just even if they're like
great love the look or something I want
to like respond back and there's just so
much I just don't have the time and
honestly I just want to have time for
other things in my life besides YouTube
because with all those other things I
already mentioned on top of like
responding to comments and then on top
of that potentially responding to
collabs and different things it's just a
lot so I just want anyone who's ever
come in contact with me
or tried to leave me a comment I really
do
try to get back to people but it's just
a lot of time and I just don't know if I
want to spend my time that way when I'm
already putting so much in my channel so
I hope that doesn't offend anyone who
loves commenting just please understand
that everyone has how they want to like
interact with social media differently
and the comment section is really hard
for me on top of that I've talked about
this before even if I have the time I
don't know what it is about comments
they just give me so much anxiety it's
like in my head I build them up to be
this way bigger thing whereas if I just
sat down and tried to knock some out you
know I can I can get through a quite a
few of them obviously genuine responses
left like me reading and thinking and
writing back it's just in my head it
builds up to this like huge thing and
gives me a ton of anxiety I'm like that
with everyone in my life too so don't
take it personally because even my mom
and other family members with text
messaging I'm really bad about texting
back I'm really bad about calling back I
am one of those people and I hate it
because I that just sucks but it really
isn't out of like oh I don't like it I
don't know what it is it just I have so
much anxiety around calling people back
it just becomes this bigger task in my
head so I just wanted to get that off my
chest I've talked about it at the
beginning of the year I think and I feel
like I kind of I like soothe myself and
Sam's like Lauren you don't know anyone
anything like don't worry about it you
don't need to respond to everyone like
respond to people who have genuine
questions and you know leave it at that
or like you don't you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do and that
Sue's me for a little bit but I always
get back in my head and have exactly
about it so I you know I'm making an
official to talk about it since I
started this series I feel like a lot of
my feelings on this and how those creeps
back it's because I'll see people talk
about like oh you know I hate that this
person doesn't respond back to people or
whatever and I understand that but I
also see it from my side and it's it's
not coming out of just like laziness or
like neglect for my channel or my you
know
viewers so if you're someone who really
really like needs people to respond back
I might not be the right channel for you
I hope that you know that I like love
reading your guys's comments and I try
to incorporate them into my channel and
take the feedback I just might not
actually like write a physical response
back to you and that goes for like all
my social media so that includes
Instagram - my try to be good but let me
know if you think that like just a heart
is good enough like at least you know
like I've read it because I did get a
comment about that like do you read the
comments and I was like yeah I read the
comments she's like well you should like
him you should heart them because that's
what people do and I'm like okay but
then I feel bad I feel like if I heart
it you guys like no I read it right then
so why didn't you respond to me that's
how I look at it anyway
let me know what you guys think down
below and then just kind of a general
question how do you guys feel about
social media like if you're creator how
do you balance everything especially if
you have like a family like right now
it's just me and Sam and my job is so
sporadic like sometimes I'm working
sometimes I have a lot of time off so I
am lucky enough that I do have a lot of
time and I still feel overwhelmed so I
don't know how people with families and
full-time jobs do YouTube and do
Instagram and you know have all these
like extra outside relationships that
they keep with people that they've found
through social media it's a lot so
everyone has their strengths and
weaknesses for sure though some some
people that's like what they love to do
so that would make sense but I really
would love to know how you balance that
how you justify you know spending your
time online versus spending time in real
life me and Dan we're talking about it
and was saying like only weirdos so you
know like do what you're doing I'm like
I agree I would agree I think that there
is something weird about people who
spend so much time being alone and
talking to the camera don't get offended
I I'm doing it myself I mean you know
I'm doing it myself but I do think
there's something like that and I think
you know the farther you go with it the
more caught up you can be and I really
do want to live life in the moment and
actually live life that's why it's so
hard for me to vlog I don't know how
people vlog and do actually good vlogs
because you basically have to be doing
and living your life for the camera and
not actually just like living it and
like instead of just eating your burrito
and enjoying it you are filming yourself
enjoying eating your burrito and making
and getting it from separate angles and
all this weird stuff so yeah those are
my thoughts right now on social media
and I do like another one but it can
just turn into a lot and I feel like a
lot of people who don't aren't creators
and don't do the other aspect all they
see is this video that you put out and
that you don't respond to comments and
instead it's like oh no oh no I spent so
much time that for me and how I like to
interact a social media it's just hard
on top of my anxiety so okay I'm gonna
stop because I feel like I'm just gonna
start repeating myself at this point I'd
love to hear your comments down below my
next tube talk is gonna be all about
different apps and things I use to help
my channel so it'll be great for anyone
who is a creator or wanting to get
started on YouTube I know that I liked
watching those though before I had a
channel so who knows even if you don't
have a channel you might actually enjoy
that one too
but that is everything thanks so much
for listening guys I really appreciate
you and I will see you in my next video
