lauren i wanted to sit down with you
today and kind of stir a new series
that's just about youtube it's about
talking about how i feel it's gonna be
called tube talk i don't know I kinda
like that name it reminds me of a tube
sock has nothing to do with a tube sock
but I don't know anyway that's just
where my brain goes when I think of it
but I think it's a good name
nonetheless I wanted to talk about
sponsorships affiliate links and just in
general like PR and that type of stuff
this isn't to bash anyone it's just to
talk to you guys about how I feel about
them this is super candid I don't have
notes or anything I'm just telling you
how I feel I would love to know what you
guys think down below and that's kind of
it I'm not trying to offend anyone so
please don't get offended I feel like I
have a unique perspective I not only am
someone who has watched a lot of YouTube
videos I've been on YouTube for a long
time but I also create content and
although I'm not like a huge channel I
still have been approached by people to
get PR have affiliate links and all that
type of stuff so I feel like I have a
good kind of like mix of both sides here
it's been talked about so much
especially recently with like the rise
of drama channels I've really loved
watching John cook Ian and I also loved
just here for the tea I think that's her
name I'll have their channels link down
below so you can check them out I just
feel like it's more relevant than ever
and I feel like since the Beauty
influencer sphere has opened up so much
and there's been a little bit more
transparency to some aspects of it
people are gonna called out for some
things and I think that's a good thing
so let's first talk about PR well
actually let's just talk in general I
feel like PR affiliate links and
sponsorships in theory you know should
work fine and I think that the core
value that needs to be there is trust in
truth and honesty I feel like the
youtubers should be truthful and
transparent and should be genuine to you
guys as their audience and as you know
someone recommending products and
recommending people to spend their
hard-earned money you should be able to
trust that youtuber but they're not just
selling you stuff so that they can make
some money or selling you stuff because
they signed a contract with a brand
that whatever they're talking about is a
genuine feeling that they have and that
it's not just because they're being
sponsored or paid or given product or
taken on a trip or whatever the case may
be I think if there is a core of truth
honesty and trust that sponsorships and
affiliate links and PR can all work and
be totally fine
it's the fact that there are a lot of
people who have broken that trust and so
it's hard for people and channels that
are honest and upfront and all these
things they still get a lot of crap
because these bigger youtubers have kind
of ruined it and that kind of sucks I
really think that sucks coming from
someone who makes videos I will say
right now getting PR and affiliate links
and sponsorships that is such an amazing
thing
I mean imagine you're making videos in
your house and eventually at some point
obviously you have to be quite large but
Mabley wants to work with you or sponsor
a video of yours or smashbox i mean a
brand that you've spent your hard-earned
money on that you've been so excited
about new releases for they finally know
who you are and they want to do a video
and collaboration with you that's
absolutely amazing I mean that is such a
cool thing and I don't think that the
hard work that they've put in to that
point should be just totally forgotten
and I don't think that a sponsorship
like that I mean who would turn that
down no one would want to turn them down
that's absolutely amazing and kind of
like a situation you can only dream up
like if I ever got that big and if that
ever happened that'd be amazing and so I
think it's great that so many youtubers
and influencers are being contacted by
these huge brands because they've worked
really hard and I think it's great I
think it's awesome that influencers can
get paid to continue to just make
content and I mean we all want to see
content from them and I for one can tell
you I don't want to watch ads who
watches yeah - doesn't skip the ads
please and that's how they would get
paid like if you actually watch the ads
or interact with the ads but I don't
want to do that and I don't pay for
YouTube read so I don't want to support
them on patreon so I'm kind of like yeah
you guys fit the bill and I can watch
awesome content that's really awesome
I feel like this changes though for me
when youtubers get larger and they start
posting as much content because they are
so busy with outside gigs it can be
frustrating to me as a viewer when one
of their four videos they put out a
month is sponsored or two of their
videos are sponsored out of the floor
it's just kind of like I want to see you
I subscribe to you originally and I want
to see your content I definitely see
that can be irritating tell me if you're
the same but sometimes I'll see a video
and I will immediately be like its
sponsored and I'll go through the
description box and I'll be like yo I
was right and that can be definitely
frustrating and it makes you lose trust
in the youtuber that you're watching I
mean it's hard to watch a favorites
video when someone's talking about
products that you saw in a sponsored
video or if you've just seen a lot of
sponsored content from them and then
they put out a favorites video it's hard
to separate those from each other and I
feel like it definitely can make you
question their recommendations why
they're recommending new things and it
just changes your relationship with the
youtuber I find now that's like me
talking specifically about sponsored
videos I have one more thing I want to
talk about before I move on I kind of
want to know your guys's thoughts on
sponsored videos that are kind of like
hidden or covered up sponsored videos so
instead of it being like sponsored let
me talk to you about the new Dyson air
dryer something I know a lot of people
are doing that one um instead of doing
that they'll be like my hair care
routine or my morning routine and then
they'll talk about the product in one of
those videos now personally I go both
ways I think it's kind of sneaky because
those are sometimes the videos that I'm
like up yep sponsored and immediately
I'm like what the heck you know but I
also can see it coming from a point
where it's like well my viewers aren't
gonna want to watch a video about me
blow-drying my hair only so let me try
to find a creative way to you know take
this sponsorship and make some money and
talk about a product that I think is
good but also find a way to make it more
entertaining for them to get other
content and information out of that
video so I can see both sides of it I
don't know I just want to know what your
guys's thoughts are because I go both
ways like sometimes I'm like annoyed
that it's like a hidden you know video
but then some
I totally understand it and when I'm
coming up with videos and I want to talk
about products maybe that were sent to
me or whatever I want to put it into a
video that's going to be one viewed not
just for them just for me like I'm gonna
put my time into it and hopefully
something that you guys will actually
enjoy instead of just being like oh
whatever so I don't know just let me
know what you think about that down
below I just wonder ultimately though I
think sponsorships are fine as long as
they're just done right I think that you
definitely again this goes back to the
truth and honesty like if you honestly
like the product and it's honestly good
and you honestly and truthfully can
recommend it I don't think there's
anything wrong with getting paid to do
so as long as you aren't only doing
sponsored content and you're not lying
to your subscribers I think it's like a
win-win PR is a very similar thing to me
PR is not a big deal if you're being
sent out as long as you're truthful
about how you feel about these products
it should just be helping you in your
channel I think it's great that people
who have larger channels get sent stuff
for free because I want to know about
products and if I trust you you can tell
me if it's good or bad or swatch it for
me first so I can know what it looks
like and decide how I want to spend my
money I just feel like it gets abused I
feel like people sometimes maybe water
down a review because they want to
continue getting PR from companies
that's just kind of breaking that bond I
think that you should have with your
subscribers every youtuber has started
from the bottom and has had zero
subscribers and had to work their way up
and through the platform of YouTube
which is very personal I mean I'm
sitting on my couch in my living room
right now you've gained your subscribers
slowly you've connected with them it
feels more personal like you're just
talking to your friend about the
products that you like and I just hate
when I see that switch and it go from
hey I'm just sitting in my living room
to highly produced video that is only
featuring things that are sent to them I
just don't trust anymore I hate saying
that I wish it could just stay the same
we liked you from the beginning and I
get that people change and grow as
humans we do and we should but it's
different than when it's changing from
getting so much PR and money and all of
that I think you guys know what I'm
talking about here anyway I don't think
PR is a big deal like I definitely think
there's easily a way for you to be a
hundred percent honest
yeah they sent it to me I didn't like it
or just not share with it like you don't
have to talk about it the thing I
probably have the biggest issue with is
affiliate codes now I have been reached
out to by a couple different companies
and asked to you know like they'll send
me products and then oh I can get an
affiliate code and every time I've just
refused the affiliate code and instead
would rather have like a discount for
you guys to save money if there's
another channel doing and they do it
differently I'm not trying to bash them
I think the reason I personally just
don't feel right about affiliate codes
is the fact that people get sent the
product for free so they're not spending
their money on it why would you not
promote this product when you're making
either 10% commission 20% Commission
however much money per sale I just think
that if I'm not gonna spend my own money
on it why would I
how could I how and why could I ask you
to do the same thing there's a
difference between truly loving a
product but when you're affiliated and
I'll just you know bring up the biggest
branch here morphine when you're
affiliated with morphe I mean they come
out with new products all the time
there's no way that they absolutely love
all the products coming out but it
benefits you to constantly talk about
them and only talk about them talk about
the brushes talk about their new
palettes talk about their new liquid
lipsticks that come out I just feel like
because money is specifically driven
from you talking and pushing their
product constantly in every video or
using it in this picture or whatever I
feel like it's the easiest to blur the
line between right and wrong and truth
and kind of lies and just kind of gets
you into a gray area of ethics and I
personally just don't like that I feel
like it's human nature like why would
you not want to sell something and make
money especially if the products like
okay and on my channel personally I
don't want to just talk and sell you
guys stuff that's okay I want to talk
about stuff that's the best and what's
not the best and just give you a 100
percent honest feedback so let's say
you're doing a review for morphe or you
got new products and you're just talking
about first impressions like I doubt
anyone is going to be like there okay
there
that great but there okay I feel like
it's easy to just talk about how yeah
these are really good I think they're
really good and sell them instead of you
know they're not bad but they're just
like okay you know I don't know
hopefully that makes sense I just think
that affiliate coats can just get into a
gray area really really fast I think
that you can easily talk about how
something's really awesome and so good
and sell it on your channel have all
your subscribers go buy it and then you
never really use that product like you
swatched it you know and yeah it's
watched nice but you never actually used
it it's not a favorite of yours but you
kind of talked about it like it was and
so everyone went and bought it and I
think that's kind of messed up I don't
know I think that's something weird
about it
especially because I doubt a lot of
these influencers would go out and
purchase all these products if they
weren't sent to them if that makes sense
I think that there definitely should be
a desire of these people to like wanna
buy these products in the first place if
they're going to have an affiliate link
like that I don't know that's just how I
feel about that I'm not saying it can't
be done and I'm not saying that people
can't be honest I just definitely think
with human nature it's just naturally
why wouldn't you want to sell more and
make money like why wouldn't you
especially the deeper you get into it
and I just personally don't want to
really fall into that or get caught up
in that and I just again can't imagine
asking you guys are telling you guys you
should buy a product that was sent to me
for free especially if it's pricey then
oh my gosh like some of these skincare
companies they're so expensive and to
have an affiliate link for something
that I wouldn't spend a hundred and
fifty dollars on and I'm asking you guys
to so that I can continue to get it sent
to me for free like there's something
weird about that right like it's just a
little bit you know I don't know if you
definitely want to talk about today
definitely leave your comments down
below I'm not trying to be rude in this
video I'm literally just telling you
guys how I feel overall it could be
really great and be awesome and I wish
that everyone could just be truthful and
honest and that money wouldn't cloud
people's decisions but that's just not
the way the world works so I feel like
that's why there's so much just
controversy and contention over
affiliate link sponsorships PR and all
that when it comes to the beauty
community I think that's ever
let me know if you have any other topics
you want me to talk about down below and
again let me know what your thoughts are
on all of this as I channels growing I'm
definitely learning more and more about
the world of PR and sponsorships and
it's definitely eye-opening and I think
that for anyone who is completely just
someone who watches I think it does
benefit you to kind of think on the
other side like imagine all the hard
work they put into and how awesome it
really is to be contacted by brands and
keep that in the back of your mind a
little bit too and what you would do but
I definitely think that a lot of stuff
has gone way too far and I think a lot
of stuff is just not transparent enough
and it needs to be oh one more thing I
did want to talk about another thing on
affiliate links personally I use magic
links to link all the stuff in my
description box if I can now not
everything that has a magic links link
is making me any money there are some
retailers that aren't monetized through
magic links but they still create a link
for you so it's not every single thing
but for me personally I'm just linking
you to the website and I'm gonna make a
small Commission it's almost like me
making money off of like an Ebates thing
or something I'm fine with that the
Commission's super small
I haven't even reached my $50 threshold
since I started linking things this way
so it's not making me a ton of ton of
money over here I think that's almost
like I'm getting a tiny bit of
commission for doing all the hard work
of like linking all the stuff in the
description box for you so I personally
don't have an issue with that and a lot
of the times the stuff I'm talking about
are things I bought so I don't feel like
it has that same kind of like ethics
issue that I feel like specific like
company affiliate links can have so
that's kind of how I feel about that
even for like the bigger youtubers who
use like real style or whatever that
bigger you know affiliate link thing is
I don't really have a problem with that
either I mean if they're gonna take the
time to link it I think that's great for
people who really want to just find it
easy so my issue is more like with ones
that are specifically from the brands
because obviously it's just it's just
more biased like you know it's a more
fee code it's not oh here's a link
make one person offer any link I you
know that goes through that brand
hopefully that makes sense but I thought
I would just mention that really fast
cuz I just remembered I like to think of
it - it's just like a referral code like
for Influenster or octal e or any of
these other things where it's like sign
up and you get $10 and they get $10 I
don't think that's as big of a deal I
think if you're already using the
service or whatever
my issue definitely is more with like
the brand specific affiliate links I
feel like those can just easily turn bad
that's actually everything I hope you
guys are having a wonderful rest of your
day
and I will see you in my next video bye
