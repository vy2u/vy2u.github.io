learning thanks so much for watching I
know I have been gone for a while
especially in comparison to how much I
usually upload so this is going to be a
tube talk as well as a little bit of an
update so if you're not interested in
the update and you just want the tube
talk news I will leave that down below
mostly though I just got sick I got
really really really really really sick
probably the sickest I've ever been in
my life and it lasted for days and it
was horrible I think I got food
poisoning or some other type of
intestinal bacteria of some sort and it
was really really rough I mean see him
come home from work a couple of days ah
a very very weak I probably should have
went and got like an IV because I was
super dehydrated I couldn't keep
anything in my body um yeah but I'm
better I have a new whole new outlook on
life um I don't know there's something
so refreshing after you're done being
sick and you feel better it's like I was
sick for so long I forgot how good it
like I forgot what it felt like to be
normal to be able to eat something and
not have any pain to be able to just
like be yourself even when I wasn't a
hundred percent even just that like 75
percent I was like oh my gosh it's so
refreshing to be a normal human so I'm
so glad that's over I would never wish
that upon my worst enemy I was very very
horrible anyway I mean that's really it
that's really the reason I wasn't
uploading I just wasn't able to film I
really wasn't able to do anything I felt
so nauseous most of the time and it's
like I didn't even have the energy to
edit videos so I also have been really
busy may as a really really busy month
for me I had the second wives premiere I
had makeup I was doing before the
premiere for people I did Katy to make
it for the premiere so just like a lot
of stuff all at once I was just really
focusing on trying to get myself better
get as much breasts as I possibly could
so that way I could work when I needed
to work I'm also going to be busy the
rest of the month so I'm filming today
I'm really going to only be doing like
really basic videos on my channel for
this month
sited I just I never have planned out
enough to my pre-record that much in
advance and I don't like doing that I
like to film like 4 videos at a time but
I really don't want to be pre reported
out like more than two weeks who's it's
just I feel unconnected from you guys
and I feel like that's like the whole
point of YouTube is to like have that
connection I'm going to be uploading
videos but they will have a bigger break
in between up I like three or four days
apart from each other so not as much
content as normal but I'm going to be
trying to put up the content I know you
guys like the most so updates to project
pans updates to just things that you
guys like so that things that this will
be a tube talk I just thought it was
like a nice mix to have you know update
plus a little bit of a talking video
feel like I could like catch up and chat
with you guys so if you haven't seen any
of my other tube talk I will leave the
playlist linked down below this is a
series where I just like to talk about
things I like to talk about usually they
have to do with the beauty community and
it's just kind of my off-the-cuff
opinion on them just sit on my couch
chillin with y'all telling you how I
feel and hopefully it's a place where we
can just have open discussion so even if
you have a differing opinion than mine I
definitely encourage conversation and a
dialogue I think that's good so today
we're going to talk about this vib sale
that's before a freaking vib sale my
feed has been blowing up I wanted I mean
it's been like four months now it's the
previa beat sale oh my gosh this is my
wish list then it turned into I don't
even know like shop whiskey for the VIP
sale and then it's just hall after hall
after freaking hall now don't get me
wrong I'm not trying to like offend
anyone if you made a div video I'm not
like I'm gonna like mad at you I don't
like hate you I'm just saying it was
just a lot of it for a really long time
and I just have an issue I have an issue
that the vib sale is so freaking hyped
up I don't understand I do not
understand it is 15% off people that's
it now I know I am privileged we had
some makeup artists so I do get a
discount on basically all the makeup I
purchase I really don't find makeup
so I get a pro discount so I know that I
am very lucky and I know that a lot of
other people are not able to get a
discount like that so 15 percent off or
any type of discount on makeup is a
really good deal I you know is it normal
I don't want to say it's a good deal
it's not a good deal but um okay battle
being said though you know I feel like
there's my little disclaimer so take
everything with a grain of salt but it's
like I am just baffled by people who are
literally buying like thousands of
dollars with a makeup and justifying it
because they're getting 15% off like 15%
off is like a little over tax like
that's it like you're not saving that
much money it's really I just don't
understand it's not like an actual
reason to go ham and buy that much stuff
and I just saw it everywhere I saw it
everywhere I go and I know in the
project panic community which I feel
really big like I feel like that's my
home on YouTube hold on right mama
um shoot where were they where was I I'm
trying to edit too much because I ain't
got the time I don't know people just
going ham I don't talk about that crap
um it's just really insane to see so
many people buy so much makeup oh yeah
paja panting that's my home in this
community I feel like honestly I feel
like that even though I know that I'm
not as hardcore as so many other people
I really do feel like that where I fit
in most and I've really been trying to
tailor my content over the last you know
a couple years to fit into this
community but in my way so it's like
yeah I'd like to talk about new stuff I
love makeup we all love makeup but
trying to just be a better consumer even
though I'm a makeup artist like I I have
to buy makeup for my job and I still
want to be a better consumer about it
because because I still don't need
everything and I think that's something
that like frickin throws me off too it's
like I see people that buy every shade
of everything and they literally only do
makeup on themselves or like swatch
makeup on themselves and it is crazy I'm
like I wouldn't even want to spend all
my money on that at the 40% off this
kind of get and I never would use all of
it and you don't even have a job in the
makeup industry
doing it and everyone can have the hobby
they want everyone can do whatever they
want with their money I'm just saying I
don't understand why Sephora's vib sale
is freaking high up because it's only
15% off it was 20 it'd be a little
better but I mean I just don't hear
nearly as much when old has their 20%
off coupons and that's five more percent
you know I know they don't carry the
same brand but they carry a lot of the
same brands
it's crazytown I think too there are
just so many other ways to get makeup on
a discount if you're I think this is
like my PSA I don't know about it it's
like first of all always be shopping
through eBay of some sort I just can't
get through a video okay I think we're
done with interruptions right now anyway
they're just this is like my public
services and I just feel like there are
so many other ways to get either that at
least that much of a discount if not
more of a discount off of items and I
don't know it's just that support of yo
detail is so hyped up that people just
don't know as much about other sales
that go on or or what I don't know we're
just lazy or they just don't care but
the thing is they do care so many people
care because that's the whole reason
that they bought hundreds and hundreds
upon hundreds of dollars with makeup or
that they save up for the div sale so on
yeah I don't know I think if you're
someone who really wants like some
coupons wants to save some money
definitely look out just for Ulta in
general they have the 20% off coupon
that comes out quite a bit they do the
21 days of uLTA Beauty whatever I feel
like all of those are better you get
points on Ulta purchases to then regime
as cash on your purchases once you save
up to certain amount of points which
again is amazing and awesome
so I just feel like altered so much more
it should so much better they're
starting to carry so many more brands I
know they don't like have NARS or Beauty
Blender or some really awesome brands
that the flora does have but they
definitely have so much and if you have
the option of either buying something at
Sephora or buying something at Ulta I
suggest volta on top of that brands have
their own websites and usually you get
some type of like signing up bonus for
giving your email and signing up for
email notifications usually that ranges
are like 10 - like 25% off which is
amazing those sites also do a lot of
different promo codes and different
things like that
so if these are just I'm not trying to
get people to shop I'm just trying to
say if you're gonna shop like you can
get a better discount than 15% off and I
know a lot of people like wait for the
sale to wait for other better sales
Maisie's have the great have so many
cosmetics and they also are starting to
get in on the makeup game and you can
use different coupons there when they
have friends and family events you can
use those on cosmetics so look out for
that same with Nordstrom Bloomingdale's
on all of those places all the
department stores again we're coming
about - just I just don't understand how
the justification for 15% off just means
go crazy and to wait for it when Ulta
literally has the 20% off going at the
same time now granted I did hear so many
people say like some of the stuff is
from Ulta because they had the 20% off
so nothing everyone just like unaware
but I just feel like I just feel kind of
crazy like if anyone else out there with
me where it's just like it's just 15%
like yeah if you happen to need
something or maybe one thing you need
only could get it four or whatever yeah
I get that I totally get it or a couple
items you know but just when it's it was
just so much I saw some people and it
almost felt like a you know like a award
like you can have the most bags you can
have the most boxes for the sale and a
thumbnail and I'm just sitting there
like am I alone like wait how much did
you say did you save like 30% holy crap
that's a great aisle we take 15% one
homey please tell me please anyway
signing up for the actual sites like
urban caters their friends and family
sale I want to say like once or twice a
year and that's like 30% off tartness on
it's like 30% off on which against
double what people are freaking out
about and yeah I don't know then just
saying like if you try to act like you
love coupons and you're getting such a
good deal like actually be about the
coupon life and actually be about saving
that money and do a little research you
know and wait for bigger better sales
because to me I don't know to me 15% off
is kind of pathetic and I feel like
that's you know again I am making fire
so I know that it's like ah come on I
know that these these products cause
these companies like nothing to make
like nothing stop trying to play me it's
not worth it it's not worth it
and you definitely don't just need so
much I think it mix yeah it's a mix of
the fact that 15% off just isn't that
great and it's just irritating to see
the support vib sale hyped up so much
like literally people having like wish
lists of like I am so many items that
they're going to like to get that I just
feel like if they were smart about the
purchases or just smarter I mean it's
still at least you're saying something
but you could have saved more money you
know okay thank you really I look good
you like my new lip gloss a lot you
haven't seen use enough in a while what
so what's your transmitter here well my
6000 subscribers oh oh sure
anyway what was I saying oh yeah it's
two things this video is all of us I'm
so sorry I just don't understand why
everyone's freaking out about the vib
sale it's only 15% which you know get a
couple things at least it's a sale I
know the only do two but then it's also
like people buying so much
and I just really it was kind of all too
much man I mean I watched a lot of it
because I just kind of want to see
what's out there but I just can't I
really even though I buy some makeup and
I just did a haul up some Mac set but
it's all for my kit and it's all like
very similar shades to what I use and
also at my kids getting to the point
where I'm starting to need to kind of
switch stuff out because I've had it for
a while so it's like I want to have
newer makeup and not have old stuff in
my kit you know so I'm just kind of like
switching things out but for myself for
my personal self
I really don't buy that much makeup you
I mean for what you would expect for me
being a makeup artist for me getting the
discount for me having a YouTube to me I
don't think so many people it's just
crazy I just seriously I'm like what do
they do how much how did I have how much
money I'm jealous of the money not
that's not the product and I don't want
I wouldn't have spent that my money on
that I want the money anyway I think I'm
going to edit your anything I'm just
repeating myself at this point please
let me know your thoughts were down
below about all of the Ivy say Heights
because again it was everywhere and it
was the poll pre-show it was the during
the show and then it was the after I
still see packages I still see you know
videos coming through so okay that was
everything if you have any to talk to

often this month they will be still up
