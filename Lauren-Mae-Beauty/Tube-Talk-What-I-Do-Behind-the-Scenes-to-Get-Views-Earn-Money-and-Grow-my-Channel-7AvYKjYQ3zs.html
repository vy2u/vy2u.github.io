so much for watching today we're doing
another tube talk video this is a series
where I just wanted a place where we
could talk about different stuff a lot
of the times it's more I guess
controversial I don't know just topics
that usually have to do with YouTube in
some way or another
usually the beauty community
specifically but I thought it would be
fun today to talk about things that I
use to help grow my youtube channel now
I know a lot of people that I watch here
on YouTube and others subscribe to me
and watch me are also creators and they
thought it would be fun to just share
some things that I've learned and
started using over the years since I
started my youtube channel that I feel
like are just cool and I don't really
maybe hear people talk about I just
thought it'd be cool to put all this
information in one video if you were
interested I feel like it's a little
almost taboo at least in the beauty
community and I have a whole video
dedicated and talking about other things
besides the beauty community and that
you know there are so many other
communities out there and I highly
suggest you check in them out seeing how
other people run their channels outside
of just this tiny tiny little scope of
YouTube called the beauty community that
I feel like it's just so vastly
different than so many other channels we
all know about how sponsored videos are
just like you know people hate sponsored
videos in the beauty community I get it
trust me
link I'm not a hundred percent cool with
how some of the sponsored videos go down
but if you go and see sponsored videos
let's just say on like h3 h3 they're
just so much more chill about it even
you know it's just like not a big deal
they put it at the end it's just so
different anyway I'm getting off topic
if you want to check that video you know
I will leave the playlist linked down
below so you can check out all the other
tube talks that I've done in the past
I've done one on sponsor videos too so
I'll try not to get too rambley I'll try
to make that my only tangent but I do
have a list of items and things I wanted
to talk about today I tried to organize
them in a way I thought was useful I
don't know but I do feel like it's a
little taboo in the beauty community to
want to grow your channel it's like it's
it's definitely a struggle that I find
it's like I want my channel to grow
obviously I love people watching my
videos I enjoy that other people enjoy
my channel I think that's only natural
if you're making a
you're hoping people will watch it right
but I mean that just makes sense for me
I'm really happy right now and how my
channel is going I feel like I found
some videos that I really enjoyed doing
that you guys really enjoy watching and
that's been really fun I feel like
they're true to myself they're true to
how I feel about makeup and that's
amazing but when you're trying to get
your videos out there and you're trying
to get more views and more subscribers
and just reach a wider audience with
that I feel like you have to make a
decision you have to decide how far
you're willing to go to I don't know I
feel like this is going into a whole
different video maybe I should save this
for a whole different video but you kind
of have to decide if you want to you
know be more outrageous and and do
things that will definitely get you
views or if you want to maybe go the
slower in the steady route and you know
maybe not do clickbait titles or titles
that are like the worst foundation in
the world when it's a review and you
just didn't quite like this foundation
or whatever it is you know I'm not
trying to throw shade I'm just saying
you just have to make that decision
whatever that decision is for you that
is for you and that's something that's
been hard for me so I have some things
that I do and that I like to do that I
feel comfortable with that I feel like
are helping my channel but I'm also
being able to stay true to myself so
let's just get into my different like
apps and different things I want to talk
to you guys about to help you hopefully
in some way at all if you're a creator
or even if you're just someone who's
interested
I was always someone who's interested in
statistics and numbers and you know
growing and I would track other people's
channels like before I even had a
channel like I'm kind of crazy like that
I really just enjoy numbers and seeing
growth I have a history and retail I
don't know if that's part of it I just
find it really interesting so even if
you don't have a channel for me when I
didn't these were interesting videos to
watch because I just wanted to know the
inside workings like how does it all
work how does this person do this I just
enjoyed that so hopefully this will give
you a little bit of insight I don't know
okay I'm done talking about that let's
move on because this video is going be
long I'm gonna mention some things at
the beginning here that
still YouTube related I really want to
talk about more like outside things but
I highly suggest that if you don't have
two apps on your phone or whatever I
mean mostly your phone right that you
get them if you are serious about
YouTube and want to see like statistics
are not interested in that so the first
one is a YouTube creator studio this is
different than the actual YouTube app
this is a place where you can see your
analytics you can see your video and the
comments and all that all in one place I
really enjoyed this app because I can
see how my videos are doing in real time
I can always check on them I post videos
quite often so I I don't know I just
like seeing the views on them and and
how it's going if you guys are enjoying
it if you're not and I think it's just a
nice way to have all that information at
your fingertips
on your dashboard you can see like where
your money statistics are if you are
making any money or anything like that -
so highly suggest that app I just think
it's a good one if you're just more
serious about your YouTube channel and
care about statistics and numbers and
things like that the other app that I
also really like that's very related to
youtube is the Adsense app now I don't
know if you can see it that's it there
this is the studio app this is my
YouTube app the Adsense app is going to
show you how many of use you're getting
it's going to tell you for the day for
the week all those types of statistics
on views there are also things like
impressions clicks page CTR impression
CTR CPC now I don't really know much
about all that I haven't taken the time
I don't make a lot of money off of
youtube and so to me they just don't
really matter like since YouTube isn't a
full-time job for me all of these
different things I'm talking to you
about today came to me over time I
didn't just start my channel out and do
all of these things a bit just too much
I feel like it's something you kind of
graduate up to you're more interested
it's becoming more serious maybe it's
more successful and you find ways that
you can adapt and change and hopefully
grow your platform so anyway I mostly
use this just to track my views and I
really like seeing like my views for the
day I like seeing my views versus
yesterday versus same day last week they
also have views for the month so far you
can see if your upper
and they also have lifetime views too so
I just think that's really cool it keeps
you motivated at least me don't don't
let it unmotivated snot as good as the
month before but I just think it's
really fun I like looking at my
statistics in a microwave and a macro
way so I just enjoy that app and use it
all the time I think that's it for like
ones that I feel like are pretty related
to YouTube so other websites and apps
that I really enjoy for looking at like
statistics one is social blade you've
probably heard about this one I feel
like it's pretty well known but this is
a website and it is also an app where
you can put in let's say your channel
and you can see statistics you can see
how your subscriber growth is you can
see your view growth you can see money
and like predictions on how much money
people are making off their YouTube so
when you hear people talk about like
this person makes so much money I'm like
let's say Jacqueline Hillier Geoffrey
start you can type in their channel you
can look up their statistics and see how
much money they're making how many views
they're getting you can see a live count
of their subscribers it's a very awesome
tool if you're really into numbers once
again and you just are interested in
seeing like what people are doing and
how other channels are I feel like if
you are really interested in YouTube and
you want to see your channel grow that
you are also interested in other
channels that are successful and why
they're successful and looking at that
information so I personally I love to
like to look up people it's so fun
especially with Sam I'll be like you
want to know how much money they're
making and I'll look it up now I will
say the numbers it's it's like a range
of numbers for money and so it's not
it's not a hundred percent accurate I
usually go about in the middle and
that's what I feel safe saying like
they'd probably at least make this much
but that is just like a fun way to just
look up other people look up yourself
you can see if someone's with a network
too so yeah I really enjoy that I just
so you guys know any web sites or
anything that I talk about I will try to
link down below so you guys so like
easily access it the next website I want
to talk about is something that's going
to help people who are maybe a little
bit farther in their YouTube career I
don't know where they are
maybe getting offers to do sponsorships
they're getting offers to do things like
that and it's kind of weird because on
social media like I don't know how much
I'm supposed to charge I've never done a
sponsored video but it's like I don't
know what I'm worth
I don't know it's just like this weird
made-up Internet thing right how much
does what my you know subscriber cat is
with my views and my interaction and all
that I don't know how much value that is
for company and I don't know if I'm
under estimating myself overestimating
myself or anything like that so social
Bluebook is a way that if you are really
wanting to figure out what your worth or
um yeah like what your you know social
media worth is you can go on there link
your accounts I linked my youtube and my
Instagram but you can figure out how
much you could charge people for a range
of different things for a dedicated
upload before I mentioned for just a
link in your description a mention to
another person's video how much you
could charge people for those items but
it's just a way for you to kind of get
an idea for that and I think that's
really awesome obviously you can go way
higher you can go way lower it gives you
a range I think it's really cool because
once again it shows you some statistics
it tells you what your engagement is on
a letter grade scale it shows you what
your average like likes and comments are
for different videos and things like
that so if you're interested and want to
know what your worth is once again it's
just a really awesome tool to have it's
free to figure out what the heck what
the heck this whole thing is you know it
really helps put money in perspective
too and I feel like if anything gives
you a better sense of like hey I am
offering a service I think I've talked
about this maybe for a brief second but
you know when you start getting bigger
and companies start like reaching out to
you a lot of times you can think almost
like oh my gosh I'm so lucky that
they're reaching out to me but you need
to keep in mind that they're reaching
out to you because you have something to
offer them and depending on what you
want to do with that
like I love getting product for free and
trying it out I think that's so fun I
love telling you guys my honest opinions
about it and for me I want that to stay
fun and I think it's good to put into
perspective that I'm offering
there I'm just giving it to me for free
I don't need to be grateful for them and
like sucking up to them because I'm
doing you a favor I'm talking about it
to my audience something you don't have
that's why you sent it to me it's a you
know a mutual relationship here so
anyway you really like that site it'll
be linked down below if you want to
check it out but um and you can also
send those quotes off I just think it's
really cool it's like Kelley Blue Book
but social Bluebook and I think it's
awesome definitely needed this is just
so much guys there's a lot of
information in this video next let's
talk about thumbnails I know a lot of
people use PicMonkey for their
thumbnails and I feel like it tried that
up and I just didn't really like it but
I found an app that I really love and
that helps me put all those stupid
little emojis on my pictures and it is
photo grid and it's a free app I just I
love it it works so well they have so
many fun stickers and text and colors
and fonts and all the stuff for what I
want for my videos I know some people go
a little more intense with theirs I
don't I'm not there yet we're lucky I'm
putting text on the on the thumbnail at
this point I recently made that change
like maybe at the end of the year last
year so I'm trying to stick with that
that I I make custom thumbnails not just
like a screen shot but you know I have
sometimes have some interesting things
on it because I really do think that
does help your videos at first it felt
really weird and like just I don't know
it's weird you know but the more I do it
the more I realize that it really does
look better when you look at my channel
and I look at my old thumbnails and then
I look at this shot of like all my new
thumbnails together because I have so
many now that are all in this new format
it definitely looks more exciting and
you know energized it looks like I care
a little bit more I highly suggest
checking that app out it's again free
which I like I don't want to pay money
I'm cheap you know I'm not making money
I want to try to find things for free if
I can and I think this one works really
well I import photos from like my
computer onto my phone and then edit it
and then either send it via email or
just import it back on to my computer
you can figure all that out I'm not a
whiz at that type of stuff so you figure
that out on your own but it works really
well for me I really enjoy it it's super
fast and easy to make if I'm too honest
it takes like seriously if I'm going
fast like three minutes I can get one
done it's awesome let's talk about links
and linking things you guys know I use
magic links now I wasn't always using
magic links I started using magic links
I want to say like over a half a year
ago or so
I think I don't really know the exact
time I started using them but it is an
affiliate program so magic links is like
a third party that you can take a link
let's say from Sephora you copy that
link to a specific product put into
magic links it shortens it and then if
someone shops through that link you will
get a commission now most of the time
it's a pretty small Commission you're
not making like usually over 10% for
sure and in my experience you're
definitely not even making that much I
know a lot of people hate affiliate
links and I don't particularly love like
brand associated affiliate links but
this is different because I can link
websites all across the port I can link
Sephora Ulta and I try to link what I
feel like is the best site that I would
shop at for where I can find that
product I like linking products in my
description so it's easy for you guys to
shop I've had people ask me to do that
in the past and that's why I do it and
then magic links is just like an extra
little reason to want to do it I hate
filling out the description box it's not
fun filming a video even editing a video
that's fun to me filling out the
description box is definitely more of a
chore so to me it's like that little
incentive it's this tiny tiny little
incentive that maybe if someone does use
this link I could maybe make a little
bit of money off of it and since I know
in my heart and with you guys that I
only talk about products that I actually
like or if I don't like them I'm telling
you I don't like them I just talk about
products honestly so I don't feel like
any type of weird way about linking
products and I don't ever pick products
to talk about so that I can link them in
my description box and I don't ever try
to pick certain sites based off of what
their Commission is I don't even really
know what people's commissions are for
different sites I usually try to do like
Sephora mostly Ulta if I can because I
like the reward system better but
Sephora and Ulta because they're easy
everyone knows them
trust them you can return stuff at them
unless I can't find it there then I'll
go to specific brand sites or Amazon
anyway we're getting off topic and that
is just a good way so if you are someone
who is linking stuff or it just needs a
little bit more incentive to stay
disciplined and actually link stuff that
was how I found a way to do that and
I've never gone to payout you have to at
least make $50 to get a payout but I
feel like it's one of those things that
like a couple pennies here a couple
pennies there it adds up and as long as
you have a proper disclosure in your
description I don't think it's a big
deal now everything that's linked with a
magic links link doesn't mean I'm making
Commission off of it Sephora and Ulta
are brand partners but like makeup geek
anything I link from makeup geek I don't
make money off of it's not a partner
with magic links it just shortened the
URL essentially and I can like track if
someone walk like click that link same
with color pop same with a lot of other
brands that I link so just because it's
a magically doesn't mean that I am gonna
make a commission if you purchase
through that link because there are some
websites that although you can shorten
the URL through their site you aren't
going to be making a commission I just
wanted to clear that up but then there
are also sites that even if you put in
two magic links you're not going to be
able to get a shortened link for
whatever reason it's like says it
doesn't support that website or whatever
so I use Google URL shortener to shorten
those links so anything you see that
it's like Google whatever that's a
shortened link and I don't make a
commission at all off of that but
something I do like about using the
shortener not only is it a shorter link
so it's not just like messy in your
description box but you can't track the
link so for example I try I'm trying to
get better because I just kind of I'm
interested in numbers I think it's cool
to see like how many people are actually
looking at my description box is it a
must-have for me to do this like I just
like knowing like okay I talked about
this in my video and I left a link oh
wow
27 people clicked it that's so cool that
people were actually interested or I
didn't talk about this but left it in my
description box and still people clicked
it or no one clicked it or whatever so I
personally like being able to track
things in that way it just as an
interesting thing for me and it keeps
like a record of all of your things I
can look back at vid
goes way past and links that I've shown
in what the clicks are on it I just
think that's cool oh my gosh I'm like
getting shorter and shorter as this
video goes on because I'm just like it's
a lot it's a lot of stuff a lot of
information I feel like I only have a
couple more things to talk about these
are obviously just the things that I
could think of right now and that I'm
actually using right now so if this ever
gets updated or I think of more things I
can always do like a part two or
something but next let's talk about
getting free product now specifically in
the beauty community it benefits us to
get products to talk about because we
can make content for our subscribers we
can let them know about new products
coming out if they're good or bad show
those swatches help them just make
informed decisions about what's coming
out and if they want to buy it my
absolute favorite site is octoly you
guys have heard me talk about it a ton I
think they just do a really good job of
helping creators I just really like the
system they have I'm trying to put it
into words for a second but I just
really like the system so you have to I
think apply it's changed I believe since
when they first started I feel like I
got on the octoly train pretty early on
I was lucky enough to like hear about it
I don't even remember who I heard about
it from but I signed up and I was
accepted and it was so fun so they have
a free store for creators once you have
an account and you can go on there and
you know apply to get sent products and
I love that it's like shopping so I'm
not just getting sent products from
brands I don't care about or things I
don't want to try I looked at the site
and said hey this thing out of all these
things seems really cool I'd love to try
this out let my subscribers know about
it and then they either accept you or
don't now they have a range of different
brands on there they have stuff from
Alibaba but they also have things from
by Terry so they have you know a range
of products on that site and I think
that's really cool they want you and
encourage you and tell you you have to
tell people that you've got these things
sent for free they want 100% honest
reviews they don't just want positive
reviews you have 21 days from the day
you get that product in the mail to then
make a video and post about it then you
upload a link of where you talked about
that product in your video to the site
and you know complete that and then you
move on you don't get paid it's not
about sponsorships which I personally
like I just really like it I feel like
it's a very fair system I feel like I
can be trans
about it that they want me to be
transparent about it so I am I'm really
into it your creator and you are more
serious if you are a little bit more
grown I highly suggest checking it out
checking out the rules and seeing if you
could be a part of the octoly family I'm
sorry just sometimes this little
hashtags are a little much for me but
anyway something new that they're doing
too which i think is really cool they're
doing octa points which help you get
like coins to then turn those like coins
into dollar gift cards so they have
Sephora or Amazon as options which i
think is awesome I don't know how but I
have like 70 coins which is like a lot
of coins
I don't know house and one of my videos
ranked in something I've been trying to
figure out how they're all ranking
system even works I have no clue I feel
like it was just like we are done luck
but I think that's really awesome they
weren't doing that before and it's kind
of a fun way for you to you know talk
about products and then get even more
bonuses like not only are you getting
free product which is super cool to talk
about and share with and not have to pay
money to then have content and talk
about things but you're also going to
get like gift cards on the side if you
somehow match up to whatever they're you
know criteria are on that so um I will
have a link for that I always have a
link for opting in my description box
that is an affiliate link the magic
links is an affiliate link I think those
are the only two my Influenster is an
affiliate link so if you like sign up
it's kind of like the friends thing like
where that's like my specific link so
they know that like I said hey I like
Influenster and you wouldn't clicked it
I don't get monetary gain off of any of
those like I'm not making money but like
I do get points or different things
depending on the different systems but
if you're not comfortable with that just
you can always find Influenster or octa
lee or magic links on your own and just
type it into Google or whatever I just
don't ever let you guys know that but
octa lee i love it I've talked about it
so much and I feel like I've gotten so
many cool products tried out so many
great things things I love things I
don't love and it's just been really fun
so if you're a creator and you want a
way to try out new stuff and maybe you
don't want something that's super
sponsoring this would be a great site
for you some other sites for free
product if you haven't signed up for
Influenster definitely do they said
out to different box boxes and campaigns
depending on your answers to surveys and
different things it's not like in every
month thing it's just like whenever they
randomly pick you but I really like
influencer for higher-end products which
is awesome like who doesn't love getting
Marc Jacobs something in the mail it's
awesome he also send out food stuff in
different things they've been expanding
so much since when they first came out
pinch me is another service I just
signed up with pinch meet recently they
sent me a box like a vlogger box that
one though is definitely more of like
actual samples like you're gonna get
like travel-size stuff not full-sized
products and they are going to be mostly
like drugstore and things like that but
that's another one as well for free
product it's not nearly as good as
actually if you're doing it for videos
or for reviews on beauty products just
so you know and then on the other
spectrum I feel like octa Lee's in the
middle let's say influencer and pinch me
are over here and then on this side
there's things like famebit and
grapevine insights that are gonna help
creators and brands meet each other and
create sponsored content so you will get
paid for your content to talk about a
product or review in our do tutorial or
whatever you guys agree on or whatever
they're looking for and you will get
paid for the video as well as get the
product for free and that is completely
different again then actively you're
just getting free product but you're not
getting paid any money where is this you
can make money there's no shade here you
can do whatever you want
I don't think sponsored videos again are
bad I will leave my ideas on sponsored
videos I have a tube talk on it down
below again but it just depends on what
you want with your channel I personally
don't feel like I'm big enough at the
moment to really want to do a ton of
sponsored content because what I can get
sponsored to make content on our
products and brands that are not very
well-known and there's nothing wrong
with that but I just don't feel right
putting my name on those things yet I
don't feel like associating with those
things this young in my channel I'd
rather wait and get some bigger
opportunities later on type of thing if
I was going to do a sponsored video if
that makes sense but those are also
sites that you can sign up for and look
at I am signed up for them and I look
through the
campaigns every now and then but I just
never find anything that's just you know
I'm just pining to do so it just you
know octal is definitely the one I use
all the time I only have two more things
to talk about I know this video is so
long guys I'm sorry the next tool is
called to buddy it's something I haven't
been using for a very long time but from
some of the channels that I watch which
will be the next thing that I talk about
I've heard the mention to buddy so many
times and I finally was like what the
heck is this whole tube buddy thing
about so I'm still definitely figuring
out the different tools it has to offer
how they can help me in what I want to
get from to buddy but I think it's a
great way that if you are serious about
your channel and you're trying to get
your videos just viewed more by using
search engine optimization and figuring
out the algorithm and using it to the
best of your advantage I do suggest
checking it out and you know do a little
research on it it's free but you can
also pay to upgrade it I'm just using
the free version at the moment it's a
downloaded thing you can get to add to
your browser plugins those are what
those are called and it just helps give
you like shortcut keys on YouTube so if
you're a creator you know that if you
want to look at your videos you have to
go to my channel and then you have to go
to like video something and then you can
maybe look at your videos by then this
just has like a bunch of easy shortcut
buttons so you don't have to go through
all those steps you can just boom I want
to look at my videos and it'll take you
to the page which i think is really nice
saves your time and all that if your
computer slow like mine definitely will
save you some time but one of the tools
that they have is a way to search for
tags and it gives you a statistic of one
out of a hundred of how good that tag is
based off of how often it's searched and
how competitive it is in some of the
videos I talked about you want to get
your videos ranked in the search engine
so if someone's looking up how to color
your hair obviously that's going to be
maybe not the best thing to tag your
video because they were already a
million videos tagged how to color your
hair there are already so many in that
area super competitive and it's searched
for a lot so you can decide yeah I'm
still gonna tag it because that's what
it's about maybe it'll show up and
whatever again I'm not
percent sure how this whole tacking
thing works I'm still figuring it out
but instead you might want to get
creative and be like maybe a little bit
more specific like how to go from pink
hair to whatever at home or whatever it
might be and you can type these things
in you can type whatever you're thinking
about tagging and figure out if it's a
good tag or if it's not if it's super
competitive if it's searched a lot but
not very competitive and then hopefully
if you do that it'll tell you which is
really cool if you have a really good
tag if your video ranks so like if
someone typed in that exact tag you
would show up in the top 20 videos on
YouTube which is cool that's really cool
because there are so many videos on
YouTube so that's just a way that you
can get your video viewed by more people
and hopefully from there you know not
only not only just get views but if
someone's looking for that and you have
some information on it they can like
know that information now which is the
whole thing and how it works I really
like it for that that's kind of what I'm
using it for the most at the moment but
I'm trying to watch other videos and
kind of figure out how I can best use
this application for what I want to do
and how I want to grow my channel and
last I have two channels I just wanted
to suggest to you guys if you are into
videos like this one these are channels
and I just find are so interesting I
love again just hearing it if I'm
constantly hearing like this is how you
can help grow your channel this is how
you can help be a better channel or get
people to watch your videos or do this I
just feel like it just makes it second
nature to me I don't know I just enjoy
it that's just a person I am in any
aspect of life I want to do it the best
I can while still being me so I feel
like these channels are great so the
first one is roberto blake again he'll
be linked down below he does a lot of
different content he does a lot of great
videos I just really like it's just
straightforward good content like good
solid content he does a lot of stuff on
YouTube and how to grow your channel but
he does a lot of other content as well I
really like a video that he did talking
about like evergreen content and how you
can put out videos that maybe don't get
a ton of views at once but they will
last over time so it's a video that
people can refer back to years and years
later and you can constantly be getting
views and just different things like
that I already think that way so
watching these videos is just kind of
formation of that but it's just nice to
learn about that if you aren't savvy and
want to be or you're kind of just
interested I think they're really cool
videos and the other channel that I
think is really good is video creators
it's very similar it helps creators make
better videos hopefully make better
content reach more people grow their
channels I just think it's nice to hear
those videos to watch those videos stay
pumped about your channel if you are
really serious about doing YouTube even
if it started as a hobby even if you do
it because you love it there's no doubt
in the fact that it feels good for it to
also be successful it does it feels
great you know and I don't think there's
anything wrong with that but it also can
go the other way and it can feel like a
little sad you don't and that's a whole
other discussion about feeling validated
from weird things online like that but
if you are more serious and maybe want
to take your channel to the next level
or hopefully at some point in the future
make even a supplemental income on
YouTube I think that these are just
great tools all of them Hopa and I
suggest them to you they're all things
that I think are really good so let me
know down below if you guys have
anything to say about these if you've
tried them if you like them if you don't
if you have other suggestions for ways
to kind of enhance your channel and grow
your channel I really hope that if this
is something you were looking for these
can help you
my biggest tip though is just you just
know what you want your channel to be
about stay passionate about your content
don't do this obviously for the money
because if you're doing that it's gonna
take so much time to get to the point
where you'd actually be making money
that you have to be passionate about it
or you're gonna hate it and and even
that then you're not genuine and no one
will even want you but just keep in mind
that it's okay to want to grow your
channel but just know what you want to
do have your boundaries on whether you
want to do sponsored content if a brand
reaches out to you what you're okay with
doing what you're not okay with doing
and just know that you are valuable and
to not let those companies take
advantage of you and also to not let
yourself take advantage of you if that
makes sense to not get so excited that
people are contacting you as you grow
and
not seeing the worth of your channel and
your hard work because you work hard and
you don't need them you didn't need them
from the beginning and so you know don't
ever compromise your ethics or your
channel or your subscribers for product
or money or anything like that always
know your boundaries know where you lie
in your ethics and stay true to that no
matter what happens I think that's the
biggest thing for me anyway with YouTube
keeping your ethics in line but then on
top of that trying to do everything you
can to grow your channel in the most
ethically sound way that feels right for
you I'm done my finger talked about way
too much and I hope this helped that's
everything guys I'll see you in my next
to talk bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
