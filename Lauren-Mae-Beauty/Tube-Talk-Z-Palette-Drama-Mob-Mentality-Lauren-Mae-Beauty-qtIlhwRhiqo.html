learn thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another episode of tube
top this is where I sit on my couch and
I talk to you about things I want to
talk to you about on YouTube this is
more off-the-cuff and just me talking
from the heart so keep that in mind I
wanted to talk about the whole Z palette
situation I felt like there are a few
reasons I want to talk about it one I
use a lot of Z palettes in my videos
because I have a lot of single shadows
and I've been using Z palette for a
really long time and I kind of just
wanted to give my opinion on it because
it's different than so many people so I
just wanted to hear me out I know a lot
of you guys like my channel because I'm
kind of like an OBS type person so I
hope if anything you can respect me for
telling you guys my opinion even if you
disagree with it also I you know I'm
totally down for a discussion in the
comments let's keep it civil and awesome
and nice but yeah we can all have
different opinions that's okay that's
that's alright and then on top of the Z
palette scandal and situation I feel
like this just ties into a bigger issue
of like mob mentality jumping on the
bandwagon and and just you know I feel
like really zooming in on little
scandals and blowing them a bit out of
proportion so yeah anyway I really hope
I don't offend any of you guys but I
also wanted to say my opinion and I feel
like a lot of people are jumping on the
bandwagon of like I hate Z palette - I
bought boycott maybe they all feel that
way which is a hundred percent fine you
can spend your money how you want and I
think I get it i get i get that opinion
for sure but i also feel like there's a
lot of people maybe that are just you
know don't want to deal with the hate or
the backlash potentially if they're like
yeah i'm so gonna use my z palettes and
I might still buy from them so if you
don't know about the Z palette scandal
where have you been there are so many
videos on it so many people have talked
about it I will do my best very very
fast to kind of talk about it Z palette
came out with a new product called the Z
Potter which is an induction plate that
helps you deep pot your pans of
eyeshadows induction burners and plates
use electromagnetic technology to heat
the metal like from within it's
definitely different
like a burner but it definitely looks
like a burner anyway I didn't really
know anything about induction I didn't
know the difference
I like brought it to my husband here
like oh yeah induction I'm like how do
you know all this crap like who are you
so that's fine and dandy but the thing
that really got people was the price its
$85 that's how much they want to sell it
for which is a very steep prices very
expensive boozy palette is expensive
brand their large Z palette retails for
$20 which is an X you know that is
expensive especially for how simple the
product actually is although it's
inexpensive you know more high-end brand
$85 is a lot of money and I was looking
up the price of induction plates cuz I
was like well maybe it's more expensive
technology the cheapest induction plate
I could find on Amazon was like $35 so
it's kind of different I mean this one's
branded and potentially a little bit
different or whatever but that is quite
a bit of money I believe that there was
a video shown on trend mode I think
that's whose account it was showing the
product and kind of debuting it and
people were saying all these things like
that's so expensive
falala nothing I don't feel like that
was maybe too hateful you know how we
get it we're snarky about stuff but
nothing horrible nothing that you
wouldn't like tell your mommy said right
and the Z palette account starts writing
back and attacking people telling people
that they're just too poor or you know
like burn your fingers doing your old
way whatever being sassy snarky but a
little bit more you know very extra and
this caused an uproar and I get it I
that is so unprofessional I don't think
this should have happened at all yes
this could be very personal if someone
on Z pallets account was like responding
to these I get that it would hurt that
people don't want to buy your product
especially if you spend a lot of time on
it that's part of being a business
that's part of like putting your stuff
out there putting anything out into the
world people have the right to criticize
it however they want even if they want
to be assholes about it oh yeah I might
pestle
but in this video sorry guys in my real
life I cuss all the time like all the
time so I try not to for my channel just
to like keep it a little bit more
enjoyable for everyone but I might cuss
in this series because these are videos
that I feel passionate about anyway
people are allowed to be assholes if
they want to you know and you just have
to like just ignore it you know what I
mean that being said it was kind of like
a rampage I mean it was a lot of
comments I feel like I've seen so many
of them and so when this got out and
like drama channels were reporting on it
and then Stephanie Nicole made a post on
Instagram like just associating herself
from Z palette and saying like she's not
gonna support them anymore makeup geek
also put out a thing saying they're not
gonna support them and so we were all
kind of expecting an apology and that's
not what we got we gotta basically I
don't feel sorry we were defending
ourselves and we don't take anything
back now that's like the story wrapped
up in a nutshell it was kind of a long
story but here are my thoughts on it I
think again she's super unprofessional
I'm assuming that it's the owner of Z
palette or the creator of Z palette her
name's Xena
I cannot say her last name I'll have her
name on the screen she's a working
makeup artist and she created this like
line because she felt like there was a
lack of product like this in the
industry that people could use I believe
I think we all think it's like her who
was writing these it could have not been
I don't know if that's been confirmed or
not assuming whoever it was they
shouldn't have done this there they're
responding on the actual brand's account
it's not professional at all to attack
your customers or to fight with your
customers regardless as if they're being
rude to you or not you know it doesn't
matter like it's just so unprofessional
and you just ignore it and you move on
like that's what you have to do if
you're putting yourself out there and
putting a product out there so that
already was horrible I also think that
they should have actually apologized
instead of doing what they did because
they were in the wrong but but this is
the but you know a hundred percent get
people who do not want to support this
brand who think that this is so
unacceptable that they would never want
to spend
their money there I get that and I think
that's great and I think you should do
whatever you want with your money and I
support you in that decision 100% for me
I think she was just being a bitch and I
don't think that I should boycott the
company just for that now I'm going off
of just this scandal I don't know if
there's some more scandals we'll go into
that topic in a little bit I don't know
I'm just I'm not gonna boycott the whole
company because she was being a bitch
and she shouldn't have been I feel like
we all can be kind of you know catty or
whatever at some point in our life she
made a mistake then she made another
mistake and for me the product is good
and different enough that I am still
going to buy this product I have already
repurchased this product and I'm not
suggesting that you guys do I think that
you guys should spend your money how you
want to and I think that the one good
thing that's coming out of like all
these drama channels and scandals
potentially if we're looking at the like
silver lining of the situation I really
do think it's great that people are
being more conscious of brands and how
they want to spend their money but I
think that should be a normal thing all
the time
it shouldn't just be when a scandal
arises that oh we're gonna boycott this
and oh this one big person that I really
like it doesn't like it so I'm not gonna
like it either I think you should make
your own opinions and I know Stephanie
Nicole totally believes that too like
100% like you should make your own
decision support who you want to
whatever I don't know to me it just
wasn't serious enough like it was
serious enough to be I'm glad I got
called out I think people should be
upset and I think that she should
apologize I'm not gonna like buy stock
in the company but I you know if I need
a pallet I'm going to buy one now I know
that there are so many other pallets
that are similar to Z palette in the
sense that you can put your deposit
shadows in them but honestly to me
there's nothing quite like the Z palette
I've watched a video from the fancy face
I will leave her video link down below I
think it's a very great video she shows
you all the different options that you
can use instead of Z palette because she
will not be buying any more z palettes
and it's super informative it goes
through so many brands all the different
sizes how many eyeshadows you can fit so
if you want to find different options
it's a great resource and video I
watched the whole video and I think it's
great but to me they just don't work the
same
like they're not the same to me honestly
I love that Z palette has the clear
screen because I can see what's in my
palette I separate my palettes by color
so it's nice to be able to see oh these
are the blues these are the greens
either the pinks and I like being able
to physically see that not having to
like write it on the side it also makes
me inspired to use my shadows and to
play around and to try different looks
out basically for that reason I really
preferred the Z palette I also get a pro
discount so I do not pay full price on Z
padding at 20% off so I get the large
palette for 16 instead of 20 so it is a
little bit more affordable for me and
then on top of everything I've already
invested in Z palette so when the
scandal broke I already knew there's no
way in hell that I'm going to be
throwing away my money and my palettes
that I already have like that's not
happening I already spent my money on
this but on maybe a more just like
aesthetic look at my palette it's like I
don't want to now switch up my game and
have two different systems of storing my
shadows I just want one I want them all
to be uniform and easy to work with and
so I don't want to switch over to a new
palette and something that I feel like
is inferior for what I like because of
this scandal it's not like she was being
racist or at least through anything that
I saw I just felt like it was her being
like offended people didn't like it and
maybe she's a little drunk drunk I mean
that's just me guessing I'm not saying
she was and she handled it super
inappropriately but we're all humans and
I just don't feel like anything that I
saw in this deserves like a forever
boycott like the lime crime scandal or
even and even not people have their own
opinions on so I just didn't feel like
it should get that much hate for what it
actually was I don't know I know you
guys are gonna disagree with me or some
of you will it is what it is but I for
me personally it just wasn't big enough
to like forever boycott that and like
you know burn my bra burn my Z palettes
and just like freak out yeah I think
that's all I have to say on that
specifically I hope you guys are
understanding at least a little bit and
again at least appreciate that I'm being
honest with you guys telling you I feel
that being said I I think that this also
just kicks up another thing for me I
just feel like so many of these scandals
there's like a new scandal every
freaking day right and I know these
drama channels are a big part of it but
it's just like irritating to me that
every little thing gets nitpicked right
like okay
I bought some shadows from Luxy beauty
and two of my shadows came cracked and
I'm not like starting it up or saying
like look see beauty sucks their
eyeshadows come broken it's like no
things happen I shot this break palettes
you know break in the mail or get
shipped out late I'm not saying that we
just a hundred percent should excuse it
if it's like repeat behavior but I also
think that a lot of stuff is like so
blown out of proportion like if one
person finds some weird random thing
wrong hell freezes over and everyone
freaks out about it
again I get that there might be more of
a pattern to it than what I'm explaining
here but it's just like kinda irritating
when I feel like some things that are
little are blown so far out of
proportion and then everyone hears it
and then everyone gets like excited and
gets in this kind of like mob mentality
jumps on the bandwagon oh you should
hate them too and then you feel
pressured to hate or just like you know
be upset about something even if maybe
you wouldn't be because everyone just
else around you is and you're like yeah
you're right I should be upset pitchfork
when maybe wouldn't be like that
otherwise or maybe you just feel
pressured like I didn't really feel like
that but I don't want to be the one that
doesn't get my pitchfork out so let's go
I don't know and also I feel like -
specifically if you want to like if this
is what you want your crusade to be
about I'm all for it like do again it's
your money and I think that people
should spend how they want and I think
they should look into brands and look
into where their money's going but it's
irritating when it's like you pick and
choose you know I don't really enjoy
that I feel like if we really wanted to
look into every single brand we could
find crap with
every brand and I know that this wasn't
like a private thing this was like a
public thing she's posting all this crap
everywhere but I think it's just
something to also consider like you know
a little devil's advocate a little other
side of the coin for you guys because
it's just too much everyone's outraged
by everything you can't use Lime Crime
we can't use this you can't do that like
I think people should be able to spend
their money how they want and we should
respect that that's where someone wants
to spend their money if they're educated
and know what they're doing and they
already know the situation that's how
they want to spend it then that's how
they want to spend it like enough set
you know but I feel like so many people
are pressured into not liking something
or feel like they can't buy stuff
because other people will be upset about
it and that kind of sucks you know I
wish people could just be and do what
they want
just like I am totally fine with you
guys not buying Z palette I probably
won't like link Z palette in my
description box because again if you
guys want to find a Z palette you can
and I just I don't care that much like
I'm not trying to push the palette on
you but I'm also just like get off my
back if I wanna buy Z palettes because I
have reason I have these are all my
points of why I'm not just doing it
blindly you know what I mean I don't
know I just feel like a lot of companies
can do do a lot of shady things and if
you want to get upset about Z palette I
think you probably should be upset about
like Kylie cosmetics and not buy them
and probably be upset about you know you
probably already are upset about Jeffrey
star if you're upset about Z palette you
should be upset about color pop probably
I don't know personally I kind of
thought that the makeup geek situation
how they handled it was a little shady I
mean they sell Z palette and then like
the scandal breaks and I get that they
need to disassociate themselves so they
don't like take any heat but then they
use that opportunity just to sell their
own palette to you it's not even like
just a straight-up oh my gosh I can't
believe that happen sorry about that we
won't be selling it anymore it's like oh
but check out our palette so like even
that to me is a little shady right I
don't know in the end right companies
their main goal is to sell crap to you
no matter who you think they are and how
nice they are and I'm gonna tie one last
thing in because this is just going on a
rambling rathole rampage but I think
it's kind of similar and maybe this is a
bad analogy
I'm gonna go I'm just gonna I don't know
it's just what came to mind I'm gonna
say it but I feel like this is very
similar to people who like want to get
up and be like it's chemicals you know
about some things but not about other
things that's how I feel like this
scandals are you know it's like this is
scandalous I'm not gonna do it but then
ignoring other scandals or not being
educated or wanting to be educated
unless someone like does a drama channel
on it I think it's kind of lame you know
like if you actually have good research
and you actually are like even across
the board I get it but other than that
just make your own decisions and let
people make their own decisions as well
think I'm gonna leave it on that note I
don't really know if that sums up
exactly everything I wanted to say but I
feel like this video is gonna get kind
of long you can let me know what you
guys think about what I said or your
guys's thoughts on the Z palette
situation I'll try to respond back I get
a lot of comments on my videos so it's
really hard for me but I have another
tube talk idea that I wanted to do kind
of talking about just like social media
and how it can like take over your life
because that's kind of how I'm feeling
right now and I kind of just wanted to
talk about that so that probably will be
my next one but if you have other ideas
on different tube talks I also wanted to
do one that was kind of like a top 5 of
like things and tools and outside apps
and things that I like to use to enhance
my channel I guess I thought that I'd be
kind of fun anyway I'm going to leave it
there guys I hope you're having a great
night I hope this didn't offend you too
much I really hope that on my channel we
can just have honest discussions and no
one can feel attacked we can just all
kind of like talk and it's okay to be
different have different opinions so
that's everything be an adult please
okay guys thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
