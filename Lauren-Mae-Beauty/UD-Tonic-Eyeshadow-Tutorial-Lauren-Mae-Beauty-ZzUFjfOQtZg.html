video is going to be a tutorial on the
look i'm wearing right now I was wearing
this look in a recent video and a lot of
you guys really liked it and some people
suggested a tutorial others just thought
it looked really pretty so I thought I
would show you guys how to get this look
it was really really easy the main star
of the show is urban decay's eyeshadow
and tonic other than that I mean you
don't need a lot of skill it's just
blending it's just a pretty eyes shadow
combination so I hope you guys enjoyed
the video I haven't done tutorials in a
long time since when i first started my
channel so i do want to start kind of
doing more tutorials and we'll see i
don't know i want to at least get like
one a month or so in there just because
i am going to makeup school now and also
i don't know I I learned to do makeup
they're not how to like pan only pan
stuff I just want my channel to be a
little bit more well-rounded besides
only project panning I love project
panning but i can only pan so many items
and declutter so much crap i want to
like I just want to do other things so
also disclaimer her this is like a
close-up of me so if you see like my
fuzzy hair on my face or different
things like that's just the real true me
um yeah sometimes the camera makes you
look good sometimes it doesn't so anyway
I hope you enjoy I'll see you in a
second ok so first thing we're going to
do I've already done my eyebrows and
I've also primed my lids using a cream
shadow and then I set that with a powder
so I'm gonna go in first with an e 40
brush from Sigma this is my favorite
brush to do like transition like shades
with so I'm going to use this and I will
be taking this shade from anastacio the
orange cream soda just orange soda I
want to take orange soda and put that in
my crease sloppily you don't have to be
precise with it I'm just try to keep it
like in the crease area
and I'm going to build it up so this is
like the second kind of like layer i
should say once you get your eyes to
match you're gonna move on to the next
step we're going to use a cream base so
it was sticky base to work with for our
main i shadow that's going to go I neck
so this is NYX jumbo eye pencil in 610
oyster I do have other purpley type
shades but I specifically like this one
because this doesn't really set so it
stays tacky no matter how much time I
have it all my eyes and although
sometimes that is a problem with
creasing since we're going to set it
with an eye shadow anyway it's not gonna
be big deal so I'm going to put this all
over the face of the lid and not go up
into the crease or anything just adapt
that eyeshadow has a really nice place
to stick I am NOT blending this like out
or anything because they do want it to
be as sticky as possible so um I'm just
putting an even coat now now i'm taking
the main star of the show this is urban
decay's i shadow in tonic we're going to
lay it over everywhere or put that cream
shadow
and ultimately you might want to do your
foundation after you do your eyes but I
almost never do just make sure you tap
off your brush as much as possible and
then that sticky face should help to
with fallout just try to not lift your
brush do patting motions instead of just
like blending it all over okay we now
have that roughly on the lid so next
step I'm gonna go in and I'm i was using
just a flat shader brush for that too
I'm so bad at tutorials anyway I'm gonna
go in to kind of just blend roughly with
this brush is kind of like a mac 217 I
believe i'm not sure i got it from
Coastal Scents for like two dollars or
something I'm gonna go in and just kind
of blend out there's a little bit of
harsh edge and then we'll go in and deep
in that crease up with a warm color
next I'm taking like a more dense crease
type of brush this is the elf blending I
brush and I'm going to place a darker
color in my crease for that I'm going to
be returning to my honest asya palette
and taking the end and I'm also going to
like deep in off the outer corner and
stuff with this as well like this whole
outer third is going to be covered with
this shadow so this is all i'll be using
in this next part
now that I've done that I'm going to go
back in with this same like brush i just
used to dry blend i'm gonna go back in
with orange soda and just make sure that
my transition and like the colors or a
splendid as possible this is also a time
that you could go in and add more of the
purple lee tonic shade to your lid if
you thought you lost any intensity i
feel pretty good about where I'm at with
that so I'm not I'm not gonna do that so
I feel good about my eyeshadow so I'm
going to go in and I'm going to
tightline using the Anastasia nor just
black eyeliner up on the top lash line
and then I'm also going to kind of like
prime or put like this eyeliner on my
lower lash line this is steel is liner
antique it's kind of a brown color this
is just going to be a base to blend
shadows on to as well on the lower lash
lines i'm going to do that and i'll be
back so that's what i look like after
I've done that step and we are gonna go
in and finish up the bottom lash line so
i will be taking this small little
smudgy type of brush I'm going to take
that Santa color and I'm going to just
kind of keep that as close to the lash
line as possible and then we're going to
blend that out with other colors yeah
this I fine just kind of finishes the
look
now I'm going to take this kind of
similar shape to brush but it's like
thicker and I'm going to use that one so
to shade and kind of diffuse that line
okay so before mascara I'm gonna go in
and highlight me in our corner I decided
to keep with that kind of ethereal fun
look so I'm going to take the like
bottom half of this shade which is urban
decay's Oh aura it's from the Glinda the
Good Witch palette you can see me so
awkward so I'm going to take that bottom
shade in highland manor corner i'm going
to kind of bring it up a lot to just to
give that brightness and i don't have
more dramatic i just like that type of
look usually and to do that I'm taking
this kind of a dense brush this is urban
decay's blending brush but I'm gonna use
it again for the inner corner I'm gonna
go put some mascara on my upper and
lower lashes and I'll be right back and
this look will be done they'll be done
okay so this is the final look I hope
you guys enjoy it is super easy look I
mean honestly the shadows what is the
main thing I only is like three real
products on the eyes for so um it's not
that complicated it's just it's just a
pretty combination but anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed I will see you in the next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
