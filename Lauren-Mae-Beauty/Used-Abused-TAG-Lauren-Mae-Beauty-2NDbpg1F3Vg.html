Florida thank you so much for watching
I'm doing another tag video today and
this is the used in abuse tag I believe
this was started by a Nicole Renee
Cutler I will have her channel link down
below she bought this idea from a
subscribers comment and what was it and
created a whole tag and it's been going
around the beauty community so I thought
I would join in there aren't any
specific questions for this tag but
you're supposed to go through your
collection to pick out items that you've
used and abuse that you can physically
see that you've used this product and
since I project pants I have quite a few
of those products but I decided to kind
of keep it at 10 these are the best of
the best the things that I recommend a
hundred percent unfortunately there are
a couple of items in here that are like
limited edition or maybe you might not
be able to get your hands on as easily
but I wanted to still include them
because they're things that I love
they're things that I have a lot of use
on and that I just I truly recommend and
if you want to actually know what I use
these are the items I thought it was
only appropriate that the first item I
mentioned is the elf brow pencil in
taupe you guys know I love this I talk
about it all the time
I'm like a broken record about it I've
probably gone through almost ten of
these since I've been using them they're
two dollars so they are incredibly
affordable now these aren't going to be
as thin as something like the Anasazi
brow Wiz or any of the dupes of that but
for my brows and what I like it gives me
just enough precision and the price I
just
I mostly can't beat the price the
formula on this is a bit creamy it's not
as hard and whacks you some other
pencils but again I work with it I love
it I can use just this in my brows and
get a look that I really enjoy and to
prove that I love it here are my backups
as well as another open brow product and
I threw on the floor I always keep them
on hand because I buy them like I don't
know five or so at a time next or
something that gets raised about all the
time on YouTube and it's something that
I also love my love for this grew over
time it wasn't something that I just
tried the first time and was like you
must have it if you love full coverage
and you love something that isn't going
to really show your skin you probably
won't like this if you want something
that's going to keep you crazy matte you
probably won't like this but for someone
who wants a really nice medium coverage
foundation so that's going to even out
the skin tone but not cover up the skin
kind of just enhance the natural beauty
of the skin this is so you
full I love that this doesn't have to
matte of a finish and I liked how it
wears throughout the date even though I
do tend to get oily with it there's
something about that doing this that I
enjoy and I feel like I can easily touch
up and my makeup still looks good at the
end of the day whereas other foundations
that are a bit thicker or heavier tend
to break up throughout the day and then
look patchy and cakey and clump up in
weird areas I just highly recommend this
this is what I use in my makeup kit as
well and it's just so good you can
definitely get better coverage of use a
brush on it just a little tip but I
highly suggest this it's very very good
the shade range is also impeccable
another skin item that I absolutely love
is this primer from hard candy this is
the issuer and the shine free primer I'm
almost out of this and I'm kind of sad
because Walmart's are kind of hard to
find around me there's one in Burbank
but that one's kind of far for whatever
reason just LA is the land of no
Walmart's which I'm not complaining
about too much but just for this
situation a kind of sex I bought this
because they did a hard candy 5 first
impressions and I just continue to use
this this is one of the primers that I
reach for the most I feel like it does
everything I needed to do it adds a bit
of moisture and just gives a nice
smoothing base for my foundation to go
on top of I find that it does fill and
pours nicely and it does control my oils
without feeling like an extra gloopy
disgusting layer on the skin the price
of it I believe is like six or eight
dollars so you cannot beat that I just I
really love everything about this
foundation I love that a strict store
it's so good and I will be repurchasing
this once I finish it up the next item
is actually something I don't have on me
because I've used my last one up but it
is the Maybelline fit me concealer is my
absolute favorite concealer I think I've
ever used when it comes to high-end when
it comes to drugstore it's just
beautiful it's the perfect amount of
coverage I love the consistency and the
way it just applies on the under eye
area I love to blend it out with a
Beauty Blender
and it's just great I use the shade fair
which is the lightest shade
I believe it's 15 fair I highly suggest
it I feel like for concealers it's also
a bit more affordable than a lot of
things at the drugstore it's just my
holy grail
I probably
like a torso goes to so good I will
continue to repurchase it and I suggest
that one for anyone who's looking for an
affordable really great concealer the
fifth item that I have is something
that's going to come to no surprise for
most of you this is the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer this gets so much
hype and I guess that you're probably
tired of hearing about it but it's so
good there's a reason for it if you have
lighter skin you know that the struggle
is real when it comes to bronzing
sometimes things just look money they
don't blend out they're just the wrong
tone they're too pigmented and I feel
like this kind of solves all the
problems it looks really warm in the pan
but on the skin it just gives a nice
assignment kissed kind of glow to the
face it shows up basically matte on the
skin but when you swatch this it does
have a bit of a sheen to it now that
does not mean as it's a sparkly or
glittery or anything like that it just
looks like skin this is my second one
that I've gone through and I've already
hit pan on it I have a backup waiting in
my drawer if I'm just doing my makeup
and I want something that I know it's
going to look great I don't have to
worry about blending out or just looking
crazy I especially have problems
blending things on my forehead because
my forehead is just I don't know if it's
big but I feel like I'm losing my hair
on the sides here like kind of cold
attacking and so I like to put bronzer
there but I find sometimes that can just
look really weird when I look back in
videos and it could be the lighting and
just everything mixed together but it
looks a little scary this one ever does
that to me so I just highly suggested it
once again these all I highly suggest so
so good oh yeah in a smell did you know
that it's all by coconut you probably
didn't but it smelled like coconut next
is probably the newest item that I've
been using that make sense this is the
item that I've used the least out of
everything I'm showing you today but
it's something that I absolutely love
and I just think it's going to be a
longtime favorites on and including it
this isn't a pan or anything but this is
the Urban Decay eyeshadow and illusion
this came in The Wizard of Oz palette
that Glinda the Good Witch won I was
going to declutter it if you didn't see
my declutter series always it link down
below but instead I popped her out of
the palace put it in one of the Urban
Decay single eyeshadow packaging and now
I use it as a highlight
I absolutely love it the way this looks
on the skin at least on my skin tone is
just perfect I'm wearing it today of my
highlights it gives this soft Sheen that
right into my skin makes me look radiant
and dewy without looking metallic it
doesn't emphasize texture it doesn't
look like glitter it's just so beautiful
I don't think you can find this so I'm
really sorry but I suggest looking for
eyeshadows in your collection that maybe
don't perform the best on your eyelids
that aren't brightening enough for you
aren't metallic enough I know a lot of
us like a really nice bright eyelid
shade and instead using those on your
skin and seeing how those work for you
that's exactly how this eyeshadow was it
just doesn't look good on the eye to me
like all over the lid it just kind of
looks like nothing but as a highlight
and like on the high points in my face
it just brings out the best and I love
it so much so if you can find it I guess
but it's not just try to find something
similar to that so that it will match
your skin tone and work for you for
being someone you talked a lot of crap
about highlighters I have two on this
list the next one is from Laura Geller
and this is the baked french vanilla
highlighter I have hit major pan I am
almost done with this item I am trying
to finish this up by the end of the year
and I'm definitely going to hit that I
suggested for anyone any age I think
this just looks so nice on the skin it
gives a nice glow but nothing again
that's metallic it's just definitely
more natural I really admire people who
look effortlessly beautiful and I feel
like this is something that would be in
their makeup bag it's kind of like this
secret weapon that people talk about
people know but it's just understated
and there's something about that that's
really sexy that makes me feel confident
and I really love that so I'd love to
pass it on to you guys not every day do
you necessarily need that highlight if
that's what you like you do you but if
you're looking for something that maybe
is a bit more subtle a bit more natural
but if you're looking for something
that's a bit more subtle and a bit more
natural this is definitely something you
should check out I have a few blushes
that I wanted to mention in this video I
was originally only going to mention one
but I just thought
thrown a couple extras the original
blush that I put in this tag was the
Clinique nude pop blush from their cheek
pop collection I wanted to mention this
because they don't talk about it a lot
on my channel but it's something I do
truly like as you can tell the flower is
being worn away it's definitely dirty
its use and abuse this is just such a
nice color on the cheeks who doesn't
have too much pink or coral it just adds
a little bit of slush but nothing too
noticeable
just kind of finishes a look it can go
with any eye look any lip color it's a
great neutral blush to have in your
collection I also really like the finish
of those blushes it's shimmery without
being too metallic so it just adds like
a nice radiance to your cheeks the next
one I wanted to mention was rocket or
from benefit I had a comment recently if
I recommend this blush as opposed to
other ones they were looking into it
and I do think it's a really nice blush
it's one of those blushes you could wear
every day again with any look I have
almost hit pan on this again I'm working
on hitting Pianist for the year and I
just like it it's easy to go to I don't
have to think about it and when you're
getting ready in the morning and you
don't have a lot of time you know time
to like sift through all your blushes
and be like does this color look good
with this eye I don't know this is just
a great go-to again it has a very
similar Sheen to it this one is probably
a bit more shimmery than the Clinique
one but it's still it's really great on
the skin and I don't feel like it
emphasizes any of my texture and the
last blush I wanted to mention was from
Laura Geller now this color in
particular I believe is discontinued or
with limited edition it's bora-bora
it's a beautiful peachy coral color I
just love Laura color blushes in general
you guys know that if you've been
following my channel
I love the baked formula it's something
that you can kind of add to your cheeks
you don't have to be scared by getting
too much color at one time this one has
a nice sheen to it it actually even has
a bit of sparkle but I really like it
it's a great one for summer it adds a
sheer pop of color to the cheeks I feel
like this is almost equivalent to like
popsicle lips but instead like popsicle
cheeks so I do highly suggest checking
out her blushes she does so many
different kits and that's how I suggest
buying her products because you really
can get a great discount but again her
products are just something
aren't raised about and should be
they're really good there are two more
products to go now this wouldn't be a
used in abuse tag if I wasn't mentioning
the modern Renaissance by Anasazi up its
high step it's rigged about and there's
a reason because it's awesome I love
this palette I have a lot of eyeshadows
in my collection I really love single
shadows but I really wanted to pick an
item you could just purchase all at once
and when I was looking through my
palette this is the only one I can say
with confidence that I've used and
abused and that I highly suggest to
basically anyone the formula is great
there blendable there pigmented I've hit
pan on three of the shades I brought
this with me on my trip to Vegas
recently these are the only eyeshadows I
brought and I felt like I was totally
fine with what I have in here you can do
something colorful you can do something
a bit more warm toned a bit cool toned
there's just so many options in here I
love that most of these colors that are
matte and then the shimmer shades are
just the perfect shimmer shades you have
a nice champagne you have a nice gold
and then this one here is a nice kind of
like bromby red it's absolutely
beautiful I definitely think it's worth
the money and honestly it's not that
expensive when you look at the price of
a lot of higher-end palettes I believe
this retails for $42.99 peg is going to
be a lip product now I don't love lip
rasta time I know I'm wearing like a
sassy red but in my everyday life and
just you know normally I really love lip
balms I really love just natural lip
colors and the only lip product that I
can think of that I have actually used
up and then repurchase is buxom dolly
these are not talked about by like
anyone I don't know why I prefer lip
products in this kind of like ten forms
there's just something about them that's
really easy and travel friendly I like
that the bullet itself is just thinner
it's almost act as a lip liner and a
lipstick in one you can get some nice
precision from it the most important
thing though what this whole lip product
is the color it just looks so good on my
skin tone it's wearable and just adds
definition to my lips without being too
much I don't feel self-conscious in this
I don't love something that's super
opaque but this one actually is opaque
it doesn't have any Sheerness to it the
color just works perfectly for me this
has in
Tootie's and the finish is more matte it
seems on my lips quite a long time I
definitely feel the tingle and smell and
taste the mint throughout the day these
are $20 you can get them at Sephora or
Ulta and I just love it so much and I
never thought I would say that about a
lip product alright guys that is
everything for my use and abuse
tag thank you so much for watching let
me know what some of your favorite items
are down below I would love to hear if
you think I'd really love something
based on items I talked about in this
video and thanks again I hope you guys
have a great rest of your day and I will
see in my next video
