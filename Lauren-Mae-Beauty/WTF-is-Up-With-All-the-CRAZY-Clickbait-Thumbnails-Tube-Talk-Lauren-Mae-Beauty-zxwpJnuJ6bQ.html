Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
talk video I'm gonna leave a playlist
linked down below this is a series I do
where I talk about different topics and
give you my opinions on them and we
talked about in the comments too so
today was kind of impromptu was not
expecting to do this one but I got a
comment on my last tube talk and they
mentioned talking about clickbait
thumbnail so I thought that'd be fun to
talk about because I feel like I have I
feel like I have some opinions on it
like I do want everything no but I think
that this is a really interesting topic
and I hear a lot of people talking about
this especially kind of as of late and
so yeah let's get into it first off I
want to say that I think there are two
categories of like considered clickbait
thumbnails they're the clickbait
thumbnails that are like showing like Oh
palette review and it looks like
negative but then they end up loving the
palette and to me that's clickbait
because you're like hello you made it
look like from the thumbnail that this
was like a negative situation that you
didn't like this palette and then it
ends up like it's the best palette ever
and you're raving about it and you love
it and you did that obviously just to
make people think like oh my gosh she
didn't like it let me click on that and
see what she has to say and that is
totally misleading I definitely don't
agree with that and then I think there
is the clickbait thumbnail that's I
don't necessarily think clickbait it's
just irritating
we're just irritated by it and I think I
might even be guilty of some of these
especially my passage will go into you
but you know it's just like all the
emojis are irritating to everyone at
this point like even if it is a palette
that you didn't like and you made a
nasty face in the thumbnail and had all
these like emojis I think people would
still consider that like a gimmicky or
clique baby thumbnail even if it's
accurately depicting kind of what you're
talking about in the video it's still
considered just back like people don't
like it so let's talk about thumbnails a
little bit as a creator myself let me
tell you that especially at first like
it is so hard to do thumbnails or it
feels like a lot of work i person
upload a lot I upload very often so I
put my time and energy into coming up
with content filming content editing
content and getting it up for you guys I
don't necessarily put a lot of my time
into creating fancy editing or editing
really nice thumbnails so you know
trying to find a solution where I can
get a thumbnail up that looks good and
people want to click it because that is
a part of YouTube like it's the first
thing people see is your thumbnail and
that's what determines if someone's
gonna click on your video or not and the
more news you get the more subscribers
you get which means more people are
actually watching your content and even
if you're not trying to like get a bunch
of numbers it's like it's nice that
people actually watch what you took time
to say that was really hard for me at
the beginning finding a way to come up
with a reasonable amount of time to
spend on thumbnails that was relatively
easy and I feel like I finally had a
place where I just have like my style of
thumbnail I'm fine with it
but I did kind of experiment for a while
and one of the things that I did do was
add the fricken emojis and I even like
was like dang I didn't think I'd be the
person adding emojis into my freakin
thumbnail and I think a lot of people
are like that man people who have those
emojis I'm sure in their head they're
like damn what am i doing my life I
wouldn't emojis in my butt it's hard
coming up with your own style of
thumbnail and finding something that's
eye catching and a lot of the times what
we do when it comes to trends is we
emulate those trends and there are
trends with thumbnails if you're a very
minimalistic channel or you do like more
minimalism videos it's a very aesthetic
thing to have a minimalistic thumbnail
and everyone kind of emulates that type
of thumbnail in that community if you
look at drama channels I feel like
someone comes up with like a thumbnail
that they're known for and then a lot of
people try to emulate that same
thumbnail so that way it looks like
their videos one if they're a bigger
channel but two it's kind of like people
now know that as like oh that's like a
drama channel type of thumbnail and I
think that's very similar to the beauty
community and right now the trend is to
have like emojis and like crazy faces
and also just in general the YouTube
community has just tried like one up
itself every freaking day
you know it's the world's this it's the
crazy thumbnails and that's where we're
at because everyone wants to get those
clicks in those views am I happy with it
definitely not I hate when it's the
first type of clickbait that I talked
about where they are doing something
where it's like come on that's not we're
talking about in the video that's like
completely wrong to me when it comes to
the one where it's just maybe irritating
to you it's just hard as a creator to
come up with a thumbnail like I don't
want to constantly be sitting smiling
and have floating product around me I
don't want to constantly be like sitting
holding up product in every thumbnail I
mean it's boring that's boring as well
so but I also for me personally don't
want to spend the time to edit a
thumbnail like imagine if I spent an
hour to two hours editing a thumbnail
picture I post a video a day I just
don't have time for that like click on
my video or don't click on it like
that's where we're at that point because
I'm just like I can't I I personally at
this point in my life and where I'm at
with YouTube like I don't want to put
the time into it but I know a lot of
people I'm gonna bring her up by name
cuz I feel like I see it all the time I
love her I love raw Beauty Christy so
much but I know a lot of people have
issues because it's like she's such a
cool real last person and then they
don't like that she has thumbnails that
are I guess clique baby or what they
consider clip baby it'll have that oh my
gosh and WTF and a lot of people have
that in the thumbnail you know talk to
you has it what she does have a series
and that's kind of become a lot of
people series and stuff and I think it's
just that's what's trending that's what
gets the clips and people are trying to
emulate that and not only in like a
greedy grabby money type of way it's
just like in a that's how humans and
society kind of works type of way and I
totally see that side and I hate it
myself but as a creator I also get it
like I just filmed a disappointing
products video right and so I'm sitting
there like putting my thumb down and
that but that's like what what do you do
it's an image to try to tell people what
you're gonna say in that video but in
one image and doing this
and making a bad face is how you do that
like that's definitely an easy one way
to do it I think they're just a lot of
people who have ruined it but just
because it's a negative video when you
do like a grumpy face or whatever
doesn't necessarily mean that its
clickbait beware it's bad because
sometimes videos deserve that thumbnail
you know what I mean
I could do without the the emojis again
I did the emojis myself I'm not trying
to say I'm above it I did it um I've
just like decided I don't want to do
them anymore and that they're not
necessarily my style and I like where my
style is now more and I've found a way
that works for me currently but who
knows you know again styles are changing
and things change and whatever so you
know as I change I might change up how I
do my thumbnails I do want to say though
to like I don't want to discount any of
the time and energy I know it takes to
maybe make some of these thumbnails even
if we're irritated by them they take a
lot more time than I do on my thumbnails
I definitely give them credit for that
and I will say to you know I think that
people are more likely to click on those
because they're trending and that's what
the big influencers do and bigger
creators on YouTube have more
professional or edited thumbnails so if
you don't have that type of thumbnail
and you have something that looks more
homemade or like just janky I guess
you're less likely to get clicked so as
you get bigger and you get resources or
you learn these tools and may it make
sense that you're like oh I want to make
them look like those other ones because
I want people to take my channel
seriously I want people to click on my
channel and so I get it but yeah I
really hope that that trend dies soon
like I hope that people stop doing just
the crazy googly eyes and the crazy like
facial expressions and emojis and the
WTF because everything isn't WTF like
it's just makeup it's not WTF anyway I
mean no hate I love raw Beauty Kristi I
suggest you check out her channel I
think she's dope person and she makes
some awesome content and let me know
this is kind of a short tube talk let me
know your thoughts on thumbnails in the
car
have you ever made of something before
have you ever tried to like even make a
like poster or something because let me
tell you it's just like hard if you're
not a graphic designer
coming up with a thumbnail can be like
what's going on what's happening how do
I do this so I think that again it makes
sense that people emulate what's popular
because it's just the easiest thing to
do and sometimes easy is good you know
what I mean like why work harder on
something that's so miniscule when it
comes to the content being to me more
important okay I'm done talking about
this I hope this tube talk was good
thank you so so much for watching guys
and I will see you in my next video bye
just so you know - I've like been
tempted to make a like thumbnail that's
like a million emojis and like thumbs
down but then I think people will just
like not get the joke and will just be
like but then you made the same
thumbnail so like it was a joke yeah
anyway that's everything thank you so
much for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
