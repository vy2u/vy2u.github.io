learned thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a tutorial actually
on a look that I saw on Instagram so I'm
basically going to be trying to recreate
this look I'm gonna have it on the
screen probably somewhere here whenever
I'm on Instagram and I see a picture
that really inspires me when it comes to
makeup i always screenshot it and i'm
thinking about doing this as like a
series throughout the year things that
inspire me or recreating looks that I
see on Instagram I kind of have done
this once and it get ready with me so
I'm gonna leave that link down below it
was just kind of like a more basic look
but still anyway so when I saw this
really cool look I was thinking I could
use the huda beauty obsessions palette
now I've only used this like very very
briefly so I thought this would be
really cool to basically use as the main
eyeshadows for this look I also was
inspired by the little like dots on her
cheeks and I have this tattoo Stamper
from milk makeup so I thought this would
be perfect to dot on the cheek so
without further ado let's just get into
it I do have my base makeup on already I
have some eyebrows on I have my eyes
primed we're basically just gonna get
into the shadow so really when I'm
looking at this picture there aren't any
like transition shades or anything we're
just gonna basically go in with full-on
color so the first thing I want to do is
start off with that yellow and that's
gonna be in the center of the pallet I'm
gonna be taking my e-40 brush and this
color is in the top portion of the brows
it's also like faded out this way and
it's also in the inner corner so we're
gonna work on the more diffused parts
because this is a fluffy blending brush
so we're not gonna get really precision
application with it and I'm just kind of
adding the tiniest bit to the upper part
of the brows because we can always go
back I'm just kind of getting an outline
for my look obviously I haven't ever
done this before and there aren't like
instructions on the Instagram page on
how to do it I'm just kind of going by
what I see I'm gonna go I guess a little
bit in the inner corner the fluffy
blending brush and this isn't
necessarily going to be exact
it's a recreation so I might take a few
liberties depending like my eyebrows I
don't have the same type of eyebrows as
the model in the picture so I'm not
really worried about matching those
exactly and
now I'm going to take this kind of like
at the tail of the brow and put it into
the temple area I want it to be
strongest at the brow and then fade off
and I did put a little bit of bronzer on
it didn't really look like there was any
in the picture but I gotta have some
bronzer
we have a great base starting out with
so next looking at the picture I think
I'm gonna work on the orange and that's
also focusing kind of in the top portion
of the brow I'm still gonna take kind of
like a blending brush but this one's a
lot denser and a bit smaller and we're
going to position this right here at the
brow and really punch that color up
it's definitely strongest year and have
it fade out obviously this probably
isn't gonna be wearable for most people
I think it's really cool though
I love these types of looks kind of
avant-garde artistry type of looks this
orange I feel like has a lot of pink in
it and then there is some orange over
here at the tail so I'm just gonna keep
it in the brow I'm not gonna go on to
the skin with it
actually I am going to take it into the
skin I'm a liar I was just looking at
the reference picture and it does take
it down a little so basically where the
arch of the brow is we don't really want
that so you can take it down there
tonight we're driving back to Arizona
and I'm not feeling very well so I'm
trying to bang out these videos I'm not
sure how all this stuff is going to be
uploaded so if you see me in this look
and then a different look and then back
to this look just know it's because I
pre filmed and I have certain videos I
kind of want up at certain times so yeah
and you can connect these but just
gently I really hope this look is gonna
turn out to be cuz I'm filming other
videos today but I'm gonna put my
glasses on if anything that'll help I
think next we're just gonna start with
the blue so I'm gonna go into this blue
here and I'm just adding a light layer
of this we're gonna go in and blend this
out with a fluffy brush with nothing on
it I'm just because I don't want too
much pigment at least not yet
to blend that out with a clean blending
brush I'm going in with the elf liquid
highlighter brush this is such a weird
brush it's like a weird stubby short
handle but I just recently got this I'm
just going to blend out those edges and
try to just diffuse the color I kind of
left the center of the lid open now you
know the picture is kind of just
editorial it's not like necessarily
straight on and like letting you see
everything so again I'm taking some
liberties with it or you know really
enhancing the parts that I thought were
really cool so next I'm actually going
to be stepping away from this palette
and I'm going into this BH Cosmetics
highlighter palette and black white and
I'm going to take the shade Queen it's
so funny that this is the color I've
been using the most from this palette
but I'm just going to be tapping that
kind of in the middle of that shade I
wanted something lighter and brighter to
really punch up that center part of the
lid and will probably come back to this
a little later now I want to add in some
of these purples and these pinks this
look is not very blended so I'm trying
my best to just kind of like dab things
and not get too technical with it
because it's easy to like want to make
it look more blended so I'm just using
this brush and dabbing it and it's also
going to be different on everyone's like
eye shape so keep that in mind
now with a bit more like a smaller brush
I'm going to go in with the darker
purple and I'm going to also go into the
darker blue and I'm just going to be
kind of mixing these and deepening up
where these two mix and you can kind of
get a little messy
like that looks like we don't want that
but that is actually what we want and
I'm really mostly just going into that
blue shade I'm gonna flip that brush
around and go back into that first
purple and just kind of work that on top
and start blending these colors oh yeah
baby oh here we go
I'm gonna go back in with this blue and
this blending side and just kind of
blend the blue over these other colors
and then last year we're gonna bring the
pink in and we're gonna blend this kind
of like down here this is very much like
a watercolor type of look so keep that
in mind and you really don't have to
make both sides like a hundred percent
even which is kind of nice
all right I'm going back in with the
yellow I really want to brighten up this
orange so I'm just putting this on top
because it's kind of pinky and I really
wanted to bring out more of that yellow
I'm also gonna reinforce this being the
really yellow side of this yellow kind
of situation going back
I feel very Cirque du Soleil right now
if you really wanted a pretty watercolor
look to I would probably suggest using
actual like cream pants I think that
would really give that effect easily
since they're not powders let's go into
the under eye I'm gonna take that blue
again and really just blend that kind of
messily underneath the eye and then I'm
gonna bring this darker blue into it
just to kind of deepen up that outer
corner now I'm gonna play around with
just kind of making sure there's
distinction instead of blending with the
different colors we just don't want it
to blend it I know the opposite of what
you mostly hear hmm this palette has
quite a bit of pigmentation so you
definitely can kind of go over colors
and make stuff happen
I'm gonna go in and pump up the orange
again just because I feel like that
color is being lost just a little bit
and I really want to like punch it in
right there so I'm gonna take something
this is the other end of the brush I
originally used with the orange I'm also
really gonna punch in the yellow on the
inner corner I just kind of had
originally blended it there but we want
to really saturate that section okay I'm
really liking the way this looks so far
it's definitely different I feel kind of
Lisa Frank but like Cirque du Soleil and
a little edgy before I move on I'm gonna
bring the blue kind of down a little bit
it almost looks a little like not
clownish but it goes down I'm also gonna
go back in with the queen color from
here and just re put that on the lid
just because I want to I'm also just
gonna use whatever's left on my brush to
blend the pink just farther I do have
quite a bit of fallout like here and
here from those blue colors so if you're
gonna do this look I highly highly
suggest doing well you can't really do
that eye makeup first so just really tap
your brush off and be aware of those
colors and you can also what to look
like this kind of incorporates them if
you really want to so they don't look
like mistakes I'm bringing a little bit
of this yellow into the pink and then
kind of to finish off the top here I'm
gonna go in with Electra and just add a
little bit of a yellow golden highlight
to the kind of center portion of the
brows where those oranges don't mix I
really like how much that added to this
look and I'm not quite ready to give up
the orange I'm going to add a little bit
more to that tail portion it's a lot of
like going back and forth guys
I'm really liking oil slick so we're
gonna move on to something I wanted to
do with the brows I did fill them in
slightly but I'm gonna go in with a
clear brow gel and really just brush
them up like wherever they are just
brush them out that's it I'm not gonna
have like that much shape I really want
them to just kind of be kind of crazy if
I had like an orange mascara I would
definitely be doing this with that so
far I'm the one thing I'm super happy
that I was almost not gonna do is
putting that highlight there I think
that really really tries this there next
I'm just going to put quite a bit of
mascara on I'm just using this line this
is the number seven lash impact ultra
you can use whichever one you have
though you could also put some really
cool falsies on I'm not going to because
it's not really my style but you are
free to do so and the clump here you go
with your mascara the better for this
look I like to take the end of
whatever's on the mascara wand like the
pointy edge and really put on product
that way and then you can always fully
through I'm just to lay down a lot of
product so my lashes are sufficiently
clumped with mascara I have a few spots
I'm going to clean up with a q-tip in a
couple of minutes but I thought we
should move on to the lips next on her
lips she's wearing a really pretty red
glossy lip I'm not gonna do a gloss but
I'm gonna use this lip liner from
colour-pop this is the color Lion King
and I'm gonna fill my lips in I might
give myself a little bit more of like a
mcdowell type of lip line nothing too
intense I wanted to still be pretty
wearable I'm not too charactery but yeah
I'm gonna fill my lips in with this
all right I really like the way that
looks to do just my own little bit of a
take on it I'm gonna take the pink from
here and I'm just going to put a little
bit on the Cupid's bow
definitely getting editorial here not
sure how much I like that maybe was the
wrong move so I might go back and like
lean on my lip line but we're gonna move
on for now I'm gonna take a hot pink
blush I'm gonna be using this one from
Clinique in the shade plum pop and I
might be adding some of that pink that
we used already on the eyes and I'm just
going to be brushing that all the way
back to the hairline and onto the
I don't think I want to add any more of
the pink like the hot pink just so that
way it's kind of a little bit lighter
I'm gonna go in and stamp on these
hearts I'm a little bit nervous about
having them like even and then I am
going to change my lip back to the more
precise lip line I want to leave this
part in there like I'm not gonna edit it
out this is like my creative process I
thought hey this sounds like a good idea
did it didn't like it and just let you
guys know the reason that I'm changing
my mind I feel like we have a lot going
on a lot of blown out water colors and I
think that contrasts nicely with a
really precise lip instead of having all
of it just look messy it just makes it
look more purposeful and more just
chosen like it's on purpose so I'm gonna
take the heart and I'm gonna stamp this
kind of just like on the lower people
maybe a little bit out almost like at
the top center of the cheek wish me luck
because this could could be the second
you know bust for this look if we don't
do it correctly so we have that one
and we have that one those are pretty
similar I'm pretty happy with them I
actually kind of like the lips now but
we're gonna still change them I think
it'll look overall better but I don't
hate them as much now that we have this
aspect which definitely makes us like a
very character very specific makeup look
I will be back with my made-up lip and
then I will show you the final product I
obviously change it up so I check off
the color and I really like the way my
lips look I just like put foundation
over them so I just try to give myself a
nude lip for that I use this NARS patina
velvet lip pencil and then I put the I
love Sarah
Kirby lip gloss on top of it which is
not my favorite but I found a way to use
it I did that because I just wanted it
to be a little bit more wearable and not
so costumey since I am gonna be wearing
it for other videos I didn't want to
have to like take the red lip off and
all of that so that's kind of my own
little spin on it one last thing before
we call this look done I decided that I
do want to highlight my face just a
little bit so I'm gonna go in with the
shade Elektra which is that yellow we
used right up there on the brow bone and
I'm just going to run a little bit down
the nose a little bit just on top of
this pink so it has a sheen to it the
tiniest bit on the chin a little up here
and into the yellow and I'm just gonna
tap a little on the center of the lip so
this is the final look guys I really
hope you enjoyed I think that I did a
really good job of like taking
inspiration a lot of color placement
from it but I made it my own obviously
these aren't circles their hearts I
found a way to incorporate that tattoo
pen which I think worked out really well
I did have a little bit of smudging like
from the pen itself over here and I just
kind of fix that with concealer overall
I'm really happy with this look I'm
super happy that I actually recreated it
I thought it was so pretty and I really
the way it looks it's so fun let me know
if you want me to keep doing this I mean
not all of them are gonna be so
avant-garde but some of them will
because that's really what I gravitate
to that's what I think is really pretty
I love color going back to the palette
we used I thought this worked out really
really well super pigmented
I thought they blended really nicely
they definitely made this look easy to
do we didn't have to build up the
pigmentation I was able to layer on top
of colors because they're so pigmented
even if I had a darker color down I
could put like a pink over it and you
can actually see it which was amazing so
I really like this palette I also love
the pink it's super bright and not too
dark which I love I'm gonna zoom you
guys in so you can see the final look
and that'll be everything for this video
