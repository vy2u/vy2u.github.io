Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm super excited because we're
gonna be continuing on my testing
testing 1 2 3 series and this video is
gonna be all about the wet and wild
flights of fancy collection I purchased
this off of the website the day it came
out which was May 2nd and I really
wanted to do this style review on this
box so if you haven't seen one of these
before I'll leave the playlist linked
down below but this is where I do a
first impressions I do a tutorial and
then I do a final review all in one
video I leave timestamps so you guys can
switch back and forth to what you want
these are a little bit of a longer video
but I really like having it all in one
video so you can go where you want to
get the information you want
I think first impressions are fun
tutorials are really great for teaching
and then at the end the product review
is gonna let you know what you want from
the collection if you want anything at
all how things performed over time in
different ways so with all of that let's
just get in to the collection I'm also
gonna have a section just for swatches
so if you want just swatches of the
products check the description for those
timestamps so this is what the
collection looks like there are quite a
few things in here this is just the box
that you can buy but there are other
things in here there's another lip scrub
there's another one of the glosses and I
think there's nail polishes as well I
think that might be everything in the
collection but this gives you a really
nice sampling of everything in here this
retails for $34.99 before I get into the
first impressions I'm going to just
insert some swatches here so let's see
what these swatches look like of
everything
all right so those are all the swatches
and I think for the first impressions
I'm gonna start off with the kind of
like priming aspects so there are two
different lip scrubs in the collection
this is the perfect pout lip scrub and I
have the shade pecker up and this is a
watermelon scented lip scrub it comes
with a little like top on it so the
product doesn't like get everywhere I'm
guessing it's super bright pink in there
and it smells like yeah watermelon oh
wow it's really tough I thought it was
gonna be a little bit looser packed so
I'm gonna scrub my lips first I hate
when you have like all the sugar all
over your like foundation and you're
trying to rub it off
it tastes pretty decent too alright so
it's pretty easy to remove obviously
because I don't have anything else
around my lips and a little bit of the
pink came off on the napkin but I didn't
feel like I like stained or anything my
lips feel hydrated they don't feel
greasy it's a pretty decent scrub I
think this retails for 399 what you
think is like a decent price it's not
that much product but honestly you
aren't just like blowing through lips
scrub so overall so far like that
another kind of like priming step this
is the wet and wild photo focus primer
water spray this is similar to the
smashbox one i'm guessing because this
is supposed to go on before you put on
any makeup it says on the bottom here
that it's called paradise potion so i
have not sprayed this on my face but I
did swatch some of this stuff because I
like couldn't wait guys I couldn't wait
it doesn't really have much of a smell
at all and the mister is really really
soft like I I feel like I got more on my
shirt honestly than I did on my face I
don't know what's up with that
yeah it's just super soft you don't get
like a ton of product you don't feel
drench which is kind of nice and I
didn't feel any like big chunks go on my
face I'm gonna let that sink in a little
bit something about this box that I
think is really really cool is that
they are donating $10,000 to a
foundation that's going to like help
save some hummingbirds here in LA I
believe which is so so cool yeah I
didn't even know that about the box
until I was like watching other people
are like oh my gosh that's amazing so I
think that's really cool I like that
it's a very inspired collection but then
it also has that aspect which is just
like extra on top of it another thing I
wanted to mention is that with the box I
got this pin if you guys don't know I
like love freaking enamel pins and I had
no idea but the box came with this cute
little hummingbird pin that says wet and
wild on it so that is just like
something so exciting for me personally
I have all these materials to show you
guys how I want to make this DIY like
banner essentially to hold my pins but
anyway it just so cool to like have my
love of pins plus my love of beauty all
in one and this just came with the
collection so that was just like this
extra exciting moment to me I was like
freaking out and like sent a picture to
sound yeah so going back to the spray my
skin doesn't feel really any different
shine wise I don't see you doing
anything so I'm not really sure about
that product I will have to get back to
you obviously with the end of this video
the rest of the items in here we have
some blushes
um some eyeshadow quads as well as lip
glosses in some liners so I'm going to
put on the rest of my makeup foundation
wise so that we can move in and test out
these other products all right so I have
my foundation done I put bronzer on and
I'm kind of like basically prepped for
the next steps so I'm gonna zoom Ascend
so we can start working on the eyes I'm
excited to do something hopefully fun
with these eyeshadows so there are three
different quads and with my first
impressions I like to do the one that's
kind of calling me the most and honestly
that's kind of the more neutral one I
don't know why but lately I mean I've
been kind of enjoying the neutral aspect
looks and just kind of like looking
flowy and more effortless I've just been
into that style lately as you guys just
saw like a green and blue crazy look on
my channel but you know what I mean
trying to get this open sometimes these
are like opening CDs I swear to you like
I know they have the perforated lines
but like come on it's so tough for me to
get them open anyway the quad I'm going
to be using today this is the stop
ruffling my feathers I finally have been
successful in opening this thing so this
is just like a really pretty kind of
monochromatic type of thing but I just
this is what I wanted to use so I'm
gonna go in with the transition shade
it's a matte color which i think is
wonderful and I'm just going to be
buffing that all into the crease I've
already primed my lids but I didn't
really set them with a powder so we'll
see how these show up
so far they're super pigmented I have
not used any of these shadows from their
like newly formulated stuff like I only
have the California roll palette which
is like in the old pans and that
collection is like two years old so I
haven't tried any of these and so far I
mean super pigmented and this was really
fast to get to this point the shadows a
little powdery in the pan but it's
nothing that bothers me I just like to
mention that for you guys because I know
that's like a thing and I'm just going
in and blending with a blank brush just
to hopefully get a better transition I
will say I mean this is my good eye and
this is my bad eye so keep that in mind
but overall I think that they blend it
out really nicely
I'm really happy so far this one's just
looking a little funky but I think
that's me more than anything this area
always gets kind of weird with this eye
so for the eyelid I think I'm just gonna
go pretty basic and I'm gonna go in with
the pink shade I'm gonna use the priming
setting spray to add a foiled effect to
the shadow so I'm just gonna spray my
brush this spray kind of like goes in a
circle like it gets everywhere around
but not the center so I'm gonna dig into
this pink I don't know if this is gonna
work yeah that's not working the primer
spray kind of sealed over the top and I
did not swatch this I dug into this with
my finger so that I could try to get
some pigment onto my finger I don't know
if that was how it was originally or if
it's just because of my putting of me
putting the primer spray there but it's
a beautiful shadow just kind of took a
while to get it on my eyeball
all right so that's what the look looks
like so far it's pretty eyes like this
golden iridescent to it which is
beautiful
but my pan is kind of like messed up
looking because I had to dig into it so
I'm not sure I don't think it's like a
bad first impression on that I just I
wanted this to not be like I didn't want
to get a glitter glue out and all that I
wanted it to be a little bit more
low-key but I will be trying that out in
a different way to see if I can get a
better effect with it I'm gonna try to
build up the transition shade into the
outer corner and just see if I can
deepen it up a little bit I do have some
fallout also from that pink shade but
again I was trying to put as much on my
finger as possible so I could get that
pigment onto the eyeball or eyelid
whatever I don't really like this look
so far but that's fine I'm gonna go in
with the brow bone color for the inner
corner that looks pretty nice it's kind
of this like weird cool tone color but I
don't find that it's looking weird on
the actual eye just in the pan it looks
like it might be a little like dark or
just something for underneath the eye
I'm gonna go in with the copper color
which is supposed to be your crease
color and just blend that underneath the
lash line
and then I'm going to take a little bit
of the brown just on the outer corner to
tie that in I'm going to try to take a
pencil brush and really pack that orange
on
I'm also adding a bit more to my lids of
that same pink shade okay so that's kind
of the I look right now without anything
else so I'm going to put some liner on
I'm gonna put some mascara on I'll come
back and let you know what I think so
far all right so here is the final I
look with like all of the liners and
mascara and everything on so far I just
don't love this eye look I'm not saying
this isn't necessarily bad I think the
matte blend it out well I do like the
colors in it I just don't love this eye
look I don't know if it's just me today
or what obviously we will be testing
this out more but I mean I used every
color in here not necessarily the exact
way they suggest but I mean that's all I
used for the eye look and it's just like
okay you know like I just wish I had
like maybe more sparkle or more pigment
or just something but again I'll try
with glitter glue and with different
things so far for $2.99 I still think
it's good but yeah well we'll see let's
move on to blush and see what we can do
with that there are three different
colors I'm gonna use one of the two
lighter ones I think I'm gonna go with
the pink one since this look is pretty
pink this is the shade don't flutter
yourself I did swatch I think one of
these blushes and these are all very
very shimmery you can tell from the
packaging like that they're gonna be
pretty shimmery so I'm excited to see
what this looks like alone but I think
you know off of just like what I think
this will work well as looking at it in
person which it's impossible to get this
tag off anyway I think these might work
best as blush Stoppers and if you have a
darker skin tone you could maybe even
use these as like a highlighter because
they're pretty shiny although they did
include a deeper tone blush in here
which i think is really awesome so let's
get into this pink shade it does have
such a strong reflect so I'm just gonna
go in with an angled blush brush swirl
it around I do get a little powder kick
up I'm just gonna apply it like I would
any blush
so you can see the shine going on it's
really pretty actually I didn't know if
I'd like it this much honestly and I'm
gonna bring whatever is left over on my
brush just kind of like up because I'm
not gonna use a highlighter today
because of how shiny this thing is I'm
gonna try to put a little bit of this on
my nose
alright so first impressions I think
it's beautiful it has like this gold
shift to it this is definitely going to
accentuate texture I can see like all my
pores and everything it's basically like
a pink toned highlight honestly that's
how she Marie it is so I think it's
pretty I like it for this look but this
is definitely not something I would wear
every single day so just keep that in
mind if you're someone who prefers matte
blushes this is probably not something
you're gonna like I'm definitely gonna
have to wear it more but off the bat I
don't think this is something that's
going to be like a favorite it's really
beautiful I like the price point it's
nice it's just a definitely a specific
look for the collection there are two
different eyeliners that came out one of
them is this gold and I kind of want to
do some like gold freckles or something
kind of like that on my face today so
that's what I'm gonna do with this oh
god are we nervous cuz I'm very nervous
about this I'm trying to do like small
flux as well as like bigger ones alright
not sure how I like that I really don't
do like freckles ever so I don't know if
my technique is very good also I just
used the applicator on here so yeah not
sure I feel about that but it's a
pigmented okay we only have one more
thing left for the collection kind of
crazy so we have four different lip
glosses here I believe there are
technically five in the collection
though I think I'm going to stick with
the lighter two again for this look
specifically and see how they go I have
swatch these two they have quite a bit
of pigment to them but they didn't seem
too sticky but we'll see on the lips I
think I'm gonna go pink you guys know me
I love pink so let's see yeah that's
pretty
I've never used a wet'n wild gloss
before these don't feel sticky at all
there's no like taste but this scent is
a little off-putting but I don't smell
that scent on my lips I don't taste that
scent on my lips I think it added color
but it's not like overly opaque it's
kind of that perfect in-between
it feels like a little bit thick but
moisturizing and again like absolutely
no stickiness so I'm excited for these
I'm gonna zoom us out to show you guys
the final look and yeah give you a
little bit of final thoughts and then
we'll move on to the tutorial overall I
have to say I was really excited for
this collection it was something like I
knew I wanted to purchase from the
moment I saw releases of it and based
off of just first impressions honestly
so far this seems like a collection
that's really beautiful I like the
packaging I like the promotion I like
the ideas behind it but it's just kind
of like okay like there's nothing super
wrong with anything so far but there's
nothing I super love and so far I'm just
like oh my gosh yes I think my favorite
part so far are the lip glosses I I like
them I think they go on really nice I
can see myself using them everyday the
blushes are nice but they're not an
everyday product probably for me will
see as I test them out and then the
eyeshadows I was really excited for but
I don't know I'm just I'm not
overwhelmed with this look it's just
kind of like okay yeah so we'll see how
I can make these work as I use them
longer as I get used to the formula and
I might bring in some other shadows and
see if there's something that maybe
isn't standalone but you know using one
shade here there works the price point
of these items is just so great that's
what I love about the wet and wild stuff
so we'll see as we go and other than
that let's just get into the tutorial
and see what I create I don't even know
what that's gonna be hey guys so this is
going to be part 2 of the testing
testing 1 2 3 with the wine wild flights
a fancy collection today we're gonna be
doing a tutorial and I know I want to
use this quad because it's like the most
colorful one I do have most of my face
done but before we zoom in I thought we
could just add the blush so you guys
know there's three blushes in the
collection and today I'm gonna be using
the more peach one when I first got this
I felt like it looked more Orange but
like now it's like more Brown golden
orange I don't know why my perception of
it changed but it totally has I've you
this on my eyes since the initial like
first impressions and it looked really
pretty so I'm going to be putting this
on to the cheeks as my blush we're gonna
really accentuate the peaches today
that's the gloss we're also gonna go for
and I will I will zoom in so you guys
can see this up close because these are
such glowy blushes that honestly I feel
like more than anything what shows
through is the kind of shimmer and not
necessarily the color so they're
definitely going to be only for like a
specific person alright so let me zoom
in so you guys can see that on the skin
so this is the blush on the cheeks it's
pretty but it's not super blushy you
know so I did add some highlighter since
you've seen me last and it's kind of
intense so yeah we're going for a really
glowy look as well I guess today so
let's get started on the eyes we're
gonna go in and I think I'm gonna try to
stick to just using this quad again
today just because even though you can
get all of these things from the
collection it doesn't mean that you're
gonna pick up every single quad and I
kind of want to just test myself to see
what looks I can create without dipping
into other colors so we're going to be
putting that Brown in the crease of the
eye and that's going to work as our
transition as well as our crease color
so we're gonna kind of buff and build it
up and now that I have that blended out
I'm gonna take a more just slightly
dense and tapered brush and I'm gonna be
putting it really into the crease to
define that socket alright and we are
moving on to the glitter glue I'm gonna
be putting this over my whole lid so for
the color scheme I'm going to be putting
the like white gold shade in the front
portion and then I'm going to blend that
into the purple and then we're gonna
have the blue on the bottom lashline and
I did bring that glitter glue
pretty far out on the outer corner
because that purple is what's going to
be defining the crease so I want to make
sure it's gonna have some good hold so
first we're gonna go in with the lighter
shade I'm just using a shader brush and
I'm going to be putting this dry and see
how it kind of holds to the glitter glue
which i think is nice cuz I don't want
it to be super cut crazy or anything I
want it to be soft and I think that
worked really nicely so far I think that
looks pretty so I minutes flip this
brush around and go in with the purple
and we're just going to be placing this
closest to the lash line on the outer
half
I'm just working it in the outer corner
and working to get up a nice blend
hopefully
not sure how this one's really working I
can definitely tell it's sticking nicely
to the glitter glue and we're the most
pigmented it looks pretty but it's
proving a little difficult to blend out
so we'll see I'm just gonna keep working
it and blending it out in that outer
corner all right so as you can see with
placement I have it in a little bit more
than like halfway instead of just on the
outer third and I did that because I'm
gonna be going back over with the white
so hopefully we can get a nice blend and
it can kind of be like a lighter purple
in that center of the lid at this point
I'm also gonna be taking a small fluffy
brush and putting it into the purple
just so we can start working on blending
this into the brown and it looking just
more blended and seamless I'm gonna try
stamping on the purple with my finger in
the outer corner just to get the most
pigmentation and then just as kind of
like one final ditch effort I'm gonna
spray with the setting spray the primer
spray and see if I can kind of get a
little bit more build up of that purple
just in the outer corner this definitely
took a little finessing but for the
price it's not too bad I'm just gonna
sweep some fallout away and so far
that's the eye look next for the lower
lash line I'm gonna go in with a teal
color this one is from Clarins
but you could use anything you have and
I'm just gonna build up on the lower
lash line so that we have some
pigmentation there for that blue teal to
stick to and then I'm just gonna blend
that out and next we're just going to go
on top of that with the eyelid shade and
we're gonna buff that under the eye
all right and I'm not putting any other
color on the bottom lashline I'm just
gonna use that blue for my inner corner
I'm just gonna take the highlight at you
so you can use whatever you want you
could also use the lid shade I just
think it'll kind of complement nicely
and be something different than what's
already on the lid and this is color
pops flexitarian all right for my liners
I'm gonna put black on my tight line I'm
gonna put white on my waterline and I'm
gonna put my perversion mascara on so
I'll be right back and then we can do
the lips all right so here's the final
look with the eyes I think this look is
really pretty I think ultimately the
purple ended up blending out really
nicely it just took a little bit more
finagling but I think the star of the
show is definitely that blue I want to
do a look with just that blue on the lid
I think it's beautiful with that though
let's get into the lips so I have the
four different lip colors here I think
I'm just gonna go peachy I know that's
like so basic but maybe I'll mix these
two together I want something light
really let the eyes shine
so I put the lighter peach which is
featherless in on the whole lip and then
I'm gonna put this one kind of like how
rob Beauty Christy does or she'll put
this on like the darker color on the
inside oh well it kind of worked that
kind of worked right yeah that is the
final look guys I'm gonna add just a
little bit more blush see if we can get
some of the color to come off no I just
look shiny okay well I hope you guys
enjoyed the tutorial I'm just kind of
blending that out I will zoom out so we
can see the final look all right so I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I
think it's really pretty look I'm really
happy with it it's fun but I feel like
because we have that neutral color on
the lid it's still kind of wearable
right it's not like as crazy as it
could've been
anyway let's get into the final reviews
of the product which is gonna be next so
I'll see you there alright hi guys we
are onto the last portion of this test
tube testing one two three video I'm
just gonna say up front I've been
testing this stuff for a while it's
taking me a while to like come to terms
with my thoughts on this collection
because if I'm being honest I literally
don't love anything I don't hate
everything but there's nothing in this
collection that I'm like oh I love it
nothing yeah so that makes me really sad
I was really excited for this collection
looking at promo pictures I knew it was
something that before it released I was
gonna buy I made sure I bought it like
right when it came out and all of that
so um I'm a little sad I was also kind
of burned by the Gothic graphic
collection although I will say there are
items in that collection that I feel
like are really good so at least I got
some things I enjoy whereas this one I
feel like I am making a lot of it work
so let's just get into my thoughts on
the products and I'm gonna let you know
if I'm gonna keep them if I think I'm
gonna pass them on you know just my
thoughts it's a review so let's start
off with the blushes because these are
the things I was the most excited for
the issue with these is that these are
so freakin shimmery they're so shimmery
and personally the two lighter shades
which are the ones I was most excited
for don't show up on my skin tone like
they don't show the color so this is the
more like warm orangish one it's kind of
coppery and then the lighter pink one
they just give off a sheen
only way I can get even the slightest
amount of color payoff is if I really
dig my brush in and really go heavy on
the cheeks and if you do that because
these are so freakin glowy then you look
like you literally just put highlighter
like all over your cheek like metallic
highlighter highlighting all your
texture yeah so I like to use these more
light handed but then I'm literally just
putting the shimmer there's absolutely
no color payoff um so they just don't
work and I will say that I prefer a
matte blush but I can get down with a
shimmery blush I can get down with
something that's glowy but these don't
have enough color payoff to make them a
blush they honestly work better as
highlighters so I will probably keep the
lighter pink one and work it that way I
think these would be pretty as blush
toppers so you can actually have the
color of the blush you put on before and
then just use this to like up the
shimmer aspect but they are very
metallic I just I just didn't really
like them the only one that shows up on
my skin is this one it is the one I'm
wearing today but I don't prefer this
color and I find that you know you have
to be very light handed still and again
it's just very shimmery I think this
might look really pretty on darker skin
tones though but really honestly none of
these are my favorite none of these are
like my new blush that I've been using
all the time I force myself to reach for
all of the items in this collection the
more I use them the more I had to be
like okay I need to use that because I
need to test it out and that's not fun
that's not fun at all so bust and I've
had that problem with wet and wild
blushes before I know a lot of people
love the ombre blushes but to me I
bought all of them because I was so
excited and they all don't show up on my
skin tone and I'm pretty fair so yeah no
no I don't suggest alright next let's
talk about the lip glosses I like these
fine but I don't think they're anything
special I prefer the two lighter shades
so there's like owl which is the cool
tone pink and featherless which is the
warmer shade they're pretty I think
they're nice I have to be careful I
don't like putting too much of this on
because there's kind of like this white
base and I feel like you can see every
little crack and like everything about
your lips that you don't necessarily
want so I use a very light amount
this and I kind of like shared out with
my finger and everything but I can't
make these work
I like the dough flood on them it's kind
of like that flat paddle on both sides I
think you get enough product on there
these are very comfortable on the lips
so I love that they're not sticky but
they're not gonna last a super long time
I don't know they're just they're fine
the scent on these is also like nothing
but also tying a tiny bit chemically so
I wish that they had just some type of
like neutral scent whether that's like
vanilla or just something something
sweet or fruity or I don't care just
something other than that because it
just makes them seem cheap the packaging
is cute but these are the only two that
I really like the other ones are fine
they have a similar formula
I just don't prefer a darker gloss so
this is more preference a lot of the
stuff is still the same I don't like to
put too much of this on and then this
darker berry I just feel like it kind of
gets everywhere and I don't love that so
I will be passing these two on keeping
these two and yeah they're just like
okay I honestly wanted a little bit more
and I wanted them to be just a tiny bit
more glossy too they don't really give
too much of a shine on the lips probably
the absolute most dissapointing are the
eyeshadows I am very disappointed in
these I struggled you saw me struggle in
the two like demos that I did my least
favorite one is flock party this one
sucks so much I hate to say that because
I know it looks so promising the colors
look so beautiful in the pan but I just
like it's just useless to me the
transition shade is fine if you want the
lightest bit of like a peachy orange to
me this is like the first transition and
then you do like another one and you're
really getting that soft blend this
blends fine it's it's whatever but it's
not going to work for that many people
and then when it comes to the other
eyeshadows in here the brow bone one is
fine but these two I literally look at
how much I had to dig my brush into
these just to get the tiniest and I mean
tiniest amount of product on to my
eyeballs
there was no saturation it just is a
weird formula it's very dense it's hard
to pick up on a brush it's hard to apply
with your fingers like it's hard to get
them out of the
pan on to your eyes actually looking
good they don't foil well they just get
hard pan like they just they suck like
they suck so much with all of them to I
feel like there's just not enough
dimension to really create a really nice
I look for it only having four shades in
here I think the one that does the best
at creating dimension is this one
because the transition shade is a bit
darker but even that it's not that
freaking dark like I just felt like I
wasn't getting enough depth on my eyes
to make something pop and I don't even
like to go super dark on my eyes this
one I struggled with which this is the
stop ruffling my feathers quad I did
this in the tutorial and I just I
struggled with it there I can't get
these to foil they swatch decent and so
it seems promising but honestly just not
worth even $2 or $3 yeah the hostel at
coaster baby quad is probably my
favorite one the blue actually is
amazing I really do like the blue when
I've used it on the lower lash line
it's just looked so nice I feel like I
can actually pick that color up with my
brush which is like it shouldn't be a
miracle but it is with these colors the
purple gave me the same issues as the
like burgundy in the other quad I liked
this transition shade for my skin tone
but again it's not a ton of depth the
brow bone shade is fine but nothing
special it's just like this satin you
know I don't know I just I feel like
they could have done better and honestly
some of these pans are really big like I
wish they would cut this in half and
almost this in half and give us two more
shades so they can really give us a full
color story and also enough colors and
finishes to create a one eye look I
found that like none of these would be
something like if I had them on choice I
would not use just the quad to make an
eye look I did that in the videos but in
real life like when I was using these I
would bring in so many other shadows to
make looks work for me so I'm probably
gonna keep this one because I think it's
pretty but the other two I mean I just
have so many better colors in my
collection with
shadows they're not anything special and
then the formula just isn't it isn't
fair
all right continuing on with my like
rant I guess of a review we have the
primer water spray and I just don't like
this it doesn't do anything at all I
hate that this doesn't have a nice smell
to me it smells just like not good like
everyone else says it doesn't have a
scent but like to me it doesn't smell
good it's almost a slightly chemical as
well I thought the sprayer on this was
pretty nice at first but the more I use
it the more I just feel like I'm
spraying spraying spraying and not
getting anything on my face but then
I'll touch my chest and it's just
soaking what there also is one tiny part
of the spray that does kind of splurt
out a little blob and so you know that's
not the best either the one bit of this
that does get on my face seems to be a
little bit bigger so I just don't think
it's worth the price there's nothing
about it like not even sensory that I
can enjoy and I just don't feel like it
does anything moving on to the scrub the
scrub is fine it's just not my personal
preference this is scrubby and can
definitely scrub your lips but I just
don't prefer how this is I feel like
this is some bigger granules of sugar
submerged in almost like a lip balm like
a moosie lip balm and then you put that
on I wish it wasn't dyed pink although I
don't find that being a big issue it's
just not my favorite I prefer the one
from lush I prefer a looser one with
more with smaller granules that are is a
little bit more dense the smell is nice
it's just it's fine like I don't think
you'll hate it but I definitely don't
love it it's not something I want to
like buy a bunch of yeah no and we're
onto the last things which are the
liners and honestly these are just not
my preference so I think these are a lot
better than the liners I've gotten in
the past like the Gotha graphic they at
least you know look nice and I do think
that they're pigmented staying power is
fine these aren't as like creamy and
thick as the Gotha graphic ones which I
appreciate the gold one is nice for like
some detailing work like I liked putting
it on the inner corner like on the first
half of the lower lash line so I'm gonna
keep the gold around I did have to build
up the color a little bit if I really
wanted it
super golden but overall these are fine
I just don't like do my eyeliner like
this I don't even wear eyeliner much so
for me they're kind of a bust but if you
like the Wet n Wild mega line or liquid
eyeliner formula I think you would like
these if these colors seemed like
something you'd enjoy yeah so these are
fine just not for me alright guys so
that's my review I know that it is like
not positive and I'm sorry but I just
didn't enjoy it I bought this with my
own money too so it's a little it's sad
for me as well okay I wanted them to
work so much I have to say that my
favorite thing I got was the pin and
this is like limited edition and I
didn't know I was gonna get it and I
collect pins so that is the most
exciting part I'm also happy some of the
money went to the Allens hummingbird the
packaging was pretty but when it comes
to the products this really disappointed
me and and honestly I think there's just
like some soft spot in my heart for the
white and wild collections like this
because they're still a part of me
that's excited to see what they come up
with next but I think I might have a bit
more of a critical eye because I feel
like I've been burned twice and so we'll
see what they come up with yeah I don't
know I'm just disappointed I really
wanted those blushes to work and I
really wanted the lip glosses and even
the eyeshadows like even though those
are colors that I have in my collection
if those are good formulas like I would
still be really happy but it's just
something about them doesn't it doesn't
work it doesn't not work and I like the
white wild eyeshadow formula I have the
California roll palette which I really
enjoy I used to have the walking on
eggshells which I really enjoyed as well
these ones just were different and I did
not enjoy them okay so that is
everything thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed let us know
what you thought of the collection if
you picked anything up in the comments
down below I would love to know your
thoughts I did watch some first
impressions and I felt like overall it
was like half and half like they liked
half of it and then they didn't like
half of it and then the only other
review that I did watch was Kaylee baute
and that was actually after I had
already came up with my opinions and I
was like you know what I just want to
know what she has to say because I feel
crazy up in here and literally we have
like the same thoughts on everything so
yeah it's just it made me feel less
crazy cuz seriously I was like using
these eyeshadows
like questioning like am I can I put
eyeshadow on is it me and that's not to
say that I didn't create beautiful looks
like I feel like the looks came out fine
but they were way too much work and if I
had different products they would have
been easier it would have been more
pigmented and I feel like even more
beautiful than what happened with these
ones so anyway that is everything I'm
gonna leave the reviews that I did see
down below if you want to check those
out as well and I will see you my next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
