learn thank you so much for watching
today I have a new type of video I don't
know if this is gonna be a series but
it's definitely a thing I want to start
implementing with certain products but
this is gonna be a series I call testing
testing one two three I know it's really
short and catchy
I bought the Gotham graphic went wild
collection yeah the whole thing cuz I
couldn't help myself it's so pretty
and so I came up with the idea to do a
first impressions which is like the one
part so I'm gonna do first impressions
do a look use as much of it as possible
I'm gonna come back a second time after
I've used it some more and do another
type of tutorial or just something
showing you the products and then I'm
gonna come back a third time and let you
guys know my final thoughts on all the
products so all that is gonna be in one
video though so you can get all that
information at once we get to have the
fun trying it out and then the real part
where if it's good or not so I hope you
guys enjoy this it's gonna take a little
bit more time to get these up still cuz
it's like three separate filming days
and in between those days isn't
necessarily only three days so we'll see
how it goes let me know if you like this
idea anyway let's get into the wet and
wild stuff this is the Gotham graphic
collection like I said I have seen
reviews on this already I know Jeffrey
started when I didn't watch that one I
saw Jay kisses and I also saw Tori or
biohazardous beauty's review of this so
they definitely saw those reviews after
I ordered this I just couldn't help
myself this cost $39 to get all of the
products and I think it's really cool
that you can kind of buy it like you
know the PR style it's only 40 dollars
for all of these products and I
definitely think that if you aren't into
this you should just pick up the few you
maybe want I just decided to take the
risk so I'm hoping at least that many
products in the amount of money at least
payoff for me I don't know I think it'll
be fun
it was just something fun and
inexpensive to get to try a bunch of
product this collection is like an anti
unicorn situation like they want to do
holographic but not in the fun cutesy
unicorn way and so they did something a
little bit more like the pastel Punk
pastel goth you know what I'm talking
about woo lots of highlighters in here
there's a whole set of lip products
which look a little scary and then there
are some liquid eye shadows which I'm
really excited about I'm gonna show you
swatches of all these products
guys can see them with some music and
then I'm gonna get started on using me
so let's get into it
we're gonna get started I have a bass on
today but I did not set it with powder
because I knew that this collection came
with a cream highlighter this is the
highlighting stick in the shade hello
darkness my old friend um no it's just
hello darkness it's really really pretty
it's a purple like holographic you know
duochrome kind of stick it reminds me of
the milk one it also reminds me of the
new Urban Decay one I think I don't know
I'm gonna try going straight onto the
skin from this stick this definitely
does like jiggle around it's not the
most like Lux packaging and I'm just
gonna blend that out with my finger I'm
using this as like a base I kind of have
an idea of what I want to do for this
look using as many products as I can I
definitely leaves a bit of purple on the
other side I'm going to just take my
finger and dab because I did get some
product on the end of the stick alright
so I put this product on all the places
that I normally would highlight first
impressions I think the color is really
pretty it's just a little bit greasy
I prefer applying it with my finger like
putting on my finger first and then
tapping it on the skin instead of going
straight in with a stick it did tend to
pick up my BB cream I think it's pretty
but I do think that the texture of the
milk one I have swatch that in store
it's just more of like a cream to powder
I like that texture better than this but
obviously there's a huge price
difference so let's move on next I'm
going to finish up my face so I'm going
to powder really fast I'm gonna put on a
bronzer and a blush and then we'll come
back and do highlighter together and
I'll see you in a second alright so I
have my face down I'm actually gonna
zoom it in a little bit so I can show
you guys I just don't like the way it's
looking after putting powder on it I
don't know if it's because again it took
some of that foundation underneath it
off or what I just it's not my favorite
it looked fine without the powder so
it's something that if you have really
dry skin and you're just going to put
this on and not really powder I think
I'd be pretty but I don't know it's not
my favorite product so far so that
it's fine it just doesn't look the best
to me but anyway um let's move on I'm
gonna just keep us in this zoomed in for
the next port I'm just gonna keep as
this zoomed in for the next part there
are three different highlighters that
come with this collection two of them
are the mega glow in the pressed powder
form this one here is the shade purple
ashes which has like a purple and like
sparkle to it definitely has glitter in
it and then the other one is white Raven
and I think this is the one I wanted to
use today because I think it'll
complement nice off the other duochrome
we're using but they do have a loose
powder 1/2 this is moon tears and this
is the one I think that I'll actually
like like the most but I think I'm gonna
save that one for something else just
because I want to see how this plays off
that duochrome since this is also dual
chrome I'm gonna go in just with my
normal highlighting brush and pick this
up this does not have glitter in it
unlike the other one oh yeah
although this looks white in the pan it
definitely gives you that like pink
purple shift once you have it on the
skin I'm really sorry if I sound stuffed
up it's because I'm I'm sick I don't
know what happened to me alright I like
this one a lot I think it's really nice
I love that it doesn't have the glitter
in it so this one so far is a good first
impression I will definitely be using it
it's not something that different I have
the moonchild palette I have the
alchemists palette from Kat Von D and I
also have the BH Cosmetics black light
palette so it's not anything new to my
collection but it's really pretty and if
you want something that's singular and
you want something that's affordable I
think it's nice I guess while we're this
zoomed in we'll just go straight into
the eyes I already have them primed and
set so we're going to just build up a
couple base shadows because we have some
really fun liquid eyeshadows to use I
thought it only seemed right to use the
pastel goth with this palette so we're
gonna go in and lay down a transition
with the shade meow
and I'm kind of going for like a purpley
grey I don't know more cool toned look
we'll see how that works out
I'm just going to be blending this into
the crease and building up a bit of a
transition
that purple and I decided that I'm
actually gonna take that Meowth color
just all over the lid as well so that
shadow the cream shadows has something
to hold on to not hold on to go on top
of is what I meant I like the way that
looks so I'm gonna go in with the deeper
purple which is the shade dope it's a
lot more cool toned and I'm going to
just be putting that into the outer
corner and just kind of deepening up and
giving some depth to that outer part of
the eye and then I'm just gonna go back
on the outer edge and take that Meowth
the first shade we used and just kind of
blend out any edges and make sure it
looks nice and seamless I decided I'm
gonna use this highlighter and I'm gonna
put this into my brow so I'm gonna take
some and just kind of flick it up into
the brow just kind of to give a little
bit of fun I don't know it doesn't add
too much but just something definitely
added a lot of glitter and not that much
pigment and then also something weird
about this is like it almost looks gray
like look at that that looks great and
then it'll look pink depending on the
light so like the pigment in it is
darker so it doesn't really work as a
highlight I don't think this would even
work as a highlight on my skin even if
it was like a fun color it's time to go
in with the cream shadow I'm so excited
so I think for sure I'm gonna use this
one which is very similar to tonic from
urban decay or black light from makeup
geek this is the color goth tears it's
so pretty I love this and so I know I'm
gonna use that and then I'm probably
gonna use one or two of these shades
either in the inner corner or just to
kind of like spice it up I will be doing
my second look when I try these out with
this so stay tuned to that that'll be
the next thing so I'm gonna go out with
got tears first and going straight in
with the applicator and I'm gonna
actually rub a little bit off the
applicator just so I can get more
precision application and just put this
on the first part of the eyelid
so that's what it looks like with one
layer I'm gonna let that dry and I think
I will try doing a second layer just to
see how it builds up and well I don't
know if I'm gonna use the other color I
think I might keep it kind of nice and
purple feel like my nose looks like so
textured and irritated right now I do
not know what's up with that okay second
layer let's go in I did kind of looking
above the crease cut crease so I'm gonna
let that kind of dry once again and then
I don't know I guess I have to do some
liner but I'm gonna deepen up the eye
shadows a little bit more just to give
it a little bit more depth on the outer
corner so I'm gonna let that dry once
again I'm will be back so right now I'm
just gonna deepen up this outer corner
and I'm gonna make sure to blend out
with that meow color overall I do like
this I think it's really nice it's very
similar to the color pop ones it's more
glittery after it dries and it does look
a little textured on the eyelid but I
find with all the cream shadows I've
used it's what it looks like
super pretty though a really easy fast
fun way to get some fun color so I'm
excited to try out the other colors I
think they look really cool the only
thing on this side I didn't blend I
don't think as good as I could have with
the shadow before it set and they do set
so if I could go back I would change
that but you live and you learn
so for eyeliner today I think I'm
keeping with the purple theme and I'm
gonna go on with this one this is the
shade black butterfly you don't look
that great and I also hope I'm not used
to using a liquid liner like this so
it's going to be all types of scary so
I'm going to speed this up and hopefully
we do an okay job doing some type of
liner and look with this
all right so I did the liner I think it
looks not that great I'm not really
found of this liner at all and I'm not
really I'm scared of the other liners
honestly from the reviews I saw and how
this performed it just didn't go on that
great I wish it was more pigmented sorry
my eyes are closed I'm trying to like
let these dots dry I don't know I think
also it's like it's not that dark to do
anything so I definitely want to try
this with like a really light look and
just do the liner as like the main focus
and see how that works honestly I think
that I will probably use it more for
like this type of thing like dots and
just not actual eyeliner I also just
don't think I like eyeliners like this
because I just get it all my lashes it
kept getting on my lashes and so
irritating so potentially some user
error because I don't normally use
liners like this but I don't think these
are worth the money I don't think you
should get them
I'm still pretty proud of the way it
looks for my skill but I just think like
it got kind of chunky here to build up
enough to make a color show so yeah
probably just don't just no good for my
inner corner highlight I'm gonna put on
a little bit of this cream shadow and
and this is the lightest one in the
collection in pure intention and I'm
going to be putting that on my inner
corner I like putting it on the back of
my hand and then going in so I can get a
better blend but just to kind of add
some fun I feel like I've been wearing
so much glitter lately I'm gonna do
mascara now and then I'm gonna come back
and we'll finish this off with the lips
and we'll see what my thoughts are
alright so I have my eyes done I will
say my mascara went on more like clumpy
and spiky because there was so much like
liner in my lashes there are lots of fun
colors in this collection when it comes
to lip products I have seen swatches and
again they're pretty sheer I want to go
with the grey one today I don't know why
that's just the one I'm really wanting
to try the rest of them
kind of fun though the pink one is the
most wearable this is wicked pink I
don't know I think I want to do great oh
I think that looks fun this is the shade
gunmetal heart I haven't even hope into
this one yet the other stuff like I
could not resist I have to like at least
swatch some of it guys they have the
classic one while packaging except for
the skulls on the lid and I know a lot
of people don't like this because of the
fact that it's sheer but I kind of been
like excited because I like a more sheer
lip color so that's one coat and I don't
even want to do a second one I like the
way that looks I was hoping that would
kind of turn out kind of purply with the
natural pink in my lips with the gray
mix to make almost a purple at first is
kind of like greasy or like really slimy
a loss but now it's drying down and it
should dry down like a normal liquid
lipstick
I think this won't be something for
everyone but I really like this this is
like how I want to wear liquid lipstick
something just sheer and fun and I like
that it's not too intense so this is a
win for me it has a lot of glitter I'm
gonna do a zoom in so you guys can see
but um that's kind of the look so I'm
gonna zoom in so you guys can see the
final look and we'll move on to my
second look trying out these products
see it's a little patchy here I wish I
fixed that I think the look turned out
well I like it I could do this with
other products though
alright guys hi it is the second testing
I'm going to be doing of these products
on camera I have been using some of the
wet and wild Gotha graphic collection
since I've done that video so some of
the things I'm trying today I have
already tried but I thought we could do
a look that's going to be more blue
based this is one of the products I'm
kind of inspiring my look around and the
reason I want to do this is I have been
seeing some reviews and this is kind of
like the worst cream shadow out of all
of them I feel like so I want to see
what it is like on the eye how it
performs this is looking a little purple
more purple than I thought but I'm gonna
make it work with a blue eye and see how
that goes and then the other
that I'm kind of focusing this look
around is the loose highlighter I have
used this
I do like it it's very glittery though
so it's a loose pigment that is very
light it's not like a heavy loose
pigment you know how some of them feel
like they have more binder or just there
have more weak to them this one is like
just like a loose if you blew it and
would go everywhere so I'm gonna show
you guys how I like to use this it's a
little bit glittery but I do think it's
really really pretty I want to give a
quick update on the eyeliners too since
I have been trying to use them I use the
purple in the look that you guys just
previously saw and I was gonna use this
pink and do something really simple and
then do a pink liner and this is what I
opened the brush to this is what the
brush looks like it's absolutely
horrendous I'll give you guys a close-up
what the Freak
these are just the worst seriously I had
a feeling that these were not that good
when I first use them but like the more
I delve into these the more they're just
pieces of crap and you should not buy
them the white one has the best brush on
it but they're just like it's almost
like a cream I feel like these have a
very similar consistency to like a cream
product instead of a liquid liner and so
they're just they're so bad they're not
worth 399 or $2.99 or however much these
are waste waste waste waste I just
wanted to point that out anyway but
let's get started on the eye look I'm
gonna be using the metal Mac palette I
know I'm using a bunch of like limited
edition Kat Von D products in this sorry
guys but I was kind of wanting to use
this part of the palette the greys the
blues I'll probably still use this
transition but I'm gonna zoom us in and
we'll get started on this look so
getting started I'm gonna be taking this
light brown shade you can use any like
transition type color you have I've
already prime my lids but I'm just going
to be putting this in I like even if I'm
working with cooler tone shadows I like
putting even just like a neutral almost
warm toned brown in the crease just to
give a bit of a base for the look and
I'm just going to be doing a normal you
know shape nothing too intense and I
think today I'm gonna be trying to do a
halo eye with this I really want that
Center to pop with the glitter shadow
usually you would do that with like a
lighter shade so I'm probably gonna make
my
pretty dark so that it can actually pop
in the center but I'm also hoping that
just the glitter alone will be enough to
make it pop instead of the lightness and
darkness of the shadows next I'm gonna
go in with the gray shade this is stone
from the palette and I'm gonna be
putting that on the inner and outer
corner of my eye and just starting to
build up the gradient of colors and
we're gonna be leaving the center as
open as possible that way we can put
that shadow and again it'll beat the pop
for the inner corner of the eye to lay
down that color I'm gonna go in with a
flat shader brush just to have a little
bit more precision and these are the
areas we want the darkest so I'm going
to lay down color and then I'll go in
and blend out with a different brush
and then I'm gonna make sure to connect
them at the top and just blow out this
part so it's not too unblended I'm gonna
go back in with the original blending
brush and just kind of blend out the
edges with that soft brown let's move on
to the blue so I'm gonna be taking the I
think I'm just gonna go in with the
shimmer shade here in the blue
this is nebula and I'm going to be
putting that on my brush and just laying
it in the center of the eye and blending
it into the other colors this is going
on really well
we have a lot of blue going on so I
wanted to start blending and making sure
we're getting a seamless of a blend as
it can I'm gonna go in again with the
gray and I'm mixing it with that Brown
too and I'm just going to start working
on the transition and then we'll punch
up the deepness on the in turn out a
corner
help with that halo effect it's time to
lay down some black so I'm gonna be
taking the shade jet from the palette
and putting this on the inner and outer
corner just bump it up again that halo I
and I'm just blending out what we have
down and then I'm gonna go in and use my
finger to just pat on some more of that
blue all right so that's the look so far
I do think it looks nice I'm not gonna
do too much more blending at the moment
because I feel like I need to like see
this from far off and not just like
really close up to see how it actually
is looking so we're gonna move in with
the cream shadow now again we're going
in with the shade and I'm just going to
be patting this from the two straight on
to the center of the eye
all right so that's what one coat looks
like I think this is looking really
pretty I do think I have like a game
plan going in since I knew this was
gonna be kind of sheer to lay down a
base color underneath it so I'm not
trying to get like complete opacity with
this one product and I think that's
helping I'm going in with a second coat
I think this looks super pretty I really
really like it I'm gonna let this dry
and then we will move on to the rest of
the eyes the next thing I want to do is
just again add more black I think it
just needs a little bit in the inner
corner so I'm taking this flat shader
and just placing it and dabbing it I
don't really want to bring it in to
where I'm blending I just don't want to
blend anymore I'm scared to take it too
high and I'm gonna put some on the
outside too just to enhance the actual
halo effect we have going on I wish I
could get my shape straight I never can
this is like more rounded this one's
more pointy on the outer edge but I if I
play around if the too much it always
gets crazy so anyway I think that looks
super good like I was scared for a
second but I'm really liking the way it
looks I want to go in and highlight my
inner corner which I'm gonna use the
loose highlighter for and I'm gonna boil
this so I'm gonna take some on a little
pointed pencil brush and I'm gonna spray
that with the Too Faced hangover spray
you can use whatever you have and I'm
gonna put that on the inner corner so
pretty this isn't very like I feel like
I should be in an evening gown or
something
I also this like reminds me of like Pat
McGrath for whatever reason I don't know
just like the dark colors and the blue
I'm gonna go in inline my tight line as
well as a bit on my bottom under lower
lashline that's what I mean
and I'm gonna kind of smoke it out a
little bit more than I normally do and
we'll go back in with some powders - I'm
going in and taking some black from the
palette and just running that under the
lash line I'm also dipping into some of
that gray just so it's not quite as
harsh as the black and then I'm also
gonna take that light brown shade we
used earlier and just run that
underneath everything besides
good this eye looks like it's broken
friend okay so I'm gonna go off-screen
fix this eye up try to make it look like
this one cuz it just looks so good and
then I'm going to also put mascara on
I'll come back and we'll finish up the
face alright so I'm back I had it
bronzer and mascara I put a little bit
of liner in my waterline as well which
is not something I normally do but my
flesh was like peeking through and it
looked really pink and weird so I
thought I would just go darker this is
as close as I could get my freaking eyes
to be so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave it
alone I'm gonna stop freaking blending
them into my brows let's just go in with
some blush I'm using this laura geller
one this is a shade cherry truffle and
it's just like a more cool toned mob I'm
gonna do it really lightly but I thought
this would look nice with the look
alright maybe I did do a lot I don't
know I kind of liked it though
and now we're finally gonna go in with
highlight I'm using again that loose
pigment and I just take whatever's in
the cap on my highlighter brush and
something I've learned about this
because it's such a lightweight
highlighter it doesn't like you put it
on and a lot will go on which is great
but you can easily buff it out and like
I said this is very like glittery so I
don't know I like it it's definitely
like blinding and really pretty and it's
like not quite
I guess glitter is maybe a wrong word
it's like a large shimmer it's not quite
glitter but it's just very sparkly so
you you know this is for making a
statement I do find that when I spray my
face with a setting spray though it does
help kind of like calm it down a little
bit so it's not as intense and that's
more like how I like to wear it it is
gonna emphasize texture as well like
most highlighters but it is definitely
super pretty I'm going to put a little
bit of this under my brow bone too just
to kind of highlight the arch I'm gonna
zoom in so you guys can see it up close
trying to like catch it in the light
it's so awkward
so we are so close to being done let's
just pick a lip out I think I mean just
for the sake of this look I'm gonna show
you guys one of the ones from the
collection if I'm gonna wear this
tonight which I probably am too we're
going to a play so I probably will put
on like a really pretty mommy nude and I
can get a look really really stunning
with whatever I'm gonna wear tonight but
this is the color I probably would go
with but just to try this on cuz I
haven't tried this one I'm gonna put the
blue one which is the shade pastel
grunge on my lips this is definitely
gonna give you like dead girl lips like
you were out in the cold and they found
your body in the snow yeah
so that's what the blue one looks like I
think that looks actually pretty good so
I think I might actually wear this one I
like a sheer lip so this is like the
perfect type of liquid lipstick formula
for me the glitter and these are really
pretty they add just like a wash of
pastel I think it definitely goes with
the collection so that's it for this
look I hope you guys enjoyed it I'm
really I really like it actually I think
I look really pretty
so I will come back and I will give you
guys a final review on all these
products so I'll see you there alright
hello guys we're onto the final portion
of this video and I'm gonna give you
guys my final review on the wet and wild
Gotha graphic collection I've been
testing this out over the course of like
a week and a half I would say and I
definitely feel like I have the set
opinions that I don't think are gonna
change so without further ado let's just
get into each item and I will tell you
if I suggest it or if I don't and just
kind of my overall thoughts as I've been
using it the first item I want to talk
about is the loose highlighting powder
and this is in Moon tiers I am wearing
this highlight again today and I really
like this product like it says in the
title this is a loose powder product and
I feel like it goes onto the cheeks
really really nicely it's super
pigmented and blinding I will say that
this is a very shimmery a borderline
glittery highlighter it doesn't have
like real glitter I would just say it's
a very like thicker Sparkle if that
makes sense
I know that sounds crazy but it still
gives it almost like glass like metallic
wet looking highlight I mentioned this
in the last portion of my video but this
highlighter doesn't have very much
weight to it so it's just a very like
loose powder it's not a heavy or loose
powder and so with this I like to put it
onto my cheeks and really buff it in
with the brush I find that it gets rid
of the more glittery look of this and
kind of melds it into the skin and melds
it into each other and then I also like
using a setting spray on top of this to
continue that and I feel like it gives a
really nice finish on the skin I
definitely can see myself using this
like after this video and you know
continuing on using this it's something
I really enjoy for me this is a bit more
of a BAM highlighter so I wouldn't use
this necessarily every day although I
really do like the look of it on the
cheeks I think it's beautiful I love the
color on my skin tone so this is a win
for me I think
you would really like this especially if
you love highlighters you will like this
I just really suggest the technique of
really buffing it in and it looks even
more beautiful I'm just gonna continue
talking about the highlighters next we
have the highlighter stick this is in
the shade hello darkness this is
something that is just a met product to
me like it works it definitely has that
duochrome
aspect to it it definitely works well I
think too with the white Raven
highlighter like these have the same
undertones and I think they pair really
nicely I think more than anything I just
don't tend to use products like this I
used this in the first part of this
video I also have used it a separate
other time and I tried using it with a
sponge because I saw on Nicole Renee
Cutler's video on this whole collection
I'm gonna leave that video link down
below as well as the other reviews on
this collection I've seen I'm in case
you want separate opinions or to see how
it looks on other people so I use it
with the sponge and it went on better it
didn't move my makeup as much I just
feel like this is a little greasy like I
just don't like the consistency of it
it's on my favorite it's not a bad
product it's not a great product I think
you can skip out on this I don't think a
lot of people use products like this and
if you do then this might work for you
and then for the last highlighters in
the collection we have the two powder
highlighters one is in a white Raven and
then the other one is in purple ashes
white Raven is definitely the winner out
of the two I think this is a really
pretty highlighter it's not overly
metallic or shiny it doesn't have
glitter in it it's just it's nice this
is another one I feel like you really
want to buff into the skin because I
don't know you want to get rid of the
white cast that this might have and just
let that purple base shine through and I
find the more you buff the more that
happens this isn't anything insanely
different to other things I have in my
collection like I've mentioned I have
the Anasazi of moonchild palette I have
the Kat Von D Alchemist palette I also
have a couple other like individual
highlighters so if you don't have those
things this might be something you want
to look into it's affordable it's
drugstore and it's cruelty free so
that's all a positive even though the
other brands I mentioned are too the
nitric sir but they're cruelty free I
think if this is something you were
really wanting to try I don't think
you'll be disappointed I think you'll
enjoy it it's nice it's just on a
must-have for my personal collection and
the inventory I already have as
for purple ashes this one I hate I
really wanted this to work I love pink
I love purple I love fun colors but the
problem with this is that it flashes
pink but it's literally like a gray
powder I used this in the first part of
the tutorial like up in my brows you
really couldn't tell it wasn't a big
deal it just got glitter on my face and
then I've also used this on my eyelid I
packed this on the eyelids over a
glitter primer and it barely gave off
any pigmentation even there but it looks
like a gray eyeshadow that slightly
flash pink so it just doesn't work as a
highlight not on my skin tone and I
don't even know if it would work on
darker skin tones because of the grey
it's just gonna look kind of Ashley it's
just like a strange product for
specifically a highlighter this was an
eyeshadow it would be better but at the
same time I just don't feel like it's
spectacular enough to even buy for an
eyeshadow I hate that there's chunks of
glitter in it like this is just
definitely not worth it this reminds me
of the mermaid scale highlighter that
came out with their like midnight
mermaid or whatever it was where it was
like a greeny gold but then it had like
that kind of gray undertone again and
it's like it's a cool idea it's a cool
powder but it just isn't practical it
doesn't work for what it is you know so
I'm yeah I do not suggest that I don't
think you'll like it
it's just don't don't spend the five
dollars we'll move on to the other
complete duds from this collection these
are the eyeliners there's a black
butterfly there is pink coffin and there
is skull prayer I hate these I think
these suck I don't suggest them I think
they're waste of your money I'm the most
disappointed with the pink one because I
was the most excited because it's pink
but this brush is absolutely an atrocity
you cannot even use it and that's how it
came it wasn't after a bunch of uses or
anything I didn't like you know jam it
in there in a fit of rage
it just came like that you guys saw me
use the purple one in the first tutorial
and I mean I was able to get a wing but
it's not very pigmented and I found with
these it's a very muchi formula it's not
a liquid formula and it just doesn't
work you have to build the pigment up a
lot and then it gets kind of like a
thick layer and even then it just isn't
that opaque they're just they just suck
the white one is the only one I'm
probably gonna keep and that's literally
just to maybe do some dotting around the
eyes or I don't know just something like
that just in case it comes up but even
this isn't that pigmented I'm sure the
NYX liner in white is better than this I
just don't have that so yeah I don't
suggest these I don't think you'll be
happy with them just disappointing I
feel like the star of the show for this
collection are the liquid cat suit
liquid eyeshadows these are really
really nice I am wearing a mix of the
pink one which is mystic dreamer as well
as pure intention on the lids today in
the center I did not do a tutorial on
this look just because this video is
already gonna be so long and then you
guys saw me use these other two in
action we have goth tears which is the
purple and then oh I think I said
necrophilia oh it's nicked Ophelia
anyway I think these are really really
great my favorite ones would be goth
tears and pure intention like if you
only were gonna pick up two or you
wanted my number ones like I know that
people will love these these two are
amazing the goth tears is just such a
fun holographic color this is very
similar to my Urban Decay tonic
eyeshadow which is one of my all-time
favorite eyeshadows ever so I love that
and then this is just that perfect pop
of a light color on the lid in the inner
corner I just think this is great I
still like the pink one but I did find
that this stains and it's honestly not
that pink like it has the barely any
pink in it and when I was watching it it
stained my hand pink and it was barely
on my hand so that's not like a huge
problem I just it's just the best it's
still definitely worth the price point
though and then the last one here this
is my least favorite but I found and
made it work in my last video I enjoyed
it I will say I did get some glitter
fallout with this but I also kept
blending after the fact so that could be
a part of it I do think that this wore
down a little bit throughout the night
as well so it wasn't quite as glittery
as it was when I first put it on but I
still think for the price this is pretty
good I just definitely suggest putting
an opaque base underneath
and then using this to just basically
add a little bit of glitter a little bit
of color you're not going to get your
most like POW color from just this this
is more of like an accent or a topper of
some sort and then last for the
collection I have the liquid lipsticks
and I feel like from all the reviews I
saw these are the things people don't
like and I honestly I like them I've
said this from the beginning I'm wearing
the pink one today and I think it's so
pretty I really like it this is the
shade wicked pink I can definitely see
myself wearing this quite often so for
me the reasons I like these these are
sheer which is a type of blood product I
like and that's not gonna work for so
many people I know a lot of people want
these to be built up to like opacity and
you can do that but it's gonna be a
disaster
I built the black one up to a pretty
opaque look and it would look fine for
like a picture or something like that
but it's not practical it's not wearable
it was like chunking off my lips maybe
like two hours later and it was
uncomfortable while I wore it I still
got the look was pretty and if I only
put like maybe one maybe two layers of
this on I think it would have looked a
lot better it will worn better but this
is probably my least favorite one
because I've found that these ones have
a lighter pigment to them so you can do
one application which is gonna give you
a sheer finish and it doesn't look weird
with the pigment doesn't look like
patchy or splotchy whereas the black one
has the most pigment mixed in and so
it's just it's harder to make it not
look streaky even on just one pass so I
wouldn't get this if you're looking for
a black liquid lipstick and out of all
of them that's probably gonna I suggest
the least I will still get a ton of wear
out of these I think especially for
liquid lipsticks which is something I
don't normally wear I don't know these
definitely to me give the pastel goth
vibe like the most out of everything
because they're this sheer look there's
like something about it that's different
but it's not too goth you know and I
mean it still has that like pastel goth
type of look the blue one I thought
looked really nice with the eye look
that I did this one and the gray one
definitely give your lips a little bit
of that kind of like dead vibe and I
think for specific looks it's really
cool really different I don't know a lot
of products that do this I think the
sparkle in them is really pretty so
again not gonna be for everyone I
like saying I suggest these to everyone
but for my preferences and what they do
I enjoy them actually as for how
comfortable they are and how long they
wear I don't think they're super long
wearing I don't have the original cat
suits to compare them to and I don't
normally wear liquid lipstick so keep
that in mind for me these wear long
enough for how long I would even wear
liquid lipstick I do find that sometimes
I can get that inner ring which is
irritating but I've just found that
that's been happening with like every
lip product I own lately and they do
tend to like crumble and I feel a little
bit dry but again I'm just not used to
liquid lipsticks I'm used to lip balms
so that could definitely be part of it
so to me these are a win but I don't
think they would be a win for everyone
overall with the collection I think that
this is a dud of a collection I think
the packaging first off is like the best
part about this I love the packaging I
love the idea and inspiration behind
this and I was really excited to get
this obviously because I bought the
entire kit and that's not something
normal that I would do for me the things
that I would actually like purchase are
the loose highlighter the cream shadows
and maybe one or two of these liquid
lipsticks other than that everything
else is not something that I would
purchase or want to repurchase and so
for me that makes it a dud plus some of
these aren't even just like oh they're
not for me or they're just not bad a
couple of them are just like not good at
all and I really think that brings down
the whole collection you know like you
don't want a collection of like really
great things and then just like crap
crap things so I definitely suggest that
you just pick and choose what you want
from this collection if you want
anything at all a little disappointing I
do like that it's drugstore at least you
know I'm not spending a ton of money but
yeah that's my overall review I hope you
enjoyed it let me know if you like this
type of video I think it's kind of fun
to see me and my thoughts throughout the
time you get the fun of the first
impressions we get to do like a fun
inspired look in the middle and then we
