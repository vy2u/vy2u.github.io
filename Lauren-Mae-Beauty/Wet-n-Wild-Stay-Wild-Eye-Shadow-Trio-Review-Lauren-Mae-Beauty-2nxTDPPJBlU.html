have a lot of videos to film today like
so many videos to film we are going to
get started this review is going to be
on the new I believe wet and wild stay
wild collection I saw these at my local
rite aid and there were four little
trios in the like in the display and
there were also some like liquid liners
I was there with a friend and I don't I
love Wet'n'Wild shadows but I feel like
I always missed the boat or I'm not
willing to like kill someone for you
know like a three dollar tree oh so i
feel like i usually don't get the chance
to get these type of items but I saw
these the display was full and wet and
wild is forty percent off too so I got
these for oh my gosh is definitely down
the whole time I got these for a dollar
seventy nine each so I thought why not I
did pick out the two more neutral of the
for the other ones were a little more
smokey and the suck the suck suck suck
do not get these if you love the normal
Wet'n'Wild formula for their trios and
they're like eight pen like palettes you
will just cry tears for days so let's
just start off with this one really
pretty neutral this is bohemian rhapsody
Rhapsody but with a wor I don't know
that's what it looks like and I don't
know if you can tell I'll show close-ups
but it has like a glitter in it so I
thought oh my gosh these are like smooth
and buttery and had the glitter like
yeah but ok so oh it's just pitiful it's
the most pitiful thing this is like
crumbly and crumbling off and look how I
don't know if you can see how chunky
that is it's so chunky and nasty and
then this last shade here they just are
not the same they're not the same guys
you know if you want to try these out
and you can get up her dollars under 9
you don't believe me then you go for it
but these just don't hold up to what I
was expecting and what I've know the
brand can do so that's just
disappointing let me give you close ups
I'm gonna give it close ups right now
there is a close up of the
hallett as you can tell it is super
beautiful in the pan but when you swatch
it it's ugly so let's just get into
swatching that is the darkest one it's
just not pigmented for what you see in
it so this is that one I don't know if
you can see all the flakiness on my hand
that's that one there I promise you they
suck it almost looks like they're
swatching out fine but they are ugly
awkward swatches later and that is the
other one there so i will now on on the
swatches I don't know why on camera they
look way more beautiful than they
actually are but they're just not that
great they're just chunky and I don't
think that they're they're not the same
quality for sure so anyway that's
Bohemian Rhapsody Rhapsody I don't know
so the second palette here this one is
called freestyle rap and this is more of
like a I just drop the stuff like a
purpley toe Pequod I guess quad trio
have you got the other ones watched by
than this one I feel like it's going to
swatch like ten times worse so let's get
a close-up of this action so that's it
in a pan again so so pretty right seems
like wow if this worked it be beautiful
so watching this one first
see on camera they look like they're
nice but they're not I promise people
they're just chunky like I don't know if
you can see that it's just like flaky
and so nasty it's not like a smooth
formula at all and then we're going to
go up to this shade here so that's that
one see that's what I'm talking about
like just chunky flaky nastiness that's
it I don't feel like the pigmentation is
nice at all mmm and then last but not
least is this one here that's it that
one definitely is the best one this
darkest shade I don't know if you can
see in the pan it's just so flaky so
anyway I want to just review to be
really quick these aren't the worst
shadows in the world I'll tell you that
but compared to what I know what and
wild can do they just aren't very good
so I thought it would save you guys the
299 or dollar 79 or however much you can
get them for I just wouldn't pick them
up I think there's just better stuff out
there I'm just super disappointed with
them I guess and I wanted them to be
really awesome and super pigmented and
and great and I have a lot of other
wet'n'wild shadows that I really do like
but this flaky formula that they
sometimes do is just so gross to me and
even if you were to wet this formula on
your eye like with fix plus or with some
other type of medium I feel like because
it's flaky it ends up just looking like
scaly on the eyes when you're trying to
like build that product so I just think
you should skip out on these ones but
you do you I hope this review is helpful
if you saw them and maybe wanted um
maybe you feel better now that you
didn't get them or maybe you can just
pass on them because they're not worth
it that's everything for this video this
is a short 1i have like seven hundred
other ones to film today no but really
like for other ones so let's get into it
I will see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
