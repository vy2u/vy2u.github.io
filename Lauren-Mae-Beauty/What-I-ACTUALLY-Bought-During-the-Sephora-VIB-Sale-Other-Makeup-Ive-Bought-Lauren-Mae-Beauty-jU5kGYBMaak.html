Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be showing you guys a
haul of the items I actually did pick up
during the Sephora vib sale I had
mentioned in a video that I wasn't going
to be like doing a recommendations video
or anything like that just because
honestly the things I recommend are
things that are tried-and-true and I
feel like when I really look at my
collection I would just be talking about
the same crap I like always talked about
or that I've talked about in the past so
I just don't want to be super repetitive
but I did pick up a few items not a ton
because to me 15% honestly it's like I
mean I'd rather have a discount than
nothing but like there are a lot of
other sales that are better plus I do
get discounts other place I just didn't
want the sale to be the reason I was
buying things I wanted it to be I want
this thing oh and I happened to get 15%
off not oh let me buy all this stuff
because there's a 15% off sale I wanted
it to be stuff that I would buy full
price but just happened to get on sale
anyway I'm gonna show you guys that
stuff and then I did buy some other
things I'm going to show you that - all
this stuff is stuff I bought so this is
like a traditional haul there is no PR I
wanted this stuff I bought this stuff so
I hope you guys enjoy I asked you if you
would I know I've been hauling a lot but
y'all said you wanted it so let's just
get into the items I bought and why you
know this is probably the thing I'm most
excited for these are the Shiseido
face I can't say it I've tried so
many times these are the Shiseido facial
cotton facial Cotton's that's it
they're just cotton rounds or cotton
squares with these ones okay first off
these feel like a dream they feel so
squishy I haven't used them yet they
came in the mail today I'm excited to
try these out obviously these are like
super raved about and honestly I feel
like I've talked about cotton rounds
like way too many times on my channel
like there's been too much time in
videos dedicated to that so I'm excited
to try these out and see how they are
the original price on these is $10 so
that is very expensive because I'm the
girl that likes to pay like $1 per a
hundred about so they're a cent apiece
and we're definitely not there with
these but I I mean we'll see because I
hate a crappy cotton round too just as
much as paying a lot of money for them
so hopefully these are as good as
everyone says and with that order I did
pick up a dry shampoo this is the
Sephora coconut water dry shampoo
I did not realize that this was a tiny
baby this is only 2.5 ounces or 75
milliliters it's a travel size so yeah I
was disappointed in that because this is
like I think it was like $7 or $8 it was
definitely a price that I thought was
for a full-size anyway if used it today
I didn't hate it so that's good but I'll
have to use it basically up to tell you
how it works how I like it it does smell
like coconut but it smells very
similarly to the batiste tropical scent
one so so far I only have three more
items that I specifically bought at
Sephora with the sale so I have the two
faced three and one hangover
replenishing primer and setting spray
you guys know I love this I talked about
this a lot from that little freaking
sample like I remember there was a time
that I was talking about in like every
single video for like a week and a half
straight but I did decide to bite the
bullet get the full size I believe this
retails for like $34 it's expensive when
you do the math though it does kind of
like even out to a very like reasonable
price for a lot of these higher-end
setting sprays so I guess that is good
but I love it this is not like going to
hold your makeup in place this is just
kind of like a nice water it reminds me
of fix+ like I use it in a very similar
way I really like the smell of this I've
described it as a medical coconut scent
because that's what it smells like to me
and someone confirmed that they got it
and that's what they think it smells
like - they were like very accurate I'm
like yeah I thought so so I'm glad
someone else look oh wow
conspiracy theory is that a heart a
medical heart because it smells like
medical coconut well we know
anyway I love this I'm really excited to
have it back in my collection I'm trying
to use up other sprays and not
completely only use this but it's hard
because I do love it the other two-faced
item that I got is this highlighter if
you guys watched my you decide when I
buy and voted there I did a whole video
talking about highlighters that I wanted
to try and it had two guys about in the
comments for which ones you wanted so
the top three that got voted in I was
going to make a video about giving you
guys reviews on them letting me know how
I like them and kind of picking a winner
but I mean it's kind of
because they're all a little bit
different so I'll mostly just be
reviewing them anyway the two-faced
diamond light highlighter was one of
them and let me tell you like will you
marry me this is cute packaging I cannot
lie so this is what the box inside the
box looks like it's so adorn imeem it's
adorable
so cute don't know how well you're gonna
see it sorry for my lights are kind of
blowing it out but that's what it looks
like it looks like a diamond I have used
this one time I'm not gonna like to talk
about how I like it or anything because
you'll have to watch the video but yeah
I'm really excited to have this I
thought since I knew I had to pick it up
that I would pick it up on the sale so I
probably honestly could've got this on a
better deal but I had a gift card so it
kind of worked out anyway but I'm
excited to try this out I'm excited to
review it and then the last thing that I
picked up at Sephora is something for
another video in the future but also
just something I really truly love this
is the Kota Lee Han Dan nail cream I
love this stuff so much I'm gonna use it
right now this is like one of my
favorite products honestly the only
reason I remember I even like that
product is because of an old flashback
favorites that I did where I went back
and was like oh whoa I do love that
product so it smells like grapefruit it
smells so nice but it's still really
light like it's not overpowering I think
it's a nice level of moisture it's not
like overly moisturizing where you feel
greasy but it isn't too light like I
feel like the Sol de Janeiro one is
great for like putting it on and like
doing stuff right then you're not gonna
like get your steering wheel all greasy
whereas this one's just a little bit
it's like a step above that so I loved
that I thought I'd pick it up because I
am gonna be doing a hand cream video I'm
gonna call it the hand cream video we're
going to talk about hand creams because
I'm just like obsessed with them it's
weird because I literally like don't
like lotion but I love hand creams I
don't know man I don't know what my life
is okay so they'll rest the stuff in
here is just stuff I bought randomly
because I was looking into it or
whatever I don't know I went to the mall
to pick up some of that Sephora stuff
and I decided to go into bath and
Bodyworks I had a gift card from some
things that I had returned unopened
that I got for Christmas so I was like
you know what I'm gonna go in just like
be around and
candles were on sale so they are now on
sale for like $12.75 like that's like
the cheapest you can get them which is
so irritating but I guess I'm just going
to have to accept that that's like the
new price so I bought one this is Tiki
Beach it's one of my all-time favorite
scents I freaking love it so much
oh it's so good it's like the most
creamy delicious Pina Colada you could
ever want ever like it is what dreams a
mmmm I love it so much seriously super
happy I picked it up I'm not gonna burn
it for a little bit I'm gonna try to
hold off at least but I might just burn
it it summer I don't know maybe once I
get back from Italy I'll burn it but I
love it I'm happy I picked it up and
with that I saw some hand soaps you guys
already knew I picked up some hand soaps
because these are the exfoliating kind
which are the same as the ice blue sage
is which is what I talked about in a
previous like favourites video and that
was like in the wintertime about anyway
so I saw there were a couple in the line
but I only liked these as a scent so I
picked up the Honolulu Sun scent and I
picked up the Fiji white sands I think I
like Fiji better but I started with this
one because I knew I'd like this one
butter these are six fifty apiece I did
use a coupon so I got one of them for
free and I ended up paying like four
dollars outside of my gift card so I
thought that was pretty good I also got
the Bath and Body Works app while I was
in there and it's kind of nice I mean
I'm not someone who Shops at Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works all the time like I used to like I
was obsessed with Bath and Body Works
before but it's kind of nice to like
track your points and you know it has
the coupons on there so you don't have
to be like going through your email
trying to find out so just a little pro
tip there even though I'm definitely not
about the body works Pro and honestly
there's only like one more brand or like
order I place but then there's like one
separate little item I guess so the next
thing is colour-pop stuff I did place a
colour-pop order once again cuz I was
needing flexitarian this is another one
of the winners so I wanted to get this
and try it out but it had been out of
stock on the colour-pop website for a
long time and I kind of ordered it I
guess on Alton now that they carry it
but I'm not gonna lie I think I like to
use it as an excuse to then you know get
other things so I got other colour-pop
things with that order I also picked up
a bronzer this is the bronzer in
California Dreaming I believe from the
swatches this is the one that seems like
the best for me but like I don't
guys it's a little bit dark it does have
a bit of a shimmer to it as well so I
need to like test it out and everything
I just wish it was a bit lighter I
thought it was gonna be lighter based
off of what I saw another thing I picked
up to kind of go with the highlighter
this is the brush and I believe it's
just like it's just a fan brush but it's
nice and thick it's like pretty dang
thick so I thought this would maybe be
nice and I could test out like what that
highlighter does with this brush as
opposed to other brushes as opposed to
your hand with a sponge what ever since
they sell it I thought maybe they came
up with a great way to apply that cream
formula because I know it's a little bit
tricky to deal with and the last couple
things I paid for on the colour-pop
website are the shadows so all these
shadows above the line they're all the
green and blue I picked those up from
the festival collection so I'm really
excited about him I basically stayed
away from any of the like warmer tones
the orange e tones I tried not to get
too many Pink's like I picked up the
cooler Purple's blues greens things that
I felt like I didn't have in my
collection don't get me wrong if I could
I would have picked up the entire
collection because I thought it was so
so pretty and it kind of was stopping me
from buying the BH one but look I did
that you guys all really loved that I
didn't film a tutorial on I use these
shadows just so you guys know I might do
a video using these shadows recreating
that look we'll see but yeah I'm really
excited about those and I thought they
were really good purchase and then at
the time of my order one of the things
like the promotions going on the site
were like if you spent this much you get
this if you spend that much you get this
so I hit like a pretty big one because
this was kind of a lot of stuff
especially those single shadows like it
doesn't seem like a lot but if they're
five dollars piece and I got ten of them
you know how to do math so anyway these
are a highlighter set and I thought this
would be nice to test out some other
formulas so it comes with three
different ones I think the only one I'm
interested in actually using for myself
is the over the moon one it's like a
holographic glittery type of one let me
get it out the other two I think I'm
gonna like tuck away and keep unused for
like future stuff it's hard to tell what
it looks like in the pan plus I dropped
it so it's kind of like a little messed
up so yeah I'm gonna be testing that out
with the other formula
I thought it
have two different things to kind of
compare to instead of only trying one
from the line and the last thing that I
picked up is the last highlighter I
needed to make that video so this is
something I've been wanting off the
Oprah website for a while once I knew
that this was one of the winners this is
the feeling yourself palette from Oprah
and it has three of their most popular
highlighters it has Rodeo Drive which is
the gold one it has pillow-talk and then
this one is blissful I really wanted
this because I believe this was like $35
I used one of the coupon codes to save
30% off on it and I got to try out three
different highlighters instead of
essentially paying like $30 for one
highlighter I thought that was a really
great deal and I'm excited I'm really
glad this came back into stock so if
this is something you're looking for or
you want to try them out I really do
think this is the best way to kind of
try them out and get a bunch of
different colors in smaller sizes but I
do believe they sell these smaller sizes
now too
so anyway that's the last item that I
picked up so that's everything for my
little haul a kind of I mean you know
when you add all this stuff up it's
definitely doesn't seem little but it's
not too bad right it's all things that I
was really interested in there are still
so many things I'm interested in but I'm
trying to hold off and really only buy
things right now I'm leading up to Italy
that are going to be for Italy like
travel sized products I'm gonna need
maybe some glowy products I did just put
an order in on the octoly website for a
self-tanner like who the Freak am i but
I kind of just want to try it out see
how user-friendly it is see if like I
don't know I'm probably gonna make a
video on it because I've never really
done a self-tanner before and I think
it'll be if anything maybe funny but I
kind of want to like document the
process of it and myself as we go so
anyway enough of that thank you guys so
much for watching let me know what you
guys did actually pick up in the Sephora
vib sale if you picked up anything
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
