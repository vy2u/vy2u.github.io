it's Lauren it feels so good to be
filming I haven't filmed in a while
because I was away but I am back now and
I have so many videos to film so let's
get into this one I wanted to do what I
got for Christmas video I know that a
lot of people do those here on YouTube
and I don't know I just thought it'd be
fun I love watching them seeing what
other people gotten it's just fun to
watch people haul things and stuff so
these are a lot of the things i got for
christmas i'm not going to show you like
every little tiny thing just because you
don't need to see like all the candy I
got in my stocking or just different
things like that this wasn't meant to
brag I just thought you might enjoy
since I enjoy them all so I was really
happy with this year because usually
Christmas is like when I get all these
beauty products and that's what I'll ask
a lot of people for like you know makeup
items hair items and honestly this
Christmas I didn't really put any of
that on my list too much so I'm really
happy with the amount of beauty i got
and that i got a lot of things in other
categories that's something kind of new
for me and i think that's really
exciting so i'll start off with the
beauty items that I got first just to
like get them out of the way if that's
what you're most interested in one of
the first things I got this is the Sonia
Kashuk brush set I know Emily Noel
talked about this a lot and said it was
really good and that's where me and my
mom saw it so we both got this set I
haven't even opened yet which I'm really
surprised at myself because I was really
excited to get this i just haven't yet i
think this is super cute it's limited
edition so if you want to definitely
check it out at target i'm pretty sure
it's sold out but i think this is about
thirty dollars and you get for nice face
brushes why I liked it is it kind of has
a few different types of brushes so I
kind of thought that it gives you a cut
that's a little bit different I'm
excited to play with these and kind of
test them out see how I like them I know
they're really soft though so excited
about those Sam sister Gwen got me a few
things from lush so she got me the tin
oh what's upside-down but inside I
believe this is like I don't
no what it was she said it wasn't the
shampoo though it smells really nice it
kind of smells like mint chocolate e or
something and I think it's like a body
not so but something with the body cuz
she said it wasn't like a one of their
bar shampoos so I'm excited for that and
I'm glad it came in the tin we were
talking about it and so many times I
feel like you waste these products
because they're not in the ten or you
know they're just being dissolved even
when you're not in the shower someone
else is taking a shower they get like
girls in gloopy so let's put that on the
right way so I'm excited to have the tin
and actually let that last and then she
got me this other I believe it's the
star yeah she got me a bath bomb and
it's like the little star it smells
really nice I really soft scent so I am
happy with that too they were just nice
little things in my stocking another
thing my mom got me this was in my
stocking this is the redken styling
paint on sparkle and shine so there's
like a silver metallic and then a gold
metallic kind of glitter liquid it says
liquid pomade and it comes with a brush
so I actually really think this will be
great for me not only for like you know
potentially every day I really am liking
like the glitter roots so I kind of want
to do something like that which I think
this would be a really nice base to put
that on but also just for school and
just for different looks that I'm doing
I think this'll be great in come in
handy it's one of those things that you
wish you had but like you don't know
where to buy them when you need them
unless it's Halloween and or whatever so
I'm excited for this I believe this is
my last like beauty beauty item and I
absolutely love it oh it's the wrong way
I do that every time you guys notice
that this is the molecule perfume I'd
mentioned this perfume in my perfume
collection video which I'll link down
below at the end of that video i had
mentioned perfumes that i wanted to
purchase or have in my collection that I
didn't currently have and this was one
of them I love the way this smells I
think it smells so good the one thing i
don't like about it is once you have it
on you you can't really smell it
yourself so I feel like I don't smell it
and I want to spray more that's why I've
used quite a bit of this but I
absolutely love the smell I've got so
many compliments on it I just think it's
a great one it is super pricey I think
this
is a really awesome perfume it smells so
good and I'm really glad it to my
collection it kind of made me think like
I can't wait to really pare down my
collection so that I can have like this
and just a few the other ones that I
really really like and that no matter
what I picked I know I would just love
it instead of like Oh have to you know
work through this perfume or whatever
similar to beauty but not quite I did
get this bag from Sam's mom it's a
makeup bag it's from charming charlies
really cute I absolutely love it it's
very similar to like my shirt right now
I love these types of bags that are
really wide you can fit so much in them
but they're still tiny enough to like
fit in a purse love this I'm really
happy i really like the style of it I
got a few of these little hair ties
these are from l Erickson or something i
don't know i love the colors of these
these ones I think are supposedly not
supposed to like give you any kinks in
your hair but I love that if you're
wearing them on your wrist they're still
kind of cute I'm gonna start with the
fashion stuff I got a few pieces of
clothing and then I'll go into the craft
stuff which is basically the rest of
what I got I got a few different
clothing items and I'm sorry that you're
not gonna be able to see them entirely
like one hundred percent really well in
this video so I'm sorry about that let
me know if you guys would ever be
interested in like a try on haul not
that I go shopping for clothes at often
because I really don't but like a look
book or a hall or anything like that I
am plus size so um yeah I don't know if
you'd like that I don't have a ton of
awesome clothes but I kind of have been
thinking about stuff like that so let me
know but if you can see this which you
really can't this is like a navy blue
sweater tunic and it has a really loose
kind of turtleneck and it's kind of long
and sleeveless which is like I love
sleeveless things I don't like sleeves
because my boobs are quite large and
there's like always a gap of fabric in
between my shoulders and my boobs and I
just personally have never liked that
and so sleeveless always I feel like is
more flattering on me that's really the
best I can do guys I'm really sorry this
wasn't thought out was it that's one of
the items and that item was from forever
21 I also got this shirt from forever 21
it is so cute it's very similar
shirt and we're now it's floral print
with like that Jersey collar I really
like this style of shirt and again it's
sleeveless the rest of the stuff that I
got was from torrid I personally think
towards kind of expensive even stuff on
clearance is kind of pricey and I don't
think the quality is that that good but
I found a few pieces in there that
weren't too bad so this is just a basic
black dress it kind of has that
heathered pattern in it so it's not a
solid black it's just a very tiny little
slave not a not a big one or anything
the waistline is like right below my
boobs not right below a little bit lower
so it's not like you know flaring out
too much and then it's like a medium
length so I thought this was nice if you
saw my closet to clutter video I got rid
of a dress similar to this so I kind of
thought this is my replacement for that
dress and then last for clothing this is
just a black tank top from torrid it is
a sheer kind of top and it's like a
sharkbite hem so if you don't know what
that means see how it's like in the
middle short and then longer on the
sides that's a shark bite I thought this
would be really nice for when I'm on set
or doing a makeup gig because it's black
I can still feel cute and stylish it was
like black denim and like a black pair
of shoes without feeling like Steffi but
still being professional that's what I
was thinking about it anyway it was kind
of pricey but it looked really nice so
since I was for Christmas I was like all
right I'll get it and then last but not
least for fashion I did get these
sandals from tour head they r on
clearance so they were only like
thirteen dollars and they were like half
off of that so it was really good deal I
like sandals I only really wear sandals
lately I've been into like birkenstock
type of shoes but these ones are really
flat though so we'll see how that works
out but i think this style of them is
super cute i forgot that i got some
electronics so i guess i'll just talk
about that now I got a Fitbit yeah I'm
so happy with this this is like one of
the one things I really really wanted
besides the perfume Sam got me this and
I really like it I've been trying really
hard to get my 10,000 steps in every
single day it's just kind of a nice
motivator to not completely like freak
your life out and you know do something
that you can't keep up but something
instead that's just a small change and
I'm the type of person that's super goal
oriented so
there's a goal I'm gonna do like
everything I can basically typical so I
think this really works well for me and
since it's just steps I'm like I can
just walk around the neighborhood like
real fast and get it for hundreds touch
like let's do it I don't know I've
really been enjoying it and I haven't
been changing like eating habits like on
purpose necessarily like a diet or
something but I do find myself since I'm
focusing on getting those steps at every
turn of the day I'm also like making
little choices like oh I'm not gonna get
us at all just gonna water different
things like that which i think is really
awesome so love my fit bed I'm thinking
about doing like a fitness like weight
loss journey a type of thing on my
channel we'll see how that goes if
you're interested in something like that
again let me know down below I think it
would just be something really awesome
on my channel something I'm interested
in and although i'm not trying to like
lose a ton of weight really fast or
anything like that i think just being
healthy and focusing on a well balanced
life and an active life i think that's
really important to me anyway we're
getting really off topic so i'll make a
new or different video on that but we'll
keep going with electronics that i got
for christmas oh my gosh surprisingly i
got a kindle fire my ex stepdad he got
me a kindle fire he got me and my little
brother it and then not my mom or anyone
else oh i didn't expect that or anything
so that was really awesome I haven't
really done much with it yet I'm gonna
do that I guess um it's really awesome
i'm not trying to like sound ungrateful
i just wasn't expecting to have one of
these in my life I never really had an
interest so I'm kind of trying to figure
out how they work what they are because
they're like an Amazon product so
they're very heavily amazon influenced
with everything on it so i'm excited to
kind of test that out and try it out
since i wasn't expecting that at all in
the slightest now on to all the crafts I
have been really into crafts lately and
really into just being creative and
having a different outlet for my money
in my time other than makeup has been
kind of fun and I've just been enjoying
that so I'm sure it's no surprise that I
got like a million coloring books for
Christmas I asked for them but i also
got one from like
one in Sam's family so I have this one
here this is called secret places I'll
just kind of flip through these ones are
quite intricate so these ones will be
really nice to do is like a colored
pencil or something with a really fine
tip this one is all about paisley
patterns so there's like that one
there's like that one they're all just
Paisley's which i think is really nice
these ones aren't quite as intricate as
in really really fine details or as many
details so i like that i have like an
option for whatever i'm feeling like
this one's really awesome this is the
enchanted forest I really like just the
content of this one it's really up my
alley right now there's like one of them
in here is like a unicorn and like
castles and like you know just that
forest theme I've been really into
mushrooms and I had to make a mutant
nose in class and i made a dear and i
have this whole idea of like a fog kind
of like the equivalent of a sea siren
but in the forest like a fawn half on
girl anyway that's kind of fulfilling
that used for me and last i got this
line this one's for my mom this is the
calm coloring book and again just more
coloring pages to color as an adult i'm
up to like six coloring books now so i
think i'm sad i still want that cat one
but i think i'm pretty set with coloring
books and again I I want to film like a
sped up video of just me coloring and
thought that'd be cool so you guys a
couple of you guys said it'd be awesome
to so I was like yeah there's weirdos
like me out there yeah with those I
wanted a couple like pens and pencils
sorry about the crackling I got this
from the target dollar spot and it was
my stocking they're just like cute
little pens I thought these would be
nice for my journals and also my
calendars and stuff they're just really
cute and then I also asked for a couple
more professional type of markers and
stuff because I really only use Crayola
ones and I thought I want to have some
alcohol markers or Copic markers and
just some different things so these ones
are prismacolor and these are like art
markers they have a fine tip and then a
more chiseled tip and these are really
cool this is like a set and then
Sam's dad caught me and then they also
have a couple blender pens which I think
are really awesome I've been using them
a little bit and they bleed a lot so I
definitely want to work on like how I
can use them I definitely need to like
watching YouTube videos and look up how
to really work with them the best way
but I know once I do I can really create
some really awesome stuff and then
similar to that I have these ones these
are alcohol markers so again they're
really great at blending and shading and
things like that and studio series is
the brand and those are all the
different colors you can also buy a
bunch of like sets i've seen a lot of
like crafting videos which all these
links down below to different like card
people that i like to watch or whatever
the last couple of things are all kind
of related and crafty my mom got me some
of these like scrapbooking type of
things they have different die cuts in
them and like chipboard type of pieces
and stuff so it's just like a big hit
full of different ones and she got me
two different styles of that so these
are really fun I like using these in my
planners I think that's more what I'm
about is like really making my planner
not only something i play on in but also
kind of a scrapbook and a memory keeper
it's kind of everything in one and i
really like that also i do want to
scrapbook a lot of the pictures that i
have from the trips we've made so far in
our lives so ok glass things I promise
on my gosh I'm so sorry this video so
long these are some die cuts that my mom
got me so this one says life and it has
a lot of cute little things and then
this one says hello these would be so
perfect for cutting out different pieces
of paper for my planners I'm super
excited for the specific die cuts my mom
got me and then she did get me a little
die cutter so this is the sizzix
sidekick and this is just like a hand
you know done basically it puts pressure
on the die cut and cuts into the paper
so you have a really clean fine line for
what you want to cut out anyway really
awesome ok so that's everything I got
for Christmas I really am just so
grateful and so lucky to have so many
people in my life who are so loving and
then also on top of that wanted to get
me gifts for Christmas I totally
appreciate every one of them and
everything that I got it's overwhelming
the generosity and
i I'm just I feel really blessed so I
