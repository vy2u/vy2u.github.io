Lauren thank you so much for watching
first I want to say that this look is a
very intense and it is a part of my
Gotha graphic review that's going to be
coming up so if you like this look and
you want to know how I did it it will be
coming so you know I get some questions
and I like to just address it if I can
in the video but other than that today's
video is going to be about palettes that
are new that I can dupe with palettes
that I already have in my collection I
have four different palettes that I'm
going to talk about today this was
sparked by honestly the Too Faced life's
a festival palette I think that palette
is really pretty in theory and I like
the colors in it but I don't like the
packaging I don't want to pay for it so
that inspired me to look into my
collection and pick out palettes that I
have that are similar and I do do a
let's do Pitt series on my channel where
it takes single shadows and create those
entire palettes but I thought it's a lot
easier sometimes that is just like a
palette that has similar colors on
another palette that has similar colors
you don't have to buy a bunch of
individual shadows so let's get into it
and I'll show you the palettes that I'm
gonna be using to seven for looks I
think I would create with the numerous
on the market hopefully that made sense
so the first part I want to talk about
that newer to the market is the Urban
Decay Naked petit Heat palette and this
is very similar to their other Naked
basics palette the one in the two but
this is going off of the naked heat so
it's all very warm colors you guys have
seen it so I have two palettes actually
my collection that I feel are very
similar to the tones in that palette I
think I can create similar looks with
these palettes I think I could be
inspired in a very similar way as that
palette so the first one here is my
smashbox of Blaze palette this is
something I'm working on in a project
pan currently and it just has a lot of
those warm tones
I feel like this gives you a lot more
variety than that palette though I don't
have any nice matte transitions which I
will say that palette definitely has but
all the looks I've seen with it so far I
feel like the colors aren't distinct
enough to really get it's a very just
one monochromatic look they all just
kind of blend into each other into a
gradient instead of having a bit more
definition so I think this palette is
nice you have a nice like red you have a
brown and orange e Brown and then some
nice
like shimmer colors so that one's
definitely very similar and then the
other one is the Hoonah warm brown
palette this has a ton of mattes in it
and then one shimmer in the middle this
has I feel like a bit more variety than
the naked Heat it doesn't have one of
those very light transition shades but I
feel like this could work potentially
better on all skin tones and you could
always add in just like one matte brown
from your collection somewhere else so
yeah these are the two that I feel like
will give me very similar looks and so I
definitely don't need that palette in my
collection
the next palette I kind of have the two
so the two-piece life estable is what
inspired me to put this palette in here
but the new Tarte one the mermaid let me
read you the name entirely via mermaid
and make waves palette I feel like is
even more similar to this one then the
life's a festival palette from Too Faced
this is the Kevin of Kwan electro-pop
palette and I love this palette I think
it's so so pretty so when it comes to
the Tarte palette which is the one I'm
going to be comparing it to the most
since I do think it's more similar I
have all of those blue pops of fun color
that are in that palette and then I feel
like bubbles is very similar to a mix
between this shade and this one here
they both have like a duo chrome to them
and that's like the other kind of fun
color and then other than that in the
palette it's just a bunch of like warm
golds and browns and peaches and like
some pinks and I have some of that in
these colors too so I think this is very
very similar I love this palette and so
I definitely don't think I need the
Tarte one I'm not even honestly that
tempted I think the packaging is super
cute I love the whole idea of it but
when it comes to the colors and I don't
like the shape of the pan like I know it
goes with the packaging but when I think
about practicality and like using it I
don't know I just don't like it but this
is a palette I'm going to be using kind
of to satisfy the colors and what I see
in that palette I think this one is very
similar it's gonna give you those high
shine colors this does not have any
mattes in it but I can always pull
mattes from other pallets and singles in
my collection
the next palette that I was looking to
dupe in my collection with another
palette is the Vizier petit pro palette
- this is a really beautiful palette it
has like some nice pinks and purples and
like Mavi tones I
like cranberry colors I think that's a
better word for it and so for that
palette I looked at the sheet palette
and thought this is very very similar
this is from colour-pop and it's their
collab with Karrueche so they have some
really nice mats in the busy art and
these ones are very similar this is a
really pretty bright coral which I think
works nicely against the coral in that
palette and then there's all these
really nice shimmers you obviously are
getting more shades in this palette and
then the price difference for this
palette and the visit one is obviously
insanely different I have not tried
boozy art shadows I do want to try them
at some point so quality wise I'm not
saying they're comparable but just color
and inspiration wise I feel like this
palette is very similar to that one and
can give you a similar look or similar
inspiration and the last palette I have
here is the Natasha Jeannot Dalila
palette and I am putting this one up
against one of the new Pat McGrath mini
palettes I'm really excited that she's
coming out with smaller palettes that
are at a more affordable price range I
do want to try her shadows at some point
just to try them out kind of like I did
with Natasha de Nonna so this one is
definitely not one where it's like this
is cheaper go with this and I'm not
trying to suggest it this is just
telling you guys what I'm doing and
hopefully will inspire you to do the
same with pallets that you're wanting
and the palettes that you currently have
in your own inventory but anyway the one
that I'm talking about is the I believe
it's the la vie and Rose palette it has
some really beautiful shades it's the
one I'm probably the most attracted to
out of all the many ones she came out
with when I saw it though I did
immediately think that the pink in here
the purple in here the gold in here even
this shade this other like warmer purple
are all very similar to the colors in
that palette again finishes are
different but just color inspiration and
these are really pretty and they're
expensive and if I was ever gonna want
that palette I should definitely go into
this palette and not do that one the
only shade I feel like that it's kind of
missing in here is like that peach but I
could definitely pull from another
palette and I think there are still
similar things in here enough that you
definitely don't need both of those and
I think this one for me can definitely
it fill whatever that palette would do
for me okay guys um this is a really
short and sweet video I just wanted to
show you some of
palates that I thought had some
similarities and something I just wanted
to note here at the end is that I don't
think that it's bad that companies come
out with either similar pallets
necessarily because every brand is
different just because another brand has
a warm I shadow palette doesn't mean
that another brand couldn't have it or
shouldn't have it I think it's more just
as a consumer looking into your own
collection and realizing what you might
have to already fulfill that needs you
aren't buying everything on the market
and that's what I wanted to do with this
video but I hope this video inspires you
to go into your own collection there's a
palette that you're really really
wanting just saying if you have another
palette that for the most part will
suffice
sometimes when you single out certain
shadows it lets you realize that a
palette is more similar to something
then maybe you originally thought I also
think that looking at the palette as a
whole for inspiration is sometimes
really helpful too I think for example
the naked Heat petite and the ones that
I picked they are not like dupes by any
mean they're not like exact color dupes
but they're very similar color stories
and you can get very similar looks and
inspiration from those okay that's
everything thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
