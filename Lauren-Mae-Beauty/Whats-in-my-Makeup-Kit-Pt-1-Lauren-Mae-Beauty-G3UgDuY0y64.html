frickin Lauren hi guys welcome back to
my channel it's Lauren
I'm so sorry about the junk breaking
it's like literally as soon as I started
filming the dog isn't breaking and I
need a film so this is just an intro
this is going to be the first video in
my makeup artist series that I have been
talking about on my channel if you guys
are new to my channel and haven't seen
me I've gone to makeup school like the
last year and I just graduated at the
end of February now I'm working makeup
artist in LA so yeah this is what's in
my kit a lot of you guys have been
asking for this video to see what's in
my kit this is gonna be broken up into
two parts because I have like my kit and
then I have like my set bag and they
just carry separate things in them I
take both of them with me wherever I go
and so it just will make the video
shorter but also give you all the
information in two parts so I've been a
little bit hesitant to make this video
just because I am so green and although
I've been lucky enough to get really
awesome work you know Mike it's
ever-changing I'm constantly upgrading
products or I get bored with stuff and
put new things in or as I'm working on
set and come across new situations and
new problems essentially to solve I
think about and add new things to my kit
because of that experience so this is
just what's in my kit now that doesn't
mean that this is what you guys should
have I'm literally just showing you what
I have and you guys can go from there
these things seem to work for me now of
course obviously I want to upgrade
eventually all the way to other products
and different things but that doesn't
mean that anything in here is like bad
yeah I think that's everything I'm just
gonna go straight into the kit and we'll
just look at it it'll just be faster
that way than me holding everything up
and then you guys can kind of see how it
organized it in here too I think that's
everything so let's just get into my kit
and what I keep in it okay hi guys this
is my kit here as you can see so this is
where I keep the bulk of my makeup I'm
sorry if you can hear the dishwasher in
the background but trying to be a
productive human and actually let a
machine wash my dishes for me instead of
them sitting in there anyway this is
just like a classic train case a lot of
people have like Zuka bags and things
like that I would love to upgrade to
that I just am not there yet this is
what I got in school and I'm gonna stick
with it and tell
I'm ready to move on I really want to
find a storage solution after this it's
gonna work for a really long time for me
so I'm not in a rush to just buy
something to change this I really want
something that's going to work long term
so anyway let's get into this we'll
start with the top on this side these
are my liquid foundations these are from
the brand dermablend I have quite a few
different options here this is a medium
coverage foundation I find that it works
really well and I can usually get any
skin tone I want this is like what I
started with so I like to carry them
with me I can finde this out with 2:44
so I can get like a more sheer coverage
or I find that it just works well on the
body and stuff too so that's what I use
for like a liquid foundation in this
section here I have some concealers so
these are the Ben Nye concealer wheels I
have like a light one and a dark one I
really like these I got these again at
school so I'm kind of just going through
them once I get through this I'll
probably repurchase this like yellow
shade but other than that it's not that
it's bad it's just I want to try new
stuff but I don't want this to go to
waste the P shades are really great too
for like any darkness under the eyes
this is just a mini of the PI by under
eye for mac cosmetics it's in the shade
medium neutral I just put this in here
cuz it's small and I felt like it would
work for a lot of skin tones that I work
on
I just I'm like the type of person who
will pack a million things into my kit
as many as I could fit so I just have
that in there too some more cream
products these are from Ben Nye this is
just a white I like to keep this for
like just the most random stuff
sometimes you just need a white cream to
like run through the browser
you just never know so I like to have a
white on me I don't have much left I
need to get a new one this has been nice
ultra light it's just a really light
concealer it looks not white but it's
very very light so I like to keep this
just for like the fairest of fair skin
tones and then this is a like Coralie
shade I like to use this for under-eye
darkness or really just anything I can
also use it as a cream blush if I get
anyone that has more mature skin I have
another option for blush and the last
thing in that section was the by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder it's just a
translucent powder
it's very finely milled I like to just
have this in there - I have another
translucent powder again you'll notice
that I tried to fit as much as I can
into this box so
yeah have this translation we'll just
stick with this side so I'll do this
next drawer down here this is a pressed
translucent powder this is from black
opal and this is a powder that's
actually good for any skin tone so even
on darker skin tones it's not going to
turn ashy obviously I've used this a lot
this is great for like really fast stuff
or like touch-ups actually on set I
still really like the way a translucent
powder that's loose looks but sometimes
it's just so nice to just be able to
grab this and go sanitize it easy and
all that so I obviously need a new one
this is the Mac film noir
it's a blush but it's matte I got this
for contouring but I'm not sure if
that's gonna work for that I've never
used it yet but I have this just in case
kind of as a product like that so yeah
I'm just keeping it in there for the
moment because I bought it for
contouring and although I haven't had a
situation that I might need this yet or
tried it out I just like to keep it in
there currently I have two primers in my
kid this is the lorac I'm so sensitive
soothing face primer
this one's oil free silicone free this
is more of like a moisturizing primer
and then I have the Smashbox photo
finish primer this one is more of that
silicon based really smoothing I think
it fills in pores decently but I'm
working on building up a primer
selection I'd like to get some of the
makeup forever like the green one and
also like a more pore filling
specifically pore filling primer but for
now these totally work for me and I'm
glad to have two different options these
are the two concealers I got in the box
box from the Kat Von D Influenster thing
I use these in my kit they're really
nice I've used them on set they work
really well they are pretty thick but I
find you can still blend them out really
nice so I just keep them in here it's
nice to have a different option and I
like them it's nice to try them out on
other people back here this is kind of
like liners and sharpener so I have a
little sharpen arm this is the gel
eyeliner I have in here now this is the
Maybelline eye studio I don't recommend
this I like the essence one if you're
gonna go something cheap I don't know
about high-end wines Inglot also has a
really good one that's another one I
would be looking into getting but I
don't like this and then wax in there
this is a cake eyeliner sealer I just
keep this in here you just never know it
also will turn anything into like a
liner if I needed to I just think it's
like a good handy product that people
might not bring one
them but you have type of thing so I
like to have that on me what sir and
over here lots of stuff it's kind of a
crazy drawer so I have that Becca
highlighter in here
this totally crumbled in this so that
was kind of unfortunate I've tried to
press it back and I just try to be
really careful with it but I do like
having this because it fits so many skin
tones this is the rms cream highlighter
I had this because we were doing like a
glowy thing I just like to have this as
an option as you can see it also have
the Marc Jacobs one in there but it's
nice to have a cream highlighter option
this is the same yellow concealer that
was in the Ben Nye one I've just been
transferring it once that gets low into
there for one of my gigs it was like
more of a consistent gig we use this
every day on the girl so I was going
through it super fast so that's why I
keep this in here and now I just I just
have it in there this is the obviously
Naked basics from Urban Decay I like
having this it's like matte shade
there's a black these are good eyebrow
colors as well brow bone shades just a
really all-over good palette this is the
Bobbi Brown 1991 lip palette so I have
different lip colors in there as you can
see I've used some up this is really
nice to be using in school and even just
now sometimes you just need like a
random color and this had just like a
good amount of shades and options and
then the last two little polyps on that
side this is the Becca afterglow palette
and sorry to blind you
this has highlighters these three
highlighters and two blushes and again
it's just nice to have more options and
I like that there's so much in such a
small container and then this is the
Sephora and Pantone universe when
marsala was the color of the year and
it's just a highlighter and blush
palette I just brought this because it
has like a neutral neutral peachy
blushes which a lot of people like don't
mind this I'm gonna clean this out
actually once I finish taking all this
stuff out so I have the Too Faced shadow
insurance a glitter glue just in case
although I don't have any glitter in my
case I have to mascara options so this
is the Maybelline Great Lash in black
and this is the lash blast in brown I
really like this one because it doesn't
even have a wand or spoolie so there's
no way that it can get contaminated and
obviously if you're doing makeup on
other people you're not using this
bullies in the brushes that's part of
the reason that I don't mind you
like lower-end mascara our drugstore
mascara because I feel like the brush is
a lot of the times the thing that people
love and I'm usually putting fake lashes
on people anyway I only have two proper
eyebrow pencils these are from ELF this
one's in the shade taupe this one's in
medium brown or natural Brown I really
like these these work super well I do
want to upgrade to Anasazi eventually
but I use these on myself and I think
they're a great product this is just a
clear brow gel so I have one but again
I'd like to put the honest as you want
in my kit eventually I obviously have a
lot of different pencil liners in here
so this is a black Urban Decay
perversion I really like this liner
super black it does not say in the
waterline very well though so I just
want to kind of use this one up and then
get it out I brought this as an option
the Kat Von D black one this one is in
the shade of hero are more armor I don't
know I just bought this as an option but
this one I don't think stays in the
waterline well either so I wouldn't
necessarily have it I just haven't like
changed it out the black eyeliner that I
got to replace those is the Makeup
Forever aqua excel I get 40% off so I've
heard that these are really good they
stay on really well so that's the one I
got to replace those this is the next
flight on glide on eyeliner it's in like
a grey silver color but like a darker
one so I just have a different option
this one is the 24/7 crave pencil I
think it's like one of the velvet ones
another one from Urban Decay and hustle
it's like a bronze and then this one's
Rockstar it's like a deep purple and
then just for a nude option I have the
Rimmel scandaleyes one and nude I lied
about not having any other brow options
so I just again I'm the type of person
I'd like to have a million things
instead of just one option just in case
so this is the it brow power it's like
the universal shade this is the Ben Nye
one I got in school and hope it works
really well it's a nice cool tone color
so I like to have that just in case and
then this one's just like a dark brown
you can use it in the brows or as a
eyeliner so these I don't like use well
these two I don't use very often but I
have them in there like just in case
what I have isn't working last items in
here I have two of these liquid eyeliner
pens this is the Maybelline one this
sucks do not get it it transfers it
doesn't stay in place and then this one
is the Stila one I love this one and
then the last two things here these are
both from nude Stix this is the shadow
stick in the color spirit just first
watch it's just a nice
like ma veto P type of color just so I
have at least one shadow stick I never
really use shadow sticks though because
I'm not usually doing like anything to
editorial I feel like I'm just doing
basic makeup so it's not like a
must-have and then this is the concealer
pencil in deep 8 and this I just used
see I like scrape it off but this I use
as like a contour like a cream contour
okay let me clean this now this is like
real life to actually use my kid but I
do like to keep it as clean as I
possibly can how do you keep your
products and stuff is important now
let's move on to this bottom drawer here
so this is just a compact from
bareMinerals this has legs and mirrors
so I like to keep that just in case
people want to see what they look like
and we're on location or I don't know
it's just easy I also have a hand mer
though so this is another type of like
primer thing this is touch-up anti-shine
from Mehran and this is a great product
for really oily skin definitely like
males it's kind of like the Becca ever
matte where you put it on and it kind of
like completely mattifies the skin so
they recommended that in school that we
get it so I have that in my pendant this
is tarts exposed obviously just like a
classic blush like I said before I have
Marc Jacobs cream highlighter in
spotlight and then the last two things
in that section one's a Ben Nye cream
this is just like a cream color wheel I
like to have this again just in case I
need it you never know and it has all
the colors in there that I can make any
color and then this is the NARS dough
and kalahari I believe and I was using
this on set again every single day it's
just a nice neutral but a little bit
different than regular neutrals anyway I
was just using that often in a past go
this is kind of like my tool drawer I
guess you could call it I guess I do
have more timers I don't know what I'm
saying
so in that drawer I have a primer this
is the Laura behind-the-scenes it's
small and fits in there nicely I keep
like tools these are just like a pair of
tweezers I used to put on lashes or two
just like anything you need tweezers I
have a pair of cuticle scissors for
cutting lashes and other things I also
keep my lash glue so I have the dark one
that's my favorite and I use that the
most but I also have the clear white
line and
I do have two other face primers this is
a mini sample of the makeup forever step
one which is a smoothing
oh yeah smoothing primer so I guess that
could be for my pores and then this one
is a Revlon beyond natural it's kind of
like the Smashbox line I was just
running low on this so that's why I
added that one I probably should just
take this out and finish it up in my own
collection actually so yeah those are
all the top drawers now let's get into
the bottom that's where the bulk of a
lot of stuff is a lot of palettes
eyeshadows things like that so we'll
start with these these are from view set
is the brand I will leave a link down
below these are the Tahiti palette and I
use these for lipsticks so I have a
neutral one these are all nude lipsticks
of range of brands a range of finishes
it's so much easier to be able to just
scoop out of here put it on my palate
put it on the back of my hand and go
from here then to take it from a
lipstick bullet also it's so much less
space this fits 24 full-sized lipsticks
in here there's a better idea of the
colors but the 24 full-size lipsticks
fit in this container like I dug into
the container and everything so it's
just so nice to have so much available
to you in such a small amount of space
this is Reds and like berries and stuff
so that's what that looks like there on
the bottom and then this one here is
kind of like brights and stuff so I have
more bright colors hot pinks purples
like corley oranges and a blue I really
been liking that and so with that I also
have some cream color palettes this is
obviously like light/medium this one's
gonna be more like medium ish dark so on
the back there I had a lot of just
different cream products lying around my
collection and it's just so nice to have
all of them accessible to me at any time
I don't know how often I'm gonna go into
these but these are kind of for me the
just in case and also making sure I'm
actually getting use out of some of
those things I was keeping in my
question so again it's just like totally
eliminated so many extra products which
is so wonderful I feel like a lot of
this stuff's gonna get a little
redundant but this is just what my kit
looks like you should take from the
clients you normally do the situation's
you're normally in plus the products you
have and what you like to use but this
is the contour kit from Anastacio I use
this quite a bit
mostly for like these two shades
sometimes that shades so this is a
makeup forever palette and in here I
have the HD stick foundations but in the
refills I got these just
I'm out see if I like them and then once
I like use up a color I'm just gonna get
the full-size it's just a better value
but it is nice to have a more options
and I'd like to fill it up but I just
still like 12 dollars a piece of my
discount so you know I just thought I'd
get like a basic and go from there this
is like a random little tester palette
from the brand Sasha but this I really
like I really like the tones of these
are nice and warm and I feel like they
fit a lot of skin tones that I work on
this is a Tarte off the cuff holiday
palette I've been keeping this in my kit
and it works so well so these colors are
just so nice like I have some neutral
ones brighter ones and then this bronzer
I use I'm like everyone this I just
recently got and this is like the darker
type of powders from Ben Nye they're
super soft super buttery and these are
just great because I can use some of
these shades to warm up people's skin
tone but also use some of these again to
like contour and stuff with so I'm
excited to have this and use this in my
collection and my kit I think I might
get the light one eventually I just
haven't yet for most of my eyeshadows I
just have the lorac pro kit so I have
the one two and three I do like the
formula quite a bit and I like that
there are some pops of color so if
someone's like oh I want like an olivey
I can still do that without carrying
like crazy color palettes with me so
there's like garnet and the deep purple
and then this one here has like the
amethyst so these just work in so many
ways because they're thin they have
mattes and shimmers the formula is great
so I really like these I think I might
add the large ones in here too
eventually we'll see obviously it's like
how much space do you have Lauren I keep
both my glow kits in here and these are
for LA Nastasia this is the that this is
the gleam and this is that glow there
for two different like skin tone so this
is like for lighter skin tones and this
is for deeper I just like to have these
because you just never know what a
client's gonna want and also these are
great for like a body blow and so if
they're doing like an interview and you
want to pop on the shoulder or anything
like that you'll just be prepared for
that another blush palette type of thing
this is from NARS this is the Steven
Klein palette and this has Lagoona a
contour and highlight shade and then for
blushes again it's just nice to have
something high-end in here and these
work really well these are a little bit
softer than the other ones too so if
someone wants more like an understated
look I think this is great and the last
big thing makeup wise down there the
is my Z palette so these are all custom
shades that I put in here most of these
are makeup geek if you want to know
what's in this and 100% just let me know
and I can do like a video on that and I
love this palette this is what I was
using on myself but I just found like I
was always wanting it in my kit so I
just decided to put it in there and at
the very bottom I just have a palette
this is the Ben Nye just like plastic
palette and that's nice
to mix foundation mix anything you need
a lot of people have like little metal
ones those are nice too that's just what
I have to the side here all of these
powders these are all from Ben Nye the
neutral set is probably the one I use
the most is just translucent I also
really like the fair one for myself as
why it's gone a lot and then the luxury
powder and banana I use a lot as well
and then I just keep these other two in
here this is topaz and ebony just in
case again that's like my motto just in
case this here is a lease Watchi I think
it's how you say it it's just like a
really cute look at this you do that and
little spritz comes out it's like a
glitter spray I like having this just in
case they're showing again their chest
or shoulders or anything and they want
some things fancy if you like this just
kind of like ups my game a little bit
you know I'm like thinking of the
details this is the black opal
translucent loose powder so it's like
the equivalent of the press but again
loose I really like this one this is the
one I use the most often as opposed to
that one I have an eyelash curler in
there in the back here I have four of
these sticks from Stila it's hard to
grab these jeans I'm like shaking I have
four different ones these are sadly
discontinued but I absolutely love them
just to give you an idea of what they
look like
they look like this I use these on men
most of the time for men's grooming or
any like no makeup makeup these are
perfect for that and have quite a few
different shades that work well on a
variety of skin tones but I like to just
have these these I use more again for
like movie studs and things like that or
for like men okay last few products here
we're getting there guys so the last
things in that corner are these pallets
of this isn't a pallet I guess but it's
just like a big bronzer this is from G
washi and it is their bronzer I like
using this warm up people's skin tones
again I like it on guys where I just
feel like they're looking a little pale
sometimes the camera washes them out or
lie
does so this just gives them a little
bit of warmth just a little bit of life
as you can tell I'm really trying to
work on like my contour powders and just
finding those like perfect products that
work on the biggest variety so I did
pick these up from Wet n Wild the
contouring palette so this one's the
lighter one and I do like this and this
one's the darker one I like this banana
powder I really like these shades and
the colors although I will say sometimes
they just feel weird cuz they're wet and
wild you know so I'm still working with
those I do like them but it's nice to
have other options and then the last
thing that I have to show you is my
Tarte tartlet palette I didn't get any
use out of this when it was in my
collection but in my kit I use it all
the time so I'm so glad it's all matte
it has some great shades some nice
purple shades and it just overall works
really well I really like this okay so
that's everything in my kit I honestly
didn't like go through this and try to
like a make it perfect this is honestly
just like what I had in here I hope you
enjoyed I hope this maybe helped you if
you're looking to put stuff in your kit
there's anything you think that I
absolutely must have in my kit that I
don't I'd love for you to let me know in
the comments down below because I'm
always looking for new products to put
in here I get bored with stuff easy and
I switch it out so I hope you enjoyed
and if you want to stay tuned for part 2
that'll be up on my channel next and
that will be my set bag I will see you
in my next video guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
