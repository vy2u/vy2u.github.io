Lauren this is going to be part two of
my what's in my kit video this is going
to be my set bag this is what it looks
like so I'm gonna be going through this
in a similar way as the last kit if you
haven't seen that video it'll be linked
down below this just carries different
stuff than just like purely makeup in it
and it's all things though that I still
definitely need when I'm on set so but
if you want to know what's in my set
back then just keep watching this is my
set bag so a lot of people walk around
with these types of bags on set these
are things that you can easily just
bring with you and have a bunch of
products on the go maybe when you've
left the makeup room and you're either
on set if that's like far away from that
or whatever so I have not like made this
perfect for you guys this is like
literally what's in here so things might
not be in like the proper place or dirty
I'm cleaning it today so yeah just
warning you on that but let's get into
it this is just some products from the
Smashbox Studios when I was working
there you get like a free little baggie
full stuff let's start off with like the
side pockets here in the side pockets
there's three on each side
I like to keep my skincare stuff for the
most part so this is not skincare this
is just brush cleaner so obviously
that's a great thing to have this is a
lotion this is like the Cetaphil lotion
so it's great for a sensitive skin this
is what I normally use but I am trying
out different stuffs don't have another
lotion with me this is the simple eye
makeup remover micellar water I use this
just to remove any makeup if there's any
fallout under the eye if I don't do
foundation first I use this the next
bucket has mac fix+ this is like
basically out again I need to just put
this in my stuff so I'll just set that
over there and this is the code Aleve UD
elixir this is a really great facials
like mist I really like using this it
feels really luxurious which is nice for
clients and it's just a great for you
know prepping the face also does this
little set of bobby pins was in there I
like to just have a little bit with me
just in case and in the last pocket here
I just have some witch hazel that's what
I use as a toner this is 91 percent
alcohol uses for sanitation and also for
my alcohol palettes and this is 244 I
feel like I've talked to you guys about
this a lot 244 is like a still
koan liquid and you can use this to mix
it with foundations to thin them this is
great for making a lot of things
wearable for HD and just more like skin
like I really like this this stuff I use
all the time because I don't like too
heavy of a look let's lift this around
so in this next pocket on these three
this is the Murad hydrating toner this
is another just like facial spray that I
really like to use it also tones too
it's just another option and then this
is the Scandinavia finishing spray I
like to use this to set the face
afterward especially like for guys or if
I feel like something's looking too
powdery this is really nice I really
like it also in here I have some eye
masks so these ones are just from the
dollar store they work really well and
it's just kind of like a nice addition
to the makeup if someone has really
puffy eyes to just kind of put this on
underneath while you're working on the
lid and it just kind of helps your
makeup look the best it possibly can be
this is like a gel one I don't like to
spend like a ton of money on them but
sometimes just that cooling effect just
really helps to dip Hough or at least
the second pocket here is more like
tools it's actually the skincare I have
a little tiny roller lint roller in here
and I have a million of the spoolie is
in there I have a powder puff that's an
opened this is tape so that I can tape
my brown paper bags as trash's to my
chair or wherever I might need them I
have a few lip gloss ones and then I
also keep a lighter in here because
talent sometimes likes to smoke or
whatever it's just nice to have a
lighter just in general for anyone who
may need it and I'm telling you some of
those things you think are like what but
you're so glad when someone asks you and
you're like okay I have it it just makes
you look prepared for set so yeah and
then this next one here this only has
two things in it this is the beauty
blender cleanser I like to keep this on
me so I can play my Beauty Blender and
then this is the Eberly see a cream face
cream I really do like this and I
probably am gonna repurchase this once
I'm done with it now that the side
pockets are done let's move to the end
pocket so we'll start with this one as
you can see this has like a different
stuff so you could fit like a pack of
tissues in it and then you can unzip
and just pull the tissues I have not got
this set up that way they have some
Russians in here so I need to wash those
sometimes one like different people I'm
using doing makeup on different people
and touching up I like to like separate
where those brushes are so they're not
touching each other so yeah I have some
makeup wipes in here you guys know these
are my favorites these are the fel ones
and these are cucumber because I only
had cucumber when I went I keep a ton of
straws on me you need to have straws on
set with you definitely have straws this
is like number one a lot of times crafty
will have straws but sometimes they
don't so definitely enough straws on you
these are just some sponges and the last
thing in this compartment are just more
cotton swabs and so this is just kind of
I don't know to me all this type of
stuff to make sense to be together in
one pocket but it might not be for you
guys
so in this pocket sometimes I keep this
in other places but this is just hand
sanitizer I'm basically out so I need to
refill mine this is also where I keep my
beauty blenders these all need to be
washed but I just keep them in a bag
that can breathe like this and then in
here just cups these are just plastic
cups I use these to keep my brushes in
like dirty brushes when I actually set
up my station so pretty basic so now
let's get into the center part of this
so this is where I keep everything else
that I bring with me to set so the first
thing in here is this I actually just
upgraded to this like a kerlick
container but this has cotton rounds it
has q-tips in the middle and also I have
a sponge in there this is just easy it
looks really nice on setup and I don't
have to like get in there and and reach
for these things they're just already
ready to go this probably looks really
weird to you guys but these are like how
I mostly store my brushes these are my
most used brushes and these are just
like bag like sandwich bags that don't
have a closure on them these are all
clean ones and then these ones are dirty
I need to wash these so if I'm not able
to wash all my brushes on set then I'll
just like keep this contained and then I
can just throw this away I put a new one
on there it's all clean and ready to go
I just have found that that's like the
easiest way for me to work like that
that's like my number one is how can I
set up the fastest I also have a bag of
lashes in here I just keep all of my
lash
I bring a lot of different options I
need to add some in here I just bought
some I bring my brush cleaner with me
this is the cinema secrets I know a lot
of people like this it does work really
well but it's clogs every stopper I use
so I like the Berman industries one that
you can get at Namie's that's my
favorite so umm once they finish this I
already bought one of those so that will
be in here in this bag here I have even
more lip products so these are all like
liquid lipsticks lip glosses lip liners
anything I can't the pot into one of
those little it's that you guys saw in
the previous video so it's nice it's a
clear bag so you can kind of see what's
going on again I like to have more
options than less this is even more
sponges you don't need to bring those
many sponges with you I just tap them
all I have extra like bags here I
probably should split my lashes up and
put them in here but sometimes it's nice
just to have a clear bag to put maybe
the products that you are working on
with that person put them in here and
then you just have like kind of their
go-to bag and then the last thing in
this bag is a brush roll and this is
what I have like other brushes in just
in case I need them I just keep them in
there I honestly have never reached for
anything in this bag since I've been
carrying that bag in there but again I
like to just be like safe than sorry
okay guys I hope you enjoyed this video
I'm gonna go wash my brushes and sponges
and if you have anything that you think
I should keep in here that I don't have
that you find works really well for you
on set let me know I would love to know
any of your guys's tips and tricks and
secrets and that's everything Oh
actually I forgot to show you in this
side pocket here I like to keep paper
bags in this but I don't have any right
now and then I also keep a mirror it's a
little hand mirror for people to see
what they look like and gum gums always
a good one and mints are good too in
case they can't like be chewing gum
anyway okay um I will see you guys have
a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
