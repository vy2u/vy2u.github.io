its Lauren today I thought I would film
for you what I'm going to be bringing to
Las Vegas I'm leaving for Las Vegas in
just a couple of days which I am
planning to vlog we'll see how that goes
vlogging is really weird and kind of
hard for me so I think it'd be really
fun but we'll see how it goes I thought
it would show you guys all the makeup
that I'm going to be bringing I haven't
done like a what's in my travel bag or a
travel makeup type of video before so I
thought it would be fun I am only going
to be out of town for like two days like
we're gonna be leaving Wednesday and
we're coming back friday so it's not
like I need to bring this much makeup
but I think it's pretty pared down for
what I'm used to bringing with me and I
picked a lot of these items either
because they're in project pans or
because their Luck's I've been loving so
I'm just gonna get into the makeup items
i'll be bringing i did want to mention
that this is what I carry my makeup in
when I travel my mom got me this its
primary Shane obviously and it just has
a bunch of different pockets and then
usually I'll separate it by different
areas of the face so this is usually
base makeup then i'll have like bronzers
and blushes and stuff then this will be
like eyeliners and I products and then
this one will be lips that's usually how
I pack it but since I'm not going to be
using or bringing as much stuff I
probably won't be that insane with it
but i just thought i'd show you this
just if you wanted to know how I pack it
cuz one little bag is definitely not
enough for me I am hoping that with this
trip I can have the whole bottom one
just be my brushes hopefully we'll see i
am bringing two different primers this
is my Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer I love this for filling in my
pores I use it every single day no
matter what other primer i'm using and
then just to try to use this up i am
going to bring the Stila one-step primer
and just use that in conjunction with it
I think that's all I bring I might bring
my clinic one actually two yeah I'm
probably gonna bring my clinique one
actually now that I'm thinking about it
so I'll be bringing that one it's the
universal face primer i believe for
foundation I'm bringing essentially two
different options the first option is my
Revlon color whipped foundation in the
shade ivory and
I mix it with this BB cream from pure
lease or however you say that so
together these make the right shade and
it kind of cuts the consistency of the
Revlon lip which is so thick and I've
really been enjoying it i've been
wearing it like the last week or so and
i have been really liking it it's what
i'm wearing on my face today oh my gosh
is that like fallout hmm looks like it
okay anyway doesn't it look like this
fall out I don't know any what's up
right in this it's a little brighter now
maybe that'll stop me from seeing the
fallout okay anyway so I've been using
this and I have been liking it so I want
to continue using it because this isn't
a project pan and I want to get it out
of my collection and just be done with
it Plus this is my March mini madness
which it probably won't be finished by
then because um it's too dark and it's
pretty has pretty good coverage so
together eventually they will get done
well put them in the bag as I show you
them it's like I packing and filming and
the other foundation i'm going to bring
is this one from pure cosmetics you guys
have seen this a bunch it's just a
powder foundation i'm bringing this just
in case they're one of the days which
I'm only they're technically wonderful
day but if I just can't be bothered and
we're like in a hurry or something I can
just easily whip this on and it won't
take a long time so I'm just bringing
this as a precaution so the other like
liquid products for my face I am
bringing my bourgeois bronzing primer I
really like this and I have been getting
back into it now that i have been using
cream foundation or liquid foundation so
i am going to be bringing that again
just to get more use out of it and then
i am bringing one concealer this is the
instant age rewind from maybelline and
just trying to get use out of that again
a lot of these are project items because
if it's all I have to use for sure it's
what I will be using plus i find that
usually if i put something on a project
unless i just absolutely hate it i can
find a way to make it work and then it
just becomes a part of my routine and it
is just what i'm actually using the next
item i'm going to be bringing is my 8th
cosmetics bye-bye poor loose setting
powder i'm bringing this
because i use this to set my face and
I'm not expecting or hoping to use the
pressed powder foundation so I need
something to be able to set my face and
I have been enjoying using this with my
Beauty Blender so I'll like blend
everything in I blend my foundation then
the bronzer than the concealer and then
I use this with the Beauty Blender too
and I've really been liking the way that
looks on my skin so bring in them for
the rest of my face products I'm pretty
basic so I'm bringing my Smashbox
contour trio because again i'm working
on the bronzer and the contouring powder
from this palette in a project and plus
they're just my everyday powders that
i've been using anyway so i want to
bring that i'm only bringing one blush
because i am trying to hit pan on this
and i just want to have one option so
that way I'm always using this and
getting the most work and use out of
this product but for highlighters I'm
doing a little something fun I decided
to bring my highlighting kit glow kit
from anastacio and I just haven't been
using this when I first got it I used at
a time and I really really like them i
am wearing it today and i just think
that it's so pretty but i've been using
eyeshadow as highlights for a while
because i'm trying to hit pan on so many
eyeshadows this year and for the trip i
thought it'd be fun just to bust this
out and use it and if they're just so
beautiful so i'm excited i'm excited to
have fun and play around with this
palette well i'm in vegas I'm just
bringing my normal eyeshadow primer I
forgot to bring it so um it is right now
the dietary hyaluronic I shadow primer I
really have been enjoying it and I'm
just trying to use it so what's
something I use every day for eyeshadows
I am bringing three different palettes
so the first one comes as no surprise
this is the two-faced peanut butter
palette I've been loving this palette
you guys know what it looks like and I
just want it with me I just sleep with
this at night so I want to bring it I am
also bringing this wet and wild
California roll again this isn't a
project I did use the red shade today as
like a transition color and to just warm
up Mike Reiss really like this look and
so basically what I tried to do is
recreate this look with as few palettes
as possible because I didn't want to
bring everything but I fig
I might want to wear this look again on
Thursday or something so I wanted to
make sure I'd have the tools to do it
and that's part of the reason I'm
bringing this to because the gold shade
here I can use on the lid even though
that's not what I'm using on the lid
today I figured I could still recreate
this look using this palette using the
california roll palette and then the
other palette i'm bringing is the lorac
Pro again I can use some of these shades
to create this look but I just have
really been liking this palette my go-to
kind of look with this is a nectar rose
a and mocha they're just such pretty
shades all together I actually have a
tutorial that I filmed really early on
I'll leave a link down below if you want
to see what my go to look is with those
if you just want to see it i know i
haven't done a tutorial in a long time
i'm sorry but i really i just really
like this palette and I feel like the
lorac pro 2 doesn't get as much love as
the one which I do prefer the one but I
think this is still a really great
palette and it just has some nice
neutrals if I just want to do some easy
no-brainer looks I really don't need all
this palettes but usually i will just
bring like so much like so much stuff so
I feel good about the pallets that I've
bringing we'll talk about browse for a
second I'm going super simple I'm not
even bringing any brow powders not even
that little quad that I use all the time
bringing two brow pencils this is the
one I'm trying to use up so I want to
bring it but I am bringing my maybelline
define a brow in case i just cannot be
bothered I don't want to deal with how
little this guys getting cuz it is kind
of hard or if it's just I just can't be
bothered I just want to have a backup
kind of option + this writes on my skin
a lot better than the vincent longo one
so if I feel like it's being like
temperamental or I'm not being able to
get the coverage I want on my skin this
will come in handy and then I'm just
bringing my clear brow gel to set that
and I've been liking that look too
without any powders it just is a little
bit more natural but honestly again I
switch at my brows all the time I am
bringing the shadow stick because i did
use this as a base for my eyes today and
again if i want to recreate this look i
will be using this this is the kate moss
rose gold shadow pencil i don't know if
you can still get this but i just
mentioned it in my rehal video and i
wanted to make sure that i actually
at least give it a try i did enjoy it
today and i kind of want to use it a
couple more times before I make a
decision on it so yeah I I don't know I
enjoyed it and if I want to recreate the
look the whole reason I even created
this like was to use this product okay
liners we'll talk about liners I'm
bringing four different liners the first
one is this white pencil this is from
stila and it is in the color pearl it's
just a white creamy eyeliner I really
like it and I've been enjoying having a
white eyeliner in my eyes especially
what I'm doing looks with a lot of pink
or red it just kind of separates the
pink from my eye a little bit so that it
looks still like it's on purpose instead
of like totally sick or something I'm
bringing my other steel liner in the
convertible color style that's in indigo
I've been using that last couple of days
and I just tight line with that and the
other pencil liner I bringing it's this
one from Mary Kay and this I've been
just using on my lower lash line and
I've been smudging it out with my finger
you know my style last i'm bringing a
liquid liner this is Dolly winks black
liquid liner this is just in case I want
to do any wings I probably well but I
just in case I get the itch I just want
to have it with me so that I can do that
if I want and because some of those are
regular pencil liners I am bringing the
Urban Decay grindhouse pencil sharpener
that's so nice all the time and then for
my vincent longo brow pencil i'm
bringing the little one because it's a
especially tiny brow pencil it has to
have its own sharpener so i need to
bring both of those technically still
liners but not as useful these are
glitter liners again just to recreate
the look i'm doing today plus it's vegas
oh i thought of course you should
probably bring some glitter the Urban
Decay one is in the color baked and
again the Sephora one is in VIP gold I
use them all the time you guys have seen
that as a ton of time so you know I just
like those I'm bringing two mascaras
this one is the lash trifecta from
Milani I've really been enjoying that
mascara I think it works really well and
then this is the lash domination from
bareMinerals i'm using this in my march
mini madness so i'm just using this till
the end of march and we will be there at
the end of march so i just want to use
it for the rest of the time it's almost
out i can tell it's getting a lot more
dry and i have been enjoying that
mascara too honestly I have pretty nice
lashes
if I do say so myself I feel like once a
mascara either dries out enough and it's
not too wet or once I learned how to
work with it I can make almost any
mascara work my biggest issues are like
smudging and the bare minerals one does
smudge if i put on my lower lash line so
i just don't put it on my bottom lashes
I only put on my top but the top ones
look really nice that's what I'm wearing
today last for lips I am bringing
technically really one lip product this
is buck Sims dolly it's what I wear
every day i love it i'm wearing it today
i'm wearing it like all the time i love
this lip color and i am putting this in
a project and i'm excited because i
think that I'll actually do well with a
lip product finally but I'm kind of sad
because then it will be gone and I'll
have to fight another lip product that I
like just as much I thought I would just
mention this Nivea lip butter I am
bringing this as well this is something
I use at night time I won't be using it
in the day but I am bringing that too so
those are all my makeup products i'm
going to bring with me to Vegas I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and this is
kind of like a mix between I feel like
my travel bag but also just kind of
products I've been using lately as much
as I love switching it up I do at least
for like a couple days like three to
five days kinda use the same makeup
products and then I might switch so it
just makes getting ready a little bit
easier plus I find that's just my style
to is like really really liking
something and then moving on and then
really really liking something so anyway
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
