Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another tube talk yeah
I mentioned in a previous video that I
wanted to do some tube tops I read out
some topics and you guys told me
basically all of them but you definitely
wanted the drama one you wanted the one
on the 50s article which I'm going to do
I just want a little bit more time with
the journal one I know some other people
have made content about that kind of
recently and I want to watch those
videos and definitely incorporate them
into mine and like you know kick around
those thoughts because I know you guys
have probably watched those videos as
well and kind of just include them in
the discussion so I want to be able to
do that and I just don't feel prepared
for it at the very very moment so we're
talking about when small creators become
big creators and kind of just I don't
know just kind of like delving into that
topic I don't have like a specific
opinion necessarily either way this is
more of like a exploration type of video
we're just exploring the topic these are
just some things that come to mind when
I think about this topic and the reason
I wanted to talk about this is because I
see this all the time in the comments
and it'll be comments on my video
comments and other people's videos about
how they love to watch small creators
and they don't watch big creators
anymore I've said that myself on my
channel that I really enjoy smaller
creators as opposed to you know the
people with millions of subscribers are
hundreds and thousands of subscribers
and as my channel has been gaining some
success which is so amazing thank you
guys so much it's so awesome it makes me
wonder you know what happens if / when I
become a bigger creator and I know a lot
of you guys if your creators yourselves
you might be like well you already have
like about 20,000 subscribers learn like
you are a big creator and I am I mean
like I mean I'm not but I am like that's
a lot of people you know let's put that
into perspective 20,000 people that's a
lot of people I'm thinking as more
success comes are people gonna say that
about me well you know I want to still
be a big creator that people want to
watch and so what does that mean why are
people saying that why do I say that so
I want to know what does it mean when
people say that they like smaller
creators or they only watch smaller
creators and what does that mean for me
what does that mean to them kind of just
you know how do we navigate this
as these smaller channels that were
gravitating to now actually gain success
because we're following them because
we're giving them exposure what's going
to happen when they become big are we
going to just drop off and find a new
crop of people or is this maybe a change
that's coming up in the beauty community
that we aren't going to have these same
people even as these creators become
larger ok let me take a breath I got my
handy dandy notebook with me and we're
just gonna we're gonna tell them into it
as always you know I have my two top
playlists I'll leave it linked and I'd
love hearing your guys's thoughts in the
comments so definitely leave your
thoughts whether they're good bad
positive agreeing disagreeing I love
hearing up I love reading them so as I
was thinking about this topic I was
trying to be like okay why do people say
this that they don't like big creators
they don't watch people with a lot of
subscribers like what is it about a lot
of subscribers that makes people not
want to watch them or whatever for
whatever reason gravitate to people with
smaller channels something that I kept
thinking at least for myself is that
this points out I think the distrust
again that people have with large
creators and I've talked about this in a
ton of different tube talks I feel like
this is a common thread is that as
creators get bigger it's harder to trust
them and there's a couple of reasons why
but I think it again it just boils down
to that distrust that we have we have
trust issues in the beauty community we
need therapy all there are some major
issues and I think that as subscribers
we've been traumatized so even sometimes
when maybe a creator maybe just makes
one mistake or maybe doesn't even really
do a mistake just does a sponsored video
we have a lot of backlash at that
because we have a lot of trauma from
past things that have happened with
other creators and other drama
situations that have happened where we
feel very sensitive to those things and
we don't want any of those things these
are the changes that I've seen
influencers as they grow that kind of
lead to those trust issues things that
people don't like the first thing that I
personally don't like is that it seems
again we don't know these influencers
they only show us what we see on the
camera I like to give people the benefit
of the doubt and I honestly think that
it's hard to judge people you don't know
in person
look it's just too difficult guys anyway
sometimes it can feel based off of what
we do see
that they kind of are potentially
feeling like their celebrity and in a
lot of ways that kind of are I mean
think of the way we think about them we
think we put them on a pedestal we you
know praise them we love the way they
look we want to know every little thing
about them if we got to meet them in
person oh my gosh can you imagine like
we do this to them so we need to take
some responsibility in this I think that
some of that Fame and exposure can kind
of get to their head potentially can
make them feel more important than maybe
they are you know it's like we're still
all just humans on this planet I don't
care how big of a celebrity you are you
can still you know be a nice person and
take time with people be caring and kind
and honest but I think that that's a big
change that we see and because of that
increasing celebrity I find that that
kind of clashes entirely with the idea
of YouTube YouTube is like you are
sitting in your room and you're filming
and you're just telling your friends
about what you like and it's not this
widely produced thing you're just
telling your honest thoughts and you
know putting yourself out there you're
raw you know and one of the things that
we do with people we see in YouTube is
we relate to them you know we're like oh
they're just like us oh there's someone
across the country who I totally get
that we're so similar I love them they
make me laugh they make me cry they
suggest great products because we both
have the same skin type and whatever it
is and so that that first connection
that we have with someone where we're
like oh my gosh like I know this person
I would be their best friend in real
life that changes as they become more
like a celebrity they don't seem as
relatable they don't seem as accessible
and as real as they once were when we
start to almost turn against them even
though we're the reason we've given them
this fame right and so to me I don't
think that it's actually about the
numbers like I don't honestly think that
that's the main issue that we have I
don't think that it's oh I don't like
them because they have a million
subscribers that's not why you don't
like them you don't like them for all
these other reasons and they have been
to also have a million subscribers which
is maybe how they've become this way but
that's not them
Rison does that make sense so it gives
me help like that you guys will actually
like me if I ever became somewhat
successful on this platform please don't
hate me y'all damn but instead I think
some of the things that we don't like
and that cause us to just kind of get
bored and tired is the over produced
videos again like I said it's like
you're sitting in your living room or
you know you're just not perfect we're
not perfect people and I think the more
success you get the more you strive to
make a better video produce higher
quality content and sometimes that can
backfire sometimes we don't want it to
look like it was made in a studio in LA
or that it actually was made in a studio
in LA
like we enjoyed watching you when you
were sitting in your living room
wherever you were and you know even as
you grow you can still sit in your
living room and film there there's
nothing wrong with that but that usually
changes and it's overproduced the
editing is amazing which sometimes is
really nice because I think we can all
agree that sometimes when you watch a
video that isn't edited and it's just
like bad you're just like I can't I'm
falling asleep you know so there's
definitely a balance to that as I've
talked about before in the brand trip
video I think that as people get bigger
and they have the opportunity to work
with brands which is so amazing guys
like right isn't that amazing sometimes
that can feel like they are bought by
the company so you have the stress with
them before you love the products they
recommended but now as they've gotten
bigger and you can tell that more of
their videos are sponsored or maybe
they're getting a lot of product sent to
them I think that has really given a lot
of people about taste in their mouth and
I honestly think it's so sad because as
I am getting more opportunities
personally I can tell that I've been
getting better opportunities bigger
opportunities whether it's just being
sent more products or buy more renowned
brands or potential you know
sponsorships down the line or whatever
it is there's this part of me that knows
no matter what no matter how much I love
the products actually if the word
sponsored is at all in the title you are
flushed away with every other person
who's ever done a bad sponsored review
or video and it sucks it totally sucks
that has totally been ruined
because it doesn't have to be but I also
stoat Alesi decide if I have seen so
many sponsored videos or it's just like
it's a bad fit you know I'm taking
sponsorships for things that don't work
or taking sponsorships over and over not
disclosing them and just trying to sell
to you products and so I see both sides
but I definitely think that is one of
the reasons that people don't enjoy
larger channels I already kind of talked
about this but again that relatability
and that authenticity kind of just goes
out the window when you start doing
sponsored videos when you start getting
bigger when you start showing things and
products that most people can't afford
you're just not as relatable like oh
you're rich celebrity type you are more
similar now to Justin Bieber than you
are to me and that was not the case at
the beginning and I think that's like
hard to deal with depending on the
person and how they you know confront or
talk about that those issues and present
those products and whatnot and then
something that has lately been I think a
really big issue which I kind of want to
talk all about this and its own video
but I think there's a big divide between
people I don't know I don't get it
people really hate when people make
YouTube their full-time career there is
something people have opinions about it
so much and the weird thing about
YouTube is is like it's just really raw
platform where you can get on and you
can talk to your subscribers and be open
and honest and authentic with them but
once it becomes your job or you've
chosen for it to be your main source of
income it's now a business right so if
you start talking about negatively about
your job and your business which is
natural for anyone to do anyone at all
to do you know everyone has a bad day at
work or you know has frustrations when
it comes to work and obviously YouTube
has its own set of frustrations whether
it's really negative comments or you
know maybe you're not getting the views
you want
it's just weird when you tell your own
subscribers those things because they're
the reason and they're the ones watching
you and then it feels like you're
complaining about them but you're not
you're complaining just about your job
in the frustrations that you have in
general and all of that and it can get
really really weird and that definitely
I get it I think that is super weird and
like just like not a good move and you
definitely need someone other than your
subscribers to talk to you about like
frustrations in your life because it
definitely can come off as like
ungrateful even though it's not
necessarily it can come off as just like
very privileged ooh you don't even
realize I hear I see comments all the
time about people being like you don't
know what it's like to work a
nine-to-five and you YouTube is in a
real job or you know if you don't like
it then try actually working something
real and all that and I get those
comments for sure this is getting off to
a whole nother topic I'm telling you if
you want a video on it we can talk about
it that starts to become a really big
divide once a youtuber gets a lot of
success and we all know that there is a
lot of money coming in and so no longer
are you guys relatable in that sense
where it's like Han just a person with
like a normal and come talk to you and
you're like oh my gosh yeah I know it's
expensive right girl ah instead it's
like look at my expensive bracelets look
at my fancy cars and it doesn't have to
be about that and also we shouldn't
shame people who do have success and
have this stuff if they want to have it
and they want to buy and spend their
money on that and that makes them happy
I am so happy for them but sometimes it
can feel like they're flexing they're
flexing on their subscribers and it's
kind of like why are you throwing that
in my face man like I'm happy for you
but you also make it hard to be happy
for you sometimes you know so I think
that's one of the reasons that you you
know we tend to stop liking these bigger
beauty channels and another one when
people make it their job and I think
just get comfortable or bigger they
start being safe with their content and
there they aren't making content that is
as you know original they aren't taking
chances one they don't want to like cut
their pay I guess I don't know what it
is they want to do stuff that's safe
they want to do stuff that people they
know are gonna like although I feel like
you guys are hurt you've already made it
like you have the opportunity to make
some more risky choices with your
channel and see where it goes you know
but anyway that's another thing I think
it can just get kind of stale and boring
and bored and you want to see them
evolve and if it's not evolving it can
seem kind of tired eventually I think I
covered all of some of that stuff now
something for me is it's like I want to
bring up something because like I've
said in these videos before where the
is kind of like an interesting take or I
feel like I have an interesting tick I
don't know you guys can decide that but
not only am i creator but I do love
YouTube I love watching YouTube
I love seeing people's channels and just
in general I like to consume a lot of
content myself so it's hard because as a
creator it feels like when I see those
comments that people like root for you
when you're small or rooting for you
well first they don't root for you at
all they never watch your channel no
they just don't know you exist you know
when you're starting off you just you
just don't have the exposure and you're
you're working hard you're hustling
you're trying to like you know make
videos make good content up your content
as much as you can get new ideas out
there try to be different but be
yourself and all these things and you're
working hard and you start getting and
following and it's so amazing and people
like you and they're rooting for you and
they're like oh my gosh you're my
favorite youtuber I love your content
you're gonna blow up I can't wait to see
you be successful and then you see these
comments and I are at least I see these
comments that are like I only watch
smaller youtubers and I'm like oh I hope
that if I ever make it you will actually
support me when I make her and I think
that just in general when it comes to
anyone famous I'm not just talking about
youtubers now and I'm definitely not
talking about me but you know I think
that's something that we as people like
to do we want to see people succeed we
want to see them succeed
we're so excited for them yeah yeah
they're doing it we're written for them
we're cheering in the crowd oh but then
when they fail the first time they fail
or then when something goes wrong we
also love to pick them apart
we love to break them down we'd love to
see the drama we love to see just them
flame out like we almost root for that
once they're on top well they can't be
perfect they can't do this like it's
crazy I'm not saying that I don't do
that to some people in some celebrities
and whatnot I think that we all do it at
some point and I think that's something
to keep in mind you know like how much
of it is on us how much of it is on the
actual influencer I definitely think
that's something that happens when it
comes to just celebrities and anyone
who's like a famous person as much as
we'd love to see the success we love to
see the decline we love it you know we
eat it up that's kind of everything that
I had written
here and I don't know if I exactly
covered it but overall I guess to recap
it I really just think that people are
fed up with the old ways of YouTube
beauty gurus or and I'm being very
hopeful when I say old ways because they
are the continuing ways but I definitely
agree with Jen that there is a change
coming and that you know people just
want something different and so when I
see people leaving those comments saying
that they don't like the bigger
youtubers and they like the smaller
youtubers I think that putting it into
the context of like what they actually
don't like if they don't like you know
overly selling to them they don't like
people being untrustworthy and not being
honest in their reviews and you know
just in general about their life they
don't like seeing people you know part
of the drama or living life like you
know debutantes and celebrities as much
as you know people can live how they
want to I'm not trying to tell people
how to spend their money or how to live
I think that's really what the issue is
and it's not necessarily about the
numbers and I'm hoping that as new
creators emerge they can hold on to
those values even when it gets tough
even when you get maybe quite a bit of
money to do something that's maybe not
morally cool I really hope that we can
stick to our guns and you know not let
money changes because in the long term
and I think for me it's like I'm just
someone who thinks about the long term
it's like it's about you guys and it's
about me it's not about these brands and
the money and if it is gonna be about
the money I hope that you can find a way
to make it work because I definitely
think there is my channel is a mix of
hey I bought this awesome cool thing
here it is here's my honest review and
also like hey you guys don't need
everything here's some you know
suggestions for things you might have in
your collection already I found a way to
try to strike a balance between the two
instead of just being all about buying
and instead of only being about panning
I'm trying to find a balance and I think
that there's a way to do it if you're
creative and you are passionate about
finding a way to make two things
actually work and to fit into your
morals as well as be successful and
that's what I'm gonna try to do with my
channel as I grow I hope you guys will
be there for that I think you will I
think we have a good connection anyway
I'm gonna leave it here I'm getting off
topic and I hope I covered this topic
sufficiently but I would love to hear
your comments can't wait to see the guys
have to say and I will come up with more
tube tops soon I promise
I might fill in some of these when I go
back home for Christmas because I don't
know I'm just try to prove them as much
as I can while I'm out here so ok that's
enough I will see you guys thank you so
so much for watching I appreciate you
thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
