Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought we would talk about some
old makeup makeup that I feel like has
gone missing
so this video is gonna be about a ton of
products that were really hyped up a ton
of videos were made about these products
and then I feel like we're there yet
you know why is no one talking about
these this video is just to kind of
spark discussion I think there's like
two main things if you have these
products hopefully it'll like you know
get you to bust them out and use them
again that might be a cool thing and
rediscover them within your collection
also I think it's a really good note on
just how trendy and how many different
releases that really are you almost
forget all these different things that
have come out and it was definitely a
trip down memory lane most of the stuff
I don't own myself and obviously
everyone's like feeds and videos that
they watch are different but I feel like
I saw so many videos on this stuff and
then now I barely hear about them maybe
one or two people talked about it but
it's kind of like they've just you know
disappeared and I just want to mention
really fast if you are interested in
this type of video I'm gonna leave a
video from page or a thrifty beauty down
below I'm also gonna leave a video from
lechia they both did things kind of
similar to this where they're talking
about products that just no one cared
about in 2017 products that were just
kind of like left behind and I feel like
these are all in a very similar vein so
I think you guys would enjoy those
definitely go check them out and
subscribe they're awesome okay so enough
of an intro let's get into them the
first one I want to talk about is the
Too Faced natural love palette now I
feel like there was definitely some
contention so people were like this is
the most boring palette ever and then a
lot of people got NPR and we're using it
and making tutorials I feel like I
remember Mariah Leonard doing a video on
this is really pretty it was like with
the pink and the orange which were like
the only two fun colors on the entire
palette and it looked so pretty on her
and I just remember like this is
something that I don't want because I
know it's so boring but there's
something about it that's like tempting
it was really weird I don't know why I
felt like that but now I seriously have
seen no one talking about this I don't
even like see it at all it's like it
never existed
and I would love to know like with this
product and other products if you guys
have these if you still love them if you
don't like what you think about them I
would love to know in the comments but
that's the first one I don't know where
that went
yeah it was like a big pallet it was
expensive definitely not something
normal for Too Faced I feel like the
only thing normal about it was that it
was a bunch of neutrals and then it also
reused a ton of shades that they already
had an existing palette but other than
that it was a little bit different but I
hear nothing about it now next is pretty
vulgar cosmetics and I'm just talking
about the line in general I remember
when I first came to the Sephora site
people freaked out and we're like buying
so much of it and I just don't really
hear much about it I know Liv loves her
makeup likes one of the palettes it's
like the more cool toned one and I think
that Rob UD Chrissy like put the
highlighter in her favorites video but
other than that I just feel like
everyone bought stuff and then it just
kind of fizzled out it's definitely not
like a ton of staple products I don't
see them coming out with new products I
don't see them like sending out PR so I
feel like them as a brand is kind of
just forgotten I don't know let me know
what you guys think about that one I
feel like the most recent thing on this
list is the Too Faced I want candy
collection and this one kind of makes me
sad I'm not someone who like watched a
ton of candy Johnson videos but I think
she's beautiful I think she's super
talented and you know like I want
collabs with youtubers to be awesome but
I feel like this one had a lot of hype
and they sent out a lot of stuff and
tried to kind of make it a thing and
then it just wasn't ever like a thing I
know April has talked about the palette
and really likes it but other than that
I just feel like I didn't see much with
the release I don't know I it kind of
was just like this letdown like there's
some steam and then nothing happened and
I don't know let me know if you got
anything from that collection honestly
this is just like a poll like I just
want to know did people buy this stuff
and if you did again I hope that maybe
you'll like be like oh yeah I love that
product and you can use it now next are
these Smashbox cover shot palettes I
actually own one of these in the ablaze
one which is the really like warm toned
ready orange colored one I believe these
are still available I'm not sure I
thought they were supposed to be limited
edition so I picked mine up and I think
they might still be available
these are really great pallets I really
like the one I have I haven't used it in
forever so I should bust mine out but I
feel like you know everyone was getting
sent these I think that's like some one
of the issues with so much makeup coming
out that it's just hard to stay on top
of like showing all the new stuff but
also using all the old stuff and it kind
of sucks as consumers because we want to
buy whatever the like youtubers are
using and if it's constantly new stuff
it's hard to keep up with that so that
is something that I feel like what
happened to them they're really great I
wish more people would talk about them
next are the Kylie pallets I feel like
in general Kylie cosmetics just has
gotten so much hype I feel like it's
dying down just the littlest bit but
when it comes to her palettes there's
always so much like craziness when it
comes to the release of them and then I
feel like when I look back now at all
the different releases she's done since
she started her brand I don't know
really why we haven't heard much about
them I know there's like the burgundy
palette as well as the Royal Peach
pellet which what happened with that I
know there was like it's chemically and
whatever but like no one's talked about
it since there was like a weird
Valentine's Day like journal thing that
was weird but no one talks about it
anymore
I honestly wonder who bought all this
stuff like that's something I think like
I just think like where is all this
makeup
we need a detective on the case next I
was watching something I went through
and was like trying to do research and
like looking back at like bigger
youtubers videos to see what videos they
had made and if these products were like
oh yeah where'd that go or oh what
happened to that and something I saw was
the Becca Chrissy Teigen palette and I
was just thinking in general I feel like
a lot of the Becca Faced palettes just
like have a lot of hype at first and
then I never see people using them and
that could be partially because on
YouTube as creators sometimes people
don't like using limited edition stuff
if people can't get their hands on it
currently I'm so maybe that has
something to do with it but like I never
see anyone busting out the Jacqueline
Hale palette I never see anyone busting
out the Chrissy Teigen palette like I
don't see these becca palettes after
they're gone they're just like hyped
when they first come out and then after
that i'm like where they had though
because those are expensive I think I
have quite a few more on this list still
I don't even know if the point of this
video it's like I'm making the same
point after every single item so sorry
but I don't know let me know if you like
it let me know if you like this type of
video or not next I wanted to talk about
the Katy and desi Joseph colors
collaboration now this is something that
got a ton of hype and it's a little bit
more recent than some of the other
things I mentioning but I honestly don't
feel like I hear that many people
talking about this anymore I would love
to see some cool tutorials again is this
is it just this is making me realize as
I said and do this video about yeah it's
just on to the next one and no one can
actually like use and enjoy their
products because it's always a new thing
is that why is that why that happens we
just forget about things and tuck it
away into drawers this had like a lot of
cool stuff in it I think the color is
really pretty and it was received pretty
well from like people who were reviewing
it but just on to the next I guess I'm
only going to talk about a couple more
things I mean this goes without saying
that the Too Faced sweet peach
collection in general was insanely
popular and I'm talking about the
initial release with the first sweet
peach palette not the newer stuff like
with the peachy matte foundation and the
peachy matte palette and stuff I really
wanted to try those like oil lip glosses
that were peach scented I heard really
good things about those but I don't
really hear anything now the blush is
something I have heard a little bit
about and people really like the Papa
don't peach blush and then there was the
other palette with the bronzer and
highlighter and the blush in the middle
really pretty I mean it was one of those
things that because of the packaging and
all of that that people were so tempted
I know I was really tempted by that
collection and then now looking back I
really don't hear much about it actually
if I do hear anything it's usually kind
of negative especially when it comes to
that bronzer highlighter blush palette
so I don't know at the end of everything
I want to be like so yeah like that's
the only ending I have because I don't
know what else to say about these
products and the fact that they're just
in the makeup wasteland and the last
thing I want to mention is the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills Aurora palette I feel
like the moonchild palette got so much
hype and although it's definitely not
for everyone
I think a lot of people really liked it
and it was something new for the makeup
world no one had really done something
quite like that in the same way as them
whereas now it's out and that's happened
so much but I feel like the Aurora
collection I was so excited to see a
second palette from them I thought it
would be amazing I feel like I saw quite
a bit on social media maybe not as much
as a lot of other releases but on
Instagram I saw Jake gets to do a video
and it just didn't I don't I don't see
anything about it I don't hear anything
about it yeah I don't know what happened
with that one I think that the trend of
like color highlighters is dying a
little bit so maybe that's part of it
being like you know kind of not talked
about anymore but it definitely has gone
silent and I think a lot of honest
Ozzy's releases get a lot of hype so
it's kind of surprising to see that no
one really talks about that one anymore
well this video turned out a little bit
differently than I had imagined it to be
so hopefully it wasn't too repetitive
mostly I just wanted to talk about some
items that I feel like I don't where
they you know and hopefully if you have
these items and you do really like them
I can remind you that you have them and
you can pull them out and use them and
love them and enjoy them okay I'm done
talking let me know if you like this
type of video or if you know where you
can structure it a little bit
differently I thought I had it all down
and then comes to filming and I felt
like I lost it a little okay
anyway that's everything thank you so so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
