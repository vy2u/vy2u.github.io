learn thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a beauty brand
spotlight video this is a series I do
where I just panic and talk about brands
that maybe I've talked about a lot I can
review them I can do tutorials with them
I tend to do whatever I want but it's
kind of focused around the brand today
we're going to be talking about carbon
cocoa this is kind of an internet famous
brand I've seen their videos on
Instagram quite a bit and this is a
company that does things like oil
pouring as well as activated charcoal
tooth polishes this is what they sent me
this is the carp and Coco natural teeth
whitening polish and then I did get the
charcoal brush as well now I've been
trying this out I do have some before
and after pictures I do have some
thoughts on this product and yeah we'll
get into it I tried to look up as much
as I could about the brands but there
really wasn't like an about Me section
on their website or anything so the
benefits of this brand is 100% natural
activated charcoal that's going to
whiten your teeth instead of like harsh
chemicals it's medical grade activated
charcoal its dentist approved this is a
cruelty-free brand and you're supposed
to get the best results when you use
this two hours after eating so I don't
know if that's like every time you eat
yourself to do it I think it's more just
like wait at least two hours and then
brush your teeth that's what I got again
this is just me reading the website and
making the most out of it that I could
seriously that's all I have I believe
this is an Australian brand I believe
that's where it came from at least we'll
just get into the products though so
like I said this is the carbon cocoa
teeth whitening powder this is black
past night this is so so black and it
kind of freaked me out at first when I
like looked at this because I'm like I
have to put that in my mouth like that
kind of freaks me out and let me tell
you it's definitely weird when you spit
this out your metal you feel like you
are in a scary movie and you know like
the the jaws scare where someone throws
up black fescue or maybe in like
Prometheus I don't know I just
definitely felt in like sci-fi vibes
when I was spitting this out of my mouth
mentally it was kind of weird at first
like sometimes I would get grossed out
and like
like gag because it's like weird to see
a different color coming out of your
mouth than what you're used to seeing
and it's so black when I tell you this
is black I'm not just saying oh it's
like a light rain water like when you
spit this out it's just your water is
just like ooh looks so soaked in black I
was reading these views just to see what
everyone else is saying about this
product and someone said that out of all
of the charcoal powders that they tried
this one is the finest and this one is
super fine I was surprised because when
I had it in my mouth it wasn't gritty or
anything there were a few grits like
afterward and whatnot but I felt like
that was the exception really it just
was like nothing like I didn't feel it
and it didn't feel like I was polishing
my teeth with sand or something it's
just like a bizarre thing to me it's
super bizarre I feel like that's kind of
why so popular in social media it's like
a fun little video to watch like oh my
gosh there's black stuff all in their
teeth this retails for 3995 on the
website which is quite expensive this
product is probably going to last you a
super long time I use this for about a
week and a half
I used it five times in the period of a
week and a half just to kind of see how
fast the results were I feel like so
many people on there saying that they
saw results immediately like after the
first use and they have some the forms
after pictures on the website again I'll
show you mine please be warned is scary
my teeth are not perfect I've never had
braces I've never had anything like that
so like you know long Ferris to show my
nasty-ass teeth on here but for you guys
anything
a little bit about the brush too I guess
before I tell you my full-on review this
brush you can buy it retails for 495 I
do think that this is nice I use it just
for the charcoal I don't use it for
anything else and I like that it's
tinted gray it came like this it's not
because it's dirty and I do like that
just so that way it doesn't look dirty
with your charcoal powder I think that's
very smart and I did enjoy it I think it
applies the product really nicely so how
you use this you would wet your brush
and then you just dip it into the
product and then you just brush away so
the first time I use this I have my
first picture is my before I have my
after picture and I do think that it may
be whitened my teeth a little bit I
don't think it was anything dramatic at
least not for me I don't drink coffee I
don't drink tea on a regular basis at
all I don't feel like I don't smoke I
don't do anything that makes my teeth
like more stained I guess than just
normal wear and tear on your teeth so I
personally did not notice a big
difference you'll have to tell me what
you guys think from the picture now it's
not that I don't think this product
works because I think it works okay like
I just didn't notice anything amazing
honestly and so many people after the
first try are like oh my gosh I saw such
a big difference
and I don't know if that's from
promotion I don't know if that's what
they really feel activated charcoal is a
real thing I looked it up I looked it up
earlier because I've been hearing about
activated charcoal in so many things and
I just kind of wanted to know what the
heck what's the difference and what is
it supposed to do when it's activated
charcoal it's supposed to pull out the
impurities so there are like activated
charcoal pills you can take and they're
supposed to help you if you've like
overdosed on something or if you've had
been poisoned and they pull those
impurities out and just kind of help you
recover from that so I definitely think
like technology wise or like Theory wise
this would work and could definitely
whiten your teeth I just personally
didn't see amazing results now when my
mom was in town I had her trying this
too because she like loves trying beauty
products and all that and she felt like
she could see a difference on the first
try and she drinks coffee every morning
so I definitely don't knock the claims
that other people
I think it's just kind of a personal
thing so she really enjoyed it she
thought it was really helping she use it
almost every day she was here I believe
she didn't want me to mention one thing
in the review she said that she felt a
little bit like she had some sensitivity
after using it and she doesn't know it
was this product or it's her to go to
sensitive she does have like receding
gums so it might not be this product but
she just thought she would mention that
so overall I do think that it
potentially could work for you I don't
think it's going to work as well as
something like your treatment at your
dentist or doing like Crest Whitestrips
um it's just not as intense but if you
want something that's maybe going to be
a little bit more natural and be more
gradual I think this might be a nice
option for you personally I think that
their prices are a little bit expensive
they definitely seem like a company
where there's always some type of code
so if you're going to purchase
definitely make sure you have some type
of discount code I believe for the month
of July they're doing like 20% off that
is not a code that they gave me it was
just when I was doing research on the
website I don't even think they gave me
a code for a percentage drop so
definitely if you're thinking about
getting this and you're going to buy
from Carbon cocoa make sure you're
getting it at a really great price but
there might be other powders out there
at different prices I can't tell you how
those are going to perform but I can
tell you that this one is very finely
milled and you're not going to feel like
you're just like scraping your teeth up
this powder is so fine that as soon as
water hits it it just liquefied into the
water and that's part of the reason you
get that really just deep dark charcoal
water color because it's not like little
particles in the water it becomes one
with the water any much is something to
know because that could be something to
do with the price and it being more
expensive is it's like a higher quality
powder overall it's kind of all I have
to say about it I'm going to keep using
it I'm going to see if I feel like my
you know results are way different than
what I expressed in this video I'll you
know let you know in the description box
of the ptosis or I'll do like a
follow-up video once I've used it even
longer I thought it was good I think
it's still like not gimmicky but I think
just because of the way that they choose
to market their products I just think of
it kind of in the realm of like the
fifties and the gummy hair stuff but I
do think that this product actually does
like work
I just don't know how well it'll work on
you depending on where your teeth are
out and what you normally do with your
teeth
so it's not like scammy and I'm not
trying to see the other ones necessarily
are either but I just think that because
they're like this really have a stronger
social media presence and that's how
they kind of get their name out there
they're just lumped into those types of
products in my brain anyway that is
everything guys thank you so much for
watching let me know if this helps you
out if you want to try this if you don't
I might put a clip at the end here of me
just like spitting the water out it's
going to be kind of gross so if you want
to see that I'll put like a black screen
and text before I go into that in case
you don't want to seem so nasty like I
don't know Extra Terrestrial puke on
your screen but anyway I thought I would
just show you that so you know what to
expect because I'm telling you it
totally threw me off guard
other than that though I'm going to
leave you be I will see you my next
video thanks so much for watching guys
bye
I look like a wit I look like a
straight-up would remember I got hell I
got to be trapping kids in my
gingerbread house is creepy man oh I can
get judgmental more than anything
hi guys I want to just show you a little
bit of a demo of me using the carbon
cocoa so I'm going to take this off you
guys can see inside so that's what the
powder looks like it just looks like
straight-up why because that's what it
is so I want my toothbrush sorry if my
bathroom is disgusting I dip it in there
and then I start brushing okay so that's
a little example of what we're doing
with for troubling stories I warned you
before this is what it looks like when
you spit it out something it just ink
you black it's so black even as you
clean it it's just super black so yeah
and I also splatter so you have to be
kinda careful
it plays outside that ah see I said over
there it's just everywhere so I probably
still have some in my teeth because I
just thought about this right now but
something I do suggest is to brush your
teeth with the charcoal first and then
go in and like with your regular
toothpaste and brush because you will
have little pieces in your teeth and
gums still it's not a ton but it's
definitely still there so I suggest
doing it as well just to like not have
to worry about that in the morning but
uh I think that's everything for this
video I hope you enjoyed it and I will
save it next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
