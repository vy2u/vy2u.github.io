Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
talk and this one is going to be all
about the drama we're going to be
talking about a lot of different things
we're gonna be talking about drama
channels just for a little bit we're
gonna be talking about just drama in
general and my thoughts on it why I
think it's popular my experience with it
on my own channel and creating videos
and just all of that just just a drum
we're talking about it's all about the
drama why all the drama if you haven't
seen any of my other tooth talks or if
you want to check them out I'm gonna
leave the playlist linked down below
with this series I just want to bring
attention and bring that conversation
and dialogue about certain topics in the
YouTube community especially in the
beauty community so yeah I'm not trying
to bash anyone I don't want these to
come out overly negative I really do try
to see things from both sides and be
level-headed this isn't supposed to
create drama in and of itself but I
think that there are issues and I think
that we should have a place to talk
about them you know maturely and have
discussion and it's okay for people to
have different opinions and sides and I
think that if we can just like listen to
each other and have a good time that'd
be cool so try to keep it simple in the
comments please this has been a tube top
I've wanted to do for a while and I've
just been kind of holding off because
I've I just it's such a huge topic and I
don't want to like leave things out but
I'm just gonna talk and see where it
goes and we'll go from there
I do have notes because you know I have
to be a little bit prepared I'm also
going to start this video out with
letting you guys know that makeup
struggles if you don't know her go
subscribe to her I'm gonna leave her
channeling down below but I'm also gonna
leave the video she did on drama
channels I think that video was just so
well done and I just I love her so much
and yeah I love hearing her talk so if
you want just more information I don't
want to like repeat too much of like
what she said because honestly I feel
very similarly to a lot of what she said
I'm gonna leave that link down below and
I definitely suggest you check it out if
you're interested in this topic and you
know I think you would enjoy that video
so the inspiration for this was just I
hear all the time and I say it too I'm
just so over all the drama why is there
all the drama so much drama but then I
feel like there's like
this conflicting thing because I notice
in myself any video I do that is more
negative in nature whether it's a
disappointing products or in some way
you're gonna like on something you
know like people want you to like roast
something those are the most popular
videos that I do if my YouTube thumbnail
is the most is like more negative with a
thumbs down or like a stinky face those
are the videos that get the most views
that people are the most excited to
watch and I find that those are the
videos I also enjoy watching so there's
kind of like this oh I hate drama but
then you would you know most people
enjoy a bit of negativity a bit of that
like you know not just fluffy rainbows
and happy and they want to kind of know
some negative science about products or
brands or whatever it is so I mean even
this tube talk I feel like it's not
drama but um it's definitely a bit more
negative or I don't know cuz I don't
think these are negative it's just more
controversial I think that's a better
way to put it so anyway that just kind
of like dichotomy is that the word to
use there it's really interesting that's
just something I've experienced on my
own channel but then there is this rise
of drama channels and I think we all
know what a drama channel is but in the
beauty community it's a channel that
reports like TMZ essentially about you
know different youtubers usually really
big ones Jacqueline hell man EMU way all
those people and they take different you
know issues that come up and they make
videos about them and kind of inform
their audience about every little thing
that they do they also inform me about
brands are just like shady things going
on in the community and this has
definitely been a recent thing or a rise
of these channels within the last I
would say a year or two it's been crazy
how many drama channels there are
especially now and I'm gonna say it here
like I watched some of these drama
channels I know a lot of people say they
don't watch them and they hate them and
I don't like when things get nasty
but there's a part of me that enjoys
like learning or knowing about what's
going on when it comes to things that
are actually issues but I think that's
the issue is that some of this stuff has
just gone way too far for clips in
views and subscribers and they're
turning out stories about things that
just aren't that big of a deal and I
think that there becomes this like mob
mentality when it comes to these
creators and I go just for information
and I like to think that I'm pretty
level-headed and that I you know I'll
take some of the information and then
I'll try to dispense the things that I
think are just like bullcrap or you know
like okay come on stop being nasty but I
think a lot of people don't do that and
they go to these channels to confirm
their hate and suspicions of these big
youtubers and so they go in thinking I
don't like this person and then when
this you know channel says all these
things whether they're true or not true
or their opinion they cling on to that
they want to be there for the drama and
I think that that has spiraled out of
control a bitch I feel like some of the
drama channels when they first started
were better or more grounded but as
they've gotten Fame and kind of become I
guess celebrities or you know YouTube
stars in and of themselves things have
switched around a lot I don't know I
don't know how I feel about drama
channels like I enjoy watching them
sometimes but I also totally get why
people don't watch them and something
that makeup struggles had mentioned in
her video was that when she watches
those channels she finds that sometimes
it puts her in a state where she'll
gossip more or she will just kind of
she's in that mindset and I think that
is something really important and I
think that's something that's like
tainting the beauty community is that
we're relying on these drama channels to
give us information or to tell us about
the drama and we're letting them feed
way too much crap into our brains and
we're forgetting a lot of the time I
think that these youtubers are humans
and people and that one it's okay to
make mistakes and not everything is a
conspiracy story I think that's like
something that is so irritating to me
it's like people are just living their
lives and I think as we are letting
these channels grow in popularity and we
watch more of that content and we are
telling them with our views and our
likes and all of that that we want more
content like this that we are forgetting
that these people are humans and
are dehumanizing them and I think that
is super negative and not good I think
it's okay to have issues and to talk
about those issues but I don't think
that drama channels do that in a
positive way a lot of the time I think
that some videos can be different and
some topics are different and definitely
each channel has its own vibe to it for
sure I think that it's okay to be
playful like I think Peterman is more
playful than a lot of them he's more
just like talking about it like he's
your friend like you would have a
conversation and it's not like this hate
or like agenda behind it I think some of
these drama channels have had like
agendas and you know they're definitely
using these beauty bureaus and their
names to gain popularity and it's
working I mean it's crazy if you want to
start YouTube and get a lot of freaking
views and subscribers start drum channel
make videos bashing you know everything
that someone does and again not all
drama channels do this but I think a lot
of them do let's go to my notes cuz I
think I'm getting off on a tangent and I
think the biggest thing too is that that
people forget that these these should be
like entertainment kind of like the
Jerry Springer Show you know what I mean
it's fun to watch drama but it's also
like you have to step back and be like
okay but it's just entertaining don't
take it farther than that and I don't
know I'm just the more I think about it
it's like it's just kind of hateful and
something that I think is really telling
too is some of these drought channels
can't even handle now that they're
bigger and like people are making drama
channels about them oh my gosh they
can't stand it and I'm like are you
joking me
you've made your entire youtube career
about talking about other people and you
can't handle videos being made about you
like please I cannot stand that I blew I
lose all respect if you can't handle
people doing exactly what you do to
other people I think that is so just
absolutely disgusting like why would you
do it to other people then anyway the
thing that I like about drama channels
is that I do think that they can be good
for exposing the wrong and things that
are going bad under neath or maybe not
everyone knows about I just hate
the mob mentality and the negativity
that it really can spread and people
just get so latched on to the negativity
and that's something that I think is
wrong with the drama channels as they
get bigger I feel like they get more
negative and they kind of lose sight of
a lot of things but I also think that's
something that we as like just people
watching need to recognize in ourselves
and maybe work on personally - why are
we attracted to drama channels why do we
want to watch the drama is it for
entertainment and fun is it for other
reasons are we trying to confirm things
are we trying to like have a club that
we all hate on this one person about
because that's not cool to me I don't
I'm not okay with that I'm more about
like constructive criticism or hey let's
fix this how I look at it in my channel
and my attitude and life is I I'm fine
with calling out but it's
because I want a positive change it's
not to just call up and be
negative and like crush someone ever
it's because I think that we can do
better I'm excited and positive for what
could be and think that we could do
better that's where I come from and
where my heart is and I don't think that
that is how all the drama channels are
their heart is for the views and the
money and so I think that can definitely
skew why they do what they do what
stories that they do another thing that
I find super weird and interesting I
think it is so weird that any youtuber
would like go to a Drama Channel and
like give them an exclusive statement
again makeup struggles talked about this
and I agree with her like that is just
weird why would you talk to these
channels I don't get it and then that
makes me question why you're talking to
them and if you know you guys are like
now that they're at the level that
they're at you know are some of these
drama situations not planned I don't
want to be - conspiracy theory here but
I just I don't like that I don't know
why I don't know it's super weird it
feels like it could potentially turn
into a situation where you almost like
you're going out to lunch and you call
the paparazzi on you to like get that
information on you and like take
pictures of you while you're at lunch
and stuff and
like you know feeding off of the drama
and each other because those the
channels like there's no doubt they the
videos and the the things that they put
out get a ton of views so I think some
creators are harnessing that and making
drama profitable for them and that's
also something I'm not a fan of like no
I don't really want to talk about the
Logan Paul thing because it's not it
just not something I really want to talk
about too much on my channel but that is
like such a horrible situation and no
matter how you want to look at it he is
profiting off of it
anyone who's talking about is profiting
off it you could technically argue that
because I've talked about in this video
and this video has ads I've profited off
of it and I just I hate that oh I hate
the cycle of it but don't worry everyone
will forget everything that happens in
about two seconds because that's what
everyone does no one remembers any
scandals that happen so I mean as much
as really bad publicity can be bad
exposure and publicity honestly is
always good even in the heat of the
moment something might go wrong and as
long as it's not entirely career
crushing I think in the end it usually
is a positive and I hate that and that's
why there's drama - I mean but think
about it you guys people who say they
don't like the drama don't go and really
jump they hate the drama they don't want
to be involved in it but I think a lot
of people do they like the drum they
want to know about situations they've
invested in these beauty gurus it's
entertaining and you know you feel like
you know them so you want to know like
oh hey is Linda's still dating whoever
oh wow you know you do that in your
normal life and with YouTube I think
these beauty gurus are in our living
rooms they're in our houses and we treat
them as friends so we want to know about
them probably a little bit more than we
should I think there are a lot of things
that get really personal and they
shouldn't especially if the beauty guru
is in putting that information out in
the public and people are going out of
their way to find that information out
or uncover that information or expose
them for certain things I think that
needs to definitely be respected more
there was a really big issue over the
holidays with Peterman and John Cook in
I'm not gonna go into it if you know
about it you know about it if you don't
you probably don't watch drama channels
and stay that way
but I think that there's definitely this
like negative side of the drama channels
and I think we're seeing that a lot more
I think we need to be more choosy about
what we're actually choosing to support
and who we're putting in these positions
of power and you know I think overall
though with drama it's like it's okay to
like a little bit of drama to me I think
it's okay to like be entertained by some
things especially when they're not like
absolutely hateful and evil and super
personal and like crushing people it's
okay to be interested in certain things
why a product didn't work why
something's negative you know I think I
don't know cuz I'm attracted to that
those are the videos I like to watch I
enjoy things like tube tops like this
because I want to have dialogue and I
want to hear about real situations and
get to the bottom of something or hear
people's opinions on things so I think
there can be some positives but really I
think that it comes down to us as again
consumers of this content and we need to
be aware of what we're watching who
we're supporting what their intentions
are and take a look at ourselves and we
think about these beauty gears because I
think that they've gotten to a status
and with you know we've had some issues
with them in the past or we feel like oh
we're being sold to or you know there's
so many sponsorships they're lying to us
all of these things and we're taking all
those feelings and they're coming out
with these hateful drama channels
instead of having real dialogue and
hopefully changing it for the positive
you know what I mean so again not all
drama channels are like that but I think
that it just it becomes a fine line in a
sticky situation I think really easily
with what is considered hateful and what
is just kind of like calling out
bullcrap or being a whistleblower you
know what I mean so anyway I think I'm
gonna close this video out because I
don't know if I have much more to say
besides what I have said hopefully I've
covered this well enough but I really do
think it comes down to us as individuals
and our thinking and we need to you know
just be able to look outside of
ourselves in what we're doing and if our
behavior is like if your hate watching I
think that's such a horrible thing to do
don't think that's a positive thing and
it's just solidifying these negative
thoughts I think if you try to have more
balance with how you look at situations
try to have some empathy try to step
into someone else's shoes for about two
seconds hopefully that can help us have
better dialogue and you can still be
disappointed in something or you can
have an opinion that isn't necessarily
positive on a situation but it doesn't
have to be mean and nasty and I think
that's what I want to eliminate and I
also want to eliminate
making every situation drama-filled
because not everything is drama-filled
if a concealer doesn't work that's not
even drama like I just think you know
because of views and the way YouTube is
and how people make money on YouTube the
drama is is success you know it gets you
exposure and it gets you money from
views and I don't think that's going to
stop and some of it is entertaining and
I enjoy it so I just want the nastiness
and the meanness to come out of drama
and I hope that people can have just
more actual enlightening conversations
and conversations that will hopefully
help them understand all sides of a
situation so they can make better
informed decisions which is what I
initially liked about drama channels is
that you can find out all the different
sides of a situation hopefully and make
a better decision as a consumer but
they've definitely changed them I think
I think overall if we look at ourselves
we can hopefully make better decisions
and I think if we all more than anything
had a little empathy in every situation
in life and really tried to understand
someone else's side point of view and
didn't just immediately think that
they're evil horrible people that would
take us a long way and if you do feel
like that then stop associating yourself
with it because if you are still
watching people that you hate if you are
watching content that exposes them in
some way and you already know you hate
them I don't think that's a positive
situation and I don't think that I don't
think that's going to help you at all if
you've already feel this way I don't
know why you need someone else to
confirm that and why you need to
continue you
giving your energy to it if you don't
want to be a part of it okay I hope this
covered drama channels and like why all
the drama these are just some of my
thoughts on drama and I guess more just
like I kind of got on like hate a little
bit too and just like drama channels a
lot there was a lot more about drama
channels than I thought there would be
but um anyway I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments you guys know I
love reading the comments and yeah
hopefully I did this somewhat justice I
will be doing a new tube top pretty soon
because of creator on the rise who in
that whole situation and it'll be really
fun I think to just go over the
cost-benefit analysis of creator on the
rise and my experience with it and just
what it is and everything because I had
no idea what it was before I was on the
training page and then all that happened
so anyway I hope you guys are having an
amazing day thank you so so much for
watching um and I can't wait to hear you
have to say okay bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
