learn thanks much for watching this is
going to be another tube talk video I
have a whole series I'll leave the
playlist linked down below if you want
to check it out this is just a series
that I started to talk about things that
I just feel you like to do with beauty
or YouTube or pull it's just a place
where we can have an open dialogue I
really encourage just anyone even if you
disagree with me or you agree or have a
different opinion than me to leave your
comments down below so we can all kind
of just have an open safe spot to talk
about stuff you know it's okay to have
different opinions we're all humans and
we all have different experiences to
form how we feel about it today's topic
is one that is irritating to me listen
and it is about comments that are just
spam or except for sub or something in
that realm we all know I'm not very good
at commenting I don't usually comment on
other people's channels
I don't comment back very often one on
Disney - I haven't died about it I have
videos on that if you want to check them
out it's just also not my style like
it's never been my style since I've been
on YouTube to comment I've always been a
silent creeper I've talked about that I
watch videos I'll I think you know know
the content but I don't I'm not on there
saying hey Bella blah and everyone has a
different way that they like to use
social media so I get that other people
enjoy comments and commenting and
getting comments back and doing all that
it's just really not my style I'm trying
but it's really not me like I personally
love the medium of like hey I'm making a
youtube video we're talking to you this
way as opposed to you know typing back
anyway recently on my channel I feel
like I've been getting more spam
comments and more like hey beautiful
check out my channel or whatever type of
comments and I like to let comments go
on my channel like basically anything
that comes through I will let through
sometimes they don't if it's like has a
link that I'm kind of like scared might
be something like you know dangerous for
people to click on but other than that
I usually let them go because in my head
I don't want to censor my comments if I
get a nasty comment calling me something
evil yeah I'm going to like let everyone
see that because that's real life like
regardless I don't know at least right
now in my life and how I feel about it
is that that's like that happened like
yeah it happened if I delete it that
doesn't mean it didn't happen and since
I don't like dwell on my comments at
times I'm not gonna like go back and see
it anyway and it's also like to let you
guys know that yeah I get love or hate
or spam or whatever I don't know but to
me it's just like that's the real life
situation so yeah I'm gonna like let it
through but I have been getting more
sand than normal and as you grow you get
spam it just is people want to use you
as marketing for their own channel which
I want to say right now is just such
 it's such and it
pisses me off so much because people who
have gained its following have worked
really really hard like I have been on
YouTube two plus years it'll be it was
two years at the end of February so it
took me over two years to get to 6000
subscribers like that a lot of
subscribers don't get me wrong but that
also isn't nearly as many subscribers as
so many other people have made in two
years so I work hard and I upload all
the time like I put so much work into my
channel so for you to come over here and
write your little comment saying hey
guys come check me out like I do beauty
videos too and just be so blatant
it's so obvious you didn't watch my
video and that you are here because you
want to just take people to your channel
it's just disrespectful especially since
we're supposed to be in the same
community and building each other up I
don't think that commenting in general
is that I get that you need to make
connections and like in a way just
commenting on someone's channel is going
to get your name out there because if
anyone's rolling through the comments
they're going to see your channel so I
think that leaving I will thought out
nice comment on a lot of people's
channel if that's the way you want to
like branch out and get your channel now
like one of the tactics you're doing I
own 10% is get it I get the hustle I
want to grow my channel to this
personally not the way I want to do it
because it just doesn't go with my
personality and what I want to do but if
you want to do that I get that that's
awesome but do not do it in that way
it's just so oh it's so fake people see
right through you I have two situations
recently that happened and it kind of
what like stunned this whole tube top
because it's just like too much
literally I have someone who was
commenting on every single one of my
freakin videos like within like two
minutes of my video going up it was the
same exact canned response of like hey
really loved the video I'd love for you
to check out my channel and I think it
either left us a link to her channel or
something like that and it was every
single one of my videos it was crazy how
many comments I was getting from her it
was like in mine because they go
straight to spam so anything like that
they go straight to spam and so I have
at one point things like for comments
from her in my spam folder for different
videos it was insane I let some through
because at the beginning like it's one
time in my head sometimes I'm like you
know what if someone goes to your
channel and wants to like sub for sub
with you then whatever like they're a
lost cause in my head but I want people
to know but that's the type of person
you are that you're leaving comments on
people's channel saying hey guys come
over and check my channel out and just
using people freaking you know the
little bit of success that I have it's
for your own game you know so to me it's
like yeah people are gonna see like oh
she's one of them like I don't want to
go check out her channel I bet so what I
would do so I have like four of those
comments in my spam and I started
reporting it which is not usually like
me again I'll just let him through
whatever but at that point it was so
insane that it was just like dude
obviously I don't even know if you're
even
watching my freakin videos and then it's
just the same response it's like you
don't even have the time to write it and
come up with like a different like way
to say it like you literally are just
copying and pasting or whatever you're
doing like it's just so stacked me and
it doesn't work like can we get that
through to like you might gain in
numbers but what the heck you numbers
mean if you get no views I don't
understand that
like yeah it feels good to have thousand
subscribers but if you get like 15 views
on your videos that sucks like the whole
reason you should be wanting to make a
channel and so that people enjoy your
content and watch it this is sort of
like that's what I like I like that you
guys like my content I like making
content that people enjoy watching one
views are more important because it's
people actually watching your and
also if you if you're wanting to get
paid you get paid per view not because
of your freaking subscriber count and at
the thousand subscribers or however
however high you can get from sub4sub
you're not going to get sponsorships and
outs that make it worth it you might as
well buy your subscribers because it's
like basically the same thing and you
can go to these people's accounts and
you can go click on their videos because
sometimes a will because I am like
totally a detective I want to like
figure out people and like do all that
crap you go over their videos and
they'll have like all these times and
literally it'll be people like lobby for
all great video oh my gosh but it's like
all fake it's all fake it's other people
who have done the same thing and that's
how you guys got in contact and it's
like why do you want to foster those
types of relationships online that is
not a community that is just like
 you know I am NOT the kind of
person that's going to like your
Instagram posts because you liked my
Instagram post if you liked my Instagram
posts I'm like so grateful like awesome
things and so glad you liked it and you
click the like button but if I like a
picture I'm going to like it because I
thought it was really cool or I'm
congratulating you in some way or
whatever like there's a reason it's not
just because oh well I should because
they did or whatever it's like stupid
that's the stupidest thing and same with
subscribing to people like you should
not be subscribing to people because you
they subscribe to you I don't do that it
just isn't real success like it's fake
success it's fake you're faking yourself
out you're trying to fake out other
people that you're more successful than
you are focus on creating good content
or creating real actual relationships
people online because those can be
really good and I'm the only comment
that much but I've met a lot of people
who I have really good relationships
with and I can see their friends you
know even from the brief conversations I
have have it is very very frustrating to
me the other person literally just
happened today and I'm going to read you
the comment because I don't know I'm
still salty a torn out anyway it's still
in my spam folder and the reason it gets
me just gets me so much it says oh my
goodness babe I'm so happy that I found
your channel I actually stumbled across
your channel through someone else's
video I'm so in love with your channel I
think you have an amazing personality
plus you're SuperDuper pretty I know one
day you will have millions of
subscribers especially since you've
started off with such a great foundation
you honestly have great content too I'm
going to keep watching your channel okay
I've just subscribed and turned on your
notification I can't wait to see what
else your channel will produce I have a
makeup giveaway going on so I was
wondering if you could come over to my
channel so we can support each other we
smaller youtubers need to stick together
and support each other
xoxo name I really feel like I don't
need to say about that comment it's
like the most
fluffy piece of comment I've
ever read and this is niggas you know if
it was just a nice comment and it was
genuine that would be so nice to do it
that is so sweet
but there are some giveaways in this one
but not some international mention of a
giveaway but they are some dead
giveaways that's why this comment is
frickin one she mentions like
this channel Channel channel channel
like 700 times she also talks about how
she has a giveaway going on her channel
she and you know after all of these guys
comments instead of just leaving it
there she frickin sends me over to her
channel Mendon talked about how we need
to stick together and you know help each
other out and that is like insulting to
me because it is obvious
not weapons video because this comment
is on a decluttr video which is a video
that I didn't show my face in I
literally don't even show my face so how
do you know I'm not freaking beautiful
and make you watch some of my other
videos and you just know I'm so
beautiful from those videos but I kind
of doubt it with all the other freaking
like indicators in this post that you
did that and if that's true why would
you be like hey I really love you too
cluttered I really enjoy your channel so
that I found it through someone else
I've been binge-watching you're so
beautiful you did a great job too
cluttering that would be like not be
weird to me because like oh she maybe
watched the Quan she obviously mentioned
that she watched every one but the fact
that it's like the giveaway and all this
crap it's so irritating to me and you
think I'm just going to like be like oh
my gosh girl like thank you so much for
your canned and sane response like I
cannot wait to go help you out and
subscribe to you when you didn't
actually do for me like if you're
trying to act like you did you didn't I
don't understand where people's mindset
is of like thinking that this will
actually work so I could go to her
channel and the thing that is even more
frustrating on top of this is that she
actually has a pretty good personality
and I don't actually think her videos
are bad right like I'm like oh okay like
you're a little bit on the smaller
Channel she has like over a thousand
subscribers which I'm sure a lot of them
came from sub back and all that bull
crap and you can tell to buy views like
view to subscriber ratio that it's a
little bit skewed and that's probably
because she of the tactic she's trying
to use to you know Greek create
subscribers on her channel so it just
does even more frustrating it's like
dude let your personality speak for
itself like make content keep going
YouTube is not an overnight saying like
if you want to be an overnight youtuber
be a journal channel and like basically
like being really opinionated on
like that's what's going to get you
views the more views you can get the
more subscribers you're going to get so
you want to try to make something that
is going to get a lot of you doesn't
matter the hate level because even if
it's a lot of hate you will get
subscribers exposure equals subscribers
no matter what the exposure is from but
the fact that you love that com
to me is like makes me look at your
channel makes me look at you and it's
like you're saying though like that
those pounds me are that so fake you're
fake you're trying to act like it's
because you want to be in this community
and you want to support each other but
that's not why you're doing it you're
doing it so that you can have a bigger
following and gain whatever success or
fame or whatever you think is going to
come from that it has nothing to do with
the community it has everything to do
with you and it is obviously you don't
watch someone else's video and you use
that their platform as free marketing
for yourself if that's who you are and
how you feel of the person so it's very
frustrating I think that's all I have to
say I mean I think it's pretty obvious
how I feel about this and I know it
cussed a lot and I felt very strong
links in this video but that's just
truly how I feel and I just I think it's
sad that people need to feel so
validated by numbers I get it partially
because it's like yeah I want to grow my
channel too and it feels good to get
more subscribers but I wish more people
would take more time and put in hard
work for their channel and actually grow
organically and if you grow organically
you are going to have people who
actually enjoy watching your channel and
are like supportive of you and will
watch your content instead of just
having a lot of subscribers because
subscribers like Ghost subscribers or
people who don't actually watch your
content doesn't mean anything again if
your goal is to make money you're not
going to make money if your goal is to
get sponsorships or get product sent to
you if you don't have the views people
are going to send it to you and if you
actually want your content to be heard
which is why you should be doing YouTube
no one's watching it like no one's
watching it if you just are getting fake
followers so that's everything I have to
say about that if you're having thoughts
or comments on it please leave them down
below I'd love to hear you guys is soft
on it and that's everything let me know
if you have any suggestions for to talk
to come and I will talk to you in my
next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
