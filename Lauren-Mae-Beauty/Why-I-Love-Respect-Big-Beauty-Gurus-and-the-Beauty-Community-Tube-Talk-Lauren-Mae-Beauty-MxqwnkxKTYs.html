Lorne thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
top video and I'm excited about this one
because it's a little bit different from
my series if you guys haven't seen this
series before I'm gonna leave the
playlist link down below but this is
something that I started because I
wanted to just open up dialogue and have
conversation about different topics in
the beauty community and just on YouTube
and just in general I've kind of like
opened it up to other things but I would
say that sometimes the topics here can
be considered negative I don't like to
consider it that way because I do like
to again have it a dialogue where we're
talking about both sides you know
nothing is just black and white I feel
like there's a lot of gray there's a lot
of reasons to feel in the middle about
things or feel strongly this way or that
way but with today's video I wanted to
give props to beauty gurus I wanted to
talk about the things that I really
respect about big beauty gurus things
that being someone who also makes
YouTube videos I can understand maybe a
little bit differently than when I had
just been a viewer that's something I'd
like to bring to these tube talks as
well is that I am not only someone who
creates content but I also like to watch
a lot of content and I've watched a lot
of content in the past so I feel like I
have a unique perspective and I like to
look at situations not only as a content
creator but as someone who just wants to
watch content and not create it so
anyway I have a few different points
that I've brought up these are things
that I respect about big beauty gurus
things that I think maybe can get
overshadowed by the drama or I don't
know affiliate or whatever else we're
talking about and I hope that this video
just brings a bit of balance because
that's what my channel is about and what
I'm about is that you know I want to
call things out that I don't think are
right I'm obviously a bit opinionated
but I do think that there are positive
things I think there's a lot of positive
that goes into it too and sometimes if
I'm just talking about something that
irritates me it can seem like I'm just
negative but I think there are positives
and I'm hoping this will bring some
balance to that so let's get into some
of the reasons I respect big beauty
gurus things that I think that they do
really well or just things that I think
are forgotten about in lieu of the
negativity that can sometimes surround
them so the first thing I want to talk
about is the fact that
single person on this platform starts at
zero subscribers a big ol goose egg so
no matter what you think about a beauty
guru now or whatever the case may be and
I talk when I'm talking about beauty
gurus here I'm talking about people a
million plus usually the biggest of the
biggest the people on the very top here
in the scale but they all start with
zero subscribers and it is amazing to me
that through hard work and creativity
and just putting themselves out there on
camera because it is so hard if you or
someone out there who has been wanting
to start a channel for a really long
time you probably know how scary it can
feel because you're in it right now like
I want to do it but I'm scared of this
that or whatever it's a very scary
feeling just uploading a video to the
Internet so I think it's amazing and I
respect so much that they got on camera
started it did their first video started
from zero and work their way all the way
up to a million plus subscribers it is
insane it is so insane to think about
that when you strip down the numbers and
you actually think of them as people
because that's what it is it's people
who have subscribed to your channel it
is absolutely mind-blowing to think that
a million people have you know somehow
connected with this content in one way
or another and even if they got lucky
let's say they've only been on the
platform one year two years in their
videos just one more viral than other
people it still takes a lot of hard work
and I don't think that them either
having a really awesome idea that got
picked up by the algorithm or in some
cases maybe just being right place right
time maybe a little bit of luck I don't
think that should overshadow the fact
that they did have to work hard they had
to do these first steps to even start
their channel and I think that that is
amazing and I totally get that and I
respect that from every single one of
them kind of going off of that point I
think that it is also amazing that so
many of these Beauty gears have turned
their name and turned what they love
into a job they've done the American
dream I feel like that to me is the
American dream doing something that you
love and just something that you're
passionate about and turning it into
your career and making money off of it
and they've done that and I think that
is so amazing it's inspiring to me to
see people who have you know started
maybe from nothing or whatever you want
to say is nothing and created something
of me
from it created a brand people want to
work with you I mean huge companies want
to collaborate with these beauty gurus
because they have you know touched so
many different people around the world
and I think that is so amazing it makes
me inspire to want to create my own
content
it makes me inspire to want to pursue my
own dreams even if it doesn't have to do
with YouTube for me it continues the
idea that you can do whatever you want
to in this life you only have one life
to live so whatever you just feel
passionate and connected to do you
should be working as hard as possible
for it and I believe that you will be
successful in it if you continue to have
a growth mindset and you continue to
work hard for your dreams and passions
and I think it is so cool that they get
to live out their careers doing
something that they love doing something
that most people consider not a job or
it's stupid or silly or they shouldn't
you know put their day job to do this
I'm like no that is amazing that they've
come to the place where they can do this
as their job and call it their job and
it is a job I think it's so cool
something else that I really love about
bigger beauty gurus and just you know
the whole beauty YouTube space is the
fact that these larger creators have
paved the way for smaller creators on
social media and making money off of
social media was not a thing before I
mean social media is relatively new and
they are pioneering a way for people to
create careers there wasn't a beauty
format before and now there is you know
think of Michelle Phan and all of these
people that I have started watching when
I was you know before I had a channel
and I was like just getting into college
and everything and I think it's amazing
that they have set so many precedents I
really do truly think that they have
given this idea of this becoming a job
to so many other people out there I know
I personally would not have found my
love for makeup without YouTube I mean
and now I'm a makeup artist living in LA
working as a makeup artist and I do
YouTube as well and so I'm super
grateful that other people out there
were willing to get on camera and you
know see where this thing will take them
and because of that I connected with
that I found makeup I found my passion
and
I think that is amazing I'm so grateful
to all the beauty youtubers out there
who started I remember when Casey Holmes
was still its blondie and I think it's
easy to forget because now the market is
so saturated that these bigger people
that people that had started on the
platform early on a lot of them are big
because they started early but so much
came with that that they have to
navigate things that no one else had to
navigate there weren't coupon codes
there weren't sponsorships or what all
of these things you weren't making money
doing all this stuff that is all
relatively new I can't imagine having to
make so many different ethical choices
moral choices all in this kind of
whirlwind and there really aren't that
many other examples like you are the
example because you're one of the first
ones doing this and so it's easy for me
to come in and be like I'm not doing
that and I'm not doing that and I'm not
doing this because I've seen what I
don't want to do from other people
making those mistakes I guess I don't
know for me maybe it's a mistake but I
can gage that off of them but they
didn't have that that I think that
that's something to consider because I
think something that gets lost a lot is
again that these people are just people
they were just sitting in their living
room and they weren't necessarily set
out to make this their job or their
career or make a living or a brand or
anything like that where is now a lot of
people know and start their channel at
least with the hopes and dreams that
that could happen maybe they don't think
it will or you know it's way off in the
future but they're starting knowing what
success potentially could be out there
even if it's like point zero zero one
percent chances they know that that's a
possibility where's before these people
they didn't start their channel knowing
any of that and I think that that's
really cool and just something I like to
keep in mind of like the og people you
know I feel like I had like two more
topics ish I think one the last one's a
bit big but um one of the things that I
really think is so awesome about these
large beauty gears people who have made
it so big is that beauty is now
something that isn't necessarily
assigned to just a gender there are so
many male beauty gurus out there there
are so many more men in makeup and I
love that it's way more accepted than
ever has been before I think regardless
of what you might think about some of
the larger male beauty gurus out there
people like Manny MUA Patrick Starr even
Jeffrey star have really opened up the
beauty industry to allowing males to be
frontrunners of campaigns and it's now
becoming so much more socially
acceptable and I think that is so cool
and so amazing for the beauty industry
obviously there were a lot of male
makeup artists in the past but actually
men wearing makeup and being celebrated
for that is I feel like a relatively new
thing and I think that is amazing and
such a positive thing that has come out
of larger Beauty youtubers and just the
beauty YouTube sphere I think it's so
cool I mean James Charles being the face
of covergirl for a while I think is you
know such a huge step and the last kind
of point I want to touch on is the fact
that just in general social media is
such a warped place to be I commend
people on their hustle when it comes to
social media if you want to sit there
and say it's so easy to get X amount of
views and X amount of likes and all the
stuff it's not it's not easy to do even
if you post consistently and do all this
stuff it doesn't mean that it's going to
happen for you so I commend anyone who
is going to go towards social media and
go hard because it's work that a lot of
people under appreciate and think is
stupid and so having so much bias toward
it and still being excited and going for
it I think is really awesome social
media is also a weird place where like
I've said you kind of don't become a
person anymore like you're just this
social media character and you don't
have feelings anymore and people feel
like they have some type of I don't know
say in your life like they can give you
all this weird criticism that they
wouldn't do to someone that they know in
person they can say all these hateful
comments to you and rude things and it's
like it doesn't matter it doesn't have
the same weight as it does in a actual
like you know person-to-person
confrontation and dealing with that can
be a lot especially when it is your job
and I commend anyone who does social
media who has a large following even if
you don't have a large following you can
get so much hate and it can just
a lot of effects on your psyche you know
it's such a weird warped world where how
do you stay true to who you are when you
have so many voices you have to cut
through all these voices of people
saying I love you you're the best person
ever and people saying you are the
shittiest person ever and I can't
believe you did that and looking into
situations that maybe have happened and
not knowing you as a person but judging
and I'm not saying that there aren't
some situations that you know deserve to
be judged and looked at very critically
I think it's just important to remember
that what we see on social media isn't
always the full picture it's not the
full person in the full being and I
think it's it's easy to sit there and
judge say you hate this person or don't
like this person but you don't know that
person at all you know what they put on
camera you know what they put on
snapchat or Instagram but that isn't who
they are necessarily and that's
something that I like to try to remember
as much as possible is just that we
don't we don't know what their motives
are on all of these things like when it
comes to feeling like maybe they're
lying to us or selling to us like we
don't know and I like to always try to
remember to give people the benefit of
the doubt of that they are being genuine
and then if there is enough evidence for
me to not then to just let it be and not
pile on even more hate and drama on to
the situation I can not imagine what
it's like having every little thing you
do scrutinized for ill will and ill
intent and that would suck that would
totally suck and then from having so
much constant pressure of that how do
you stay positive and the same you that
you started out being it's like it's so
hard and so impossible I feel like along
with the natural changes that are gonna
happen as your life is changing your
experiences are changing you're
obviously going to become a different
person and like you know continue to
grow but finding a way to balance real
life and social media and not let all of
these negative voices get to you I think
is such a hard thing and so choosing to
continue to be in that spotlight and be
a part of that and still having even the
tiniest bit of sanity I think is so
commendable
because I can't imagine what they have
to go through daily when it comes to the
negative sides of social media I also
want to point out to you that I think
that when you are social media famous or
just famous in any way where you have
money or fame or something that someone
can suck away from you I can't imagine
what it's like trying to find real
friends real people who care about you
that must be so difficult and I cannot
imagine what that's like trying to find
friends especially in LA because I live
here I know what it's like you know
trying to find people that actually give
a real about you and care about you
as a person and not just want to kind of
mooch off of your fame or your fortune
or the fact that they know whoever this
person is or whatever that is something
that must be very very difficult and
again can kind of you know Jade you if
you've been burned a few times and you
kind of are just living you're living in
a different world and a lot of other
people out there because of the
whirlwind of Fame and all these things
that have surrounded you because of this
awesome success on YouTube and I think
that there's like a two-fold part like I
never think that all of the
responsibility is necessarily on one
person but I think as someone who has
the cameras on them I think it's
important to try to have like mental
health days try to stay as mentally
sound and surround yourself with people
who are actually good people that are
going to tell you what's real and what's
up and not let you get caught up in the
hype of it all not let you get caught up
in yourself to stay humble but I also
think as a viewer it's important to kind
of sympathize with the other person try
to think about how you would be in that
situation which it's impossible to do
until you're there but I think trying to
understand another person's side and all
of the different pressures that they
face is something that's important and
again something I hope to try to bring
to my channel and these different topics
but I think that's where I want to leave
it again I always get kind of rambling
at the end here but I think that as much
as there are a lot of negative things
and trust me I will call out the
negative things that I think are wrong
on my channel but I do think that there
is another side and I think that it's
okay to have balance
you know like just because I think those
things doesn't mean I hate anyone it
doesn't have to all be negative and I
think that it's important to talk about
the awesome positive things I think it's
easier to point out the negative but I
think it's more important to try to stay
balanced and to look at some of the
positive things and the amazing things
that have come from the community
because it's not all negative and it's
not all bad all right thank you guys so
much for watching at the end I do you
want to say I forgot that my makeups
kind of a little bit out there in this
video I did do this makeup in a
boxycharm unboxing video so if you want
to see how I did it I will leave that
link down below so you can check it out
I'm trying to get better about letting
you guys know what the heck's going on
with my face because a lot of you guys
ask but other than that thank you so
much for watching guys of course leave
any tube-top suggestions in the comments
and I will see you in the next video bye
