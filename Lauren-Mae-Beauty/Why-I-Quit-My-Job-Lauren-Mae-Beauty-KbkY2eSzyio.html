I thought I would film a couple videos
of course I always follow time but I
kind of wanted to just talk about why I
quit I've had a couple people ask and I
thought I would take this moment just to
like explain myself not that I have to
just - and then also kind of go a little
inspirational and I think it's just a
great way for you guys to get to know me
the way I think and it's kind of a
little bit more personal of a video for
me to do so as some of you guys may know
I moved here with my husband from
Arizona to California and we did that
back in February I was going to transfer
with my job originally but it didn't
work out quite I did technically but I
quit my first day because it will just
stop there so I was with the company
before for five years and then I moved
out here quit and I didn't have a job so
for a while I was looking for a job and
then I also decided to start makeup
school I go to makeup school part-time
technically it's not full-time its
Tuesdays and Thursdays but it's all day
long on those days so I had that and
then I was able to find a job luckily in
May I loved it it was in the beauty
industry it was a beauty store we sold
makeup hair care skin care and it was a
good job I was there six months and I
just recently quit there's quite a few
reasons for why I quit I was a full time
manager there which meant that I worked
40 hours a week and I worked five days a
week so that plus school equals I worked
a hundred percent of the time I worked
Monday through Sunday and then it all
started over again I didn't have a day
off unless I specifically requested it I
didn't often request things off unless
it was a really big deal because I knew
going into this that this is what it was
going to be like and part of my
personality is like overachiever I think
that I can accomplish everything and
have time to have Sunday brunch and on
top of it so I did it for six months and
I just got to be so exhausted I was so
exhausted at the end of it and again
like I was saying that's a part of my
personality to want to be perfect and
want to do
everything right so I found that I was
putting a lot of my energy into my job
and although that's great and it's a
great quality as a worker right now in
my life I really should be putting a lot
of that energy towards school I pay a
lot of money to go to school and
although it's only part-time there's a
lot of prep work washing brushes all
these things that go into school and
having a great product the school I go
to is a year-long program school I go to
is a year-long program and there's six
different courses and we move through
stuff really fast we learn a lot of
stuff right now I'm in a class where I
life casted my face and we're molding
our own pieces and prosthetics so that
we can apply them in the next class so
it is quite intense although it is you
know make up school I think some people
would think that that's not real I mean
as a background on me I have two degrees
I have a degree in history and I have a
degree in religion and applied ethics oh
I've already done that school this is
like school on top of that but I chose
to go to once we moved up here so with
all of that it was just a difficult
situation and then I don't want to go
into bashing anyone or a company or
anyone I worked with but I love the
people I worked with but the management
there was sometimes difficult to deal
with and it just made it not necessarily
the funnest atmosphere I thought that
this job should be just fun I mean
although we're selling and doing all
these things
yes it's a job but it should be fun I
mean we're selling beauty products and
we're getting to talk about all these
great things with people who come in so
and we get free product I mean there's
so many benefits to this job
specifically and I just felt like it
should be more fun than it was and I
found myself being stressed out not only
because of like workload but just the
way the atmosphere in the store was and
like being nitpicked which is hard for
me I'm a perfectionist so I mean not to
toot my own horn but a lot of the time
there isn't that much to tell me I did
wrong I'm all for constructive criticism
but I don't enjoy being nitpicked I
don't think anyone enjoys being
nitpicked
it's like finding fault and things just
to find fault and then not getting
praise for anything and that can be a
very difficult situation to be in I
don't need someone to pat me on the back
all the time and tell me I'm amazing and
hold my hand but I definitely don't want
to be nitpicked if I'm doing a good job
so that was just I mean I'm not trying
to get you know tense here that was just
difficult for me and then I think to a
big part of it was me being a store
manager before made it even more
difficult to deal with things because if
I didn't feel like something was right I
did my best to like respectfully try to
fix it or handle that situation and I'm
only one person I can only do so much
and again my focus should be on school
not fixing the situation going on in
this work if that makes sense we're in
this whole company I mean you know I I
can't
I'm only one person I can't do that and
honestly do I want to be spending my
time fixing that do I get paid enough
money to do that or should I be focusing
on things that matter to me that I'm
paying a lot of money and that actually
truly interests me and are where I want
to go in my life that being said let me
look at my little sheet cuz I made a
little cheat sheet for me to look at so
with all that as the situation and all
those things taken into account I also
had to look at the fact that me and Sam
moved out here for Sam to act that's why
we moved out here that's the type of
people we are I think that says a lot
about us
me and Sam have been dating for forever
and then we got married finally but
we've been together over eight years and
even when I was a junior in high school
that was our plan to move out to LA and
for him to pursue acting and I think
that gives you kind of an insight into
the type of people we are we're people
who want to follow our dreams and
although we saved up money and all this
it's not like we'll just like be
reckless with our dreams but we need to
pursue them and and since I came out
here I didn't have any ties to this
company I'd quit the company that had
been with for five years and that was
really hard because it's like all I ever
knew what was the only job I ever had
and I had this like weird love for it
because it's just part of me
part of my past in history and just so
much part of me but I didn't have that
tied to this job and I just had to put
myself first I was way too tired and I
just wasn't feeling any joy at all and I
felt that not only was I not feeling joy
at work but I felt like it was sucking
the joy out of other parts of my life
and I just couldn't do it I couldn't do
it
luckily I have a husband who has a
pretty decent job out here that we can
right now afford to just have him
working and me doing school I don't like
to make money off of youtube I mean I
make like seriously no money off a
youtube so I didn't quit because I'm
pursuing YouTube full-time or something
um yeah that definitely I mean I could
maybe buy us some rice and beans you
know every three months um so that's not
why I was able to quit my job I just
couldn't do that anymore and I'm lucky
enough that a husband was able to
support me and also did just support me
leaving and he wanted me to leave he
told me while he was in Peru like why
don't you just quit and we'll figure
things out like not later like he had
figured it out but why don't you quit we
can handle you not having a job for you
know good four months or so and then you
can find something that you love after
school or at the end at the tail end of
school but just not have to worry about
that anymore so I'm kind of like turning
I think that that's really important in
just life and that's part of something
that I really want to stick to I think
sometimes it's really hard you are in a
job or in a situation or with people and
either they make you feel like you're
crazy to do something
pursue your own dreams or you feel
nervous and that kind of keeps you
locked into something that you don't
like and although I realize that
everyone can just up and quit their job
and I had a very special circumstance
where I could do that this time but I
think it's really important that we do
things that are gonna help us get to
where we want to be in the long run and
sometimes that takes a leap of faith and
a jump and people may look at you crazy
and you may feel like scared yourself is
this the right decision
you know oh my gosh I won't have money
like we used to all these things but I
kind of had to do a cost-benefit
analysis with my life and it's like I
only have one life we all only have one
life and this job wasn't helping me get
to where I wanted to be and so I figured
that since I was able to the best
decision would be for me just to cut it
out I left on good terms I put my
two-weeks and it wasn't just like run
away from my problems
it was solving my problems and I'm
really glad that I left I'm able to now
spend holidays with my family which I
wasn't going to be able to do and it's
kind of a big deal for me because I am
out here alone and that was part of it -
I'm very isolated and not being able to
hang out with anyone any of the friends
I made from work outside of work not
being able to hang out with anyone from
school or do any of the projects that
people were able to do with school I
wasn't able to do that because I was so
confined to work and it isolated me so
much and there was just I just couldn't
do it I was just felt so alone so
unhappy and I knew that that was going
to take me to a darker place and I
didn't want to go there so I put a stop
to it this video isn't to say that you
should
do a job you don't want or whatever
sometimes it takes a lot of hard work
and sacrifice and you're working a job
maybe you don't love but that you that
you can at least handle so that you can
get the money or the finances to pursue
something else that you you love and you
want to do and I think that that's great
but this one wasn't like that so overall
I mean that's why I quit and that's just
kind of my philosophy especially with us
making the move out here I don't want to
get stuck in a job that I don't at least
love or can deal with or you know that
doesn't just suck the joy out of
everything else in my life
and that's just where I was at that
point I think sometimes we look at
people who have these awesome jobs who
are doing something that they love but
are able to make money at it and we just
think oh they're so lucky but those
people worked really hard and made a lot
of sacrifices and took a lot of chances
to get where they are and I want to be
one of those people in my life so I have
to sometimes do that I even you have to
sometimes make those really hard choices
take a risk and bet on yourself and bet
that you're gonna be awesome and that
you can do this and you can handle this
situation it may not work out perfectly
but there I just feel like there's so
much money so much opportunity
especially out here in LA that I'd
rather take advantage of that and what
I'm doing now in school then focus and
give all my energy to a business to
someone else's dream instead of my own
dream if that makes sense so just let
you know what I'm planning on doing I'm
going to kind of just chill out for the
holidays really focus on school trying
to do some externships and gigs and
things like that and then after the
first of the year I'm going to
potentially be looking for something
part-time something probably beauty or
retail part-time or and if I don't
decide to do that then I am going to
wait until like after school look for
something full-time that has weekends
off holidays off like something really
corporate so that Sam can pursue acting
and I can be making more money
I have two degrees so I definitely am
like a viable candidate I have
management experience and all of that so
I mean not that you guys need to know
but I thought I would just let you guys
know about kind of where I want to go
what I'm doing how I think about things
in life and that's kind of it I hope
that this inspires you not to quit your
job but just to find the things that
spark joy in your life and focus on them
and make goals and plans to do what you
love be the person you want to be and do
the things you want to do I hope that
was good I thought that's a pretty good
ending alright I hope you guys are all
having such a wonderful day I hope you
enjoyed the new background I thought it
would film in front of my tree and stuff
for the holidays while it's up because I
love Christmas so much and that's
everything I'm gonna end this video here
I hope you guys again are having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
