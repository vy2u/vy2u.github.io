yelled at you guys right there
hi guys welcome back to our Channel it's
Lauren thank you so much for watching as
the title said I'm going to talk about
myself culture palette and why I'm
returning it yeah let's just get into it
I don't want to make this like a big
deal I know there are like 10 million
videos on subculture I'm not trying to
convince you one way or another if you
should or you shouldn't I honestly think
that if you were interested in this
palette just like swatch it out in
Sephora or wherever maybe get it and
then you can always return it if you
bought it from one of those places
some people love this some people hate
it I'm just in the middle I don't
necessarily hate this palette but I
don't love it and that's what it is just
like that's what makes me want to return
this I I really feel like in six months
I will have wished that I returned it
instead of keeping it and that's not
cool with me
so I did make a list of some of the
reasons I'm getting rid of this just so
I can like make sure I hit everything
that I feel about it I did end up duping
this palette and I let stupid series so
that's one of the reasons that I just
feel like I can get rid of this I am so
happy with all the dupes in that video I
don't know I don't think I need this one
that's like a big factor to me for the
few shades that I do really like in this
palette I feel like I have suitable
dupes that I could be getting use out of
and finishing up instead of having this
one of the biggest reasons that I'm
returning this is because the color cube
and the color electric as well as
adorned that one's not that bad but the
formula of these is not my favorite
honestly really hate it you had so much
hard pan electric has so much hard pan
to use these shadows it's just a pain
it's not worth it can you make them work
you can make them work you can make them
look decent it's just not worth it to me
it's not worth it for how much I paid
for this palette I mean I feel like if
this is any other palette I would be
pissed and because I really wanted to
like this and I love the colors in it
and it's honest Asya I feel like I'm
giving it more of a pass and that's not
cool when I used a door on the lid it
wasn't my favorite either it just looked
kind of creepy and gross so that was not
cool I just don't like the formulation
of those I have
so many pretty foils and duo crumbs in
my collection I don't need those so
those are all just out for me I really
do like the color Roxy that's my
favorite color and the palettes so
pretty the petal peach from Coastal
Scents is so similar that there is no
way I can justify keeping this whole
palette for that color I do really like
a new wave and edge as well but I have
similar colors in my collection
dawn is also pretty but it's so basic I
have a million shades like that the rest
of the colors in here I just don't think
I'm going to use very much or if I do
use them they don't work very well fudge
it does not blend out well on me I just
get it just gets patchy so I don't even
like to use it I'm too scared to use it
some of these shadows I am really
nervous to use because I just don't have
time when I'm doing my makeup for it to
look bad ever like know if I'm doing my
makeup I don't time to sit there and
have a go patchy and fix that whole
situation so I find with fudge I just
don't even want to use it
ulcer doesn't go to patchy on me but I
don't like how deep the color turns out
on my eyes I usually want something a
little bit brighter for my preference
but rowdy and access are just SuperDuper
dark plus the blues and greens in here I
don't normally wear a ton of blues and
greens so I just I just don't see the
justification with all of the other
issues I have with this palette to keep
it I do like the color mercury but again
that one tends to get a little patchy on
me as well so yeah for all those reasons
it's just not worth it to me I try to
think back at my Modern Renaissance and
how much I loved that palette and this
is not gonna sit anywhere near how much
I love that palette so I just don't feel
that it deserves a place in my
collection so overall I guess it's kind
of like my review and everything all in
one I didn't feel like I needed to give
it any more explanation than that I did
like the looks that I created with this
palette while I was testing it out but
there definitely nothing that I couldn't
create using other shadows of my
collection so that is why I'm returning
my subculture palette if you've had this
palette or tried it out let me know what
your thoughts are down below on it I
know this is like
or in the community in half and I have a
feeling that the new Hooda palette is
gonna do the exact same thing that
people are gonna be like it sucks it's
great it sucks it's great and for me
this just didn't work I wouldn't say
it's like the worst palette ever there
are some really good positives to this
but for me and what I have in my
collection already and what I prefer to
keep in my collection this does not hold
a place so I will be returning it I hope
you guys enjoyed the video thank you so
so much for watching and that's
everything bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
