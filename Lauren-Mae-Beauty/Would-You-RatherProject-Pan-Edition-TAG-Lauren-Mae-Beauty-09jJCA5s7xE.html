lauren i was tagged to do the would you
rather tag project pan edition this was
created by courtney ki will leave her
link down below and then i was tagged by
jessica and she has been on YouTube for
forever and she does anywhere from
project pan videos to book holes lots of
different stuff I will leave a link down
below if you want to check her out and
let's just get into the tag questions I
loved approach Japan so it only makes
sense that these should be fun questions
for me to answer number one is would you
rather do a year-long project pan or for
three-month project pans I kind of do
both I haven't your long one going on of
products I want to finish up just in
2016 and then I'd like to do seasonal
challenges but if I had to pick one I
think for three-month project hands
would just be easier it's fun to have
like an end date in insight and so you
can constantly be moving on to new
products it just doesn't get stale that
way and it doesn't seem so daunting
because in a year you can finish up
bigger products but if you put like a
foundation and a blush and all these
things if you don't use them
consistently you can kind of stray away
and I think just having that change
every three months just keeps you fresh
and keeps you motivated number two would
you rather pan and eyeshadow palette or
a face palette I would rather pan an
eyeshadow palette you can go through
eyeshadows so much quicker than a blush
or bronzer and you can also multitask
those products and I feel like get
through this practice faster because of
that the pans on I shadows are usually
quite small whereas the blush is really
large and it takes so long to use up
blushes bronzers aren't too bad if
you're using them every day but they
still can take a long time highlighters
could take forever so I just think to
feel accomplished and actually get it
done eyeshadow palette be so much easier
number 3 i'm reading off my phone here
guys so that's why i keep looking down
would you rather pan a red eyeshadow or
red lipstick until it's finished I've
actually tried panning a red eyeshadow I
had it in my finish 6 by summer I will
leave that link down below I made a bit
dip in it but I didn't quite hit pan so
I'm really hoping hit pan in the next
month or so I definitely would choose an
eyeshadow over a red lipstick I'm not a
red I'm not really red girl in general
but I feel like with an eyeshadow you
can kind of blend it out and diffuse the
color a lot easier than you can
the red lipstick and with lip products
we all know I don't usually wear lip
products if I do with two nude if not
just like a bomb or something so I
definitely think that I'd actually be
able to pan a red eyeshadow way easier
than I red lipstick I think it'd be
easier number four would you rather wear
lipstick or a blush for six months until
you use it up or just for six months
straight I would rather wear oh that's
kind of hard it's so tough if it was
buck sums dolly I feel like I could wear
that six months straight and be done and
I can be totally fine and not have to
worry about it and I could switch up my
blushes but sometimes I do like to do
something fun and I feel like your lips
can be a really big point of like a look
and I like to do fun looks too so ah I
guess I'll go with the lips just so that
it I I think that it probably would end
up being easier to disco with lip so I
would do lips for six months instead of
blush number five would you rather do a
project huggard pan or project 50 pan
roulette over the course of a year hmm I
feel like the hundred pan potentially
could be easier because you can pick the
items that are going in there so you can
like pick a bunch deluxe sized items or
things you really like I think it would
be more challenging and feel like better
throughout the year and once you've
completed it to do the 50 pan plus it's
fun it's kind of fun to not know where
you're gonna get and just feel
challenged so i think i would go with
the project 50 pan throughout the year
yeah i'm gonna go off the phone number
six would you rather use up your
favorite product to get use out of it or
use up your least favorite product to
get rid of it that is like I feel like
the crux of project panning that it's
like so the question isn't it I love
using up things that i like but i will
say i enjoy using up products that i
don't like to get them out of my
collection because then my collections
full of things i do like as long as it's
not something that i hate so much that
it's like killing me or something that
takes so long to use up that my other
products that i do actually love are
gonna go bad but it's something just
quick i'd rather just get out the stuff
that isn't my favorite or they don't
really like and get the money maybe i
spent out of it or whatever and then
just have a collection full of the
things i love i go back and forth but
most of time I guess I pick things that
I don't like or want to move out number
seven would you rather panel
your makeup until it's gone or declutter
and start fresh that is so hard it's
weird I've thought about this actually
before and I thought people who are just
starting to build their collection or so
lucky because they have no makeup they
don't have all these things that are
older in their collection that they feel
guilty that they bought but maybe they
don't want to use or they still feel
desires to let go get the new stuff I
don't know I don't know if I can choose
because I like panning the stuff I have
because I do like the majority of my
collection I really enjoy it but there's
so much fun stuff out there it'd be so
fun to just start fresh and and to just
go into buying makeup with the mindset
I'm in now instead of the mindset I was
that would be really awesome so I'm just
gonna go for fun with ya start fresh and
go in with my mindset yeah I can
repurchase on the stuff that's not
limited addition to my collection and
get those things I love but it'd be
interesting I think for me to see what I
would buy now that I'm me today but
still buying more makeup than I am now
that was like so confusing but hopefully
you guys understood that 10 number 8
would you rather lose your favorite
product or have to repurchase a product
you hate I know this one was kind of
easy like I'd lose my favorite product
and then just repurchase that product
jessica sutta to is just like I'm not
gonna buy product i don't like yeah I'm
not gonna buy a product I don't like
either so I mean all these things are
replaceable unless it's limited edition
or something but it's like if you have
your favorite concealer and you go on a
trip you lose it you just go right by
that concealer it's not a big deal
number nine would you rather panic
glitter eyeshadow or a black lipstick
you must use it every day until it is
finished I think everyone that I've seen
do this tag has picked the glitter
eyeshadow and I'm no exception I'm also
picking the glitter eye shadow I think
black lips can look really edgy and
really cool but I would not want to wear
black lips every day and I don't feel
like there's a formula of a black
lipstick I guess if you did a liquid
lipstick you could use it as an eyeliner
every day instead of as dress lipstick
so that might be a way out of this
question a little bit but I'd rather use
a glitter eyeshadow for sure I love
glitter yeah I would use the glitter and
number 10 would
other tag specific friends or everyone
to do this time I like tagging everyone
that's just how I always I don't think
I've ever specifically attacked someone
to do something so I tag anyone who
wants to do this to do it it's fun to
look at these questions and just kind of
reflect on your preferences and just
what your answers would be for this so I
hope you guys enjoyed my answers and
this video and I will see you in my next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
