is going to be a really really quick
video on the two rouge pur Couture
lipstick that I received from my gosh I
can't speak I'm nervous because there's
guys out saying that I received from
Influenster influenster i will link it
down below if you guys haven't heard me
talk about it now then I've had a couple
videos that they've sent me stuff anyone
can do it so it's not anything like
YouTube necessarily related I think you
have a better chance if you have like a
channel in an audience but honestly
anyone could get send stuff so
definitely sign up if you're interested
down below that being said all the stuff
was sent for free to me for like review
purposes so let's move on to my review
they sent me these two beauties in two
different colors one is number 19 which
I know is called fuchsia and the other
one is number 06 which I don't know the
exact name but it's 06 sorry guys these
are beautiful lipsticks they come in the
normal gold packaging very YSL very
luxurious the entire like thing with
these lipsticks is that they are
supposed to give you luxurious rich
color that dresses the list with intense
hydration and antioxidant care so it's
kind of like great for like any age if
you like their time is like you know
have the full spectrum of more mature
women younger women the color selection
of this line i believe is quite intense
they have quite a few different finishes
as well these ones are just the
moisturizing ones they're not like
anything special not like Matt or
anything I'm just gonna go into
swatching first so this is number 19
this is also what I'm wearing on my lips
that is it there and seriously these go
on so beautifully they're so rich I
would say to have a luxurious color
payoff they're very moisturizing this
took nothing like this is one swipe I
didn't have to build this up it's just
absolutely beautiful the other color
again &amp;amp; 0 6 i'll do it next to it I mean
super beautiful this one's definitely
the more wearable kind of rosy brown
nude color both of them are absolutely
beautiful in color I think that they're
great I definitely think
if you're looking for something that's
hydrating and you have the money to
spend on these I think that they're
worth it and they're a great product i
think the product itself is really great
the only thing that kind of worries me
about these products or the few
complaints i guess i have is because
they're moisturizing specifically like
this color it's definitely the color i
gravitated to the most out of the two I
like color so um this is definitely a
bright color to have a moisturizing
formula although I do find that if
you're careful this would totally work
it's just you know having that
moisturizing formula it's you know pros
and cons it's great because it's
moisturizing your lips don't feel
cracked it's more comfortable but it's
also more apt to move around the lips
and also um like just get everywhere so
it's good and bad I guess it just
depends on what you're looking for that
one can go either way it just depends on
the lip product that you want the really
downside of these which I feel like is
you know some people might not find as
an issue these all my light went off it
died okay we'll just keep going I'm
sorry about that guys the other thing
with this is the smell heavily of roses
that is something that's really hard for
me I find that it does get less and less
or maybe you just get used to it
throughout the time you're wearing it
but honestly it's kind of overwhelming
if you're someone that uses high-end you
know lip products and you're used to
something like that because they know by
terry's also smell of roses then this
wouldn't be an issue for you but if you
can't stand roses or you can't stand
stand that like flowery perfume II kind
of lipstick tastes than you would not
like these in for the price you'll
definitely not going to like it I do
find that these stain your hand or your
lips so that is nice first lasting power
like even if you're eating something
it's gonna leave that little bit of a
stain so it still looks more finished
and put together on the lips that's
gonna do it for this review I mean I
think if you have the money and you want
to splurge they are very nice I don't
think you have to have these ones to
have this nice of a formula but I do
think sometimes these items are fun to
treat yourself with and if you have a
tick your birthday or something like
that I think they are fun and if you get
a color that you will actually wear
all the time I think that's what makes
something like this more usable and get
your money's worth out of it because if
you get a color that you never wear or
you know that you're not going to wear
very often then yeah might be beautiful
but it's just beautiful sitting on your
vanity so I just suggest that if you're
going to invest and you're going to do
something like this for fun just get
something that you're actually going to
wear and that you're going to be wearing
all the time so that way you can really
use it and enjoy it instead of letting
it sit and go bad in your collection
anyway that's just the project panner in
me I've been talking in this review I
hope you guys enjoy this video they're
beautiful overall they're beautiful it
just depends on if you want to spend the
money or not I hope you guys have a
wonderful day I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
