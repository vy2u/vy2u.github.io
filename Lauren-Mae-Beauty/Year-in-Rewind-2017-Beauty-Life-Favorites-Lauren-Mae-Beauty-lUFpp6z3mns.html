learn thank you so much for watching
today I'm filming quite a few different
videos they're all gonna be kind of like
fun end of the year types of videos so I
thought it was appropriate to wear my
most classic makeup so today we're gonna
talk about my top favorite beauty
favorites of the year this is like a
year in rewind I went through and
watched all of my old favorites videos
kind of got a feel of what I was liking
if it's still a favorite if it's not and
just kind of wanted to get a good idea
of the year because I post a lot if you
guys didn't know and so it's so weird to
think about where the years started and
ended and sometimes I think things are
way farther away or happened a long time
ago when they haven't or they just
happened and it's been like seven months
so that all being said these are my top
favorites of 2017 I'm gonna be talking
about my absolute favorite beauty
products first and then I'm gonna go
into other things I do have a favorites
video from 2016 I'm gonna leave that
linked because I didn't even watch that
I didn't want to go through it if you
want to see like all Beauty favorites
and just like a ton of really awesome
stuff check that video out because those
are all still favorites too I just
really wanted to be even more specific
with what I was mentioning in this video
I mean just like very very favorite
things and I think that's everything
we'll stop it there let's get into my
favorites I decided that I'm gonna
mention the hair favorite first just
because this is something that I can't
believe I've been using for so long this
is the viral extreme hot pink color wash
and this is what I used to dye my hair I
do not usually use like any type of dye
I just used this so my mom is a
hairdresser she drives my hair blonde
even though I do have quite fair hair
already and so I just keep it up with
this I love it so much highly suggested
I'm gonna leave it linked obviously with
all the other stuff and I always leave
things linked but they have a bunch of
other colors as well so I highly suggest
this if you want an easy way to keep up
with your color cuz with colored hair it
just fades so fast my hair is never the
same color every single
it's different and I find that this
really helps just make it easy and
manageable to have fun hair I'm on top
of that I find that this color
specifically fades really well I like it
from when I first wash it all the way
until it's like almost out I still think
it looks pretty so I highly suggest this
definitely worth the money I feel like
I'm so close to the camera right now I
assumed us out a little bit just because
I was like getting creeped out I was
like so close in screen just you guys
now if my bra showing like I'm sorry
y'all it's just the way it is I have
boobs and I have a bra on
so yeah let's move on to other favorites
I wanted to mention mac fix+ this is
been something that I have found I kind
of need in my collection I love using
this to spray on my face after I've done
powder it really does give the skin a
skin like finish and I don't find that
it makes me more oily throughout the day
I also love this for foiling eyeshadows
and I find that not all sprays are
created equal if you use just another
type of like setting spray it's not
gonna work the same this one just does
an amazing job so I do highly suggest
this I think there are a lot of
different ways you can use it plus it
smells just amazing so this is something
that I would repurchase and I find that
I'm often taking out of my makeup kit to
use in my own personal collection we're
kind of going in order of like face
stuff I guess so we'll just keep that
going next I did want to mention a
foundation this one is like my all-time
favorite one so when I use in my kid I
know everyone has different skin types
and everyone has different preferences
but this is what I suggest for everyone
I am into my own style I like the skin
I like seeing skin and I get that people
want foundation to kind of perfected and
I find that this is perfect the name of
this is the mango forever Ultra HD
foundation this has a medium coverage
and if you need more coverage than that
I honestly just suggest getting a really
heavy duty concealer get something to
spot treat with you don't need to have a
mask on your face but again you do you
if you love something that is full
coverage by all means continue doing
what you're doing but if you want a
suggestion from me this is what I
suggest they have a huge shade range
which i think is amazing
and personally one of my favorite things
about this foundation is throughout the
day it's just easy to continuously kind
of blend out and make look good
I find on my skin when I use something
that's super full coverage that maybe
really Lots down Matt at the beginning
it'll look really good for a couple of
hours and then after that it starts
creasing it starts breaking down and
then there is no going back I mean it is
splotchy if you try to blend it out with
your fingers it just gets crazy really
really fast for me and I'd rather have
something that maybe does let my oils
show through a little bit but I even
kind of like that a little like I like
looking alive I like having a bit of a
glow so I just suggest this I think it's
amazing another favorite for the year
I'm not talking about necessarily this
product specifically but just in general
translucent powders are great again I
like having a lighter look to the skin
something that's gonna set down your
foundation and keep it in place but not
going to really cake it up not give it
too much powder this one is the kiss pro
touch it's what I've been using all year
I'm almost done with it but I I really
just think like any translucent setting
powder is going to just be so nice it's
gonna be lighter coverage don't get me
wrong but that's what I've been into
next I wanted to mention a product from
milk this is their matte bronzer and
it's a cream they have two different
shades and this one specifically is in
the shade baked I love this product it
is such a natural bronzer on the skin I
like blending this out with a brush I
find it's just a little bit faster you
can use a Beauty Blender as well or even
just your fingers it's just great it
adds warmth and a little bit of subtle
definition which I really enjoy and I
think it looks really natural on the
skin I still love my Physicians Formula
butter bronzer but I thought I would
mention it something different and
something else I've been loving
specifically this year for blushes I
really couldn't narrow it down to just
one so I thought I would mention the two
that I basically use all the time rocket
or is the blush that I basically
suggests for everyone I just love it so
much it's easy it's simple
it has a shimmer to it but it's not like
overly shimmery where it's gonna like
emphasize pores or texture on the skin
I've hit pan
- so much so this is just like an easy
go-to blush for me I don't have to think
about it it goes with everything but it
still adds a nice flush to the cheeks
the next one I have here is from Tarte
and this is the color party I got this
for my birthday this year so that was at
the beginning of the year and this was
actually in my January favorites video
of 2017 but I still love it it's so good
I'm wearing away the imprint on it which
you know means I definitely like it this
is a matte color and again it's just a
very universal shade it goes with
everything it'll go with any eye look I
don't have to think about it and I
really like the way it applies on the
skin so both of those are kind of like
my go-to blushes next let's talk about
brows because I have had a brow journey
let me tell you if you go back to my old
videos my god it is so cringy it's
cringy oh my gosh and to think that that
was me being like I've got a lighter
brown today they were intense I'm glad
you guys stuck through and are still
here because honestly if you go back to
any part of your life and you look back
and you see what you're doing you're
like what got firk but specifically my
brows were pretty bad even in the
beginning videos of this year so I
thought I would talk about the brow
products that I feel have really changed
my brow game I love brow gels but there
are so many different ones that I used
throughout the year and definitely like
that I do want to mention a million and
I didn't want to mention one cuz they're
all in an even playing field so I'm just
gonna talk about the brow pencils I know
I talked about this a lot and it's
because I love it it's the elf brow
pencil in taupe this is two dollars and
I love the price point we've talked
about it we get it I love that this is
two dollars um
I use this in the tail of my brows to
really I guess sculpt them out it's a
little bit dark I can use this on my
entire brow I just find that I tend to
go to heavy-handed on the brows and so
sometimes I can get a little heavy with
this but if I take my time and really
you know try not to be heavy-handed I
can use this on my entire brow get a
nice pretty precise brow and I think it
looks really good but the product that I
like to use in conjunction with this is
the colour-pop brow boss in the
shade blonde I talked about this and
said I didn't like it at one point I
said I did like it I went back and forth
and I love this I I'm gonna order
another one before the end of the year
because I am going on a no buy for
January I just ran out of this today and
I can't be without it because I can't go
back to the host brows this is really
light but I love the way that it looks
in the front part of my brows it it just
makes it easy for me not to go overboard
and I need that I really do so these two
together it's still only a seven dollar
brow combo and I love it I've also I
guess I'll mention the brow gel that
I've been using because I do really like
it it's the elf one it's like the
natural brow gel now if you have really
thick bushy brows you might not like it
because the wand is very thin very
skinny it's like one of those under lash
mascaras but it works so well I love the
way it applies product to my brows I
don't need a lot of taming I just like
brushing them up and just making them
look a bit fuller and like perfected so
those together that's still only a $10
brow like trio it's great I love it
we're gonna talk about eyeshadows and I
could have mentioned a million things I
have a lot of eye shadow favorites I
shadows my favorite thing but I don't
think I could do this video if I didn't
mention Urban Decay electric palette and
specifically I love the color savage I
have pan in it it's what I'm wearing in
my brows today this has become like my
signature look you guys might think that
I just do this in videos or to be edgy
like nah this is me this is what I wear
this what I look like I just love the
way this looks it's so me it's a little
bit funky but this is like my everyday
like some people do wings liners some
people like you know put shadow in the
crease every single day I could do this
every single day as my look you know so
I have to mention that I know this is
discontinued but it's honestly my
favorite pink color I do have one from
colour-pop and it's not the same I've
tried the huda beauty one in the
obsessions you know little palette it's
not quite the same so I'm gonna be
working on trying to find a dupe for
this for you guys and for me so I can be
using something that isn't discontinued
since I do you mention it so often on my
channel and if I continue to use it the
way I have been I mean this will
eventually run out I would like to find
something to replace it something that's
light and bright and just as blendable
so good I love it sticking with eyes
before I move on to lips I did want to
mention a mascara this is the Urban
Decay perversion mascara it's my
favorite it's what I have on my lashes
today I always get compliments on my
lashes and I am naturally blessed don't
get me wrong I'm not gonna sit here and
be like like my lashes are ugly like I
have pretty good eyelashes but this
mascara just does them justice I love
the way it looks it's super black this
gives me a fluffy lash I've heard a lot
of people describe this as wet and I
would not I don't know if I just don't I
don't know I don't think this is very
wet maybe at the very beginning but as
it dries out I I wouldn't consider this
wet and it just makes my lashes so
fluffy I feel like they look like little
demi wispies on my own and I love it I
highly suggest it I think there is like
still that pack I got on sale at Sephora
for Black Friday so I'm gonna leave that
linked down below
it's like 15 dollars for the full size
pretty good and you get a eye liner so
you know next let's talk about lip
products this is the Fenty beauty gloss
balm in fatigue glow I had to say that
seven hundred times I love this so much
I am wearing it today mixed with another
lip gloss but I love this it's so easy
to wear I love the smell of it it's
comfortable it's easy I say that already
yeah this is my favorite lip product
that I have right now I love that it
gives my lips a tint but it doesn't it's
all over the top I feel comfortable
which is so important for me I do not
like matte lips for anything other than
basically like filming I think they look
pretty or they're great in photos but to
wear all day like when you
working or doing stuff it's just like
get off me oh I need comfort so this is
amazing highly suggested worth the price
the other product that's new to me is
from sol de janeiro and honestly I just
want to mention something from them
because I truly do love their products I
have a whole video talking about the
products I'm gonna leave a link down
below but this is the Brazilian kiss
Koopa ku-ku-ku-ku value say it lip
butter I love it it smells so good
mine got melted in the car in my purse I
was doing a shoot outside my perch was
in the direct sunlight and just melted
this thing but I loved it so much I'm
almost done with it and I will be
purchasing another one because we are
taking a trip next summer and I want it
for that so yeah I really would like
this guys it's super great it's a great
lip balm it's not overly shiny me and
Sam can both use it and enjoy it I like
that it has a nice smell but when you
put on the lips it doesn't have like a
really sweet taste I hate that I hate
when a lip lip product is like super
sweet or super I don't know like you you
know lick your lips a little it's just
like distracting and just too much for
me
it's not like that so I like that oh
alright those are all the Beauty
favorites that's it I know that was
still a lot but you know I feel like you
can go kind of overboard and like have
like a million things in every category
if you really want that check out Emily
Noelle she did like a ton of different
days and broke categories down and just
like really put some work into that so
if you haven't seen that definitely
check out her like top favorites for the
year so moving on I did want to mention
a kind of like fashion favorite I don't
normally do that but I'm gonna mention
my glasses I love you so much I think
these made it into like two different
favorites videos and these are from firm
ooh I'm gonna leave these style link
down below
always use a coupon these were sent to
me I get a lot of glasses from them I
think they like contact me every three
months or so and they let me pick out a
new pair of glasses and so this is like
my third or fourth one that I've picked
out and it's my all-time favorite one
I've ever picked out I've had a pair
after I got these and these are still
the ones I go back to I love the thin
frame it's very popular at the moment
the circular lens
is a very on trend but what I also love
about it is that these are so
lightweight now I talked about the fact
that they feel a little bit cheap but
they feel cheap but they feel
lightweight and I love that I feel like
when glasses are heavy they tend to you
know give me headaches and I just
feeling comfortable in them these just
feel great on the face and that is very
important to me I love that they have
the little feet so that's the only place
touching my face besides you know what's
holding onto my ears I can smile and my
cheeks don't touch the bottom of the
glasses which I got some big ol cheeks
oh I love that these are just great
they're so cute and then I specifically
have like a pattern to mine so they have
like a kind of like purpley almost like
a groovy man feel to them and I love
them I love them so much I feel super
cute in them other people really like
them I've had people stop me and like
whole foods and all these places and be
like what are your glasses and like want
me to like tell them the style of my
glasses right then in the hair and I'm
just like well okay so highly
suggest these I think they're really
great I think they're really affordable
I've been very happy with everything
I've got from fur mail so yeah really
like these I check them off but I'm
probably gonna wear them for the rest of
videos sometimes you know it just feels
good to be able to see you know cuz I am
blind like I wear this glasses every
single day of my life so the last couple
of things I want to mention are mostly
like media favorites as well as like
work favorites so in general I'm really
happy with my Instagram if you guys
don't follow me you should what
shameless plug I don't post like your
typical I guess like beauty kind of
Instagram stuff it really is just a
secondary place for you guys to like if
you want to see what I'm doing and see
what I'm up to you I post about my work
I post about things I like I post cute
selfies it's just kind of whatever I
want and I really enjoy that as a visual
medium that's why I like YouTube so much
because it is so it's visual as well as
informational it's not like a blog you
know so I love Instagram I I connect to
it in a lot of ways I'm not saying
I'm like a picture taker also known as a
photographer I'm not like professional I
gonna have like amazing things like that
but I do enjoy it a lot and that's one
of my favorites when it comes to work I
wanted to mention because I do have so
many new followers and it's insane I
mean that obviously is a favorite how
much my channel has grown this year is
insane
I really wish I knew exactly where I was
at the beginning of 2017 I want to say I
was maybe at like 5000 subscribers or so
and at least at the time I'm filming
this I've met 25,000 and it's insane
it's crazy I cannot believe that much
growth on it if I'm being honest with
you guys one of my stretch goals this
year I was like if I can make 10,000
subscribers this year by the time 2018
happens I will be so excited and it was
getting to like September and I was like
right and it was getting to September
and I was sitting there and I was like I
don't know if I'm gonna make 10,000 you
know I was telling salmon alright sorry
for the dog interruption but it's
getting close to the end of the year and
I was like I don't think I'm gonna make
it and then my makeup addiction video
was a really big hit and I got a lot of
views on it and I got a lot of
subscribers which is so amazing and I
really love that that is one of like
that was like my first like really big
video and it's such a personal story of
mine it's such a personal video that it
was so amazing for so many people to
respond to it and to I don't know be
moved by it or feel the same way or just
connect to it and so I hit 10,000 after
that and I celebrated that on Instagram
with cute little Donuts and I yeah that
was so amazing and then for in three
months to have over doubled that like
three months from one that video took
off and I hit 10,000 I couldn't believe
I was like oh my gosh I cannot believe
this and then to double from there pit's
insane so I just want to say thank you
that's obviously a favorite and it feels
so surreal and weird and I don't want
that to sound
it's definitely not a negative weird
it's just strange it is weird you know
yeah it's like what you hope for
and like the dream but it's this far-off
dream and you don't entertain that
thought too too much because you know
you have to do a lot of a lot of videos
that don't get a lot of views and have a
lot of heart growing pains on the way up
so yeah that's a favorite anyway that's
not what I was really gonna say but I
just got into it what I was on the way
to saying was one of my favorites for
this year for working is second Wives
Club I know a lot of you guys are new
and so I am a working makeup artist it's
like what I do but I worked on the show
second Wives Club on E I was like the
main makeup artist for the show I didn't
do like Shiva's makeup and I didn't do
Veronica's I did hers once they had
their own personal makeup artists that
they brought on that production didn't
supply I was part of production
essentially and yeah so Katie and Shauna
I did their makeup elides and Marissa's
makeup a lot that was such a cool thing
to see my work on TV and on such a like
huge platform sadly a second wife's Club
did not get a second season which I was
a little bit surprised at but um yeah it
was still such a cool experience I'm
really happy to have worked on that show
to have yeah made those memories had
that experience and that was a really
cool thing this year another favorite of
mine is a thesis that I worked on I just
talked about listen to get ready with me
but this is kind of like a new thing it
just happened so one of the thesis is
decide mm-hmm I don't know one of the
movies I worked on at AFI it's a short
film it's called a natural it made it
into a really big short film festival
and that is just so incredibly exciting
I mentioned in that but like the numbers
it's amazing that this made it in and
don't get me wrong we were all excited
for this film but for it to actually
make it in and be one of 73 picked is
insane so that is such a cool
accomplishment definitely one of my
favorites for the year next let's talk
about some movies and TV shows not ones
that I did make bond just like ones I
enjoyed watching with that first though
I want to mention movie pass although
this is so
I got at the end of the year it is a
yearly favorite because it has changed
my life movie pass is a monthly
subscription for movies I'm just gonna
leave a link go check it out but it's
like you pay monthly and you can go to
specific theaters and see movies for
that much money it's crazy it's it's too
good to be true but it's true it's like
the one thing that actually was true so
I guess I'll go into movies one of my
favorite movies this year so far is Lady
Bird I think that's my favorite one
that's the only one I can remember just
like absolutely loving absolutely oh
it's so my style of movie I think
everyone did a really great job I love
that it's just like so real it's sad
it's funny sometimes it's both at the
same time it's so real and relatable and
those are the types of films I really
connect to and I really enjoy being a
part of I love watching so I love that
movie for some TV shows I loved the
night manager it was so good I don't
know why it took me so long to watch it
I don't think it came out this year I
think it came out in 2016 but it is so
good if you have not seen it I believe
that you can stream it on Amazon and
it's like a six-part miniseries is what
you would call it how big little big
little lies that's also one of my
favorites I didn't put that down by just
thought about it because it's a
miniseries as well ok so my night
manager Tom Hiddleston Hugh Laurie I
believe that's his name so good actually
you can watch it with your husband or
your boyfriend and they would like it
probably just as much so good loved it
big a little lies loved it as well so
good highly suggested I feel like your
husband's definitely gonna like that one
too don't get me wrong so I mean if they
like good shows and the like is so big
little lies highly suggest I also just
suggest The Handmaid's Tale that was
something that I watched and really
connected to as a woman and I suggested
I think it was really good really well
done amazing acting so those are some TV
shows that I just randomly added but one
that is not random that I put on this
list because like hello it's everyone's
favorite us Game of Thrones if you
haven't seen Game of Thrones what are
you doing
a million people have probably told you
by now like hey Game of Thrones is
really good you should watch it like
just listen to
and just do it it's so good even if
you're not like law geek even if you
don't like that type of crap you're
gonna love the show cuz it's amazing um
no I just really enjoy that show I think
it's so good it's like everything I want
when that music plays I am so down this
was the first time we were watching it
actually well it was like you know
coming out we had just started watching
it I think this year or yeah I think
this year so it was really cool to like
every week at a new episode although
it's horrible and I just want to binge
it but anyway I love Game of Thrones
I'll stop talking about it and last I
just had a few music favorites I wanted
to mention I am gonna leave my Spotify
year-long playlist or like your favorite
playlist down below I think that is a
very good representation of like what we
listen to do it like mostly like rap and
hip-hop but then there is like Billy
Joel throughout it and like Paul Simon
and Sam have some Bob Dylan in there and
I don't know it's like a very good mix
definitely all the songs I listen to the
most this year but some standouts to me
are definitely post Malone stoney album
I love that album I love him I think
he's like a cool dude man it's so funny
I mentioned that's people and people
feel like oh he's so like ugly or weird
I'm like you guys are judgmental he is
cool as hell
