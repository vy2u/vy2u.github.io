here really fast if sorry I'm spoiling
the look for you guys
but I forgot to mention at the beginning
of this video that I would really
appreciate it if you guys could go check
out the uber commercial that I worked on
if you guys follow me on Instagram you
saw me post some things about hiking and
it's showing you my makeup and I showed
you like this gnarly blister that I did
and that commercial slash like short
film is finished and it's up on the uber
YouTube channel so I'm gonna leave a
direct link to that video down below if
you guys want to check it out and just
see my makeup work in that video but if
I could ask you for anything else
besides that it would be amazing if you
guys could leave that video a like it is
a part of a contest and we're one of
nine videos to be chosen and it would be
amazing and I know it would mean so much
to everyone who worked on this film if
you guys would leave it alike and
support it there are other ones too if
you want to check them out obviously
please like ours but if you like other
ones I can't tell you what to do so um
yeah anyway that's it I feel weird doing
this cuz I'm not usually someone who
does this but I thought that I would at
least share it with you guys you could
see my work but if you wanted to go the
extra mile and leave a little like on
that page it would be amazing anyway
onto the tutorial for this eye look hi
guys welcome back to my channel it's
Lauren and thank you so much for
watching today I wanted to do a kind of
Blu honey inspired look I'm gonna be
using some of the shades from my lips to
put on the blue honey palette I have a
video on this if you want to check it
out
if you have the Jaclyn hill palette
though and people were also suggesting
the kathleenlights palette they're very
similar
although I will be using a lot of the
yellow type of shades today the yellow
is really the inspiration overall I've
just been really wanting to do an all
y'all look Georgia Harris just did like
an all yellow look and I really liked it
so we're going to be going into that
palette I'm gonna be using my yes please
palette and the shade here and I'm also
gonna be pulling for my pastel goth for
that yellow so um yeah that's kind of
what I'm working with today I already
did my face and my brows and everything
so we're just gonna get straight into
the tutorial I'm gonna zoom in so you
guys can see my eyes a little bit better
I tried a different foundation
combination today and I'm not
fan of it so don't judge me all alright
we are zoomed in nice and close scuffle
I hope I'm in focus first thing I'm
gonna go in with just this creamy matte
shade and I'm going to be setting my
entire lid I did already prime it but I
want to make sure we have a good base
now that I have that done I think I'm
gonna go in with the pastel golf palette
and we're going to go in with the shade
star which is the bright yellow and I'm
using my e-40 brush from Sigma and I'm
just going to be buffing that into the
crease so you guys can hear the lawn
blowers I'm so sorry
it was jackhammers before that today I
swear you would think I don't know I
don't know where you guys think I live
but let me tell you it's always loud and
busy here
I'm also going to be bringing that up a
little bit into the brow bone and into
this area just because I want this
lightest brightest color to really shine
through it's not really blending the way
I want it to so yeah I'm kind of dealing
with that issue currently I'm gonna move
into a smaller blending brush and I'm
gonna be taking the yellow from the
yesplease palette and I'm just gonna be
deepening up some of that color I'm also
gonna be taking this all the way down on
the lid like I said this is a very
yellow look I've just been really
wanting to do yellow lately I don't know
what it is
and I'm not sure how this is going to
turn out so just like bear with me
and then I'm going to blend out the
edges with our original efore tea brush
I'm really really liking it hopefully
this next step doesn't ruin it but I'm
gonna go in with the shape paper tiger
and we're just gonna be putting out on
the outer edges just to give a little
bit of like some type of dimension
although I'm just feeling the yellow I'm
also getting a tiny bit of fallout so if
you're really concerned about that I
would your eye makeup last first I'm
using this brush just to kind of put
down the color I'm not sure how I'm
liking it but we'll blend with a
different brush in a second
I switched brushes this is just a small
eco Tibbals
basically this look is fire I'm gonna
loved it so much I'm gonna go back into
the e-40 and just blend out any edges
and that's as deep as I want to take it
I really want to keep it super yellow
I'm glad we have a little bit of
definition it's looking good so I do
have some fallout like I mentioned I'm
just gonna take this bat cream this is
actually the same matte cream as in the
yes please palette I'm just gonna try to
clean up anything I have going on I'm
not super worried about the fallout I
think it'd be really pretty to do like a
little bit of like a shimmer here but I
also really love the matte so I don't
want to ruin that I think I don't know I
don't want to ruin this okay I thought
it was maybe gonna do like some blues on
the bottom but I really kind of want to
keep that i varied yellow so I'm
actually just gonna go in with paper
tiger on the bottom lower lashline
and just on the outer half I'm using a
pencil brush and I'm gonna give it some
definition the enemy's a fluffier like
angled brush and I'm gonna go in with
the pastel Gogh palette and not yellow
and I'm just going to blend that out and
I'm gonna take the yellow into the inner
corner I'm so obsessed with this look
and then just to bring in a little bit
more definition I'm going in with a
smaller brush and going to pack this
paper tiger once again on the lower lash
line
I do think I'm gonna bring a little bit
of blue in this is my BH Cosmetics
what is it black light palette I'm gonna
take the color Queen and it's just like
a shimmery metallic blue and I'm gonna
put that on the inner corner
and I'm going to bring it into the
yellow little I am super liking the way
this looks I'm going to put on some
mascara and liners for mascara and using
my Urban Decay perversion and then the
two liners that I'm going to be using
this one is Max Costa riche and then
this one is from white and monnel it's
just a white one I'm going to be putting
that on my waterline and then I'm gonna
zoom us out so I can show you guys that
and we'll pick a lip out and this look
is almost done alright so I went a
little bit heavier with the liner than I
intended I actually put a little bit on
my top lash line instead of just tight
lining with it so yeah there's that I
think today I'm gonna go in with this
kind of like Coralie color I think this
is gonna complement the look pretty well
because it's quite warm with those
yellows which just is like a coral and
then the blue orange is like it's
complementary colors so that's what I'm
hoping anyway
I just did a light layer of it but this
is the color cosmic from bareMinerals
it's just a lip gloss okay and that is
the final look guys I hope you enjoyed
this kind of hopefully quick tutorial I
want to try to incorporate more just
tutorials instead of like get ready with
me so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed thank
you so so much for watching and I will
see you my next video hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
