Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to start a new kind of
series or just type a video on my
channel this is going to be kind of
audience interactive I hope you guys
enjoy that I don't know I think it'll be
fun I was kind of inspired by Kaylee
okay is it Kaylee baute I think that I
say she did a video where it's like you
guys decide what makeup she gets to try
and then she gives you collective
reviews and she was inspired to do that
video by fancy that with Candice so I'm
gonna have both of them linked down
below so it's kind of a mix of that and
then also Samantha March is doing March
Madness which is you guys pick face
products for her to try in a video and
so I kind of like took it some
inspiration from that you had some like
you know creative brainstorm power going
on and so I've been thinking about
buying some new makeup and I just
thought you know what I would love to
get your guys's recommendations so I
have ten different products I'm going to
talk about today we're gonna be doing
highlighters because I don't know what's
wrong with me I'm just like I like to be
late to the trends I'm like oh you know
Kanye's album life of Pablo that's
really good and everyone's like that
came out in 2016 and I'm like well okay
it's still good today
and not time with highlighters so I have
ten highlighters here that I'm going to
tell you guys about let you guys know
why I wanna I'm like just no I'm tell
you guys why I'm thinking about buying
them and then I would love to hear your
guys's recommendations in the comments
down below and then based off of what
you guys say your reviews or suggestions
or just what you guys want me to try
even if you haven't tried it like you're
like oh you should try this I'd love to
see a review or whatever it is I'm gonna
pick the top three and buy those
products and then come back and give you
guys a review and comparison to other
things in my collection and just overall
talk about the three highlighters and
what I think about them and yeah what I
like about them and everything I think
it'll be really fun I hope you guys
enjoy this I know I do a lot of things I
like not by but I really thought this
would be fun for you guys to be able to
recommend products I feel like a lot of
you guys try way more products than I
even do and so I would love to tap into
the knowledge that you guys have and get
some recommendations from you guys I
don't think I missed out on anything so
that being said let's just get into the
ten highlighters that
looking at and we'll get the thing going
so the first one is one I talked about
in my makeup temptations and so I just
had to put it in here I have a couple
actually I think from that one in here
but I'm talking about the two-faced
diamonds light highlighter this is
something I know I don't necessarily
need but it's just so pretty I love the
way it looks in the packaging I just
it's tempting me so much that it's like
kind of going into like I kind of want
to buy it so that's the first one this
is a kind of like duochrome prismatic
type of highlighter it's not just like
your basic everyday one but I will say
my collection has quite a few of these
so I would love to know your as is
thought I know a lot of you guys in that
video said you really liked it so so
number two the second highlighter I'm
thinking about getting is the Laura
Mercier matte radiance baked highlighter
this is something that doesn't get a lot
of love anymore like I know it's like a
cult classic product but I feel like
metallic more blinding highlights have
kind of taken over so this one is taking
a backseat and not as many people talk
about it but as you guys know I do
overall like a more subtle highlight so
I think this one would be really nice
I've heard so much about this for a
really long time and it's something
that's on my list to like give a go see
what I think about it I love the laura
geller baked highlighter in french
vanilla and I feel like these are kind
of similar so I kind of want to test
that out and see which one I like better
next is kind of a fasting line this is
the Natasha de Nona
all-over glow shimmer powder in light
and it's just one of their highlighters
it comes in three of my shades but of
course I'm gonna get the lightest one
cuz I'm pretty fair this retails for $38
so it's not as expensive I feel like as
it could be being Natasha Genoa and I
just kind of want to give some other
products of hers a chance I really want
to try her glow primer too but anyway I
tried those shadows and they're not
necessarily my favorite especially for
the price but I kind of want to give
this a go and see how it looks on the
skin I love the looks that she creates
on Instagram I think she's an amazing
artist and so I would love to try the
highlighter out and see how it works on
my skin next I probably want this one
because of all of the hype but this is
the a BH and amrezy sand dunes like
highlighter collaboration this just
looks so pretty and it's gold
I don't know I'm scared that it won't be
light enough for my skin
I'm scared with the descriptions that we
use do we even know what we're saying
some of the times I don't think so what
I mean to say is I just don't know if
this project will be a little too dark
for my skin tone but it just looks so
absolutely beautiful every swatch I've
seen it just looks so so pretty so
that's something I'm thinking about
getting number five on the list is a
highlighter from Kylie baby these just
look so pretty and I've heard from
everyone who's tried them in that video
you guys said that they're really really
pretty and it's more subtle but still
really beautiful and I want to try it
out so that's on the list and it's
something a little different for me it's
a brand I've never tried so it's kind of
just overall a little exciting and will
quench some curiosity number six are
just Oprah highlighters in general I
have heard so much about Oprah I know
raw Beauty Christie loves her Rodeo
Drive which I'm not as dark as her
though like she's just like a couple
shades darker than me so I don't know if
Rodeo Drive will work for me but I know
blissful is like a newer one they look
so beautiful and so many people like
them so I want to try one of the over
ones the one from the nikkietutorials
collaboration might work the best for my
skin tone I don't know let me know if
you guys have a bunch of Oprah
highlighters which one you think would
work best for me for the next three
we're gonna have some like drugstore one
so hopefully you guys pick at least one
of those cuz like Sam my wallets gonna
be hurting if not number seven though is
from colour-pop and it's their
flexitarian highlighter I'm not someone
who really loves cream highlighters but
one I love color pop and I've never
tried any of their cream highlighters so
I kind of want to try them and then
specifically the shade flexitarian looks
like crazy metallic and beautiful so
I've seen it used in like photo shoots
and different things and it just looks
so pretty so I'd love to like try it and
feel it and just get some thoughts on
the formula I put in here the Physicians
Formula butter highlighters because I
love the butter bronzer and I've heard
bad reviews about the blushes like
they're not very pigmented and all that
and so I just kind of like for the price
let those ones go but I think the
highlighters might be cool so if you've
tried those let me know your thoughts
and if you think they're good number
nine I'm kind of letting the gimmick get
to me but I haven't seen anyone talk
about this so I kind of want to try it
this is the AL may make them jelly
highlight it comes
two different colors again this is kind
of that like duochrome
like a serial type of situation going on
I feel like the kind of got inspiration
for Eddie the Far Sally like jelly
highlighter but these ones are more like
glittery and pink or blue and so I kind
of want to try it out again no one's
talked about him I would love to see
some freakin swatches and reviews but
ain't no one putting it down probably
talk to you we'll come up with one
before I even do this video watch and
the last highlighter on the list is from
bareMinerals this one is the invisible
glow powder highlighter again we're kind
of going back to the really subtle
highlights I really like bareMinerals
products I don't know why they don't get
as much hype I mean okay I get why they
don't get as much hype they're not as
crazy cool and really pigmented and
super over-the-top as what's very trendy
right now but I just think they have
really nice products in great quality
every lip gloss I've tracked from them I
love that's what I'm wearing right now
on my lips it feels great it's it's just
no nice everything I've tried I really
enjoy actually except for the well
rested I think I'm gonna return it it
just it's not working out it's too dark
for my skin tone and it just it's not
what I wanted anyway just a little
update on that but I do want to try that
one out it looks kind of cool I think
this one might be like the most subtle
out of all of them so it would be
interesting to see how that's gonna look
on the skin especially for someone who
likes a subtle highlight like is it
gonna be too subtle or not subtle enough
or whatever you know okay so those are
all the highlighters if you guys want to
leave a comment down below on which
highlighter you think I should try and
then if you guys don't want to leave a
comment but someone's already left to
comment about the highlighter you think
I should try then just like that and you
can leave like your top three if you
want and then I'm gonna like leave this
up for a week before I go through and
like tally up what the winners are and
whatnot so um yeah let me know if you
like this idea so we can continue it on
with other things like if you guys don't
like this I guess we won't I think it's
gonna be fun though I really hope you
guys do but I kind of need your
participation to make it work so yeah I
I'm excited I'm super excited to try out
some new highlighters I have like high
hopes for and I hope that they'll work
really well and I think it'll be cool to
kind of compare them to what's already
in my collection in that follow-up video
so that's everything thank you so much
for watching and thank you in advance if
you're gonna leave a comment I really
appreciate it and
I'll see you in my next video hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
