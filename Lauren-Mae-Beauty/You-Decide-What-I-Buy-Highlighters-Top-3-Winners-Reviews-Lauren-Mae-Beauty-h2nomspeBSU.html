Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I am finally coming back at you
with the results from the highlighters
that you guys decided what I bought if
you don't remember that video I don't
blame you cuz it's been a really long
time so I'm gonna leave it linked down
below but this was a series that I
wanted to start and we're gonna continue
on after this I promise but I picked out
10 highlighters that I was interested in
trying and then I had your guys vote in
the comments of which ones you wanted to
see me try out review and come back and
let you guys know what I thought about
them so I told you guys I would pick the
top three highlighters that got the most
votes
I would buy those and test them out and
so I have the results today I'm really
excited I want to say thank you so much
for all your participation all of the
comments there were so many on that
video next time I will definitely do a
poll because it took me oh yes to figure
out how many comments there were so I
got over 2,000 votes for all the
different highlighters that we had let's
get into the number one highlighter you
guys voted for and that was color pops
flexitarian this was something I was
talking to you guys about I've heard so
many amazing things about this and I was
interested in the formula because this
is a cream formula so I picked up
flexitarian and that one with 404 votes
so it was the clear winner out of
everything the next item that one was an
Oprah highlighter and I told you guys I
was going back and forth between pillow
talk and I think blissful no pillow talk
and Oh glazed donuts that's the
nikkietutorials one but what ended up
happening is by the time I had counted
up the votes and everything had gone
through I saw that Oprah had a little
palette so this is the feelin myself
palette and this retails for $29 you get
small versions of three of their
highlighters this one is blissful this
one is pillow talk and then this one is
Rodeo Drive so I thought that this was
an amazing deal it's like the price of
one of the highlighters to try out three
of them so that's the second one this
one got second place with 369 votes and
then the third place winner was the Too
Faced diamond highlighter this was
something that I've been wanting because
the packaging is so freakin cute and so
yeah I picked this one up and it was
expensive and I can
to give you guys some reviews this came
in third place with 271 votes there were
a lot of other ones that got in the 200s
fourth place went to the Omri Z
highlighter from Anastacio it had 256
votes and then the laura mercier matt
translucent or matt baked highlighter
that one came in fifth place with 230
view so those were so close
but they didn't make it and I was almost
gonna do a top 5 but I was like okay you
have to draw the line somewhere
obviously you want all of them just pick
the three that one okay so let's get
into my reviews of these products I'm so
excited I've realized that I love
highlighters I know I'm a little bit
late to the Train I know it's kind of
mellowing out which is really nice
because it was a lot of highlighters at
one point I mean there were palettes and
you know singles coming out every single
week I feel like from the same brands
even but I am super happy to report that
I am a fan of all of these highlighters
I think that they're all very beautiful
there's something that I really cherish
and love in my collection which is
amazing so the first one I'm going to
talk about is the color pop one it is
the one I'm wearing today and I will say
I think this is my favorite one out of
all of them the price point is just so
good this is eight dollars and it's just
so beautiful this is what it looks like
and mine is kind of beat-up because it
is a cream and when you put your brush
in it does kind of make some holes
here's a little finger swatch of it and
then I'll give you a swatch on the hand
and I will have video of me demoing this
the sheen on this is just incredible I
love it when I first got it in the mail
I was a little bit nervous because I
knew this was a cream I wasn't sure how
I was gonna apply it how it would work
and I do find that just applying this
with a brush is the best way to do it I
personally use this one from AOA studio
it's very similar to the Anasazi one and
the reason I like this is because I can
easily dip it into the product and then
sweep it onto my cheeks because it is
such a small precise brush I can really
blend it out but not get it everywhere
this is a highly highly metallic glowy
product so if you aren't someone who
wants that much glow I don't think this
is going to be right for you I didn't
feel like I was someone who liked that
but this is just so pretty it's so
pretty on the skin
it does have some I don't want to say
glitter cuz it's not glitter but the
first time I used it I was like oh I
don't know if I'm gonna like this cuz
it's very shimmery but it just melts
into the skin the longer you wear it the
better it looks on the skin I really
really love this I will say when I was
first using this I wasn't sure if it was
breaking me out because I was getting
some little minor breakouts on my
cheekbones but I was also really sick at
the time so I'm not sure if it was my
immune system I've been using it like
every day for the last like four days in
a row trying to like see if I'm breaking
out again and I really haven't noticed
anything out of the ordinary necessarily
so I'm still kind of on the fence I know
someone in the comments had said they
had broken out from it too so I'm not
sure but I still love it so much so it's
something I still would wear like
honestly I will keep you guys updated in
other videos though if I find that this
is breaking me out but it's so beautiful
I really truly love it I think that if
you're gonna make a color pop order I
would pick this up if you like
highlighters you're gonna love it and
something kind of cool about this is you
can't apply at different ways you can
use it with your finger you can use it
with a sponge and those are gonna give
you less of a shine and even if you use
a brush if you just tap the brush in and
then apply it it's gonna give you like
an OK shine and be really pretty but if
you really dig this in and you get
almost some chunks on your brush you can
like see it and then you put that on
that's when you're really glowing and
then you just work that into the skin
and it's just so beautiful beautiful so
highly suggest this really great and I
can't believe you get such an awesome
highlighter for the price with that
order I also picked up a brush this is
there like highlighting brush or fan
brush it's the f13 and this also works
well with it it's just a little bit too
big I feel like to give me precise
application with something that is so
shiny and shimmery I just want a little
bit more precision since it's such a
out-there highlighter but I do really
like this brush for other things like
bronzer and other highlighters so this
was nice and it works with the
highlighter but I prefer the one I
mentioned next let's talk about the
Ophir ones because they were number two
on the voting I'm really happy I got the
palette because I was able to try out
the different ones the blissful shade is
just a little bit too dark for me it
just you can see
the darkness on my cheek when I move
back and forth so the only two I've
really been testing out long-term are
Rodeo Drive which is the golden wine and
then pillow talk which is in the center
pillow talk is so beautiful and works
with my skin and then Rodeo Drive on its
own unless I go really really light
handed I have to mix it in with pillow
top again though I think these are
beautiful highlighters the hype is real
if you were wondering if Oprah was worth
it I really do think that they are these
were like a thinner formula than I
thought they would be here are some
finger swatches I just thought these
were gonna be less powdery and more like
gelee but they're not they're a powder
they're just highly highly metallic so
those are some swatches I hope you guys
can see I like to apply these either
with the brush I mentioned the AOA
Studio one this one or my normal
highlighting brush which is the contour
brush from Real Techniques and my
favorite way to apply these is I will do
my face I'll do my foundation powder
blush bronzer and then I will spray my
face down with my Too Faced hangover
mist so I'll spray it down and then as
its drying I will go in with my
highlighter and I'll mix the two shades
and then I buff it into the skin and I
find that that really makes this melt
into the skin look highly metallic
because it's kind of almost foiling it
and it blends out really nice like
that's just my favorite way it looks
great applying it regular but I just
find that I get less texture when I do
that both this one and the colour-pop
one are gonna leave texture on the skin
they're very highly metallic like these
are more pop and highlights for sure but
they're beautiful I think that they are
worth the money they're worth the hype
their quality highlighters I really
really have been enjoying them and I was
very skeptical and again I highly
suggest the set because of the price you
get to try out so much for such an
amazing price and then the last
highlighter I have here is the Too Faced
one and I was really excited that you
guys picked this one because it's
something I probably would have never
picked up like it was always on my wish
list it was always something I was
interested in and kind of wondering
about but I don't think I would have
like bit the bullet and actually
purchased it because it's expensive I
think this is like 32 or 34 dollars the
packaging is absolutely beautiful it
looks like a diamond ring would be in
here but instead you just have a diamond
tie later so this is what it looks like
and it's gonna be really hard to show
you on camera but this is a duo
chromatic highlighter and when you look
at it in person it almost looks like
there's like an oil spill on top of it
because you see like pink and blue and
green it has like multiple colors in it
I'm gonna try to swatch all three of
them for you and hopefully we can see a
difference on the camera I don't know if
they're gonna show up the different ones
but there's like a green one there is a
blue one and there's kind of a pinky one
hopefully you saw something from that
swatch but if not I definitely suggest
going in store and seeing it it's always
so hard for the camera to pick up yo
crumbs I really like this highlighter
and something I love about it this is
like a gel a formula so it's very thin
and you don't need to put a lot of this
on to show the application I haven't
found any issues with it being like
different colors from one cheekbone to
the other since it is kind of like this
marbled mix of different colors for me
this turns up just kind of in general I
see and I feel like the colors that pick
up the most for me are blue and kind of
pink I really don't get too much green
it doesn't look green on my cheekbones
is what I'm trying to say overall I
think this is really really beautiful
and something that although I do have
other dual chromatic highlighters in my
collection I have the Anastasio
moonchild glow kit I have the alchemist
palette from Kat Von D I have the black
light palette from BH Cosmetics I have
the Naked cosmetics one that we got in
the boxycharm like I have a lot but this
formula is so nice and different than
all of those I feel like the other ones
are thicker or more powdery and again
this one is just so thin and just gives
you the shine which is so pretty and it
makes it so that way when you're looking
straight on you don't necessarily see it
and then when you turn that's when the
flash happens and those are some of my
favorite ways to wear duo chromatic
highlighters because they don't just
look obnoxious the whole time they
really do catch the light in interesting
ways that make it still look really
pretty on the skin and to me wearable
again for applying I like using just the
traditional ones and I do
like using the setting spray just to
kind of like make it look more melty
into the skin but that's just something
I like to do with most highlighters like
basically with my routine it's just
something I do at the end but I don't do
it the same way I do the over one that's
really the only one I do where I'm kind
of like applying it while my setting
spray is still wet
whereas I will apply this and then put
on my settings brave alright guys so
those are the highlighters that I picked
up let me know if you have tried any of
these in the comments if some of them
are your favorite or which one you would
want to pick up out of the three also
let me know what category you want me to
do you decide what I buy on next I'm
thinking loose powders because there are
a lot of high-end brands that have come
out with loose powders and I'm like I
want to try them all so that's something
I'm thinking but if you have another
category you really want me to try let
me know down below and I can get started
on that when I get back from Italy so
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed the video and I will
see you in the next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
