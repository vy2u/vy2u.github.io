Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another to talk and
it's been a it's been a minute since
we've done a tube talk so I will leave
the playlist linked down below if you
guys want to check it out it's just me
talking about some topics that usually
have to do with YouTube usually have to
do with the beauty community but just in
general just things I want to talk about
it's kind of just a fun way for me to
start a discussion and honestly that's
what I want from these videos is like
just discussion and a place where we can
have hopefully intelligent conversation
whether we're on one side of an argument
or the other or a debate I don't really
want to call it an argument cuz we're
not like mad at each other but um yeah
we all have different opinions we all
have different experiences and those
help form like how we feel about things
and something that I'm learning in life
and that I think is just really
important especially lately is just
having empathy for other people trying
to put yourself in their shoes trying to
see stories and situations from a
different perspective and I think that
not only helps this world be a kinder
place but I think it helps you to like
not get upset about things or just to
like understand more and just to be a
better person in general hopefully make
better decisions in your life so anyway
enough of that goodness Lauren um today
we're gonna be talking about the YouTube
ad pocalypse and I just I've been
wanting to talk about this for a while
actually and I this wasn't the original
tube-top I was gonna film today I just
was starting to like think about it and
was like you know what I'm a little bit
more passionate about that today and for
these videos I like to be just like
ready to go a little bit more so that
being said I'm not as planned I feel
like as I normally am so keep that in
mind I mean these are all kind of off
the cuff just me talking but this one
might be a little bit more all over the
place or a little bit more sporadic I
guess than the other ones so for me with
the ad pocalypse that means I also want
to talk about just like in general
people making money off of ads talking
about like multiple ads and videos
patreon just things that youtubers or
channels may be doing to create extra
income because some
their videos are being demonetised or
not considered advertiser friendly I
feel like my perspective on this is kind
of unique just because one I am a
creator so in a lot of ways I'm like
yeah let's make money guys I'd be
awesome because it's awesome to create
content and then happen to get paid for
it from ads that's amazing but then part
of me I'm also an avid watcher of
YouTube I watch a lot of YouTube so
because my channel is a little bit
smaller and this isn't my full-time job
I also feel like I side a lot with
subscribers in a lot of ways where I
don't agree like I don't care I don't
want you to do that even if it's gonna
make you more money or you're not making
as much money so let's just get into it
I of course want to hear your guys's
thoughts down below and something I want
to bring up too is I'm not trying to
judge anyone that does something a
certain way even if I don't like it you
do you these are just my thoughts and
I'm totally open to because some of
these I don't feel like I have concrete
thoughts on these are just kind of like
oh I kind of feel this way about it and
I might not have an exact like reason or
a really strong belief on why I feel
that way at least maybe not something I
can verbalize but I'm totally willing to
like hear other people sides and you
know again ya figure out other people's
reasons for doing things and that always
helps people to understand okay anyway
and after that my gosh I just like I'm
explaining so much it's just been too
long since we've done one of these I
think that's it if you don't know about
the YouTube ad pocalypse I believe this
started about March of 2017 this year
The Wall Street Journal ended up doing a
piece about how YouTube ads we're going
on videos that were like really
inappropriate that were racist or
terrorist videos and just different
things and how basically that's horrible
so that spooked a lot of advertisers and
they pulled out didn't want to be a part
of YouTube didn't want to have their ads
on YouTube and because YouTube takes a
cut of the Adsense that's part of how
they make their money as well they have
changed their rules a lot since then
where things that aren't deemed
advertiser friendly aren't going to be
monetized you're not
have ads run on those videos they've
also changed things with the partner
program so you cannot even monetize your
videos now and tell you at least have
10,000 views on your channel and then I
believe you are eligible for
monetization I have no problem with that
I think that's actually a good thing
because when you're that small of a
channel you're honestly not making any
money anyway ask anyone who has like
built their channel up from the bottom
10,000 views is a long time to get to
and you're not gonna make basically any
money for those 10,000 views anyway so
it's just kind of like a way you can
kind of do whatever you want
build your channel up and then once
you're serious enough and you have
enough of a subscriber base or just
views even if you don't have a lot of
subscribers but a video you made it gets
a lot of views then you're eligible and
I think that's good plus I believe when
YouTube first started you had to apply
to be a partner and even then you could
still get rejected so I still think that
this is a positive way that they're
trying to make it work anyway that's not
what this video is about I just wanted
to give you a little bit of a background
so a lot of people and I don't think the
beauty community is as affected by the
ad pocalypse as some other channels are
but since then since about March a lot
of videos are being demonetised based
off of like tags that you put in it
based off of titles they have a
guideline of like what's considered
advertiser friendly and the guideline is
very very vague which I'm a smart of
YouTube to do because then they can kind
of use whatever discretion they want and
it can usually any video I feel like
could potentially fit under like being
deemed not advertiser friendly so
because of that a lot of youtubers have
lost a lot of money they're not making
as much money as they normally would
have and it's just been this kind of big
thing like how are these bigger channels
gonna survive how are they gonna make
the money that they used to be making
and I think something that also went
along with the videos being too
monetized I think a lot of people are
making a lot less even on the monetized
videos that they have then they were in
the past anyway that is my understanding
from everything I've watched on it and
what I've heard from other channels and
whatnot for me personally I was not
really hit by the ad pocalypse
because I am such a small channel and
a lot of my growth has come in the last
couple of months I really haven't made
that much money on YouTube at all you
have to be making quite a few thousand
views to be actually getting like a
paycheck every single month so for me
getting paid on YouTube was never like a
big thing from the beginning of my
channel like finally I'm at a place
where I'm making a tiny tiny bit of
money but where was I going with that
 I'm already I'm already being
sporadic but I know a lot of bigger
people were so for me it's not that big
of a deal and I think something with me
and how I go into things is like nothing
gold can stay baby I don't know I feel
like YouTube is an amazing platform I
suggest for everyone to do YouTube I am
like so Pro YouTube in the sense that
I'm like oh you like to like plant weird
crap in your garden like make a youtube
video about that or you like - I don't
know collect weird baby dolls that you
know I don't know sing the ABCs like
making a youtube video about that there
are so many like weird niche communities
on YouTube and I just think it's like a
fun way to one connect with other people
who have similar interests to you I just
think it's so cool that you could
potentially make something that is a
hobby into a stream of revenue for you
and when I talk about YouTube like I
would love YouTube to be this awesome
thing where it is a big stream of
revenue for me and helps pay my bills
and everything but for me that's like
the thing like YouTube would just be one
stream of revenue I don't think counting
on YouTube for all of your money is a
smart idea because this isn't a typical
job you can't depend on this paycheck
because if your views change if the
clicks change if someone purchases
something or doesn't through the link
all these things change what you're
making per view or per thousand views on
YouTube I don't even know how it works
honestly I have no idea I've tried to
figure it out it's still like way above
my head and so it's it isn't smart to
count on YouTube as like this secure
form of income because it's not and
honestly a lot of people have said this
before - but it's like even any job is
like you potentially could get
fired the next day or something feel
wrong I could go bankrupt they could
sell off and they'd fire you or whatever
there are so many things that can go
wrong in life I think it's just
important and smart of people to take
whatever money they're getting and to
plan for the future and I think that's
like to me one of the biggest issues
that I'm seeing with a lot of these
creators is it's like are you guys like
planning for the future like I get being
upset with YouTube and how the
communication hasn't been a big thing
and they should be better about that I
also think that some of the things where
it's like do the role of lie to everyone
or do they not those things I definitely
think need to be cleared up and that
YouTube needs to work on but when it
comes to just you know the pay rates
being totally knocked down or you know
them changing what's considered
advertiser friendly and what isn't
that's part of it and if you have
abandoned whatever job maybe you were
doing to do YouTube full-time I feel
like that is one of the risks that you
took and I don't think that you deserve
it because you took a risk I think it's
amazing that you took a risk I think
it's amazing that people want to pursue
their dreams
I'm totally someone like that I mean me
and my husband moved out to California
to pursue our dreams so I think it's
great but with that they're random
things happen and come up and I think
it's how you respond to those situations
and how you adapt that's really going to
help you stay stronger and get better
anyway I feel like I'm kind of going off
on a tangent for that so let's um cap
that for a second and let's go into some
bullet points because I think that will
help get my point across a little bit
better first I want to talk about
multiple ads and videos now one of the
ways that people have been kind of
combating the fact that they have had
their revenue cut or maybe some of their
videos are demonetized or they're just
making less money is by putting multiple
ads in videos I am someone who does
monetize my channel so you will probably
see an ad before some of my videos so I
get and I'm okay with making money and
having that ad I get the idea of like oh
I'll just put more ads in my videos I
make this content I want to put
on it and I'll make more money that's a
great thing and I see that as a creator
like yeah that's awesome to make more
money and potentially I I haven't looked
into it because it's not something I
personally would ever do to my channel
but I understand the idea of like oh
that's a way I can make more money and
people can just skip through a couple
more ads but as a subscriber
it drives me bananas and I absolutely
freaking hate it so much I already hate
the ad at the beginning but I feel like
I've just come accustomed to it I get it
I want them to get paid ba ba just like
the selfish thing of like not this ad
especially when there are 30-second ads
that is like ridiculous to me I'm like
get the F out of here like I need a
quick little attic and skip or something
looks like 15 seconds or less other than
that it's just a little bit ridiculous
to me and then to go to the point where
you're littering your video with ads I
cannot stand it like if it's too much
for me
it's just personally not a way that I
want to create extra revenue on my
channel and I just don't like it oh I
hate it so so much let me know what your
guys thoughts are on multiple ads on
videos like if it's not a big deal to
you if you like it whatever I just I
can't stand and I hate it so much
especially when you can see like the
yellow dots on the time line like oh
it's so much I feel like I especially
see these with like drama channels um
mostly drama channels are a lot of like
who just like litter their video with
those ads anyway those are my thoughts
on multiple ads I just wanted to like
bring that up they aren't my favorite
way for people to create extra revenue I
just I don't want to see more ads like I
don't especially because in the beauty
community too I feel like sometimes the
video itself is a big ol ad so yeah I
don't I don't want to watch like seven
different ads on top of like being sold
to in a video so yeah it's not my
personal favorite way to make revenue
let's talk about another thing that I
well I don't have very good feelings
about for most people now that that is a
very big point I want to make but
patreon
I want no guys no no no no for me
patreon works for like a specific group
of people
I feel like content creators who you can
tell put a lot of time and money and
editing and research they have they have
knowledge they're bestowing on you I
feel like they are more suitable and
kind of like the right fit for patreon I
totally understand like Kurt's it guy I
don't know how to say it exactly it's
something salmon really likes to watch
I'm gonna leave this channels link down
below it's like a more scientific
channel and they like ponder certain
questions and whatnot and they have some
really cool animation that they do
anyway I understand them being on
patreon I think it's cool it's like an
educational thing that makes sense to me
a couple examples of people who maybe
aren't so much like as corporate I feel
like that that one's a little bit more
has like a corporate feel like it's a
whole company but people are more
individuals I really like the channel
ask a mortician she is a mortician and
she also has I believe a funeral home I
think she has a funeral home but it's
more like green and stuff it's really
cool I think it's here in LA actually
anyway she has a channel where she talks
about death she talks about a bunch of
different things like iconic corpses is
one of her series yeah she spends a lot
of time on her channel she has a lot of
information to bestow and for me I feel
like she is giving great information and
I'm probably someone that would never
really support anyone on patreon I think
for her channel if that's something she
wants to do like I'm not mad at it for
her being on patreon same with a woman I
watched named Shay Lindsay I think she's
changed her name since then but again
she'll be linked down below she does
video essays about movies and stuff and
she puts a lot of time and energy into
them they are way more researched and
thought-out and edited than a lot of
other videos on YouTube
and I think that's my biggest thing
obviously this is all subjective so it's
like to me these ones are okay and I get
that other people might be like know
this person's content is okay and you
know worth to me paying for and I guess
you know as viewers we're the ones that
are gonna make that
if we want to support monetarily our
favorite channels are not but I think my
biggest issue with it is that I feel
like some of these channels are very
very small so it's like I just I feel
weird asking people for money like that
like I think that is just so weird
especially when it comes to things like
hey YouTube is a big dream of mine and
it's not making me enough income at the
moment but I still want to do it guys I
really want this to be my dream so if
you could help fund my dream I'll follow
you on Twitter or like that's one of the
reward tiers or if you want to help
support my dream of me doing what I want
with your money that you're working hard
for all uh I don't know I'll give you a
shout out of my think I don't know I
just I'm not a fan of the patreon system
for that that's just a personal thing
for me I just think it's weird to ask
people for money and I get that again
everyone's different on that I'm not
trying to like necessarily judge anyone
I'm just trying to give my opinion on it
I just I don't think I could ever do
that I think it's just super strange it
feels weird it feels weird for that to
be like one of the tiers like I'll
follow you on twitter like who the hell
am I like who gives a if I follow
you on twitter
but like I'm just a person what the
Freak that's like super weird to me like
to even like put yourself on it like I
like a higher rung like that you're
follow on social media even means
anything like has some type of value
like that super weird so for me patreon
are just kind of like a weird thing and
I feel like they're being abused
a little bit I don't know I I just think
like YouTube honestly really should
start out as a hobby and it should be
something you're just doing because you
want to do it doesn't matter if you make
money doesn't matter if it syncs money
it's just something you like to do and
then and even if it's not even if you're
like no I want to do it as business I
want to make money on it then freaking
work hard like this is not something
that's going to give you a return
overnight and that's something you
should go into with YouTube so when
these smaller creators or people who
aren't at a level where their views
can't sustain them or even their
sponsorships consisting them I
personally find
a bit old tacky for you to ask your
subscribers to help you know pay for
your house or pay for these things
especially though and this especially
for me is like irritating when I see
bigger bigger youtubers who are like
asking for money on patreon
it just gets weird right because then
what if they go on vacation and they go
on a vacation to like a tropical island
like to me as a viewer I'm like oh you
can't make enough money but you can go
on a tropical vacation but you're using
that money from your subscribers to do
that like I think that's super weird
like things start getting weird to me
when that happens oh I'm not sure how
much some of these larger creators make
all I can base it off is what I know I'm
making and also like I try to do a
little bit of social way to like figure
out potentially what people could be
making and I know there's a lot of money
to be had on YouTube I know that if you
get a lot of views you definitely can
make some money so it's a little bit
frustrating to me to see creators who I
know get you know lots and lots of views
complain about money and I think that
goes back to kind of like planning for
your future it's like you're not always
gonna get a million four million seven
million views a month so yeah you might
not be able to afford Cartier bracelets
and all of this really expensive and
lavish stuff but when things go wrong or
you're not making that much money
anymore you lived outside your means
it's hard it's hard for me to like sit
there and feel bad for you and want to
support you on patreon so that you can
have all of these things in life that
potentially I'm not even having I just
think it's very very strange anyway I
hope I yeah I'm not sure how clear was
on that one I feel like I could probably
talk a whole video about patreon and the
things I don't like about it and I and
the way I feel like it's being just kind
of used in the wrong way you know and I
mean it's kinda like a go fund me that's
like hey guys I just really want a
computer because you know everyone needs
a computer nowadays so if you could help
fund a computer for me that'd be cool
like what like I'm all about being kind
and nice but I also think that when it
comes to YouTube
part of the part of the thing is the
hustle and and
me the hustle is definitely not turning
to patreon the hustle is how can I get
past this can I upload more often maybe
I don't upload twice a week I upload
four times a week I'm gonna double my
uploads and hopefully that'll get me
more money maybe I'll add a new series
to my channel that won't get to monetize
that isn't going to be deemed
unadvertised err friendly that is going
to actually make money i just think
being creative in those ways is a better
way to make money than to just literally
like say it give alms to me
I think that's weird you're literally
saying my content is enough like you
they're not getting anything else I
don't know it's so weird to me I feel
like this video is getting a little bit
longer so something else I want to talk
about before we kind of wind this down
with yet populist happening again like I
said I do think that creator should be
paid for their content I think it's
awesome and I hope that people can make
enough money on YouTube to support
themselves and hopefully move on to
bigger and better things and you know
pursue whatever it is that they want to
pursue in life so with that being said
if they're not making as much money when
it comes to ads I think that we should
also be okay with some things happening
that maybe before weren't and for
example I'm thinking about like
sponsorships when it comes to the beauty
community I know a lot of us hate
sponsorships I know a lot of us feel
like some of the bigger beauty gurus are
sponsored even when they're not or it
just feels like is this a review can I
trust it or whatnot but you know
sponsorships don't always have to be a
bad thing and for me I like to look at
sponsorships as instead of them
literally asking me for money or like a
patreon they are getting the money from
a company to make a video saying I don't
know if whether it's reviewing a product
I mean a sponsored review seems kind of
like mmm how does that work but if it's
just like a video where they sponsored
by Clinique let's say because I know
that's been going around and they just
do it get ready with me using a lot of
clinic products I don't know maybe not
be just like totally pissed off at them
for doing that instead of them trying to
sell you clinic stuff being like use my
code clinic 30% off they actually were
just sponsored by them got the money
from the company made it get ready with
me talked about some fun cool stuff and
we move on with life it's like Clinique
is a reputable brand maybe
like everything but I think that it's
fair to say that's you know enough of
their products are good enough for them
to be a company so I think just being a
little bit more relaxed about things
like that would be better for us as a
community especially the beauty
community
I know sponsored videos are a lot
different when it comes to other sects
of YouTube anyway that's something that
I think I also think that you know if
creators are going to come up with their
own merch or they're gonna come up with
products to sell I think that's like a
nice way potentially for them to make
extra streams of revenue to compensate
for may be missing out on some when it
comes to advertisements if it's a water
bottle with their name on it or whatever
and if that's something you actually
really like like you're actually getting
something for that money that you're
giving them and it's supporting them
like to me that's kind of like a win-win
and like when it comes to the beauty
community I know a big trend right now
is that everyone's coming out with their
own lineup products and like I get that
I think that's really cool actually
because like I mentioned a million times
that's something I would love to do in
my life that's something that's been a
goal of mine even before I started my
youtube channel but you know it's like
giving either them a chance or
supporting them if you actually like
them and support them and I think in
general we just need to like stop hating
as much on that I get that it's
irritating when they're like virtually
goodbye oh I can't stand that line but
yeah finding other ways to support your
your youtubers whether that is by giving
them a watch or buying some of their
merch if you actually think you'd like
it and you actually want to support them
like that is really awesome and you know
I'm not getting mad at them for
branching out in those ways to me those
are way more productive ways to
potentially make extra forms of income
than adding a million ads on their video
or having a patreon I think last I just
wanted to touch on something that's kind
of irritating to me but then on the same
time I also get it and I think it's
irritating that people are irritated by
it so it's like I'm a I'm a hypocrite in
myself here no I'm just torn it's like
everything is not black-and-white so I'm
kind of just like in the middle and I go
back and forth but you know I've seen
quite a few creators make videos about
not making enough money on YouTube
talking about how they're pissed about
it talking about how YouTube sucks and
they need
and all this stuff and part of me gets
it as a creator myself I understand that
it's irritating that they're not you
know talking to you or they're not you
know doing all these things that you're
making less money and you don't even
know why you don't know how you can fix
it
it's hard to get in contact with anyone
like I said the communication is just
really poor on that but I think that
telling your subscribers that sometimes
feels like a slap in the face you know
it's like I think sometimes the bigger
you get the harder it is to kind of
relate to maybe someone who is working
you know 9:00 to 5:00 minimum wage but
you're higher up in your career and for
you your career happens to be YouTube
instead of it being like a banker or a
lawyer or whatever it is so when you get
on camera and you start complaining
about not making enough money or not as
much money as you used to and you can
potentially go in there socialblade and
see how much money they are potentially
making it can kind of feel like a slap
in the face to your subscribers to then
ask them for money or I don't know just
complaining about it because you're
sitting there thinking like okay well
sorry you don't make $30,000 a month
anymore and you're only gonna make
10,000 like as much as that's a huge cut
and I guess that they have expenses for
their channel and all the stuff again I
see both sides I see on both sides like
Chanelle little Frank Ocean I get it I
think that sometimes it can just come
off the wrong way and it can feel just
like I don't personally enjoy watching
it sometimes like I've zamel watch it
because it's drama but it's like I don't
know it just kind of can rub me the
wrong way a little bit depending on how
it's talked about but then I'm on the
other side to where it's like you know I
see some of the comments being like oh
you're just you know stuck up or you're
whatever you don't even know you need to
come back to reality blah blah blah but
it's like you know on on your own
Facebook all the time you see your
friends complain about their job and
complain about all these things and so
when a youtuber does that they're just
doing the same things but their job
happens to include the audience that
they're also tweeting that out to and so
that's where it gets really weird you
know what I mean
anyway I think that's all I'm gonna talk
about I'm gonna end it here I don't even
know if I made sense I feel like I see
that the end of all these videos those
are just some of my thoughts I would
love to hear what you guys have to say
on some of these things especially some
of the people that are creators that
watch me I'd love to know your thoughts
and the subscribers you know I think
that's that was but my idea was for the
next tube talk or the tube talk I was
going to do today instead of this one
was kind of like this kind of like look
at creators versus subscribers I think
sometimes it's hard for each of them to
like understand each other and I think
that it'd be better a better
relationship if you could understand
potentially where the creators coming
from but also if creators can maybe
understand where subscribers are coming
from a little bit more and just kind of
like the different modes of thought
between the two because they're
definitely different and I definitely
have different thoughts when I'm in a
more of a creator mindset or if I'm in
more of a subscriber mindset so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
if you have any other ideas for tube
tops down below I would love to know
what you guys want to talk about and
that's everything thank you so so much
for watching guys
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
