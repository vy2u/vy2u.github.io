Lauren this is going to be YouTube made
me buy it tag this is obviously super
popular this has been popping up in my
recommended videos is popping up in my
feed so I thought that I would join in
and also do it something I really liked
about this tag is it's not just bad
products or good products it's just
products that you bought because of
YouTube because you watch someone else
have it or it was all the hype and then
you can give your kind of opinion and I
really like that so I have quite a few
products here these are all things that
I don't think I would have purchased if
I wasn't super end at YouTube I'm just
gonna start off with some bigger items
the first one I wanted to mention are
the vise palettes I remember coffee
break with Danny talking about the Vice
- palette and how much he liked it and I
didn't pick that one up I wasn't to
makeup at the time but I just thought oh
I wasn't interested in it and then she
was like raving about it she really
liked this like one purple color and I
was so upset that I didn't buy that
palette so the next year I for sure got
on the vice 3 palette this is what it
looks like they're absolutely beautiful
I really do like them I definitely know
that I picked him up because of her this
one is last year's vice palette and then
they aren't doing one this year
technically so the vice palettes to me
definitely have like a specific youtube
memory with them so I really like these
another Urban Decay product this is the
Naked 3 I was not technically on YouTube
when the naked one was like crazy
popular
but once the Naked 3 launched everyone
went crazy for it and I also bought it
this was something that was in my
products I regret purchasing video I'll
link it down below if you want to check
it out but I just don't know I just said
not feeling this one I know a lot of
people really like this I just feel like
so many of the tones are so similar feel
like they're still like kind of dull
like I just wish I had more personality
and I do think that a couple of the
shades are really glittery and dusty and
not as pigmented as the other ones this
is definitely something that I I do
regret purchasing but YouTube made me
buy this for sure I mean everyone was
talking about this it was in everyone's
favorites video I kind of felt like I
had to complete the collection you know
another palette this is my NARS keyboard
and guy Borden I
how to say it blush palette I had so
much foam over not getting the palette
right before this which was the Dan Mari
palette and it had sin in it and I was
like so upset I saw so many people will
have that in their collection I'm so sad
I didn't get that or that I wasn't into
makeup at the time so when this came out
I jumped on it I had to do it had to
have it and I do like this palette but I
think these two shades are really
similar I mean I definitely don't get as
much use out of it as I should for how
expensive it was but this was definitely
something that was influenced by YouTube
another one let's talk about it this is
the hourglass ambient lighting palette
and I've used mine quite a bit and I do
think these are nice powders but I don't
think that they're anything absolutely
amazing for me personally I do have oily
skin though so that might be the issue I
do really like this highlight here
though it's just a subtle it's a nice
subtle sheen it's one of those
highlighters you guys know that I really
like that isn't too metallic it's just
so nice so I do like this palette but
it's something that I think is quite
expensive and I don't know if I'd ever
repurchase the powders by themselves and
I think this might be my last like
bigger palette and this is the
Maybelline's blushed nudes I just did a
maybelline 5 first impressions video and
this is in it I'll even link down below
when this came out I was so excited it
looks so similar when you think about it
to the naked 3 ballot I recently bought
this because I wanted to test it out for
myself I've heard so much on YouTube
about this good and bad and everything
in between
sponsored videos not sponsored videos
all of it so I just wanted to try it for
myself I don't hate this palette I don't
love this palette I don't think it's
anything special and if you have a large
collection you definitely don't need it
but I also don't just like think it's
the worst thing ever if someone likes it
I could see points on why to like it if
someone doesn't like it I totally
understand why they wouldn't like it so
I'm just kind of like me on this palette
but I definitely bought this because of
all the hype on YouTube hype on that one
being both good and bad just buzz in
general the next things I have to talk
about or just the balm in general the
balm cosmetics
I feel like definitely got a huge gain
in popularity because of YouTube
specifically the mary-lou manizer this
is people like go to their favorite mine
looks barely touched because it is bare
this is a very nice powder but it's not
my favorite highlight it's okay I don't
really like gold-tone highlighters on me
I prefer pink ones but I'm just not a
crazy highlighter girl so you guys know
that but this is a nice one if you're
looking for something and then I have
all of these I got these off a whole
look because they're 50% off I feel like
you know that if you watch a lot of
YouTube because that's what everyone
says and so when these went on a long
time ago I just bought all of them so
first I have the Bahama Mama bronzer
I've not really used it it's quite dark
and I'm obviously pretty fair so I keep
this for my kit and just different
things just in case but it's not
something I've gotten a lot of use out
of the rest of them are all blushes so
this is the frat-boy blush I really do
like this this is one of my favorite
ones from them it's a matte peach color
I really like peachy blushes and this is
a really nice one too more this is down
boy I don't use this one as much because
I don't really go cool tone pink too
often but it is a nice one and then I
really do like cabana boy as well
there's something a little bit different
about this it reminds me a little bit of
narcing but this one's definitely a
unique one I know if it wasn't for
YouTube I would not have bought all of
those on HauteLook for 50% off some more
blushes these are the box blushes from
benefit there was a time when I remember
everyone having all of the benefit stuff
sent to them they'd have like their name
on it and all of that
I feel like benefits kind of dropped off
man I know they just have like that big
brow launch and revamp but I really I
feel like they really need to come out
with just with some more products you
know all the new kits are all the same
stuff of their old stuff which we like
and love but a lot of what keeps the
beauty community going is like fresh new
products so I really want them to come
out with a few more things anyway the
first one I have here a sugar bomb I
remember a Blair Fowler talking about
this which that feels like old school to
me talking about one of the Fowler
sisters but um yeah she really liked
this so I bought it I don't really like
it but it's one I keep just because it's
like one of those ones I probably won't
declutter for a while it's just so
expensive and I'm kind of keeping it
from a kit or just a case or whatever so
but rocket or on the other hand I really
really do love I've just started using
this actually I didn't use it right when
I first got it I just bought it because
it got
but this is such a beautiful blush I
really do like it it's perfect for
everyday it's pretty shimmery but
nothing too metallic I really do like
this it's a good one
I think I have about like five more
products with me to talk about to just
stick with me next I have something that
was an influence from Ingrid um she's
been Miss Claire Marazzi here on YouTube
now she's just ingrid nilsen I believe
she loved the tarte airbrush Amazonian
clay powder foundation and I even bought
the little kabuki brush to go with it I
do think this is a nice powder it just
doesn't work for my skin type I find
that I get really oily and the biggest
thing is the color match is not good for
me this is in light beige and I should
have gone with something a little bit
lighter it's a little bit too dark for
me and that makes it really hard to wear
I've been trying to use this up this
year and I'm not gonna be successful so
next summer this thing needs to die I
definitely wouldn't repurchase and it's
just not my favorite product and it was
expensive I think between both of these
this is probably like over $50 for these
two products like what that's a lot of
money I don't feel like these videos
would be complete without color pop I
remember coffee break with Danny talking
about this and hauling some stuff from
them early on like before it was crazy
and right after that video I went on
there and was like oh my gosh five
dollars like that sounds so great and I
bought a ton of stuff I'm down to four I
only have four left because I've
decluttered a lot of them I think these
are good eye shadows if they work in
your routine and there's something you'd
reach for I find that I'm not really
reaching for this formula because it is
kind of like a hybrid between a cream
and a powder so for me personally I
don't find that I reach for the
eyeshadows but I made this purchase
before they had any other products
besides eyeshadows like that's how long
ago I made this purchase I haven't tried
any of the lip products I'm really
excited to I think I'm kind of waiting
to see what they're gonna do for Black
Friday before I purchase online but I do
want to get a couple of the lippy
pencils and the lippie stix and try out
some other stuff but color pop for sure
is like a YouTube phenomenon I guess I
could have included this in my palettes
earlier but this is the wet and wild
walking on eggshells trio this is a
classic the shade here that is for the
lid is absolutely stunning and it's
drugstore and I think these retail for
it's the second one there these retail
for $2.99 which is a crazy
inexpensive I really like this and this
is a simple go to it doesn't have mats
but if you're looking for something
really simple really basic I really do
like this and elastic have two lip
products I'm not a lip product person I
don't wear a lot of lip products I know
it looks like I do because I got this
lip on today but I mostly just stick to
lip balms in my everyday life so there
are two lip products that I specifically
think of when I think of youtube I think
of these products so first is buxom
White Russian and I wanted to pick this
up I bought it in the full-size I didn't
like get this in a little kit and I got
this a couple of years ago now I
probably should try to pan this soon
this is a beautiful lip gloss and I do
really like a buxom formula it's very
light but it still has some opacity to
it I totally get the hype on this it's
like one of those perfect lip colors and
the formula this is so nice
and the last product this is steel is
patina it's what I'm wearing on my lips
today I bought this because I saw
kathleenlights rave about it and it just
looked like the perfect
Mavi nude I don't even know what would
you call this color it's like a nude but
it's not a nude at the same time I
really like this I really do like
steelo's formula
I don't wear liquid lipsticks all the
time and they're not my favorite formula
of lip products but I really do like
this one my lips do not feel dry at all
right now and I kind of forgot how good
this formula is compared to a lot of
other liquid lipsticks out there so I
really do like this I really love the
color
I feel super cute with this on and this
is definitely a good one if you're
looking for a really pretty liquid
lipstick in this color oh my gosh okay I
finish guys I hope you guys enjoyed this
video
I feel like seriously my whole
collection potentially could be in this
video because there's so much I bought
because of youtube but these are some
things when I was just like scanning
through my collection they just kind of
stood out in my mind like I wouldn't
have heard about him if it wasn't for
YouTube I wouldn't have been considering
buying them or I wouldn't have like gone
overboard to buy them if it wasn't for
YouTube and beauty gurus dang it so I
hope you guys enjoyed I will see you in
my next video and I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
