learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
talk and this is a series that I do
where I talk about just different things
that have to do with YouTube or the
beauty community or both I'm gonna leave
the playlist link down below because I
have done quite a few of these but
today's video is going to be about the
changes to the YouTube Partner Program
and my thoughts on them
I had a few requests to do this video
and I'm gonna say up front that my
opinion is not gonna probably be the
same as a lot of other people's but I
want you guys to hear me out and I can't
wait to hear what you guys have to say
and what your thoughts are in the
comments down below that's one of the
things I love about the series I
absolutely love seeing your ex's
comments and just kind of seeing other
people's point of view and I think
that's how actual change and dialogue
happens is when you are open to
listening to someone else even if their
opinion isn't the same so I'm sure if
you're a creator you already know this
but YouTube has changed its YouTube
Partner Program roles I believe before
you had to have just 10,000 overall
channel views and then you could apply
to be a partner that was also a change
from the original one which I believe
you could just become a partner by
starting your YouTube channel and since
then the requirements to become a
YouTube partner program are going to
change to having a thousand subscribers
as well as having 4,000 hours of watch
time on your videos in the last 12
months they definitely are upping the
requirements on this it's definitely
different than having 10,000 total views
on your channel and all of this is in
relation to the kind of ad pocalypse
that's been going on I do have a video
about ad pocalypse and like the patreon
Gold Rush if you guys want to check it
out I'll leave that video specifically
linked so this is basically a response
to all of the advertisers pulling out
recently in the beginning of 2016 or so
and trying to create a more stable ad
environment for creators and for
advertisers
I want you talk about the reasons why I
think this is a good thing I also want
to get into kind of some things that I
feel like don't ever get talked about
and/or just are forgotten you know like
I think that as youtubers you think like
oh cool I could make some extra money
doing YouTube and put ads on my videos
and so it can seem like YouTube is
trying to take this away from you and
trying to discourage small creators and
for small creators but when we look at
this as a business we have to look at
like what ads are and why are you
getting paid
how youtubers get paid from Adsense is
that a company thinks that whatever you
are doing is valuable enough you're
reaching enough people that it's worth
it to them to put an ad before your
video and they think that they'll get
some type of return or exposure from
doing that so if that's gonna be
profitable to the advertiser you
probably are reaching either a lot of
people you have a big audience and if
you were a small creator that might not
be the case so I get that it's kind of
disappointing now but when you look at
why you would even get that money in the
first place I think you have to take a
hard look at your channel and think am i
reaching a lot of people would it
benefit a company to put an ad on my
video and if your channel is still small
it might not be beneficial for those
advertisers to put an ad on your channel
and that's just the reality of it that's
not necessarily bad that doesn't mean
you should quit doing YouTube it just
means that's the place that you're at
currently to me that just like makes
financial sense as a business decision
when it comes to YouTube when it comes
to advertisers and I feel like if you
are having a deep heart look at your
channel you could probably realize that
hey it doesn't make sense
think about yourself would you want to
put an ad for something in front of your
own video and do you think it would
actually get you any return because
that's ultimately whatever
advertisements are there trying to sell
something or get exposure of some sort
so I think that's something that we need
to like take into account is that when
you are a small channel and you aren't
getting a ton of views and you don't
have a huge audience then it doesn't
really benefit advertisers so it
sometimes doesn't make sense for them to
even want to put ads on your channel
that being said they were doing that
before in the old program and when there
wasn't really a requirement to be a
YouTube Partner and so that's kind of
like my first point that I want to like
bring up and just kind of remind us what
Adsense is why people are getting paid
and what the companies are getting as a
benefit of it and that's why you get
money so talking about the new
requirements 4,000 hours worth of watch
time
it is kind of a lot of watch time but
it's also not if you are getting that
much watch time in a whole 12-month
period that means that you at least have
some sort of like stable audience that
are watching your channel you're
probably uploading consistently and I
feel like you're gonna be adding to the
platform in a positive way same with
having a thousand subscribers you can't
just get up on to YouTube and get a
viral video you have to be a little bit
more dedicated to be a YouTube partner
and I don't think there's anything wrong
with that I know it can seem like
YouTube is taking away your revenue
stream but as they've said and I'm gonna
leave this creator studio or a video
from YouTube about some questions people
have had about the new YouTube Partner
Program changes it was really helpful
for me so I'm gonna leave that down
below if you want to know a little bit
more information but people who aren't
making these these numbers so they don't
have a thousand subscribers and they're
not getting 4,000 hours of watch time in
a 12-month period
you already weren't making any money on
YouTube so really it's just the
potential of making money I think that
is like making you feel like YouTube
doesn't want you or it's trying to
stifle you and personally like I'm here
to say that like them making a barrier
here it's not really a barrier because
you already weren't making money in the
first place like you know two dollars
here seven dollars here I mean when you
look at it in the grand scope of life
and whatever it's not that much money
I'm not trying to be insensitive to
people and you know I get that different
amounts of money mean different things
to different people and where their
situations are but when it's a hundred
dollars or less over the course of like
12 months there are so many other ways
that you could be getting that extra
hundred dollars besides doing YouTube so
I don't think that that should hinder
you from wanting to continue to do your
channel and I think this kind of points
out to me something that it's like we
always talk about like don't start
YouTube for the money and you know I
didn't start YouTube for the money well
you can't start YouTube for the money
anymore because you aren't going to get
any money until you hit some benchmarks
and I don't think that there's anything
wrong with that I
that it's honestly I think it's
something good now obviously my channel
does reach the requirements I'm not in
entirely really small Channel but I'm
also not a huge channel but I feel like
even at 7000 subscribers or five
thousand subscribers or when I was
starting my channel all of these things
wouldn't be a hindrance or something
that I would consider when I was
starting my channel YouTube is hard no
matter what no matter what the
requirements are YouTube and having a
channel and having subscribers and
getting views is going to be hard
it just is having a huge audience and
having you know people who watch your
channel and enjoy your channel is the
exception to the rule it is not the rule
and I think that's something that people
don't consider when they start YouTube
you don't deserve anything people work
really hard and they you know work on
being in front of a camera and editing
getting their content upgraded coming up
with good ideas it takes time to grow
your base no matter what no matter how
good you are honestly I feel like if
this is something that's gonna stop you
because you can no longer get paid for
the couple of views that you are getting
when you're smaller and you aren't
outside of yourself enough to see why
YouTube is making this decision I mean
they're not just making this decision
randomly it is in the wake of the ad
pocalypse they are trying to create to
me a more stable environment for their
creators who are getting tons of views
and have a lot of subscribers and
actually have an audience base that
advertisers would want to advertise on
and so if you're thinking about the
future which is how I like to think
about my life and my goals and my
aspirations this is it potentially could
be like oh man feeling but I'm like this
shouldn't stop you that nothing none of
these fake boundaries in life should
stop you if you want to do something and
if it's actually meaningful and probably
gonna give you a lot of fulfillment it's
probably not going to be easy there's
probably gonna be a lot of obstacles and
they might be changing as you're going
for that goal and I don't think that
something like this should stop you from
starting a channel part of it sucks I
guess but I also just don't think that
the when I look at this like
cost/benefit I feel like the cost to
smaller channels
and the tiny bit of money that they
maybe would have made is so small
compared to the benefit of keeping
YouTube stable as a whole and if you are
wanting to become a creator on this
platform it would make sense that you
would want the one that you're gonna
keep going even through all the
obstacles of not getting views at first
and then slowly growing your channel and
growing it to a thousand and two
thousand three thousand subscribers and
getting more views as you do that and as
you upgrade and you know continue to
shape your content in your channel you
would want YouTube to be a stable
platform so by the time you get to
either reaching that threshold or higher
it's profitable for you for me
personally I think it makes being a
YouTube partner also more special you
actually have to you know you have to
put in a little bit more to be a YouTube
partner and I think it just gives it
more of a meaning now it has a little
bit more weight to it there are a few
negatives I guess to me one I think that
anyone who was a part of the original
partner program and has any money in
their adsense account now if you're not
a creator you probably don't know this
but with Adsense you only get paid out
once you meet a hundred dollar threshold
so until you do that you just have kind
of some money in this bank account so I
think a lot of these smaller creators
who haven't met that threshold yet and
are going to be you know kind of I guess
kicked out I don't know how else to say
this aren't going to be a part of the
Partner Program once the new changes go
into effect I do think that they should
be paid out to the money that is in
their account and kind of everyone
should be zeroed out with these new
changes
I get that YouTube does not have to do
that I just think it would be one kind
of a like showing good faith and also
for me it's like the ads on those videos
have already played advertisers and
YouTube has already got their cut and
since they are changing the rules so
much I think that it would just it just
seems right to me to pay out the bit of
money that is in the account so it's
zeroed out and then kind of starting
fresh i I do see that if you were
waiting on that like $75 or whatever and
now it's going to take a lot longer for
you to get there you not only have to
continue on with YouTube to get that
money but you have to real
really grow I get that point too though
it's like well just keep doing your
channel and you will get it eventually
so I don't know I just think it would
have been showed a little bit of good
faith and just kind of like you know rid
their hands of the situation a little
bit and made it just more positive and
then the other thing that I wasn't sure
of and after watching that video which
is going to be linked this is no longer
as much of a concern for me but
something that a lot of small creators
were concerned about isn't the money but
more the idea that their channel in
their videos are not going to be
suggested as much as people that are
part of the YouTube Partner Program and
from that video they said that that is
not going to be the case that videos are
going to have the same exact chance as
they would whether you're a part of the
program or you aren't so I really hope
that that's actually true because that
is the downside I could see is that as a
small channel it's already going to be
hard and if YouTube Partner Program
videos and content creators are being
suggested more than people who aren't
obviously it would take a lot longer to
get to those numbers it's still not
impossible but it definitely would be a
little bit harder and I think that's
that would really suck but from the
information from that video they said
that that's not going to be the case so
I'm really happy about that and I really
hope that that's true but again that
kind of goes back to you for me having a
YouTube channel is not easy
it seems glamorous and so fun and all
these things but it's a lot of hard work
and it is it takes a long time it takes
a lot of continuous time - it's not
something that you can just post a video
and everyone sees it and all of a sudden
you have a ton of subscribers and views
you dad's not YouTube and if that's
something that you want from YouTube
you're not gonna get it you're not gonna
be satisfied and it's gonna suck you're
gonna hate it you know and so for me
already YouTube is a long-form game man
like you're in it for the long haul
because that's how it works you have to
show consistency not only for the
algorithm but you know so that way you
can be at the right place at the right
time when one of your videos does go
viral or gets more views than others you
have a ton of other videos to back it up
where people can go and binge watch your
content and then subscribe to you so
that once you get that exposure you can
actually hook people and that want to
enjoy your content so anyway that was
just something that I had a concern for
but I don't think that's going to be the
case any longer
going back to another positive thing for
me something that I really enjoy about
this new requirement is that it's going
to get rid of hopefully some like spammy
and body type of channels channels that
are there to distill other people's
content and re-upload it and make money
based off of views hopefully it'll stop
people and what they call bad actors and
people who aren't here to make the
community better and I hope that it will
help overall make YouTube a healthier
environment and hopefully people can't
just like you know post something and
it'd be like a negative type of
situation but gain monetarily off of it
and I think that is really awesome
and I hope that that will ultimately
kind of start changing as time goes on
and this is implemented longer I hope
that it will kind of start changing the
atmosphere and some of the things that
are negative aspects of YouTube I hope
that will be changed and that's like
something I'm really hopeful for so
overall those are kind of my thoughts
all I'll talk a little bit more really
fast I don't want this to seem like I'm
not supportive of small craters I mean
until recently I was a super small
crater myself I think that overall
really where we can be better as a
community is by larger creators what I
like to call sending the elevator down
once someone has some success I think
that it's important to not forget the
community that you were a part of and to
remember what it's like to be a smaller
creator and to shout those people out to
help bring up other great creators and
minds in the YouTube community and and
show them some spotlight and success as
you gain success I don't see that happen
I mean I see that happened a lot in the
creators that I watch but I would love
to see that happen with a lot of bigger
youtubers if you watch my channel
regularly you know that I shout out
people constantly I'm constantly leaving
links in my description box of like
other channels that I just mentioned
I'll leave a link to their channel I
also have a video where I talk about and
specifically
shout out youtubers that I watch I'm
going to be doing more of those in the
future and I honestly think that that is
something that's really important and
that people should be doing I mean even
before this became a new requirement
that is something that I think would
help make the community healthy and I
think that people forget maybe once
they're bigger what it's like to be so
small I know even when I look at it I'm
like I don't know how I had the courage
and the strength to keep going and keep
posting videos when it was such a small
Channel now it's easier because I have
an audience but all the work going up to
getting this and you know getting this
amount of success I don't know how I
stuck to it and I think once you have a
little bit of success you look back and
you're just like oh my gosh how was I
doing that you know honestly starting
YouTube and that first thousand
subscribers the first part of your
channel is the hardest part and your
growth from there is kind of exponential
but that first part it's always the
hardest it's always been the hardest
before these rules it was the hardest
and so I think it's just important for
this not to discourage you to do a
channel like I know I just said it's
really really hard that's not to
discourage you I'm just trying to
realistically give you a game plan you
should be thinking about the future this
is a long-term thing if you really want
the actual success of having a lot of
subscribers and having a lot of views if
not you can still have a channel and you
know just talk to people and make a few
friends or whatever it doesn't have to
be this crazy million subscribers
success story you can also just do that
you know and it's actually a hobby
there's no way for it to not be a hobby
because you aren't necessarily getting
any monetary gain when it comes to
accents and that's not to say that you
can still have success with your YouTube
channel outside of Adsense if you do
sponsored content or if you find other
ways to make money around those factors
too there's always that as an option I
guess if you want to do that but overall
I really think that you know just
broadening your mind and thinking about
things in a more long-term way and your
goals whether they're this or
anything in your life as much as these
new rules are a boundary I feel like
when it comes to the monetary aspect of
it that boundary was always there from
the beginning they're kind of just
labeling it you weren't going to make
any money until you really were getting
those numbers anyway so I just think
like don't let those things stop you you
know if there's something you want to do
in life then do it even if it's hard you
just you keep doing it you know what I
mean so that's kind of it I hope this is
I wanted this to be inspirational I did
want to touch on one more thing though
and this is the kind of sub4sub kind of
situation that's going on
I saw Diana or some call me Coco I'm
gonna leave her channel link down below
do a video on this and I think that this
is important too is that I see a lot
like let's let's support small craters
like yeah guys subscribe to me and I'll
subscribe to you and that's great and
all if it's coming from a genuine place
but when it's coming from this kind of
like step for something let me tell you
that doesn't help you it doesn't help
you it might make you reach the thousand
subscriber mark but when it comes to
watch time you need people who are
genuinely engaged in your channel who
genuinely want to watch your videos and
do watch your videos that's part of
YouTube just takes a while to get that
going when I look at my content from the
beginning of my channel it's not very
good I have grown so much through
filming and editing and constantly you
know kind of honing in on the craft that
is creating YouTube videos and I think
that instead of focusing your energy on
that you should be focusing your energy
on how you can make your videos better
how you can create better content and
that's going to be way more beneficial
for your channel than just you know
trying to get other people to find your
content just good content speaks for
itself and it might take a second for
people to come and find you but once
they do I'm telling you it will be
successful so just stay focused and
don't get too caught up in the numbers I
know that it's hard because the partner
program you have to hit certain numbers
but I'm telling you if you focus on
what's right and you have true
intentions with your channel and your
message that's going to take you so much
further than if you are just focused on
trying to hit those little requirements
you know like just create a really good
video that you think people will
actually enjoy and that you're
passionate about and that's gonna
so many more views than something that
is feeling contrived to get views if
that makes sense
anyway I have a whole video on sub4sub
and why I hate that too so I'm gonna
leave that link down below but it's just
not real numbers guys it's not real
success it takes time and I hope that if
you have a channel or if you're wanting
to start a channel that you said this
doesn't stop you and that you still do
it if it's something that you've always
wanted to do but you're too nervous or
whatever the case may be why you haven't
started I don't think that these new
YouTube Partner Program things should
stop you if we look back to the
beginning of YouTube it you weren't
there were no ads on videos for a long
time at the beginning and then for a
while if you were a part of the YouTube
Partner Program you had to apply and I
remember like when Beauty baby 44 is
that her name um Lindsay Lindsay Hughes
I remember her being like Oh hide for
the partner program and I got in and she
had like over a hundred thousand
subscribers at that point when she had
like you know said that so I mean this
is still nowhere near what it used to be
this is still a positive thing anyway
I'm kind of rambling on here at the end
so I'm sorry but I really hope that this
kind of I don't know opened your mind a
little bit I really hope that this was a
positive thing too I know that a lot of
people want to be sad about it and I get
that initial like kind of like oh you
know kind of like a little bit but I
think overall that's life you gotta keep
moving on it's a business decision from
YouTube we are uploading to YouTube
voluntarily you guys and they can do
whatever they want I think that they're
trying to make sound business decisions
to hopefully sustain YouTube into the
future and I see my future with YouTube
so I think that this is a positive thing
and I think if you saw your future with
YouTube are part of your future with
YouTube you would see this is a positive
thing and hopefully this would give you
more Drive to you know post more or to
come up with better content or just more
creative content or whatever it is and I
hope that you can take from this
negative something that is a positive
and hopefully it will inspire you to
Jess
you know go harder go bigger be better
that's what I try to take from this
situation so thank you guys so so much
for watching I'm super excited to read
all of your comments and I can't wait to
hear what your guys's opinions on the
matter are so and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
