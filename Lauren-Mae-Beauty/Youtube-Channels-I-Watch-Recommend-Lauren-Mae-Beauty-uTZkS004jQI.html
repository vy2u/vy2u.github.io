Lauren thank you so much for watching
first off if you want to see this look I
did do a demo of it in my let's do
padana Tasha Genoa Lila palette so you
can check that out if you want to know
how I did it I feel like I get a lot of
comments on my looks and like wanting to
see tutorials and I try to film a lot of
them they're just not like hey this is
my purple eye tutorial so if you're ever
wanting to see how I did it it either
might be coming up or it's already out
not all of them but a lot of them anyway
let's get into this video today I wanted
to talk and give a shout out to all the
youtubers that I really enjoyed watching
I've had quite a few requests lately to
talk about my favorite youtubers or just
people that I like to watch and so I've
been wanting to do this for a while and
I thought since I had some requests I
would do it I feel like this is kind of
like a double-edged sword in the sense
that in one way it's really awesome for
the people that are getting a shout out
but I don't want anyone who isn't
getting a shout out to be offended or
sad I'm talking about 25 people here
which is a lot of people and there are
so many more people that I do watch so
I'm really sorry if I didn't mention you
it's not personal something I don't like
your channel I just had to kind of be as
selective as possible and there are just
so many names so if you want to see a
part two of this eventually I will do
that down the road and mention new
people I also really stuck with smaller
channels for the most part I have a
couple like larger people I guess in
here but a lot of these are going to be
smaller channels because I mostly watch
smaller channels let's get into it I
want to talk about Project panners first
because that's like where my communities
at that's where I like started with my
channel and I'm still very much into
project panning so yeah I have a lot of
like really good friends and people that
I've made connections with and there are
so many more people that I'm not even
mentioning that aren't on this list that
I've made really good connections with
so again if you want to see like more
project panners let me know first I'm
just gonna talk about ls because she's
like huge in the project pan and
community if you haven't seen her videos
definitely check them out she does a ton
of different project panning videos on
her channel like that's mostly what it
is she does like lipstick roulette she
does 365 days of samples she is a
Fleetwood Mac project going on right now
she just loves using up makeup and what
fun about her she does a lot of really
fun and interesting looks with her
makeup she's not afraid of color so if
that's something that you think he'd be
into I know you would love to see her
channel she always has like a ton of
progress and all of her updates and
everything too so I'm sure you guys
would love to see her Channel next is
amber f you guys have heard me talk
about her as well
but she is kind of credited as the
person who first panned a whole palette
I believe so she did she panned the
whole naked palette and from then on
she's been panning a palette a year and
kind of started to pan that palette this
year she is panning the chocolate bar
palette if you want some inspiration for
how to kind of like get past using the
same shadows every single day and
spicing it up her videos would be great
for that it'll definitely keep you
motivated and using your palette and she
kind of talked through her struggles and
worked through how she's making
different shadows work she also likes to
pan like whole eyeshadow look so I think
you could get a lot of inspiration from
those videos next on my list is curious
sparkles or Maggie I really love her eye
I've said this before but I started
watching Maggie before I even had a
channel and so to me she's just like an
OG I don't know I've kind of grown with
her as she's changed her views like she
was really in a project panning and she
still is but you can you can just see
over time how her Channel and her just
attitude toward makeup has changed and I
just really enjoy her she's definitely a
little bit more laid-back I'm a little
bit more simple and I really like that
her collection is very simple she's
cruelty free she likes more natural
products so if that's something you're
into I think you would like her channel
next we have pretty pistol 86 or cherish
here on YouTube she is also like an OG
she does so many different project pants
she does super thorough reviews in her
empties she's amazing I'm using a blood
product so if you struggle with that you
might find a lot of inspiration and her
videos or tips and tricks to kind of
help you use up lip products I just
really like her like aesthetic and her
style she's super sweet so if you want
someone who uploads a lot of updates to
projects I think you'd really enjoy
cherish next is
me from the daisy girlie I love her so
much she is so fun and quirky she is
just so cool she is someone who loves
color and doesn't like boring palette so
I totally relate to her on that I also
think you should follow her on Instagram
because she does just the coolest eye
looks they're just so fun and I get a
lot of inspiration and color inspiration
from them and I think you guys might
enjoy that so I'll leave that link down
below to also let me know if you want to
see like my favorite Instagram people
but yeah I just I really liked her she
pans like I feel like harder products or
things that not everyone pants because
they're colorful or glittery or whatever
the case may be and her personality is
just super fun and kind of like
whimsical and perky and I really like
her
next is thirsty beauty or page here on
YouTube I feel like she has a very
curated collection her collection to me
is not that large at all she's done such
a good job of like weeding things out
and really just bringing one thing in as
she uses a thing up and so if you really
want someone who has a realistic
collection and like that aspect of
someone I think you'd like her channel
she's panning the two-faced sweet peach
palette I believe right now and into
next year and she's also been
decluttering some of her makeup because
it's been old and stuff so if that's
kind of what you've been liking about my
channel I think you'd really enjoy her
video she's also been uploading like a
ton lately so if you want someone who
uploads a lot you would enjoy her
channel next is Heather from love
Heather right she's someone I feel like
I mentioned all the time on my channel I
really like her channel it's super
informative I just feel like she has a
lot of structure to her channel a lot of
structure to her videos she does really
thorough reviews and if that's something
you really want you would love her she
does project pans she likes to use her
makeup in season so she'll have like her
summer makeup her fall makeup her winter
makeup and that's how she rotates
through her collection which i think is
really cool yeah I think you'd really
like her I think you'd really like
here at least I do and I don't know if
you like my channel maybe you like bears
next is it's me hunter under is someone
that I've had a long like relationship
with I mean it's not like we talk all
the time or anything but um yeah she's
just been a part of the pan and
community for a really long time
I remember when she was panning the
Stila like in the nude palette I just
have a lot of memories watching her
videos sadly someone like broke into her
car stole our computer and like deleted
her old channels so she had to start
from scratch so definitely go over to
her Channel and show her some love and
subscribe to her she also just cut off
all her hair and she looks so awesome
and so fierce and I love it so much I
just also like her musings and her get
ready with me I just feel like we see
eye to eye and a lot of like points so
yeah I really like hunter go check her
out she's also an author like I don't
know she's just badass I like her next
we have nobody's beauty guru or Julie
here on YouTube we did a project pan
collab together I can't remember which
one I think it was like the sweet tone
at the beginning of the year anyway I
really enjoy her channel she has blue
hair which I love I just really like how
she comes across on camera she also has
a booktube channel so if you're into a
booktube you might enjoy that as well
she has like the Stars and Stripes kind
of collapse she's doing with a lot of
other project planners so if you want to
get introduced even more project panners
that would be a great way to do it but
it's a way they go through their
collection I think they're coming to the
end of it they go through their
collection and talk about like
concealers and what are the stars and
which ones are like not so good I think
they did clutter them anyway I really
enjoy her Channel and her thoughts next
we have Jaclyn I love jacqueline so much
she's someone who is so sweet but also
will like not take from anyone
and I love that it's like the perfect
mix I just enjoy so much of her channel
I enjoy like every video I even pop on
some of her live streams and I don't
normally do that because I really enjoy
just her thoughts and yeah I just I love
her definitely check out Jaclyn Levine I
think that's how you say it if that's
how you say it can you please tell me
because I like say it that way every
time and last like officially I guess I
wanted to mention Danny or Danny beau
here on YouTube I think that's how you
say it even though in my head I want to
see
Danny boom Ana I really love her channel
she does a ton of project pants she has
a palette of the week series going on in
her channel where she's switching out a
palette a week because she has so many
and she just wants to like rotate them
and just get good use out about she does
such beautiful eye looks to her makeup
always looks really good so I highly
suggest checking that out but there are
just so many other people I mean Haila
or auntie ma Lena like there are some
Lizzie like there are so many more
people in the project pan and community
it's just too many to mention kourtney k
i will leave all of those people i just
like shout it out down below it's just
too many and i'm not trying to leave
anyone out jamie like I'm not I hate it
I feel like I'm so excited to talk about
other people but I don't want anyone to
feel like you know I didn't shout them
out because I want my project panning
community you know to glow up with me I
just think it's so amazing that there is
a larger audience than what I had
originally thought for people who are
wanting you know to just shop your stash
more to be more thoughtful with your
makeup purchases and the project panning
community does that and I love it so
yeah check all those ladies out if
you're into project panning and I'm sure
if you watch some of their videos and
they've done collabs you can just like
kind of go down the rabbit hole and find
so many amazing people max I just wanted
to talk about like overall Beauty
vloggers some of these people do project
pans some of them don't some of them are
smaller some of them are a little bit
bigger anyway let's just get into it
because I'm telling you it's a lot and
we're already been here for a little bit
so the first person I want to talk about
is Angelica niquist I don't know how to
say it I don't know how to say her last
name again everything's linked so check
it out she does just really awesome
content she's super into single shadows
like I am which I love she's also really
into indie brands I feel like she's the
only person I see talking about brands
that I see on Instagram and it's great
to see live swatches she also is an
afraid of color like she loves color and
hates news so much she's just like so
bored by them so I love seeing the
palettes that she picks up I think she
just does different content and I
they enjoy that so if you're looking
into indie brands if you're looking for
just like some really cool look she's
absolutely stunning so check her out
next is Bailey B and Bailey does a lot
more review so if you're into a lot of
different products and you want reviews
she does a great job she's very thorough
and I really enjoy her channel even if
I'm not like buying everything sometimes
it's just fun to like learn about new
stuff like even if you're not gonna go
purchase it it's cool to just like know
what's coming out and I feel like she
does reviews on some of the stuff that
people you know do but also just some
different products and I like that next
is another Bailey Bailey Lane she is
someone that I watch a lot just for like
I don't know sometimes I want like the
kind of normal beauty guru but she's a
little bit smaller she has like a
southern accent I don't know where she's
from but she just like is bubbly and fun
and I just enjoy her videos if I want
something light-hearted she does hauls
but she comes back and lets you know
like what she thought about those
products which I really enjoy so if
you're looking for like a fresh take on
some of the larger beauty gurus I think
he would really like her next is
blushing shades of beauty or Lisa I
really enjoy her channel she does some
project panning type of stuff but she
also does buy a lot of stuff too and she
just enjoys makeup so I think you guys
had really enjoyed her channel also I
always think of one beauty addict I
don't know why they're just like
together in my mind but Alex from one
beauty addict that she does some really
great content she's been posting a lot
lately too so if you're looking for
someone who uploads frequently she's
been just doing some different type of
videos so if you're looking for someone
with fresh content ideas you would enjoy
her channel next is the one who's like
the biggest one I think on the list but
that's drac Macon's
her channel is just so her and she's so
sweet I love her I looks like seriously
even her Instagram - I suggest looking
at that she just does some like some of
its kind of gory and bloody which is not
necessarily my thing but I just think
she has so much like she's just such an
artist and I love that because that's
what makeup is to me - and it's so cool
to see someone express that through
makeup and I think she
such an amazing job I love that she
doesn't like have all these false
eyelashes on all the time like she's
just cool and I really enjoy her channel
next I think this is the only guy on the
list but Tom from hope mess Tom um he is
just such a nice person and we talk kind
of a lot I feel like on Instagram and so
I highly suggest checking out his
channel he's doing a series right now
called kiss or keep it simple stupid and
he's going through every step of the
face and how to do it and giving you
kind of like step-by-step instructions I
just I really like him I think he's fun
and funny and I think you would really
enjoy his channel so check him out next
is Kayleigh vote bot I don't know how to
say her last name she used to be hello
Kayla here on YouTube but if you're
looking for someone who is going to give
you no BS
she's the channel for you she also
really likes affordable makeup so if
you're someone who doesn't like to
splurge or doesn't want to be tempted to
splurge or sold to splurge you would
love her channel she's cruelty free a
lot of the people I talk about are
cruelty free Jacqueline's cruelty free
it's me hunters cruelty free I think
Paige might be cruelty free not sure
anyway I think you'd really like it she
also loves palette so if you love like
eyeshadow palettes and that's your thing
that is what she usually tends to buy
she loves like the balm palettes
although she doesn't like the newer ones
a lot of the time she just does a lot of
like palette comparisons and stuff like
watches better which warm toned palettes
better so if you like eyeshadow palettes
and you want content like that you would
love her channel next is lip loves her
makeup I think most people in our
community know about Liz but she is just
like a no BS youtuber as well she for
the most part doesn't even head in her
video so she's just a mile a minute
talking at you telling you about what's
good what's bad this is great this is
horrible she has such creative ideas
when it comes to videos which is so
awesome she uploads I think like five
days a week at least she just is awesome
so if you want someone who's just
consistent has a lot of opinions she
buys a ton of makeup so she has a lot in
her stash to like compare against I
think you would really like her channel
yeah she talks fast though so like be
prepared take your notes girl next is
makeup struggles love her channel she's
so real she's just
I love her if you want someone who's
like she's just like sitting in her
apartment in New York fan in her face
cuz it's hot she's like hair and she
cusses but she puts a warning so
whatever but I'm down with cussing but
you know she's just Fanning her face
she's telling it like it is her auntie
halls are super good she doesn't
sugarcoat anything I like her I like her
a lot
next to someone that I've been watching
for a while now Mandy Davis MUA she's
another makeup artist here on YouTube
and she does a lot of like wedding
makeup I believe she buys a lot of
makeup and I just enjoy her review she
knows what she doesn't like she knows
the type of makeup she like if you're
looking for someone who tries a lot of
luxury products I feel like she does try
a lot of like higher end stuff she's
very much into that kind of like wedding
look I feel like to where it's just like
really pretty skin really pretty eyes I
think you would really enjoy her channel
and she's just super knowledgeable we
have three more people this is so many
and I know this video is going to be so
so long I'm sorry um next is Samantha
March and she is someone that I've
recently just started watching she
uploads I think six days a week seven
days a week she uploads almost daily if
not daily
she doesn't will I buy a series which is
very very similar to my new Beauty
lunches type of video so every week she
will go through and talk about like the
new launches and say if she's gonna buy
it or if she isn't she also does like
anti hauls she just has a ton of cool
content she's just so creative and comes
up with new video ideas which I really
appreciate and creators there's just you
know the world is our oyster and so it's
frustrating when you just see the beauty
gurus do the same videos and like I've
mentioned in a lot of videos a lot of
that is because they only upload so many
videos a month but when you up your
uploads you can put just so much more
content out there and so I really enjoy
that it's nice to see a fresh video
every single day in your feed instead of
just like the same tired content next is
April from Juan and makeup I really
enjoy her channel she does haul a bit
which I like to live through her
vicariously and see what she thinks
about all the new releases without me
having to buy it she does like get ready
with
if you enjoy those types of videos where
she's just like chatting and talking and
I enjoy her personality and just her
thoughts and she also does reviews on
all the new products that she's buying
too so I think he would really enjoy her
channel and then last is Lisa Stevens I
was kind of inspired by her to do this
video as well she actually works at
Sephora so I don't know she is like
trying to project pan and trying to be a
better consumer and all the stuff which
must be just like absolutely insanely
difficult to do while you work at
Sephora or even at any type of beauty
store I mean it's like all the new
releases are there you get your store
discount and all that but she just has
really great content she's also know PS
I feel like when you work in the beauty
industry you just like you know it
doesn't faze them as much like you're
not as like swayed to say good or bad
things it just doesn't seem so shiny and
special in a lot of ways anymore I don't
know that sounds really negative it's
not meant to be it's just like she'll
give you a real opinion with what I'm
saying she also has her kids on her
channel I feel like every now and then
she does like live shanks and they'll
like pop in or she had like them like do
her makeup or buy her makeup and stuff
which is really really sweet and um I
think that's it okay wow that's a lot of
people I didn't think this is gonna be
like a Megalodon video but it was there
are just so many people to talk about
again there are just so many more people
that I do watch i watch a lot of YouTube
guys yeah it's kind of a problem I
husband like knows about way too many
people on YouTube anyway that's it I'm
ending the video I hope you guys enjoy
these people as much as I do of course
leave any suggestions down below for
more people to find other channels I'm
really into just kind of like you know
spreading the love spreading the wealth
and you don't know about a youtuber
until you do so hopefully some of these
will be your new favorites that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
