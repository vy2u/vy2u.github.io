so summer is right around the corner and
I am so excited because it's literally
my favorite time of the year I love this
beginning stage of summer where things
are just getting warm and it just feels
really fresh like I can't explain it but
today I'm excited to share 10 of things
for you to do this summer so these are
just ideas on ways you can make the most
of your summer because I know a lot of
you have more free time in the summer or
if you're working then at the very least
you have better weather in the summer so
today's video is sponsored by thrive
market if you haven't heard of thrive
they're basically an online store where
you can get all the top healthy and
organic products at wholesale prices
ship straight to your door so all the
products are 25 to 50 percent below
retail prices and they do that by
cutting out the middlemen going straight
to brands so they can pass on the
savings to their customers what I love
most about that market is they're on a
mission to make healthy living more
accessible for everyone so with each
person who signs up through our market
donates a free membership to a
low-income family veteran or teacher so
if you're interested at all drive market
is giving all lavender subscribers a 20%
off your first purchase plus a free
30-day trial plus free shipping on
orders 49 dollars or more so go to
thrive market calm / lavender or click
the link below in the description to
learn more about drive markets all right
here are 10 things to do the summer
okay first I'll state the obvious go
swimming take advantage of the amazing
weather get some cute floaties find a
pool and throw a pool party summer is
the perfect time to enjoy the water
whether it's the pool a lake the ocean
or even a water park number two explore
your own town as if you're a tourist
visit your local art gallery or go to a
restaurant you've never been before look
up things to do in your city online and
see if anything sparks your interest
you'll be surprised at what you can find
when you see your own town with fresh
eyes number three spend time in the
great outdoors go to the beach go hiking
or just be with nature experience that
sense of all you get when you're in
nature that feeling that you're so small
in this big grand world nature will
naturally recharge you and leave you
feeling rested and inspired number four
make healthy summer treats like
smoothies acai bowls and nice cream nice
cream is basically a vegan ice cream
that's made by blending frozen bananas
so here I've blended frozen bananas and
blueberries with a nutribullet
then popped it back in the freezer to
get that thicker consistency
by the way thrive market sells a
nutribullet for 30% off which is a steal
so I'll post a link to it in the
description you're welcome
number 5 visit a theme park and just
have fun I don't know about you but I
love the thrill of riding roller
coasters it just makes me feel free like
I'm a kid again with no worries but if
this isn't for you find another way to
treat yourself and let yourself play
next you can use this time to redecorate
your space browse Pinterest for some
inspiration and have fun refreshing your
place sometimes we just need a little
change so switching things up a bit in
your space will inspire you to make
other positive changes in your life if
you're a bookworm like me take this time
to dive into some good summer reads if
you're looking for some book
recommendations I got you check the
description for my pics number 8 explore
a hobby you've always been curious about
whether it's guitar cooking or painting
there must be something that you've
always wanted to try but still haven't
or maybe there's a hobby that you used
to really love doing but stopped having
time for take the time to pick up that
hobby just for the fun of it
number nine learn something new take
advantage of your extra time to learn a
new language skill or just dive deep
into a topic you're interested in
learning doesn't have to end when school
ends I'm all about lifelong learning
because there's just so much to explore
out there last but definitely not least
spend lots of quality time with your
loved ones
enjoy your leisurely days in good
company cherish those warm summer night
all right I hope you like these tips on
ways to make the most of your summer I
hope you have a beautiful summer and
just go outside enjoy your life
