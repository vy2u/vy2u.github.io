so if you know me that you know that
water is like my favorite drink I love
drinking water all day but I realize
that not everybody loves water as much
as I do some people struggle with
drinking enough water so today I wanted
to share ten tips to drink more water
today's video is sponsored by life water
life water is a premium water brand that
you can get at any 7-eleven and what I
love the most is that it features
gorgeous artwork on its label that will
change several times a year as they
feature different artists so it's super
pretty super aesthetic I just love the
look of it so our goal today and in life
is to always stay hydrated so you can
reap all the benefits like having better
skin more energy boosted immune system
and so much more
so how much water do you drink first off
there is actually a water calculator
I'll link it below so you can figure out
how much water you should drink because
it depends on your weight your height
your age even your environment and how
much you work out your activity level so
calculate that down below my goal is to
drink 90 ounces a day of water which
equals to two and a half of these life
water bottles because these are about
33.8 fluid ounces which is one liter
once you know how much water you should
drink now it's time to check out the 10
tips on how to drink more water all
right first things first drink a cup of
water right when you wake up because you
want to replenish and rehydrate after a
long night's sleep you can do this right
after you wake up or after you brush
your teeth it's up to you but I love to
just rehydrate in the morning and get
that out of the way tip number two get a
pretty water bottle that you love so
that you'll want to take it everywhere
so it doesn't matter if you like the
bottle because then you'll want to take
it with you when you're running errands
or to the gym it's kind of like an added
accessory
tip number three always keep water by
your side so you can stick water
throughout the day this is my method for
drinking water I always have it with me
and anytime I think about water I just
drink it and you can get through a lot
of water drinking this way tip number
four drink a glass of water after every
bathroom break so think about it as you
just expelled a lot of water so it's
time to replenish all of that water and
hydrate yourself tip number five drink a
cup of water before every meal so this
helps you just drink water at regular
intervals throughout the day and
sometimes when you feel hungry you're
actually just dehydrated so drinking
water can also help you curb your
appetite if you have cravings tip number
six track your water intake throughout
the day with a water tracking app or in
your planner so it's up to you whether
you want to do it digitally or analog
it's just important to keep track of how
much water you're drinking so you know
exactly how much you're getting every
day tip number seven if you really want
a reminder you can set a water alarm
every hour to remind yourself to drink
water so this is for people who like
notifications on their phone tip number
eight eat more water rich foods like
fruits and veggies so for example I love
making green smoothies in the morning
it's just like a great way to get a lot
of water in tip number nine use the hair
tie trick so wear a hair tie on your
left wrist for each bottle goal for mine
is two and a half water bottles so every
time you finish a bottle switch the hair
tied to the other wrist so you know
you're all done when all your hair ties
are on your right wrist tip number ten
have it stacked so pick something you do
pretty often throughout the day and
drink water every time you do it for
example every time you check your phone
drink water or if you listen to music
throughout the day each time a new song
plays take a sip of water
I hope you like today's tips on how to
drink more water thank you again to life
