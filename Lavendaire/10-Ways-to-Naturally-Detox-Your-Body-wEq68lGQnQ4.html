naturally detox your body so I've been
feeling pretty unhealthy lately I've
been eating out a lot so this year I
definitely want to be healthier and just
gives my body the Refresh it needs you
know flush out those toxins in a natural
way so today's video is actually
sponsored by thrive market if you
haven't heard of Fry's market before
they're amazing I was like mind blown
when I discovered their concept
so basically thrive market is an online
store that could be described as Whole
Foods products as Costco prices so it's
all of those like healthy organic
premium products that you love at like a
fraction of retail price which is
amazing and I really love what the
ranked market is doing because they're
helping make healthy living more
affordable and accessible for everyone
so what I love about thrive market is
not only if you get healthy food at a
discount that's shipped to your door you
also support a low income family or
person in need so with every membership
that you buy thrive donates a free
membership to a low-income family
veteran teacher or student which i think
is so awesome so normally a subscription
to thrive is $60 for a year which is
basically like five dollars a month but
today they're doing a special for my
subscribers they're going to give you
guys a free 30-day trial and a free
coconut oil oh yeah you can totally use
this coconut oil for anything basically
yeah it really is free we'll ship it to

95 shipping the link is down below so
click that if you want fist and a free
30-day membership to thrive market
alright on to the video
the first thing you should do to
naturally detox your body is definitely
drink more water if you think you're
drinking enough drink some more try
adding some lemon to your water to help
with digestion and detoxifying and also
get that extra boost and vitamin C you
can also try adding a tablespoon of
apple cider vinegar to your water for
another way to naturally detox water
helps flush out your system naturally so
being properly hydrated can give you
clearer skin and also improve your
circulatory respiratory and digestive
system
number two try pulling oil pooling is a
traditional way to clean and detox the
piece and gums it can also give you
whiter teeth better breasts and protect
you from cavities all you have to do is
take a tablespoon of coconut oil
here I'm using drive markets coconut oil
and honestly it tastes so amazing and
squish it in your mouth for about 20
minutes do this in the morning before
you brush your teeth so what the oil is
doing is it's trapping and collecting
all the bacteria and toxins in your
mouth so make sure you don't swallow
that oil after 20 minutes spit out the
oil in the trash because it can clog you
sink then rinse your mouth out with warm
water and you can brush your teeth as
usual number three replace your coffee
with green tea I know some of you are
obsessed with your coffee but consider
switching to green tea because it's so
much better for you green tea has
healthy antioxidants and can give you a
slight caffeine boost without making you
feel so wired so having green tea in the
mornings is a great way to relax and
detox naturally number four replace a
meal each day with a healthy smoothie so
I love to start my mornings with a
hearty Green groovy smoothies are my
favorite way to get real fruits and
greens into my diet the best part about
smoothies is that they're so
customizable you can add whatever you
like to give you the kind of boost you
need for me I love spinach kale bananas
chia seeds flax seed and then whatever
fruit I have on hand
make sure to use natural ingredients to
get the vitamins and fiber you need for
a healthy digestive and immune system
you'll also notice that a healthy
smoothie in the morning will give you
great energy and hydration number five
take a probiotic supplement to improve
your gut health a popular place for
toxins to gather is in your stomach so
taking probiotics will restore good
bacteria and balance in your gut and
help get rid of all the bad bacteria and
toxins 60 to 70 percent of your immune
system lives in your gut so by improving
your gut health with probiotics you'll
also be improving your health in general
number six
eat more fiber in its natural form our
digestive tract can hold on to toxins
preservatives from foods we eat and
other leftover waste so introducing
fiber to your diet helps keep things
moving through your digestive tract all
those toxins wastes and anything else
that's built up over time will get a
much-needed push through your body and
you'll feel so much lighter and
healthier fresh fruits vegetables beans
and whole grains are all great sources
of fiber number seven get in more
exercise and sweat it out exercising is
not just for losing weight it's also
important for detoxing your body too
when you exercise you sweat out toxins
in your body and you also help your
digestion circulation and organ
functions
not to mention exercise makes you feel
amazing by releasing endorphins so what
are you waiting for it's time to work up
a sweat and flush out those toxins
number eight meditates or do yoga toxins
come in many forms and stress is a huge
one meditating or doing yoga can help
you detox your body and your mind by
relieving stress really it's your
circulatory digestive and lymphatic
system to help your body get rid of
toxins and waste and yoga has several
different poses that stimulate those
exact systems encouraging circulation
improving digestion and moving fluids
through your lymphatic system
deep breathing also encourages the body
to eliminate carbon dioxide lactic acid
lymphatic fluid and other ways number
nine try dry skin brushing because your
lymphatic system is right beneath your
skin dry skin brushing helps your lymph
system drain toxic waste which gives you
other benefits like include immunity and
circulation refresh skin and even
reduced cellulite it also helps
exfoliate dead skin cells and unclog
pores to release any toxins that have
been trapped in your skin I got this
brush from dr market but you can use any
natural bristle brush and brush your
skin before you shower you're supposed
to be naked but obviously I'm not and
for this video start by brushing your
feet and move in sweeping motions toward
your heart always brush towards your
heart because you want to follow the
flow of your lymphatic system I'll have
a link to a how-to video in the
description if you're interested I've
been trying this for a couple weeks so
far and I absolutely love it
lastly start incorporating super foods
into your diet friends it's time to
educate yourselves on super foods super
foods are foods that contain an amazing
amount of nutrients and antioxidants to
help our bodies fight off infection and
harmful toxins I've linked some
superfood list below so you can learn
more try incorporating superfoods into
every meal and enjoy their health
boosting benefits stop eating food that
makes you feel heavy and guilty and
instead eat foods that are natural
healthy and beautiful and give your body
the proper nourishment it needs to feel
alive
honestly why eat normal food when you
can have super foods corny but you know
