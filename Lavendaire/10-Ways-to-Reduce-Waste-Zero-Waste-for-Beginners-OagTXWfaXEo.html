today's video is on how to live with
less waste so it's a video for beginners
who are looking to get into the zero
waste lifestyle and it's just a video
for anyone who wants to be more
conscious of their environmental
footprint I am so so thrilled to be
partnering with Eco Xia on this video
Eco Xia is a search engine that plants
trees as you search the web and I think
it's the coolest concepts ever the way
it works is just like any other search
engine so you can use Eco Xia to search
something on the web and then search ads
will come up with your results and with
those search ads they get income and
with their income they donate 80 percent
to planting trees so I think on average
forty five searches will plant one tree
and I've been using Eco Xia for about
three months now and I have about five
hundred searches so if you calculate it
I think I've planted maybe like eleven
trees which is so awesome just knowing
that you're doing something good just by
doing what you would normally do with
the internet so this is something that
everybody can apply everyone can start
using this now and you'll truly make an
impact so there are a lot of resources
that I'll link down below videos of Eco
Xia doing their work planting their
trees and they're really big on
transparency which is what I love and
why I support them so that you know
exactly where their money's going to so
I fully trust them and I yeah I love
this thing so much so you can use a
cozia on your computer or on your phone
they have a mobile app for iOS and
Android and what's really cool is
they've already planted ten million
trees this June and they have a goal to
plant 1 billion trees by 2020 which i
think is super inspiring so definitely
check them out if you're interested in
the sort of thing as you can tell I'm
super behind it alright so moving on to
other ways you can be environmentally
friendly here are ten ways to live with
less waste
first it's important to know the five RS
of waste management refuse reduce reuse
recycle and rot in that order
today we'll start with refuse refusing
is a first rule to living a zero waste
lifestyle think before accepting any
clutter into your home turned down
flyers and junk mail
freebies party favors and any other junk
that will most likely go into the trash
each year Americans throw away a hundred
billion plastic grocery bags which take
about a thousand years to break down
instead of accepting plastic bags and
creating more demand for them use
reusable cloth bags or even no bag when
possible I used to think that it was
like mandatory to use these plastic bags
for your fruits and vegetables but I
recently discovered you can just use
your own bag or even no bag which is
even better because why bring home extra
plastic you could also bring your own
jars to grocery stores to avoid bringing
home any unnecessary plastic containers
I love when grocery stores sell things
in bulk so that it's really easy to do
some zero waste shopping you can either
way your jars at the front beforehand or
bring an extra of the same jar so you
can weigh it at checkouts
next instead of using a one-time
disposable plastic straw you can either
refuse the straw completely or use an
acrylic or steel straw instead I
personally like to drink my smoothies
with a straw so I have this acrylic
straw for that specific purpose
instead of using this plastic cling wrap
in your kitchen to preserve your food
and leftovers switch to using the
sustainable and reusable food wrap these
are all-natural organic and compostable
I believe they're made out of beeswax
and they actually do a really great job
at keeping your food fresh even better
than the plastic in my opinion instead
of buying disposable plastic water
bottles opt for a reusable water bottle
that you can fill up again and again
glass and steel are probably best for
your water bottle but I'm using this
bpa-free plastic bottle because my
boyfriend used to sell them and we have
a ton of them leftover so if you have
them already we use what you can do your
best to avoid using disposable utensils
instead you could bring silverware from
home or use portable utensils made out
of stainless steel or bamboo over 4.7
billion plastic toothbrushes that will
never biodegrade are dumped in landfills
and oceans each year so you can make a
huge impact just by switching out your
plastic toothbrush for a sustainable
bamboo toothbrush think of all the
plastic toothbrushes that you'll use in
one lifetime and imagine avoiding that
waste completely just by switching to
something that's biodegradable and
compostable disposable period products
also create so much waste the average
woman throws away up to 300 pounds of
pads tampons and applicators in her
lifetime
instead try using a menstrual cup
menstrual cups are made out of medical
grade silicone and one cup can last you
up to 10 years which is pretty amazing
lastly reduce the amount of paper you
bring into your home
by switching to paperless whenever
possible do this with your mail your
bills your notes and your books I
personally love reading ebooks on my
iPad but I know some people love
traditional books so just do whatever
works for you I hope you like these tips
on how to live with less waste I just
want to remind you though just take it
one step at a time don't be so hard on
yourself
it's a journey all that matters is that
you're becoming more aware more
conscious of the environment and you're
doing your best ok everyone is at a
different point in this journey I'm not
perfect I'm totally not zero-waste yet
but I think the first step is awareness
and then after that you'll start to
reduce your waste little by little so
let's create a non-judgmental welcoming
space where we can just open up the
discussion around reducing our waste and
let's not judge others who aren't aware
of this lifestyle let's just understand
everyone's at a different point in our
journeys the best thing you can do is
just be a living example of what you
want to see in the world and let your
actions speak louder than your words it
all begins with awareness and let those
awareness seep into your actions and
then others will see what you're doing
and then they'll be inspired to follow
along alright that's it make sure you
subscribe if you haven't already I love
you so much and also check out the cozia
for like a really easy way to start
being more environmentally friendly just
by searching the web alright love you
all so so much see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
