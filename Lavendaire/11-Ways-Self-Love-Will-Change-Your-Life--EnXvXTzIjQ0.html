hi everyone how are you doing it's
Eileen from lavend dare today I want to
talk about eleven ways the self love
will change your life and I promise you
it will change your life because these
are all things that have happened to me
these are ways that I've just become
aware of like how I've transformed over
the years how self-love has really made
a positive change for me in my life and
I honestly believe that self-love and
gratitude are the roots of happiness
those are two things that if you can
practice them daily then you'll be so
happy like your life will be amazing
already with just those two things by
the way if you're new here I'd
appreciate if you click subscribe and
click that bell down below I make a lot
of videos on how to create your dream
life so it's a really awesome community
here alright here are the eleven ways
that self-love will change your life
number one health when you truly love
yourself you're gonna take better care
of your body and your well-being you'll
eat better you'll exercise more just out
of respect for your own body because you
know that your body's working really
hard to keep you alive and just letting
you live your life you're gonna take
care of your body in return so when you
love yourself you prioritize self-care
because you know that your mental
well-being is also just as important as
your physical well-being number two
relationships you may have heard of the
saying we accept the love we think we
deserve so when you have high quality
love for yourself then you set that
standard to accept high-quality love
from others so you start to have low
tolerance for people who don't value you
or respect you because when you respect
yourself then others will respect you
too so it's kind of like life attracts
like whatever feelings and emotions you
have towards yourself you're gonna
attract more of that to you and anything
that doesn't match that feeling you're
gonna like repel it you know if you love
yourself and somebody treats you poorly
you're gonna be like oh I don't have
time for that you know what I mean
number three
confidence self-love definitely boosts
your confidence so because you've
learned to love appreciate and embrace
everything that you are then you're no
longer insecure or ashamed about any of
it you might recognize that you still
have flaws and imperfections things that
you can work on but you still like love
yourself regardless so when you're
confident you flaunt what you got you
feel beautiful you feel powerful you
hold your head up high and you have more
fun in life along with confidence comes
more style and swag so when your
self-love is high you develop this
distinct style that is uniquely you and
that is because you've grown to know
yourself you've grown to know your
tastes your aesthetics and basically you
know what you like and you aren't afraid
to show it
so this basically manifests in having a
more unique style being more confident
in just how you express yourself in your
daily life self-love will also change
your relationships with your friends and
family so just a couple examples instead
of saying yes to people and being a
people pleaser all the time you're gonna
be able to say no instead because you
value yourself you value your time and
you want to protect your energy as well
having more self-love will also make it
easier for you to forgive others who
have hurt you so instead of like holding
any grudges or being angry at someone
for a long time having self-love will
teach you to forgive and it's kind of a
selfish reason for that it's because
when you love yourself you don't want
yourself to continue hurting over
anything that's happened in the past
you don't want yourself to suffer at the
expense of others so even if this person
doesn't deserve like forgiveness or
whatever like you forgive just so that
you can have a clean slate you can have
inner peace because you love yourself
and all you want is for yourself to be
happy and this brings me to my next
point
having more self-love will make you
happier and this is kind of a given but
it's worth mentioning so think about
when you love someone you truly want
them to be happy so think about if you
love yourself you truly want yourself to
be happy so you'll do anything that you
can to make yourself happy so instead of
like feeling like you're pulled by
society
pressures what your parents will think
of you what your friends will think of
you you do what's best for yourself
because you love yourself
so having self-love will give you the
courage to step into the life that you
want to be in instead of being
influenced by others because you love
yourself you'll do anything you can to
make yourself happy
self-love will also give you more Drive
and motivation in life so when you have
this feeling that you have a high
self-worth
then you're gonna believe in yourself
even more you're gonna believe that you
can accomplish anything you set your
mind to so having this like belief makes
you feel more invincible it makes you
feel more powerful and strong and
because of that you have more Drive and
motivation to do bigger things in the
world you won't settle for any less
because you know that you can accomplish
so much more
another major perk of self-love is that
you're gonna care so much less about
what other people think of you and what
other people say about you because I
know that when you are insecure you're
so easily swayed by what other people
say you're easily hurt by what other
people say because you're like oh my god
is it true are they right but in reality
like no they're not right if you truly
love yourself then you see your
self-worth and you're not gonna take
that hate from anybody positive vibes
only okay so you're gonna learn to keep
only the people who truly love you and
support you in your inner circle and
whatever happens outside of that it
doesn't matter anymore if you ever fail
or mess up instead of being hard on
yourself you're gonna learn to be kinder
and more gentler to yourself so that's
the magic of love it's that everything
is always gonna be okay think of how you
would treat a loved one when they mess
up or fail you're gonna treat them with
kindness you're gonna say like it's okay
like try again tomorrow
that's because love is compassionate and
love is forgiving so instead of like
beating yourself up over messing up or I
don't know just being so hard on
yourself you're gonna learn to treat
yourself kindly and give yourself more
love because you truly love and care
about yourself when you truly love
yourself you won't need to feel insecure
or compare yourself to others because
you love yourself you can love others
openly as
so you are more supportive instead of
jealous or envious and you know that
life doesn't have to be a competition
you don't have to be competing with
everyone because everyone has unique
value everyone brings something unique
to the table so you stand strong in who
you are and you own that and with that
you're confident but also humble because
you won't feel the need to have to prove
yourself all the time most importantly
self-love will set you free think about
it
what can hold you back when you are your
own best friend genuinely loving and
supporting yourself throughout your
entire life journey like literally
nothing and no one can hold you back
when you truly love yourself so you're
free to step into your greatness you're
free to be fabulous you're free to be a
light in the world you're free to be
yourself
so self-love is the beginning of like
allowing yourself to blossom into
everything that you are it's so
important and I hope that this video
signs some light on how impactful
self-love can be and how we can all
learn to cultivate self-love because
it's like a lifelong practice so now I'd
