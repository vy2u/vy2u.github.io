my favorite way to fill up a journal is
to do stream of consciousness writing
this is my morning pages journal where I
write in it every morning
it's basically letting your thoughts
flow on the paper without filtering
yourself trust me it's like the best
thing ever I love it you can also keep
an evening journal I love to keep this
by my bed so that I could just bring
them all of my ideas and emotions before
I go to sleep that way I can go to bed
with some peace of mind you can also
keep a notebook of your monthly
highlights so at the end of the month
I'll review what happened and just jot
down the highlights from that past month
people that I saw places I went just so
at the end of the year I can look back
and see my year at a glance I also love
to keep a gratitude joy and success
journal so about once a week I'll sit
down and write down the things that I'm
grateful for things that brought me joy
during the week or little victories that
I could celebrate with myself
this is something I've shared before
it's called
current me versus future me so what you
do is on one side of the page you paint
the picture of who you are at the moment
and then on the other side of the page
you paint a picture of who you want to
be who your ideal self is and it's a
really great way to just evaluate your
goals and how to get to where you want
to be you can also keep notebooks just
to doodle and express your creativity in
different visual ways I always have
random doodles here and there I also
love to keep a notebook just for poetry
and songwriting so if I ever have ideas
for like pretty words or verses and I'll
put them down in this notebook I'll also
put down like chord progressions and
ideas for melodies and just play around
with that kind of stuff here
if you're lucky enough to travel you can
definitely keep a separate notebook for
your travels so this is my travel
notebook when I went to study abroad in
Italy and I kept like little receipts
from here and there I have this brochure
from what I want to see long long play
at theatres and it's a really nice way
to kind of scrapbook but also journal
all of your memories while you're there
and you can see here I listed out all
the cities that I've visited in that
semester it was amazing this is my
notebook for taking notes when I'm
learning something new specifically like
when I'm taking online classes or I'm
watching online tutorials I like to have
like a notebook just for things that I'm
learning so that I can always go back
and reference my notes I also love
having notebooks for planning and
scheming so I don't know how else to
describe these notebooks but it's just
the place where I plan and organize all
of my ideas and my creative projects so
that's a timeline for my honestly album
and later on I have like plans on this
app that I was working on and then I
have plans on lavend dare before I even
started the blog in the youtubes I kind
of had it all planned out just how it
worked in a system and then I have like
different mind maps like this is a flow
chart of a short film that I was working
on so just any creative projects or
ideas that I have I love to just put it
down on paper and organize it
lastly this is a journal for just random
free-flowing art so I've been learning
to watercolor and then I just decided
that this is a journal that I'm just
going to make a mess in I don't care I
just want to just like like throw up on
the page just so I can express myself
and play with no judgement and just like
literally wreck this journal I hope you
like these ideas on ways to fill your
notebooks by the way I have an entire
journaling playlist which I'll link
below and on the screen should check
that out if you're interested thank you
so much for watching at love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
