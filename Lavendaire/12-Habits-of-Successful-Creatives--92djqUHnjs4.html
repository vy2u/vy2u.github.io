it's Aileen today I'm gonna share 12
habits of successful creatives and this
video is for myself as much as it is for
you because lately I've been kind of in
a creative funk I haven't had as much
inspiration or motivation to create so
these are just things that I want to
remind myself to keep doing to keep my
head in the game keep the momentum going
and just be a better creator so today's
video is in partnership with skill share
which is my favorite online learning
platform so I'll talk about it later but
if you're interested I have a link right
here where the first 500 people will get
Skillshare premium for just 99 cents the
first habit of successful creatives is
that they create consistently they have
a routine and stick to that routine for
creating whether it's creating every day
every morning every evening or even once
or twice a week they have like a set
schedule they schedule in time to create
and that's how they get work done the
main reasons for this is because when
you create consistently you get a lot of
practice and the more you practice the
better you get at your craft so it's
important to just keep consistently
creating and get that practice it's all
about just taking those daily little
actions towards your craft in order to
become really really good at what you do
the second habit of successful creatives
is that they don't wait for inspiration
they take action anyway they take action
even if they're feeling stuck or
uninspired so they don't sit around
waiting for inspiration to come to them
they just do the work even if it doesn't
feel like you know super easy they do
the work and then inspiration finds them
while they're in action so it's all
about like taking action sometimes even
if you don't feel like it because first
of all that's how you stay disciplined
and second of all inspiration comes to
you when you are in motion so if you are
not in motion you're sitting there like
things are not gonna happen for you but
if you take action first the universe
will meet you and support you and that's
how you continue creating and build that
momentum even if you're not always
inspired next successful creatives
understand that perfection is the enemy
so done is better than perfect something
I love that Elizabeth Gilbert
in her book big magic is in order to be
a successful creative one must be a
highly disciplined half-ass so it just
means that you have to have the
discipline to continue creating the work
consistently even if that work is not
good even if it doesn't meet your high
expectations just create the work put it
out there done is better than perfect
you know there's actually so much value
in just completing a project rather than
taking your sweet time to refine it
tweak it make it as perfect as you can
because we all know that if you take
your time it's just gonna take forever
it's better to just get it done even if
it's half-ass put your work out there
and work on the next thing because
that's how you improve at being a
creative another habit of successful
creatives is that they follow their
intuition and trust their gut so they've
learned to not care as much about what
other people think what other people say
and care about expressing their truth so
I to me the journey of being a creative
is continually learning how to be more
and more and more authentic how to
express my authentic self and my truth
and that's a lifelong journey but that's
definitely what it takes to be a
successful creative because there's no
value in imitating others or if you
notice the truly successful creatives
are ones that followed their own path
their own heart and that kind of carved
out their own way another habit of
successful creatives and successful
people I would say is that they're
always open to learning new things
whether it's going deeper into their
craft learning more about their industry
or their art or learning about something
completely different than what they're
used to so obviously it's really helpful
to dive deeper into your craft and learn
more and more and more about whatever
field you're in but it also is helpful
to learn things that are completely
random because you could actually apply
things you've learned from other areas
of life to what you do there's ways that
skills cross-pollinate knowledge
cross-pollinate sits just inspiration
can come from that as well so there's no
wasted time in learning new things
personally I love to learn I'm always
reading new books or taking some sort of
online classes one of my favorite
websites to learn is Skillshare as you
might know Skillshare is an online
platform where there's over 17,000
classes in creativity business cooking
even just all these random hobbies and
skills it's really fun I've taken some
cooking classes recently also some
watering classes because I love to just
get into creating with other mediums but
yeah if you guys are interested in skill
share you can check it out right here

people who click that link will be able
to get Skillshare premium for just a 99
cents for the first two months so that's
a really good deal I hope you guys enjoy
it
the next habit of successful creatives
is that they're willing to take risks so
they're willing to try new things to
explore to go outside of their box
because you wouldn't be able to get that
inspired if you just stayed in the same
box all your life you have to go out
there discover new things take some
risks try new things in order to create
something new and stretch yourself I
think this goes for everyone in life not
just creatives but you have to be
willing to take risks in life because
sometimes those risks they might be more
rewarding in your life so if you are not
willing to take risks then your life
won't be that rewarding if you're able
to take bigger risks then you'll see
bigger success and life will be more
rewarding you'll also find that
successful creatives all have a sacred
space for work so they've created like a
haven a studio or even like your little
creative corner where they could do
creative work so that's really important
because you want to have the environment
set up for you to work because if you
have to set up an environment each time
or if you work in different areas
it's very inconsistent and it's kind of
an obstacle to creating so you want to
have a space for creating and make it as
easy as possible for you to start
creating that's kind of one that I've
been struggling with for the past month
because I just moved into a new
apartment
I bought a desk online and it still
hasn't come yet so I haven't had like a
proper place to work and I'm just
getting to know this place to shoot it's
not like a set up where I could leave it
there so
it is an obstacle for me to like get
creative but that's just another
reminder for me to create that sacred
creative space for myself ASAP
another thing that successful creatives
do is they give themselves space to
daydream to be aimless to be bored
basically it might sound weird but
creativity comes out of boredom so what
I mean by that is you know when you're
doing repetitive boring tasks like doing
the laundry washing dishes cleaning
driving taking a shower those are the
times where your mind is kind of in a
bored meditative state and ideas come
during those times so you have to allow
yourself space to do nothing and
daydream or do something really like
minut in order to have creativity
inspiration and ideas flow to you like I
don't know about you but I get my best
ideas when I'm driving or when I'm
showering or sometimes like before I go
to sleep so it's important to give
yourself space to let those ideas come
to you instead of constantly like trying
to work and force things out of yourself
another thing that's successful and
healthy creatives do is that they take
time to fill the well meaning that they
go out and observe the world consume
content get inspired read books see art
just do all these things in order to
observe the world absorb the world in
order to fill that inner creative well
because sometimes when you're constantly
creating you can deplete your inner well
if you don't take the time to go out and
fill it back up so this is why artist
dates are really important if you
haven't seen it already I have a video
that I made about artist dates which are
a concept of taking yourself out on a
creative date just for fun it's from the
book the artists way by Julia Cameron
and that author talks so much about how
it's important to fill your inner
creative well so yeah another positive
habit to pick up is meditating or
practicing mindfulness so when you
meditate or practice mindfulness you are
spending time by yourself in solitude
and allowing for self reflection and
self healing and all
that and it's really important as
creatives that you take time to tap into
your source get connected with that
divine energy divine source in order to
fuel your well-being and your
inspiration for creating related to this
is the next habit which is one that I am
all about
it's self-care successful creatives take
care of themselves
they take care of their mental physical
emotional well-being because if you are
not well you can't really do much in the
world everything becomes miserable it's
a struggle so you have to take care of
yourself first in order to be healthy
and positive in your life all of that
love and positive energy that you give
yourself will flow into your work and
your art instead of like feeling like
every day is a struggle it's important
to be able to take care of yourself so
that your lifestyle is sustainable
because you can't overwork yourself you
just can't make yourself create like a
machine you have to keep some sort of
balance in order to protect your
well-being and the last habit of
successful creatives is that they
continue to reinvent themselves they
continue to innovate they continue to
transform and evolve because what is
life without transformation and change
life is constantly changing and so you
as the artist will inevitably change but
it's also good to like support that
change and not resist it so successful
artists will always try to stretch
themselves do something different than
they've done before in order to just
change grow and evolve over time that's
just natural and it's good because
basically artists are not meant to stay
the same if you stay the same and
created the same work your entire life
things would be boring and you wouldn't
be fulfilled so you have to constantly
be stretching yourself and trying new
things and sometimes the your audience
or people around you might not like that
change but you have to accept it you
know the key part of learning to embrace
change is to understand that sometimes
you have to let go of the old in order
to make room for the new so you maybe
have to shed a part of your old self in
order to birth your new self to life and
life is all about
continuing to grow and evolve so that's
what's exciting for me I'm excited to
continue to grow and change not do the
same things but just improve at
everything that I do just level up in
everything and I hope that you guys are
on this journey as well wishing you good
luck and if you have any habits that you
think that I missed make sure you

see you guys in the next one love you so
much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
