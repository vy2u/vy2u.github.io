Welcome back to Lavendaire.
Today I want to talk about ways to raise your vibration.
I was actually inspired watching Holistic Habits' video on this, so I'll link hers down below.
I just think it's something that I feel like more people should know about,
that our world that we live in is made of energy.
Everything is just atoms vibrating at different frequencies and vibrations.
I'm sure you guys have learned in school about science: An atom is mostly empty space.
So much of things that seem physical are just empty space,
and the qualities of physical things are because
they're vibrating at different frequencies.
I'm definitely not an expert at explaining
that so I'll post links below if you want
to learn more about that.
To put it in another way, when I'm talking about people -
when you think about high vibration in people,
those are feelings of joy, positivity, love.
All of those are high vibrational feelings
or states of being.
And lower vibrational states of being are
depression, sadness, anger, all of that.
You could also put it in terms of health.
A healthy human body is between 62 and 70 MHz,
and human cells start to mutate or change
when the frequency drops below 62 MHz.
So for example: Your body is at 58 MHz when
you have the cold or the flu.
And 42 MHz is the frequency of a body where
cancer can appear.
Lastly, when a human body is dying, the frequency
is measured to be around 20 MHz.
To put this all into perspective, here are some frequencies of food that you may eat.
Dead foods, such as hamburger and chicken,
have a frequency of 3 - 5 MHz.
Raw almonds vibrate at 50 MHz.
And living greens like broccoli and wheatgrass
have a frequency of 70 MHz.
Already, you can see that the things that
you put into your body,
the things that you eat, can also affect your frequency.
So let's start with that one.
The first way to raise your vibration is to
eat high frequency foods.
Usually these are raw fruits, veggies, things
that have high nutritional value,
those are usually higher frequency and better for you.
It kind of makes sense, but this is just a way to explain it
using the physical properties of this food
and why it might be good for you.
So the more organic and the more unprocessed your food is,
the higher vibe it probably will be.
So try to stick to whole foods, foods that
are closest to their original form vs. more
processed versions of that food.
Number 2 is to use essential oils.
I personally love using a diffuser to diffuse
essential oils into my space.
Here's a chart of different frequencies of different essential oils.
Without even knowing about the frequencies
of essential oils, you can already know that
smells can lift your mood up.
That's why we like nice-smelling things, and
they just make us happier in a way that we can't explain.
I just thought this was so interesting.
After I learned about these frequencies, I
started gravitating to using more frankincense
because it's more of a higher frequency oil.
But all are great, and when you're using these
high frequency oils, it can really raise
your own vibration by association.
You're breathing in this high vibrational
oil and it raises your own vibration.
In a non-scientific way, I'm just saying smelling
an essential oil will lift your mood up.
The third way to raise your vibration is expressing gratitude.
This comes from within, but whenever you express gratitude, you raise your vibration
because you're tapping into one of the highest frequency states of being that you could be in,
because gratitude is all about abundance.
It's all about what I have vs. what I lack.
And gratitude is just one of those things
that, if you practice it every day, there's
no way that you could be a sad person,
because when you're grateful, you're naturally happy and thankful.
And you feel like you have enough.
Positive thinking is another way to raise
your vibration,
and I feel like this one's obvious, but I have to say it.
If you feel like you're being negative, you're
worrying, or you're stressing over something,
just switch your mind into being positive,
being optimistic, seeing what's going right
in your life vs. what's going wrong in your life.
And it is a simple mindset shift, but it can
really change your mood.
It lifts you up and you feel like - When you're
depressed and stressed, you're like this.
Your body naturally tenses up and crumbles into a small ball.
But when you're positive and you're open and
you're feeling love, you naturally open up
and you accept life for what it is.
It really does a huge thing to change how you feel.
It raises your vibration to be positive.
Number 5 is to hang with high vibe people.
You might notice that some people have a brighter energy about them.
They're just fun to be with and you want to be with them.
Hang with people who are radiating that positive energy,
and you will receive that positive energy.
It will actually raise your own vibration
as well, because like attracts like.
Similar to the saying that &quot;You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with,&quot;
your frequency is the average of the frequencies
of the people you spend the most time with.
So the more you surround yourself with positive, high vibe people, you will be that way as well.
But if you find yourself hanging out with
people who are low vibe, they will also bring
you down to their level as well.
Number 6 is to use crystals.
Similar to essential oils, different kinds of crystals also have their own different frequencies,
and they all can give you a boost in different areas.
For example: Rose quartz is useful for boosting feelings of love.
And I'm not an expert at this.
I'm sure you can learn more about this, researching online.
I just know that crystals can really help
purify your energy and the energy around you,
and they're something to look into.
Number 7 is to drink water.
And I know this is a typical health tip, but
water is not only good for maintaining your
bodily functions,
but water also helps circulate your energy.
It helps detox any negative energy you have.
It helps purify yourself.
And it's natural, just thinking about drinking
water to hydrate yourself, to cleanse out
the toxins within your body.
It's essentially doing the same thing to your
energy as well.
So you just feel better after drinking water.
You have more mental clarity, you have more energy.
It's just good for you.
Just do it.
Number 8: Meditate.
Meditation has so many benefits.
It helps you have a clearer mind.
It helps you destress.
It helps you maintain balance in your life, feel grounded.
There are so many benefits that I feel like
I don't have to sell it.
You should know by now that meditation is amazing for you.
It's essentially a way for you to practice
returning to your core, your true self, your soul.
And it really raises your vibration, because
when you meditate,
you learn to stop thinking negative thoughts,
you learn to control your mind a little more
that your thoughts aren't running on autopilot.
So when you have more control over your thoughts
and your mindset and your life,
you just feel like you have it together, so that will naturally raise your vibrations as well.
Number 9: Practicing acts of kindness will
also raise your vibration.
You'll notice that, when you do nice things
for others, you feel good about it too.
It boosts your mood to help others, to give to others, to be kind,
just because kindness is one of those high vibe actions.
So the more that you are kind to others, the more that your state of being is going to raise up,
and you're going to live in the states of
kindness and love and positivity.
And that's a great place to be.
Number 10 is to move your body or dance.
When you move your body, you're literally energizing yourself because you're shaking things up.
So I think, on the physical level you're raising
your vibration
because the frequencies are increasing I think,
when you're moving.
I don't know if that's scientific.
But also: when you move, your soul feels good as well.
I don't know about you guys, but I love dancing.
So when I dance, I express myself.
I feel like it's a spiritual thing, as well as physical.
So moving your body and dancing can also raise your vibration.
Maybe it's the endorphins too, that it will really boost your mood, but it's all of the above.
Number 11 is breathing deeply.
So when you breathe deeply, you're giving
your body more oxygen and that energizes your body.
And…I don't know about you, but every time
I think about breathing, it just makes me
want to breath deeper because it's similar to meditation.
That's how you feel centered.
You relax yourself.
You just remind yourself to be in the present moment.
And you feel more alive when you breathe deeply,
because most of the day, we're not conscious of our breath.
It's just on autopilot.
But once you really put awareness to your
breath, you feel so much better.
You feel like, &quot;I've got it. I'm okay.&quot;
Lastly, number 12 is to look around and notice beautiful things.
When you see beauty in the world and you appreciate it, it actually raises your vibration,
because it associates yourself with the feelings of love and presence,
and don't you feel like you're in a better mood once you see the beauty in things?
It just gets yourself feeling good, feeling
inspired and happy, grateful.
I guess it's similar to gratitude and positive thinking,
that when you shift your mindset to notice
the beautiful things in life, you just feel better.
And naturally, that raises your vibration.
You're also a more pleasant person to be around, if you always notice the good and the beautiful things
vs. the negative and the bad things, right?
It's all interconnected.
You're a high vibe person if you see the good in life vs. the bad in life,
and you focus on the beautiful vs. everything that's wrong.
So I hope you guys liked these tips.
And I hope you see the relationship between science and spirituality
in all of these different topics that are just one in the same.
These are just different ways to explain why things like gratitude and meditation, positive thinking,
all of the above - why they are good for you.
It's good for your well-being, your mood,
but it's also good for your physical health.
When you have a high vibrational body, you get sick less, right?
So being a happier person equals being a healthier person.
It's all the same thing.
It's all holistic.
Science, spirituality, it's all one in the same to me.
And it's all interconnected.
