but 2015 was a huge year for minimalism
I noticed there was a huge trend in
people talking about minimalism people
discovering it and a lot of people read
the life-changing magic of tidying up
myself included which is pretty awesome
because it's changed a lot of our lives
I'm sure so today I just wanted to
revisit this topic because I know a lot
of you guys came from my minimalism
videos and I just appreciate that and I
just want to celebrate minimalism where
I am right now in my journey and where
everybody is in this movement so to me
minimalism means that you are mindful of
everything that you have meaning
everything that you own is something
that you love something that brings you
joy or it's something that you really
absolutely honestly need minimalism
means that you're more aware and
conscious of the choices that you make
in what you keep in your life and what
you discard in your life once you clear
out that physical space you also clear
out your mental space so you'll notice
that your mind is more clear and you're
more at peace as more and more people
are getting into minimalism one thing
that I want to tell everyone is don't
feel obligated to stick to any strict
rules because minimalism is just a
concept it's an idea and you should
really just use it as a guideline to
your life style don't feel like you have
to follow everything rule by rule line
by line at the end of the day you are
the boss of your life you can control
what you want to do with your life how
you want to live it so just take the
parts of minimalism that you like and if
there's anything that you don't like
then don't feel obligated to use that
minimalism is not about having a limited
number of things it's not about having
just a set number of items in your
closet or just having one shelf of books
it's less about the quantity of what you
have it's more about the mindset that
you have towards your things so as long
as you are fully aware
of your things and you actively made a
decision to keep those things in your
life then you could be considered a
minimalist 2015 was a year that
minimalism changed my life so it's a
recap at the beginning of the year I was
just getting into minimalism I was just
learning about it and in April I read
the life-changing magic of tidying up
and I started to tidy my things through
the khawarij categories so it took me
six months to get through all of my
stuff but that was a huge accomplishment
because I'm just proud of myself for
going through every single thing with my
own two hands now I can say that I know
everything that I have everything that I
own and everything makes me happy
everything is something that I want to
keep I've gotten rid of a lot of clothes
I've gotten rid of a lot of stuff and
now moving forward I am just more
conscious about the things that I buy
making sure that there are things that I
really really really like things that
will last a long time and I'm just like
more tidy as a person in general
so in the past my room has always been
messy and I've never really bothered to
clean but now I really enjoy tidying and
it's so nerdy but I just find joy in
organizing and keeping my things in
order keeping my things clean
the reason I say that is because I
notice a real difference in my mindset
when I have a tidy place versus when I
have a really messy place when my place
is messy and things are not put away
things are out of order
I feel more jumbled like my mind is
jumbled and I'm less productive I'm less
creative but once like my things are in
their right place and everything is nice
and clean I just feel like like at peace
I'm calm I can now do my thing I can do
my work I could do whatever I need to
get done so that's where minimalism has
taken me this year I'm still learning
and I'm still growing with it and I'll
see where it goes from here because at
this point I still feel lazy folding
clothes I don't like to fold clothes and
put them away even though I made a bunch
of calamari folding videos
the work is like tedious but I really
enjoy having an organized closet I love
it
thanks to 2015 I've embraced minimalism
and I'm sure a lot of you out there have
too so my final thought about this is to
just do it at your own pace don't feel
like you have to compare yourself to
other people out there who call
themselves minimalist as well just live
your life the way that you can live it
the way that you want to live it and
really just try to be more mindful about
your choices I think that's the most
important thing about minimalism to be
mindful of the things you have be more
mindful of everything in your life be
mindful of the things that you watch be
mindful of the things that you eat be
mindful of the people you keep around
you so this whole concept can be applied
to other areas of life do it the way you
want to do it and don't judge anyone
else for doing it a different way that
is so important do not judge someone
else for the way that they embrace
minimalism because we're all on our own
journeys so here's to minimalism thank
you for helping us in our life all right
thank you guys so much for watching and
being a part of this minimalism movement
I will see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
