so I'm super excited to share something
new with you today I know that 2017 is
right around the corner and it's about
that time where we're all starting to
like plan for our new year so with this
channel I always want to share like tips
on how to become a better artist of life
tips on how to create your dream life
because I believe that we all have the
power to design our life exactly the way
we want it so this whole time I've known
that there's only so much that I can
help you with just by sharing tips from
my life because essentially creating
your dream life is a very individualized
process because everyone's dream life
looks different your life is completely
different from the person next to you
and it's just so individual and unique
and that's what's beautiful about it but
I've just been thinking of how I could
help guide each and every one of you in
a way that's more personalized so I
finally came up with the idea to create
this 2017 artist of life workbook so
essentially this workbook is a tool you
can use to guide you to find clarity and
direction in what you want who you want
to be and how to get there
and I'm super excited to share this with
you because essentially this is like
exactly what I wish I had when I was
just starting out when I was super lost
and unmotivated and struggling at the
end of college so I'm not sure if you
all know my story but if you don't and
you're interested then I'll post the
video link in the description below but
essentially I was at a point out of
college when I was really lost
unmotivated pretty depressed even and it
really took like five or so years for me
to soul-search do a lot of self
discovery and exploration until
fast-forward now I am loving my life and
I'm exactly who I want to be and I got
here from reading a lot of books and
just doing a bunch of exercises to
figure out who I am what I want and how
to
there I've shared some of these
exercises with you guys for example the
currently versus future me exercise that
I created and have been doing every year
since 2012 and something I didn't show
you was in that same notebook I did like
monthly reviews where I would review
each month write down like highlights
what I've learned I also started doing
yearly workbooks like this one in 2014
so the year I started lab and air I got
into these workbooks created by Leonie
Dawson who's like an amazing very
creative blogger so shout out to Leonie
for just getting me into this workbook
thing because that helped my life so
much you know since I started lavender
till now it's been two and a half years
and everything has changed basically
everything has changed in a positive way
and I feel like this year for 2017 it's
about time that I just combine
everything that has helped me to create
a workbook of my own so that I could
share with you guys and you guys can
have some sort of tool to help you guide
you through your life so now I'm just
going to give you like a sample of what
this workbook looks like and keep in
mind this is not the final draft because
I'm still getting feedback on how I can
improve it but basically this is like
the gist of it so first I have a section
on reflecting and closing out 2016 kind
of reviewing the lessons you've learned
from the year and then I have a section
on 2017 where you set your intentions
for the year like creating your New Year
theme and all of that fun stuff and then
I have like a huge very detailed section
on setting goals in every aspect of your
life so I have a section on health goals
relationship goals career goals personal
growth goals creative goals spiritual
goals home goals money goals adventure
goals and your ultimate life goals so a
lot of goal-setting here and then after
that there's a whole section on
self-love and kind of just looking at
yourself looking inward there's a
section on designing your habits like
creating your morning and evening
routine there's a huge bucket list of
100 things you want to do before 2018 a
section on your ideal world and what
that looks like and then at the
of the workbook there's that monthly
review section where there's like a page
for each month for you to kind of review
your month review the highlights kind of
track your progress and see how you can
improve from here and last but
definitely not least is the goal book
and these are the pages where you will
learn to plan and execute your goals and
I will go into this more in an upcoming
webinar so yes you heard right I'm also
doing a webinar for 2017 I'm going to be
hosting two sessions one at the end of
December one the first week of January
and I'll work it out where I'm doing
them at different times so that people
living in different time zones can both
catch that webinar and the webinar is
called how to set goals you can achieve
and have your most successful 2017 so
basically I'm packaging this workbook
along with that webinar so if you buy
the workbook then you'll get to watch
those webinars as well it's a bundle so
on top of the workbook and webinar
you'll also get an invitation to the
2017 artist of life mastermind Facebook
group so this is something I'm very
excited about because it's basically a
private exclusive Facebook group where
you guys who are using the workbook can
encourage each other support each other
and also keep each other accountable and
I plan to be super engaged in this
Facebook group so you can literally ask
me questions any time and I'll respond
right away and I'll also do like
Facebook live Q&amp;amp;A s and chats and for
example the first Facebook live video I
want to do once we have this group is to
go over everything that I wrote in my
workbook and then you can share what you
wrote in your workbook and it will be
fun to just keep each other accountable
throughout the year and lastly in this
package you'll get free access to all my
2017 webinars so let's review in this
package there's four things first you'll
get the workbook of course and it's in
digital PDF form I have two versions of
the workbook one that's like colorful
that you can watch on your computer and
tablet and a black-and-white printer
friendly one so you don't have to waste
too much ink if you want to print it out
and then so after the workbook you have
the 2017 how to have your most
successful year webinar on goal-setting
and the success -
and then you have the Facebook
mastermind group and then you'll get
free access to all 2017 webinars that I
host so the price of this package is $25
and that is the early bird price if you
get it from now between Christmas after
Christmas it's going to go up to $30 and
then it will stay that price for the
rest of the year so act fast you can
pre-order these workbooks on my website
the link is lavender calm slash shop or
you can click the link in the
description below I'm so excited for you
guys to use this workbook and also to
get to like interact with you guys on a
deeper level in that Facebook mastermind
group because I've always just wanted
like a supportive community of
like-minded people who could just help
each other achieve our goals so
hopefully that's what it's going to be
also if enough people are interested
then I might be ordering actual printed
versions of the workbook where it's like
it really nicely printed and there's
like extra pages for notes in the back
that's something I really want to do if
not this year then next year but
basically I'm just super excited for you

page below just to see I'll have sample
pages sample screenshots so you guys can
take a closer look thank you guys so
much I love you all and I'm so excited
