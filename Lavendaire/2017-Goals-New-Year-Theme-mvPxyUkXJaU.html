to lavender it's so good to see you
again I hope you had an amazing
beautiful holiday season so today we're
going to talk about my 2017 goals and
theme for the new year
if you haven't heard of the concept of a
theme I actually made a video last year
about my 2016 theme and I'll link that
below so you can watch it but basically
last year my theme was to be bold and to
be consistent so I kind of had two
themes like a macro theme and a micro
theme last year and just last year in
review I think I did take my theme to
heart I did do a lot of things that were
bold and whenever I had a big
opportunity I didn't hesitate
I would accept it and say yes and go up
for the challenge for example last year
a few bold
things that I did were I gave my first
TEDx talk which was amazing literally
like a life goal of mine and I signed
with an agency I launched my first
podcast the lavender lifestyle
I also took a spontaneous trip to Europe
with my friend Judith where we only have
like two weeks to plan so that was like
crazy I got invited into YouTube's next
up program which was amazing I got to
meet a lot of new people learn a lot of
stuff and I launched my first product
the artist of life workbook which many
of you know about if you don't know
about it it will definitely be in the
description below and I'll talk about it
later also and I feel like this was a
year where I was more bold with like my
body in terms of like I was 25 turning
26 last year and I felt like that was
the age where I felt like a complete
adult like I could make my own decisions
for example like I got LASIK which was
something I've been wanting to do for a
long time and this might be TMI for some
people but if you watch my birth control
contraception video I finally got an IUD
which was something that I've been
wanting to do but have been so scared to
do for so long and some other fun things
like I got my eyebrows tattooed and I'll
talk about that later in like my
December favorites video which I'll
shoot right after this but yeah I feel
like
made a lot of bold decisions this year
and I said yes to a lot of big new
things and it was a big year for me like
it really my life changed a lot and I
have so much momentum now and it's
really exciting so now let's talk about
the other theme consistency because this
is where I had like my fall backs so I
was pretty consistent the first few
months of the year where I was
meditating journaling reading and doing
all of those like healthy habits daily
and it's consistency is always something
that's tough for me to work on
especially keeping up so many different
habits and towards like at the end of
the year November December I got real
lazy like I even stopped doing yoga and
there was a time most of the year I was
like going to you up in three to four
times a week I was really good
for a few months and then I just
completely like fell off and got lazy
and the holidays came really my life got
thrown off and that's okay but yeah I
just realized that I can't have too many
things on my consistancy to-do list I
really have to like tone down the habits
and so next year I still want to be
consistent but I'm going to choose one
thing I'm gonna choose meditate daily
and I'll talk about that when I talk
about my 2017 goals so first let's talk
about my theme for 2017 so going into
this year my theme for this year is
space I want to create more space for
myself
I was deciding between the words balance
and space and I kept feeling like I kept
going back to the word space like I want
to create more room in my life more
space so in November and December I
really got thrown off I wasn't really
centered and doing things that were
benefiting my well-being I think I
focused a lot on work and my career and
making that work book that whole
workbook I literally worked all those
two months on it and it stressed me out
at some points but I mean it was super
rewarding but at the same time I found
myself working like 15 hour days where I
would like wake up like go straight to
work all day only take like breaks to
literally eat and like sleep at 3:00
like I didn't make time to take a break
go outside exercise do yoga I didn't
even take a break for like relaxing I
just felt like I got into that very
hustling mode where I was focusing just
on creating and work which is not
necessarily bad but at the same time it
was very imbalanced I wasn't giving time
to myself I wasn't like exercising I was
very unhealthy in the way that I was
eating and so moving forward I'd like to
just step back and relax and not be in
that state of like hustling anxiety if
you know what I mean because sometimes I
could get real ambitious and I could get
into that mode and it just it's great
maybe I'm productive but at the same
time I don't feel amazing I don't feel
like calm and centered and balanced and
that's what I want for 2017 also I want
to create more space to make time for
things to do just to make me happy like
being sad just purely for fun because
last year I had these things on my list
that I never got to like learning to
watercolor paint and taking dance
classes I didn't really do that much I
did some but not as much as I wanted so
I think this year I want to create more
time to just do things for fun instead
of just like thinking about my career so
yeah hopefully this year I can make more
space in my life space for me to breathe
relax enjoy the little things in life
the beautiful things and just have more
time for myself and for the things that
I just want to do just for fun and
really have a more balanced life you
know success at the speed of balance
that's always been a quote that I told
myself so it really is just like
learning to incorporate that learning
not to go too fast to have some space to
just enjoy the present moment in front
of me alright so let's move on to my
2017 goals and so in alignment with my
2017 theme to create more space by
number one habits goal of this year is
to meditate daily so ideally I want to
meditate in the more
like I'll start with ten minutes and
then see if I could build from there if
I don't get some meditate in the morning
I'll do it at night before I sleep so I
feel like ten minutes out of your day is
really not so much and I don't know it's
just hard to have been consistent with
it in these past years but this year is
my year to prioritize meditation because
I feel like that is the number one thing
that can help me just kind of detach
myself from that go-go-go mentality
learn to relax sit back and enjoy life a
little bit more my second goal this year
is to create two videos a week for
YouTube so previously I just did one
video a week and this year I'm going to
up it to two and upload on Wednesdays
and Sundays so I'm excited because I
just have so many ideas and I realized I
can't get them all out if I'm only doing
one video a week so it will be both like
a challenge and a way to explore my
creativity a little bit more and create
more videos that I'm proud of my third
goal is the big project of the year and
that is to write my first book yes I
want to finish writing my book this year
I kind of told myself this last year but
of course I pushed it back I did come
out with like an outline and a table of
contents but I think I just I'm not
confident in it yet so I have to revise
that first work on the book proposal
that I want to finish by like February
and then once that's done I can like
tweak that and get feedback and then
write the book so stay updated on that I
really am just going to maybe set aside
time like every Thursday and Friday to
do book writing because I like to block
my days so Monday through Wednesday I'll
be working on like shooting editing
videos Thursdays Fridays will be like
podcast and book writing days we'll see
how that goes
my fourth goal of the year is a creative
one and it's to do daily posts on
Instagram so I've never been really good
at being consistent on Instagram but
this year I really want to like practice
taking better photos because I just love
that medium and I love visual content I
just want to get better at
and it's a way for me to practice so I
also read this book last year capture
your style by ami song and this book
really kind of motivated me to use
Instagram as a creative outlet as just
something where I could explore my
creativity for fun I also want to do
like artsy videos to post on Instagram
like maybe like life as art or some like
visual pretty vlogs I just want to
experiment more with my creativity and
put that on Instagram and the reason why
I can't put it on YouTube is I've
learned some things from like YouTube
camp and researching that like you can
actually upload videos to your channel
that can hurt your channel for example
when I upload blogs they're not as
popular like they don't get as many
views as my other videos and when that
happens the YouTube algorithm kind of
demotes your channel and it doesn't
recommend your stuff so this is why big
youtubers have a separate vlog channel
it's because sometimes certain types of
content can hurt your channel and bring
it down so it's just it kind of sucks
but I realize I have to be more
strategic on youtube I have to make
everything high-quality on YouTube and
kind of like be picky about what I put
on YouTube versus on Instagram I'm
seeing that as my creative art platform
where I can literally post whatever I
want so it just so you know FYI YouTube
will be more strategic Instagram will be
pure art and whatever I feel whenever I
want
Seifer the tangent but I wanted you to
know all right so my fifth goal of 2017
is to exercise three times a week
because I want to move my body more I
feel like I've been so lazy lately and I
want to get back to the gym I want to
dance I want to do yoga and I'm gonna do
like a habit tracker where at the end of
each week or it may be like as the week
goes on I'll be checking off the times I
exercise and I think that visually will
really help me to stay motivated and
yeah and my final goal of 2017 is to
limit my time on social media I've spent
way too much time with being distracted
on social media that this year I'm only
going to check all my accounts morning
afternoon and evening so three times
I feel like that's enough times you can
like catch up in the morning you have a
midday check-in and then right at night
you know before you get ready to go to
bed because this year I feel like I
waste too much time kind of checking
notifications and responding to comments
and emails throughout the day and it's
getting harder and harder for me to
respond to everyone and I really want to
use my time wisely to be productive to
create content because that's what I
love to do and I like to create and
spend less time on like just checking
what people are singing and things and
so I noticed that every time I check a
notification it leaves me on this like
rabbit hole to check other things and
then like 15 20 minutes go by and I'm
like what am i doing so yeah I think
limiting my time on social media will
also help me create more space it will
let me be more productive and it will
just have like you know a more structure
to my day so there you have it those are
my 2017 goals and my theme for the new
year let me know what your goals are and
what your theme is post them in the
comments below
I'd love to see them also just a quick
plug here shout out to my work book
community because I love you guys so
much you know how inspired I am by all
of you if you guys haven't heard I have
something called a 2017 artist of life
workbook which is a product that can
help you plan your most intentional year
by going through all your specific goals

you're interested in that the link is in

each other share ideas and I'm just like

inspiring and so helpful and there are a
lot of good resources in there so thank

this year because it's like my first
time being in this mastermind group and
we're all going to encourage each other

me be consistent this year you know I
need more accountability

practice meditation daily and I follow
through with all of these other goals so
