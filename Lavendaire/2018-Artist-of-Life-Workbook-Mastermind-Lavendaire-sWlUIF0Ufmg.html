How are you doing?
Today I am super excited to share
the 2018 Artist of Life Workbook.
So if you follow my channel,
you know that I've been working on this workbook
for months.
I put so much time, heart, and effort into
it.
And if you guys don't know what it is,
the Artist of Life Workbook is a guide that
I created to help you create your most
intentional, inspiring, and successful year
ever.
So it's a workbook
full of questions and exercises to help you
discover yourself, clarify your vision,
plan your goals for the next year, and execute
your goals for the next year.
So it's more of a big picture, planning journal.
It's not a daily/weekly planner.
I know a lot of people confuse that.
All of the exercises in here are ones
that have personally helped me in my life,
and I am confident that they will help you
in your life.
So some of them are familiar.
You might have heard of them on my channel
before,
like the vision board, Current Me and Future
Me.
But I personally think
the most powerful part of this workbook is
just answering all the questions
so that you can reflect and really dig out
the deep desires and dreams in you.
And I love, love, love the completely redesigned
goal book.
So the goal book is the part
of the workbook that keeps you accountable
throughout the entire year
by checking in quarterly and checking in monthly.
So there's a space for quarterly
and monthly goals and then quarterly and monthly
reviews.
And so, as you're setting goals
and reviewing them each month, you're kind
of evaluating how you're doing,
how you could do better next month, and it's
like a constant feedback loop
that can help you improve and stay accountable
for yourself.
So as you can see, there's two different versions
of this workbook.
There's a print version and a digital PDF
version.
So it depends on your preference.
I personally love writing on paper in a physical
journal.
That's why I love the print version.
But the PDF version, you could also print
it out or fill it out on your computer or
your tablet.
If you want to learn more, you could click
here to access my shop.
There's more details there
and there's an FAQ section there that may
answer some of your questions.
Also, I'm planning to donate 10% of profits
from this workbook to Pencils of Promise.
They are a non-profit organization who are
working to improve education
in developing countries.
And so I'm just really excited to be able
to do
something good with my business because I've
always looked up to social businesses.
Lastly, you'll notice that there's something
called the Artist of Life Mastermind.
So the Mastermind is a program for people
who are doing the workbook
but want more accountability, support, and
connection with other workbookers.
So we have weekly prompts and weekly challenges
to kind of keep you on track
throughout the year.
We also share our wins together.
There's a buddy system
where we can group you into four or five people
to support each other
in your own little Facebook chats.
My favorite part is definitely the live video
chats,
because that is my opportunity to chat with
you guys face-to-face.
I answer all of your questions, but I also
learn a lot from you guys as well,
because it really is a mutual two-way street
where I'm not doing all the sharing.
I invite guests from the group to share what
they've learned and share their challenges.
And we kind of help each other out because
a true mastermind is where
everybody contributes something so that everybody
can learn even more.
You know what I mean?
I really believe in the power of coming together
and sharing together,
the power in just bringing a group of people
who are from different walks of life
from all over the world, but who are like-minded
and also want to improve themselves.
And it's just really beautiful to grow together
because we are not alone.
I remember when I was just starting out reading
self help books, but none of my friends
were into this topic.
I really felt alone, and I felt like there
was no one
that I could share my passions with.
And now, something like this Mastermind group,
this is what I wish I had when I started out,
because you find so many other people
who are similar to you and you could learn
from each other.
It's just a beautiful experience to get to
grow together and also feel like you have
a solid support group.
You have this solid community that you could
turn to for anything.
So if you're interested in the workbook or
the Mastermind click right here
or down below to check out my website.
And if you have any questions,
leave them down below.
I'll do my best to get back to you.
I'm actually going to plan to do a live Q&amp;amp;A
on YouTube.
I'll post the time here and down below to
confirm.
But yeah, come back
and ask me any of your questions.
It'll be a live dedicated to talking about
the workbook and showing you what's in it,
in detail and everything.
Also, if you join the Mastermind program,
then you're gonna get free shipping on the
workbook.
So you just put both of those in your cart,
and you'll see the free shipping option there.
Lastly, I want to thank you so much for your
support because without you,
I would not have been able to launch something
like this, to create something like this.
This is just a dream come true.
I am so proud of it.
I don't know, I have no words.
But whether you started watching me recently
or whether you've been watching me
for three years or more, I really, really
appreciate you, because you make it possible
for me to live my dream life.
I wouldn't be where I am
without the support of all of you there watching.
So thank you so much.
I love you so much.
And keep being Artists of Life.
