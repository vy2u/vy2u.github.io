Welcome back to Lavendaire.
Today I want to share
23 habits of highly successful people.
These are habits that I've learned
from reading books, articles, and also, casually
interviewing the most successful people
I know in my life.
These are habits that I think are really important
for all of us to be aware of,
but don't worry if you're not super great
at all of these habits.
Nobody's perfect.
The first step is to be aware of the habit,
and the next step is to just work on it every
day.
It's always a practice.
Alright, here we go.
The most successful people always take full
responsibility for their life.
They never complain, nor do they blame others
for their problems.
They take responsibility for all the good
AND the bad in their life.
They know that even though they can’t always
control what happens TO them,
they can always control how they RESPOND to
those events.
They can choose to respond in a positive and
productive way.
Because of this, successful people are always
optimistic for their future.
Next: Successful people always know their
priorities and do the most important tasks
first.
They know that the content of what they work
on MATTERS.
So it’s better to be effective
on the right tasks, than efficient with the
smaller, less meaningful tasks.
Successful people also create their own morning
routine.
The key to super productive days
is to start them right.
Choose activities that energize and inspire
you, see what daily tasks
you can get out of the way early on, and build
your morning around those tasks.
I personally like to drink water, take my
vitamins, journal, and exercise before I start
working.
Next: Most successful people practice daily
meditation or some sort of mindfulness practice,
whether it’s journaling, morning pages,
or something like the Five Minute Journal.
Tim Ferriss stated that out of all the successful
people he’s interviewed,
more than 80% have some form of meditation
or mindfulness practice every day.
Another key to success is to make health and
exercise a priority.
Research says that regular exercise and a
healthy diet can lead to higher levels of
productivity,
happiness, motivation, and, not surprisingly,
your ability to live longer.
Successful people
take care of their bodies because they know
it affects all other areas of their life.
Another habit that all successful people have
in common is they read and learn continuously.
Bill Gates reads 50 books a year.
Warren Buffett reads 600-1000 pages a day.
Elon Musk learned how to build rocket ships
by reading books.
But successful people don’t just read anything.
They're highly selective about what they read,
so they usually choose knowledge and learning
over entertaining books.
Another key habit is to have discipline and
self-control.
Successful people know
how to stay focused and not fall for distractions
or FOMO.
Their priorities are solid, and they keep
their eyes on the goal.
The most successful people are also extremely
consistent.
There’s so much power in consistency,
because small consistent actions is how you
build anything great.
To practice your consistency, try doing something
for 21 days straight.
If you fall off, start the 21 days over again.
The longer you can stay consistent at something,
the more likely you will succeed at it.
Successful people will also follow through
with what they say.
They take their promises
and commitments seriously.
When they say they are going to do something,
they are going to do it.
They don’t give excuses, only results.
Another thing they do is they persist and
persevere.
Successful people don’t give up easily.
They stay in the game no matter what.
One quote that I constantly told myself
and wrote in my phone in the beginning of
my career was:
“No matter how hard it is or how bad it
gets, I’m going to make it!”
That mindset seriously helped me stay persistent
in reaching my goals.
Successful people also aren’t afraid to
fail.
They know that failure is good,
because failure is just a learning opportunity.
It teaches you what doesn’t work,
so you can try something else.
Oprah says, “There is no such thing as failure.
Failure is just life trying to move us in
another direction.”
The most successful people hone their craft
daily and sharpen the saw.
What they do is, they work on their craft
every day, by practicing and making small
improvements,
so that over time they become very, very good
at what they do.
Ask yourself: What’s your craft?
What skills are important for your career?
And then work on sharpening those skills every
day.
Another habit is to be self-aware.
Successful people know their strengths and
their weaknesses,
and use them to their advantage.
They know how they are doing, and they are
aware
of the areas where they need to improve.
So they're confident, but they’re also humble.
Another habit is to practice gratitude.
Tony Robbins says, “Success without gratitude
is the biggest failure of all.”
Gratitude is the key to living a happy and
successful life.
Without it you’ll always be yearning for
more, more, and more.
With gratitude, you’ll know how wonderful
your life already is,
and be thankful for how far you’ve already
come.
Successful people also have a solid support
system.
Whether it's a partner, friends, family,
a mentor, coach, or some sort of community.
It doesn’t have to be a big group.
It can be just a handful of people to rely
on and bounce ideas off of.
Another key thing that all successful people
do is: They surround themselves
with like-minded achievers.
I’m sure we’ve all heard of the quote,
“You are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with,” and it’s
so true.
Successful people surround themselves with
people they can learn from
and people who inspire them in their journey.
Successful people are also goal oriented.
Not only do they SET goals,
they also make the detailed plans on how to
achieve those goals,
and then follow through with their plans.
They know that execution is more important
than ideas.
Another habit of successful people is: They
are proactive and take initiative.
They don’t wait around for things to just
fall in their lap.
If they want something,
they go out and make it happen.
Successful people also know how to manage
their emotions.
They are aware of how their emotions influence
their thoughts and behavior,
and so they learn how to detach from any emotions
that aren’t serving them.
They know there is a right place and time
for exploring their emotions.
Sometimes you have to set your emotions aside
to get the work done.
Successful people also communicate clearly.
Every great leader is a great communicator.
They speak with authority and confidence.
And they talk about their ideas
in a way that connects deeply with their audience
and moves them.
These people are also great listeners.
They listen to what others have to say,
ask questions, and write things down.
They do this so that they can learn
and fully understand a situation, or get the
details right in fixing a situation.
You'll also find that the most successful
people value their alone time.
They take time alone to think and connect
to their intuition,
which helps give them a clearer direction
in life.
They use that alone time
to recharge but also strategize for their
future.
Lastly, most successful people love the journey
more than the result.
They learn how to enjoy the process, rather
than do everything for the end goal.
That’s how they stay committed, consistent,
and persistent for the long run.
Ultimately, that means that if you love what
you do,
then you have the best chance to be successful
at it.
Alright, those were 23 habits of highly successful
people.
Of course, there are more habits,
but I think this was a pretty good start.
