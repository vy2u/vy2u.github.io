to talk about the three things that all
creatives need to start doing more of
these are actually things that i need to
be working on so this blog is basically
collection of advice that i want to give
to myself but i thought i would share in
hopes that some creatives and non
creatives out there can relate so number
one stop being so hard on yourself we
are our own worst critics i feel like a
lot of the times a lot of artists are
unsatisfied with their work and we feel
that what we create never meets our high
expectations for example about a month
ago my producer friend josh gave me a
track to write a song to and i spent an
entire night writing that song and I was
like 80% done with it I recorded a demo
and then once I listened to it over and
over again I started to hate it and I
started to think oh my god this sucks so
bad and then I just press save clothes
and I just left that in folder the back
of my harddrive
until a couple days ago I was talking to
Josh again and I was reminded of the
song and I was like hey by the way I did
write something through this song about
a month ago let me show you what I have
I didn't like it so I just put it away
and he listened to it and he was like oh
my god this is epic why don't you like
it what I realized is that while I work
may not be our best or it's not as great
as we want it to be somebody out there
may still appreciate it we can't expect
to create masterpieces every single time
we have our on days and our off days and
that's okay
in the end just don't stop creating
dumped out yourself don't be so hard on
yourself if this is something that you
can really relate to then I highly
recommend you watch this TED talk by
Elizabeth Gilbert on your secrete of
genius she just talks about a new way to
view the creative process which takes a
lot of pressure off of ourselves number
two
finish what you start somebody once told
me that it's easier to leave things
unfinished because you can't judge it
that way if you just have something
that's partially done and you don't love
it then you can just blame it on the
fact that you didn't try your best
anyway you didn't finish it it's not
your 100% and so it's easy to just say
that but when you have a finished
product then it can be judged and
sometimes that's very scary but every
project is an opportunity to grow and to
learn and if you only work on something
partially then you don't get the full
experience and you don't grow as much as
you would if you completed the entire
cycle of creating something so finish
your stuff get feedback and keep
improving it just keep working until you
get it and I promise you it will get to
where you want it to be number three
share your work I know so many creatives
that don't share their work because
they're like it's not ready or nobody
would want to watch this or listen to
this and they just leave a lot of work
hit in kept to themselves and just it
never gets out there I strongly believe
if you have a talent and it's meant to
be shared with the world and if you keep
it to yourself that that's just being
selfish because
if you share something then it could
really improve somebody's life out there
if somebody can really connect with it
you don't know there are a lot of tastes
out there so you never know when
somebody will appreciate or relate to
your work even if you don't think it's
your best that unpopular song often
artists first album could be somebody's
favorite song even if it's not that
artists big hit or best song sharing
also gives you the opportunity to grow
because you can receive feedback from
people like I said we are our own worst
critic so you shouldn't rely on just
yourself to judge your work once you
start sharing and getting feedback from
people you'll realize that you have more
motivation to keep doing what you're
doing and that's building a really
positive cycle of creating sharing
improving and growing in general lastly
don't be afraid to shamelessly promote
yourself there is a lot of noise online
and in the world and nobody's going to
see your stuff unless you actively and
constantly promote it if you want more
inspiration on this check out shameless
Maya she's another youtuber and she is
known for her shameless self-promotion
journey and she's just grown so much
when she started promoting herself like
crazy so I want to know do you have any
additional advice for creatives leave
them in the comments I want to check
them out because I want to learn more
I'm going to be posting videos Sundays
and Wednesdays so make sure you
subscribe check back I will be here
again with a new video on Wednesday bye
