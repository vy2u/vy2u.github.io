today I wanted to share five books to
read this summer so I know a lot of you
have more time in the summer it's a
perfect time to get more reading done
and these are like five different books
that will give you something different
so depending on what you're looking for
hopefully one of these books will be
good for you so my first recommendation
is you are a badass at making money by
Jen's and Tarot this book is for you if
you want to cultivate a more positive
relationship with money so if you notice
yourself having like negative thoughts
about money if you ever heard yourself
think that Oh money is evil or money is
greed or any other negative like
thoughts around money then maybe this is
a book to picked up because this book
will help you close the bait that
positive mindset around money help you
realize that money is just a tool money
is just a resource it doesn't really
have a positive or negative connotation
to it but it will also like motivate you
to make more money in your life it will
just like help you hone in on the
gratitude that you have around money it
will also help you shift your mindset so
that you can attract more abundance into
your life I'd recommend this book to any
artists or creative types who struggle
with the idea of pursuing money because
I know that a lot of people you know
they want to pursue art or you want to
pursue meaning or you want to help other
than you think that money and art and
meaning are exclusive but actually it
can all be inclusive it can all be this
one of the same it really is about
shifting your mindset and recognizing
money for what it really is just a tool
to help you live your dream life the
next book is one that I highly highly
recommend it's good for those of you who
don't want to read necessarily because
it's a audiobook all you have to do is
kick back and listen and it's just a
bunch of stories so the book is called
born a crime by Trevor Noah I've already
like raved about this book if you don't
know who Trevor Noah is he's a comedian
he's the host of The Daily Show and he's
from South Africa
in a very interesting time during
apartheid where he was basically like
illegal because he's mixed-race so he
wasn't supposed to exist and he has all
these interesting stories of him growing
up as a child in South Africa first of
all I loved his voice second of all he's
like super funny third he's like really
great at telling stories like you're
really captivated into his stories and
he really takes you to another place
plus he also speaks like so many
different languages in this audio book
that is just like it's just a really
good way to expand your mind to
recognize all the different cultures out
there and just really appreciate just
the story of a human being growing up I
just thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed this
book it will make you laugh it will make
you cry it will make you sink it will
get you inspired so if you're looking to
dive into a memoir and then I highly
highly recommend the board a crime by
Trevor Noah
you'll love it so I'll include like a
free audible trial so you can listen to
it for free actually the next book that
I highly recommend is called the slight
edge by Jeff Olson this is a book for
everyone literally anyone and everyone
should read this book so if you've ever
tried to achieve a goal or if you've
ever tried to improve your craft or hone
in on your skill but you felt like you
got stuck and then you had to start all
over again and then got stuck and start
all over again
this book is for you because it really
teaches you how and why to put in the
little effort of work every day this
book is like the book of consistency
it's all about teaching you how to be
consistent why you should be consistent
how it can literally transform your life
and I'm telling you right now the slight
edge transformed my life because it just
blows your mind on how putting in a
little bit of work every day can really
take you far so if you've been looking
to you know improve your productivity or
just be better at chasing your goals and
chasing your dreams and definitely pick
up the slight edge by Jeff Olson read it
and you will not regret it
trust me the next book that I recommend
is called the artists way by Julia
Cameron
so this is a book that I'm currently
going through right now what it is is
it's a 12-week process a 12-week journey
to help you unblock your creative
channel so help you like tap into your
creativity so if you're an artist or you
are creative and you feel like you have
a project you want to complete but
you're stuck or you just feel like you
haven't been inspired lately definitely
pick up this book the artists way so
it's a 12-week program so summer is like
the best time to come through with this
program because that's like three months
basically so each week the book takes
you through different tasks and
challenges and it will like cover like a
different section each week so I know
this book is like a classic for creative
it was written in the 90s and it's still
very relevant today if you've ever heard
of morning pages I talk about that a lot
of my channel that comes from this book
the artists way by Julia Cameron so if
you're creative you want to tap into
your creativity you want to get more
inspired definitely definitely consider
picking up this book the last book I
want to recommend is called a new earth
by Eckhart Tolle so Eckhart Tolle is an
amazing author she is like so white is
almost like a monk but he just had all
the answers okay anyway his most popular
book is called the power of now it's
huge if you haven't read it I definitely
recommend you to read that too but a new
earth is his newer book it was
recommended by Oprah it's basically a
book that teaches you how to distinguish
what is the ego part of you and what is
the true part of you this book does go
pretty deep
it's very in-depth and you might not
understand it at first read I feel like
it's one that I had to take my time to
read like slowly and then reread the
pages again because it's like some
really deep spiritual stuff so it's all
about learning how to recognize which
part of you is your consciousness your
awareness or your soul your spirit
whatever you want to refer to it versus
which part of you is your ego so you
have like an ego part of you the part
that like succumbs to addiction the part
that is like negative self-talk and all
this stuff that is
essentially an illusion everything that
is your ego is an illusion it's not real
so it's just it teaches you what part is
your ego how to separate that from your
core and your soul who you really are
it's definitely a book that will help
you dive deep rediscover yourself and
kind of reframe your perception of the
world I really think this will open up
your eyes it will open up your mind it
might probably change your life so yeah
if you've been feeling kind of blah and
living on the surface you kind of want
to dig deeper within and explore some
new concepts and like I said to reframe
your perception of the world then
definitely check out a new earth by
Eckhart Tolle plus feel free to like
dive deep into all of his other works
because he is something else
he is truly amazing all right I hope you
like these five books to read this
summer let me know below if you have
other suggestions on books that I should
read this summer because I'm always
dying to add more books to my reading
