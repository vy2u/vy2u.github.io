today we're talking about the five must
read books in 2017 these are all books
that have heavily impacted my life
they're my absolute favorite books and
they're books that I think have enough
variety enough to enhance your life in
different areas so let's jump in the
first must read book of the year is
called big magic by Elizabeth Gilbert
and if you haven't heard about this book
I don't know where you've been because
this book is so amazing it's super
popular and it only came out recently in
like 2015 so Elizabeth Gilbert is the
author of Eat Pray Love and the
signature of all things she's a novelist
but this is her first book where it's
kind of more nonfiction based and it's a
book about creativity and it's not just
for artists and creatives it's for
everyone because she makes the argument
that everybody is a creative person
everybody can find joy through creating
something and exploring your creativity
and it's just a book that changed my
mindset on my lifestyle and it's really
inspiring it helps you look at
creativity in a different way it helps
you look at fear in a different way and
I think that is like probably the number
one book I'd recommend to anybody who
wants to start reading something
interesting so the second book is
another must read and it's a classic
it's called the power of now by Eckhart
Tolle and this is the book about being
present this is like the book about just
like you know being fully in the now the
current moments Eckhart Tolle is like a
monk literally like I've seen him speak
live he's so Zen he's always living just
in the present moment and he's written
so many books that are like literally
mind-blowing and it will shift your mind
it will shift your life and this is
probably his most popular book so I
would recommend the power of now first
but another book
sidenote not on this list but that is
really good is a new earth by Eckhart
Tolle that's another book that is like
life-changing that you should read but
definitely start with the power of now
because it will help you appreciate your
life and where you
right now so much more it will just like
open up your eyes literally not
literally but you know what I mean
the third must-read book is one that I
recommend often because it's probably
like one of my top 3 favorite books ever
it changed my life in a time where I
needed it the most
it's called The Four Agreements by Don
Miguel Ruiz and it's the shortest book
out of all of these books on the list so
if you want to read like a quick read
something that's easy but powerful read
The Four Agreements so yeah basically
this book makes all of life's problems
very very simple there are just four
agreements to live by and once you live
by those four agreements you'll realize
that all the problems all the issues all
the stress can really fade away and
they're really powerful so yeah read
that book the fourth must read book of
this year if you haven't read it already
is the life-changing magic of tidying up
by Mario condo I know a lot of you on
this channel already have read that book
you've already tidied through the co
maurices stuff like I have but for any
of you guys who have still not read that
book read the book because I think it
will really give you a new sense of
freshness in your life if you can really
take in those lessons and apply it to
your life start to declutter your
physical things the things that you
don't need anymore start to see your
life through the angle of what sparks
joy what makes me happy and only keep
the things that make you happy and let
go of everything that does not and
honestly that is the magic of tidying up
it really refreshes your life it helps
you become more conscious of everything
you keep in your life not just physical
things but relationships and everything
else I've already talked so much about
this book but it's worth recommending
again for a must-read for 2017 because
minimalism is on the come-up it's a
movement and it's only going to grow if
you haven't seen the minimalism film
documentary on Netflix like that I think
it's trending right now so yeah it's
coming so if you want to get inspired to
declutter and reorganize your life
definitely definitely read that book the
final must read book on this list is one
on productivity and it's called getting
things done the art of stress-free
productivity by David Allen and this is
a one of the most popular books on
productivity probably the most popular
book on productivity out there I would
say and after I read this book I did a
major revamp and refresh of the way that
I organize my to-do list and so if
you're somebody who loves like making
lists and organizing planning your goals
that sort of thing this book is an
amazing resource an amazing tool because
it just helps you get things done in a
more efficient way I feel like he's
really thought out his process and a lot
of people follow this process so it's
really benefited my life similar to the
way like the life-changing magic of
tidying up like I decluttered my life
through this book getting things done I
really decluttered my to-do list and I
became more efficient at the way I
organize things so if you're into that
getting things done the art of
stress-free productivity read that book
alright those are my five must read
books for 2017 I can wholeheartedly say
that I 1,000% recommend each and every
one of those books so you won't go wrong
with reading any of them trust me so
please please please let me know if you
have any book recommendations on your
own because I'm looking for more books
to read this year and I feel like my
list my reading list is getting kind of
boring and I kind of need new additions
to check out so please recommend your
stuff down below and yeah let's have an
amazing productive beautiful magical new
year bye
