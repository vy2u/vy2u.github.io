nutrient-rich foods like fruits and
greens they are quick easy and only
require a good blender today I'm sharing
five easy superfood smoothies that make
for a great breakfast especially when
you're in a pinch first I'd like to
thank dr market for partnering with me
on this video you can find most of the
ingredients from this video on Drive
markets the rice market also sells the
nutribullet blender for 30% off which is
such a great deal my nutribullet is
hands-down my favorite and most used
kitchen appliance if you don't know
already dr market is an online store
that sells the top healthy and organic
products at wholesale prices shipped
straight to your door all their products
are 25 to 50 percent free low retail
prices so it's really fun to see how
much you save with each purchase my
favorite thing about dr market is that
for each person who joins thrive market
donates a membership to a low-income
family veteran or teacher i love that so
much to get a free $60 in organic
groceries from thrive markets go to
thrive market calm / lavend dare or
click the link in the description below
you'll also get free shipping and a 30
day trial all right let's start off with
our first superfood smoothie the red
this one's on the sweeter side so it's
really easy to enjoy I'd say this is
like a beginner smoothie here are the
ingredients you'll need a banana you can
add another if you like your smoothies
creamier and sweeter strawberries of
course and yes you can blend them with
the stems in and was so stoked when I
found that out on Google goji berries
which are an amazing superfood go easy
on this if you're new to the taste
though almond milk or technically any
other liquid of your choice and lastly
ice
this one's optional but add it if you
like your smoothies cold I usually don't
add ice but I know most people like it
next add all the ingredients into your
blender cup side notes I'm not including
exact measurements for the recipes
because I personally never measure when
I'm making smoothies I just eyeball
everything and learn what I like over
time
so I want to be here to share the
ingredients but give you the freedom to
explore what ratios you like best since
we all have different tastes anyway so
feel free to experiment and adjust these
recipes to your liking alright it's time
to blend next up we have the green
smoothie this one's packed with
nutrients but the green teas can take
some time to get used to if you are
still a beginner to these types of
smoothies so here are the ingredients
that you'll need first greens of your
choice I have spinach kale and chard you
can add more greens for more nutrients
or less greens if you're not used to the
taste yet next week grass powder this is
optional but sometimes if I don't have
fresh greens I'll use this instead a
banana or maybe two if you want some
chia seed and flaxseed and optional
another fruit of your choice I had to
pie in the fridge though why not
and lastly coconut water it's like water
but better add everything into the
blender here I kind of messed up because
I put bananas first but I actually
recommend putting greens first so you
can push them down and pack them more in
there but it's okay and then blend
following the green smoothie we have the
purple really this one also tastes
pretty good because it's so simple it
reminds me of blueberry yogurt here are
the ingredients for this movie we have a
banana we have our main star of the show
blueberries which are my favorite
berries at the moment chia seed and hemp
seed which is another superfood I've
recently decided to explore and almond
milk or coconut milk could work to add
all the ingredients into the blender Cup
I felt like adding more blueberries and
then blend until you're happy with the
consistency
all right next up we have the most
adventurous movie of the bunch
the yellow smoothy this one's adventures
because includes a spice called tumeric
a powerful antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory usually used in Indian
curries it has a more earthy taste that
you might not be used to but
surprisingly this was my favorite
smoothie of the bunch here are the
ingredients we'll be using a banana as
usual frozen mangoes or fresh mangoes
whatever you got turmeric our star spice
black pepper just a dash
yes it sounds weird but black pepper is
proven to dramatically increase the
absorption and effects of turmeric
that's why you'll always see them use
together in recipes and almond milk or
any type of milk will works first add
the almond milk into your cup then add a
teaspoon or less of turmeric then add a
dash of black pepper a small amount is
already enough to reap the benefit then
add all the fruits and then blend look
at that colour I love it so much
all right the last movie is the quickest
and easiest of them all I call this the
lazy superfood shake because it can't
get easier than this seriously here are
the three ingredients needed first
bananas and I definitely add two for
this one this green superfood powder mix
which is kind of like a multivitamin
antioxidant a supplement made from
superfood ingredients and coconut water
add the bananas into the cup then add a
scoop of the superfood mix and then add
the coconut water lend and you're done I
feel like you should literally make this
in one minute
maybe he's like two minutes if you take
your time peeling bananas but anyway
like with all other smoothies you can
add more ingredients if you'd like so in
general take some time to explore what
fruits and greens you like best and
remember to always add superfood boost
like Scaasi berries chia seeds hemp
seeds and flax seed because why not
you're getting so many more nutrients
and you don't even notice they're there
that's why I love smoothies so much
