finished reading girlboss by Sophia
Amoruso if you guys don't know who she
is she is the founder CEO and creative
director of Nasty Gal this book talks
about her life growing up as an outsider
to how she started her eBay store
selling vintage clothes online called
Nasty Gal vintage to how she scaled that
to the multi-million dollar business
that it is today as Nasty Gal so first
off the thing that stood out to me most
about this book is Sophia Amoruso
attitude this girl is strong and
confident and successful and she knows
it Sophia is super smart and she really
focuses on the work you know working
hard working smart and the book is
generally just very motivating to all
the girl bosses out there you know for
anyone who has an entrepreneurial
mindset or who wants to do something
cool with their lives today I want to
share five lessons that I learned
reading girl boss so without further ado
here they are from the very beginning
Sophia Amoruso has always paid a lot of
attention to detail so from her
photography to her copy on her eBay
listing to just how perfectly straight
the shipping label is pasted onto the
package Sophia Amoruso really cared
about the details and that is just so
important to building a solid brand any
solid business because every little part
should be intentional
even today Sophia talked about how she
chooses the photos to go on her website
so after a photo shoot she'll shrink all
of her photos down to like a tiny tiny
size on the screen stand back and blur
her eyes and whatever images pop from
that session she'll pick those for her
website because she really understands
the importance of thumbnails you know
composition of the photos even when it's
like a tiny tiny thumbnail it makes a
big difference in your business one
thing I really admire about Sophia
Amoruso is just her mentality of being
ahead of the game in going that extra
mile so she's always working hard and
working smart so she talks about in her
early days of selling
on eBay she would really hit every
thrift store and look at every single
item that they had she would know their
schedules and so when there were new
arrivals coming to the thrift store she
would just like wait for them to put it
on the racks and once they put it up she
would pounce and also she scoured
craigslist for estate sales which are
sales when old people died I didn't even
know what state sales were before I read
this book but she would wake up at 6
a.m. and waited in line with people who
are like 20 years older than her and
once the state sale started everyone
would be you know going for the antiques
but she would head straight for the
closet to find vintage clothes this is
how she scored Chanel jackets for $8.00
and was able to sell them on eBay for
$1,500 which is huge so just I really
admire her ability to be smart and
really go that extra mile she did more
than what she was supposed to do she did
more than what her competitors were
doing and that's how she became
successful so throughout the book Sophia
really makes a point that she grew up as
an outsider she wasn't good at school
and you would never think that she would
be as successful as she is today
but the reason she became this
successful is because she googled
everything so obviously in an
entrepreneurs path in the beginning you
don't know that much and you know you
don't know that much so a lot of times
people let that lack of knowledge stop
them from going the next step when they
have an obstacle they don't know how to
solve it they just leave it at that
but what Sophia Amoruso did was when she
ever came to an obstacle or she just
didn't know the answer to something she
would just google it and research it
like crazy we have the Internet today
which is really all the knowledge that
you need at your fingertips but you need
to know how to use it wisely
so on top of googling everything she
would turn to YouTube to listen to
experts speak at conferences that she
wasn't able to attend and she would look
at similar companies to see how they
structured their company and she would
see who they were hiring and what she
found that they
this company hired this person she would
go on LinkedIn look up that person look
at their resume and see what skills and
background it takes to do that specific
job and basically all of that online
stalking and researching is how she
learned to build her own business I've
heard this before but hearing it again
from Sophia Amoruso just really inspired
me to get up and dress up for my life
because how you look on the outside can
affect how you feel on the inside
so if you look confident and put
together on the outside it'll make you
feel more confident on the inside so
most of the times I'm kind of lazy in
the way that I dress I just want to
dress super comfortable if I don't need
to get out of my leggings I don't but
really I think this just inspired me to
dress up more just because it's fun
because you can and because it makes you
feel great so I'm gonna share my
favorite quotes from the book now while
I have the freedom to wear whatever I
want at work I dress the part in fact
everyone at Nasty Gal does when I'm
confident in what I'm wearing it makes
me feel more confident throughout the
day granted I could probably negotiate a
deal in my pajamas but I'm a lot more
dangerous in a pair of leather pants and
boots second hurtful I love that quote
so much because it just shows her
attitude she's such a cool girl she just
is such a girl boss and that is Sophia
Amoruso for you what I also love about
Sophia Amoruso is just how humble and
real she is so even though she's had
huge success in her career she does not
let it get to her head and she just
focuses on the work and continuously
growing her company in her book she
talks about how she gets congratulated
on a daily basis and how in one year she
was named all of these business awards
she was inks 30 under 30 CNN's 40 under
40 she was on Forbes magazine the cover
of Entrepreneur Magazine basically just
getting a lot of press and being awarded
and congratulated for what she's done
but she ends that whole section with
this line remember girl boss it's not
cool to get drunk on your own success
and at the end of the book she also
touches upon it again with this line she
says once you found success don't stop
it's not about being insatiable is about
not resting on your laurels so I respect
this mentality so much you know no
matter how successful she gets she just
wants to keep doing better she just
wants to focus on her work focus on what
she can create focus on the value that
she gives out through Nasty Gal rather
than letting all the lights and cameras
get to her head all right so those are
my five lessons that I learned from Girl
boss obviously I learned more than those
five lessons but I just didn't want this
video to be too long if you guys want to
know more of my favorite quotes from the
book then I've included more in my blog
post the link is below generally I'd
recommend this book to anyone who wants
to be an entrepreneur or is into fashion
or just wants to learn to be more of a
confident girl boss in life so
definitely read girlboss by Sophia
Amoruso thanks guys for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
