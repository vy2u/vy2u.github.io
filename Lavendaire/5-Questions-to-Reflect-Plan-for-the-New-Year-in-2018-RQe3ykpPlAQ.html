it's Eileen today I'm gonna bring you
five questions to help you reflect on
the past year and plan for the new year
I hope you're ready to plan for 2018
like I am I'm so excited for next year I
feel like I don't know why I just like
the number 2018 I feel like it's a good
luck number it's even it's pretty
there's a lot of circles in the number
for some reason like I just really like
it so these are all questions that I've
asked myself at the end of the year for
like the past five or more years I used
to do this like digitally on my day one
app on my phone and sometimes I would
journal it out more recently I've
created this artist of life workbook
where is it it's upside down here it is
this artist of life workbook to help go
through these questions and you know
what this workbook goes a lot more
in-depth in the New Year planning and
reflecting and all of that stuff so
today's five questions are kind of a
taste of what you would expect from this
artist of life workbook so let's get
started
first question what were my highlights
of 2017 and highlights could mean your
accomplishments the things that you're
most proud of it could even be like the
memories that you've had the best
memories you've had of your year and it
doesn't have to be like an
accomplishment or something big it could
be like just like a smile that someone
gave you it could be something simple
just any moment of joy any moment that
you want to remember and I love
collecting my year's highlights because
that's how I look back on my year I have
a really bad memory guys so I write
everything down
I use my day one app to log daily
journal entries just to like bullet
point what I did that day and at the end
of each month I'll collect my highlights
from that month and at the end of the
year I'll look through my monthly
highlights and collect the highlights of
that year I know I'm very like
meticulous about that because that's how
I collect my most precious memories and
if I don't write it down I'm gonna
forget it you know humans memory is
pretty unreliable if you don't know that
so I don't know I like to
down my highlights the memories that I
want to keep because these are the
things that I'm gonna have with me for
the rest of my life second question what
about 2017 am I most grateful for so
have some time to sit down take out your
journal and have a ball really just list
out as much as you can everything that
you're grateful for for this past year
because I'm sure that a lot of great
things have happened to you this year
even if some bad things happen to you
this year like some challenges or
obstacles think of what good might have
come from those negative experiences and
what you're grateful for related to that
so gratitude has such a huge influence
on our happiness and how we feel about
our lives looking back so ultimately
like two people can be reading the same
story but interpreting it in different
ways using gratitude you can interpret
your own story through the eyes of love
and positivity and feel good about
yourself and your experiences rather
than just like focusing on the negative
now let's cross over to the new year for
our next question what is your theme for
2018 so I don't know if you've seen my
previous videos I make a video on my new
year theme every year I'll post those
videos down below but a new year theme
is a word or phrase that you want to be
your compass for the year so think about
what do you need more of in your life so
my theme for 2017 was space I wanted
more space more breathing room in my
life in general because I felt like at
the end of 2016 I was really hustling
hard and I was deep in work and just not
really taking a moment to enjoy life and
be mindful so previously my themes have
been like patience and perseverance or
boldness one year I wanted to just be
bold and everything that I did so every
year ask yourself like what do I need
what do I want to invite into my life
and make that your theme question number
four how do I want to evolve and grow in
2018 so this is the fun part this is the
part where you put on your dreamer hats
my dreamer hat is always on but just
think of how you want to grow how you
want to change what difference you want
to make in your life how do you want to
see yourself at the end of 2018 like
December
20-18 exactly one year from now where do
you want to be how do you want your life
to look like in all of these different
areas my last question is what areas do
you want to focus on in 2018 and what
are your goals in those specific areas
so I know a lot of us like to do
everything at once we want to believe
that we can grow in all these different
areas at the same time at the same rate
but in reality that's not how life works
life is kind of like a push and pull
where you have to make certain
sacrifices in this area if you want to
grow in this area and it's just the
truth that we can't multitask as well as
we think we can and we can't accomplish
everything at once you have to do things
one at a time so start to think of like
what areas do you want to focus on first
you know maybe you can focus on this
area for the first month and this area
for the second month or maybe focus on
an area for three months at a time it's
totally up to you to help you brainstorm
the areas could be like health self-care
career relationships your money
spirituality creativity it could be
whatever you want but ultimately decide
what areas of your life do you want to
focus on growing first it's kind of like
what flowers do you want to water first
in your garden of life oh my gosh that
was such a good phrase on my phone just
rang so sorry but anyway after you
decide what areas you want to focus on
decide what goals you have in those
specific areas and when setting your
goals is best to be as specific as
possible set a deadline for this goal
set like an amount if you could quantify
your goal in any way like the clearer
your goal is the better and then after
you set your goals the rest of it is
like breaking down your goals into
actionable steps and then taking action
on those steps I know it's easier said
than done but that's how you do it
everything is done by just putting in
the work just taking those baby steps
you know create a to-do list for each
goal and then pick one thing off the
list and work on it today there's no
real secret to getting your goals done
it really is like taking action setting
your goals and the rest is can you take
action can you be consistent can you be
patient can you persevere and all of
that I've talked about
channel in various videos in various
podcast which I'll link below I'll link
a whole playlist related to new year
videos and yeah I hope you guys have a
beautiful new year happy holidays and
I'll see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
