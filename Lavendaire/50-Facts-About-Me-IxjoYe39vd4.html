facts about me video just so you can get
to know a little bit more about myself
so it's just gonna be a fun one and I'm
gonna start right now
first fact is I have a Hitchhiker's
thumb which means my thumb bends like 90
degrees back this way I have this my
whole life and I didn't know that it was
a weird thing until I saw a video saying
Jessica Alba has a weird thumb and she
has a Hitchhiker's thumb as well and I
was like wait everyone's thumb can't do
this my hair has been all the colors of
the rainbow literally from red to orange
yellow green blue purple and silver and
gold and I've just always loved to dye
my hair in high school I used to buy
those box dyes from Target and do my own
hair and in 2014 I learned how to bleach
my hair so that's when I started to go
crazier with more pastel colors
I'm currently 25 years old in the
Chinese zodiac
I am the year of the horse I'm
classically trained in piano and I've
been playing my entire life since I was
like 5 or 6 years old
if you guys know anything about piano I
took the Royal schools of music exams
and I passed level 8 which is the last
level but what I discovered I really
loved to do was just play and sing pop
songs on the piano so in high school I
started a YouTube channel where I just
recorded myself singing cover songs I
also played flute from when I was in
fifth grade throughout high school so I
was in band marching band Wind Ensemble
all those things and I also played
piccolo for two of those years I'm a
singer songwriter and I have an album
out on iTunes and Spotify which I'm
pretty proud of because I was like my
little personal project the only sport
that I did in high school was swimming
so I was on the JV swim team my
sophomore year and I was probably the
slowest swimmer on the team but that was
also like the most fit I've ever been in
my life because I swam every day and I
was just so muscular I love to dance
do yoga and Zumba I also danced on a few
hip hop teams from when I was in college
too a few years after college so I think
I was probably on 4 or 5 too
teams both competitive and exhibition
teams I went to school at USC University
of Southern California and I studied
business and communications I really
love wicked the Broadway musical and I
know it the words to all the songs so if
you ever see me and you know those songs
too like we can totally do it I really
love pastel colors I use exclusively
wuji pens because they're the best I've
traveled to 17 countries so far in my
life
and one of my goals in life is to travel
to all seven continents of the world one
day I want to write a book I'm
chinese-american and my chinese name is
xu eileen so it really sounds like
Eileen sue I speak Mandarin Cantonese
basic Spanish basic Italian and of
course English is my first language I
know how to sew I have multiple crease
eyelids which means that I just have
like so many creases on my eyelids that
my eyes are never the same shape my left
eye is smaller than my right eye so if I
take photos I'm always like showing this
side because this is always smaller when
I smile can you tell my favorite animals
are Turtles and elephants so I love
turtles because when I was young I had
these two pet turtles and they grew from
like the size of a quarter to like this
size and they were so huge I had them
for so many years I really fell in love
with elephants when I went to Thailand
and I got to meet them face to face they
are so awesome so one day I hope to
volunteer at an elephant sanctuary
that's just something that I want to do
once in my life my favorite Pokemon is
squirtle and in my car I have a little
squirtle bobblehead right there on the
dashboard out of all the elements I
really love water like I really like to
be around bodies of water and water just
makes me feel so calm and peaceful I am
a Libra my birthday's in October my
myers-briggs personality type is between
ENFJ and
nfj so when I took the test in high
school and college I would get ENFJ but
I think after college I'm more of an
introvert so I've become more an infj
but basically I think I'm in like around
the middle between extrovert and
introvert it really depends on the
people I'm with and the life stage that
I'm in I love chocolate and my favorite
types of chocolate are milk of bars and
I Kias hazelnut chocolate if you haven't
tried iqs chocalate it's amazing don't
judge it until you try it
I really enjoy interior design I really
like clean very refreshing spaces I have
a younger brother named Elvis
so he's three years younger than me and
I love him to death I also have a lot of
cousins
I have probably 20-something or more
cousins and I grew up with most of them
they feel like my huge family of
brothers and sisters when I was young I
was SuperDuper shy and timid like I was
the kid who was so scared to raise her
hand in class too scared to talk my
favorite drink is water and I'm not
kidding I love water the only bone I've
ever broken in my body is my thumb so in
high school I fractured my thumb by
falling off of a scooter and I had to
wear a cast all on my arm up to here for
at least a month that summer I went to a
rock festival called Warped Tour and I
crowd-surfed for the first time with my
cast like riding the people and I also
got my cast signed by the band matchbook
romance and a few other small bands that
were there my first internship in
college was at the TV channel E I worked
on the set of E news in the wardrobe
department so I got to sit on set with
Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic when
they were filming the show my favorite
movie of all time is Moulin Rouge I've
probably watched that movie at least 20
times or more in my life and I'm still
not sick of it I just love the
soundtrack so much and I love its
romantic style Moulin Rouge was directed
by Baz Luhrmann which is why I also
really love the movie The Great Gatsby
with Leonardo DiCaprio that movie is
just so beautiful visual
and there was a scene where they show
like flowing Creek and race and like
flowing fabric is one of my favorite
textures in the world it just makes me
so happy I used to go to Chinese school
every Saturday morning with my cousins
and after Chinese school we would take
kung-fu lessons so I also used to do
kung fu' as well the thing is I was
never really good at sparring but I love
to do like performance kicks and stuff
so honestly I'm more of a dancer than a
fighter also when we were kids my
cousins and I got together and we
learned the whole choreography to n
sync's it's going to be me and we
performed it at a family party and it
was like the coolest thing ever we still
talked about it now because we put so
much effort every Saturday we would like
practice watching the music video over
and over to learn all the moves and yeah
it was just really fun I really really
wish that we still had the video but I
haven't seen it in years the first CD
that I ever purchased was Britney Spears
baby one more time and when I was young
my first dream job was to be Britney
Spears backup dancer that was my goal I
also used to pretend to be a radio host
and DJ when I was young so I had this
little toy recorder radio thing and I
used to record myself talking into it
like Hello this is the Eileen show and I
would record a song when it came on on
the radio and like oh my god this next
song is so great buh buh blah and I
would record that song and I would have
all these tapes like Eileen's favorite
songs
Eileen's mixtape blah blah blah I was
like the queen of mixtapes back then my
favorite cuisines are Japanese and
Italian food and I think I could live
off of those two cuisines for the rest
of my life if I had to even better was
when I went to Japan and we had Japanese
Italian fusion pasta it was so good oh
