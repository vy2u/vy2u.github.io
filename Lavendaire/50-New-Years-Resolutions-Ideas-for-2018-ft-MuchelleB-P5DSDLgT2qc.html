Welcome back to Lavendaire.
2018 is right around the corner.
I don't know about you but I am so ready,
so ready for the new year.
Today I've collaborated with MuchelleB.
I'm sure a lot of you have known her,
have heard of her, watched her videos.
She's really amazing.
So we're gonna bring you
50 New Year's resolutions ideas.
She's got you covered with 25 ideas.
And I got you covered with 25 more ideas.
So watch this video
and then click down below to watch Muchelle's
video after this.
Alright, let's get to it.
1.
Make it point to explore a creative hobby
in 2018.
So whether you want to
pick up an instrument, learn how to paint,
do something that fuels your creative soul,
because human beings are meant to create.
I believe that every single person
is a creative person.
So you have to use what's in you, and it's
just fun.
It will bring a lot more color and inspiration
into your life.
2.
Design your ideal habits on how you want your
lifestyle to look next year.
So whether you want to start meditating every
day, journaling, drinking tea in the mornings,
whatever it is make it a plan to slowly incorporate
your new habits into your lifestyle
one at a time.
Do it really slowly and then build from there.
3.
You can also decide what habits you want to
break next year.
So make a list of your bad habits or habits
that you really want to let go of,
and then start one at a time.
Tell a friend about this so that your friend
can keep you accountable.
And if you really want to see it through,
make a consequence or some sort of punishment
for not following through,
and make sure that friend holds you accountable
for those consequences.
4.
Make it a commitment to read at least 10 pages
a day.
I find it easier
to make a commitment based on the pages vs.
the number of books
that you want to read in a year, because when
you make the goal the number of books,
it feels big and daunting.
But if you just tell yourself, okay ten pages
a day,
or even five pages a day.
Usually you read your five or ten pages
and then you want to read more.
So it's all about building the consistent
daily habits
of reading, rather than focusing on the end
goal of how many books you've read.
5.
Try listening to audiobooks.
This is something that I got really into this
year,
and I think it's because I felt like it was
easier to make time to listen to books
when I was driving, rather than reading actual
books at home.
So if you feel like
you can't make time to read every day and
you have some sort of commute,
or you go jogging where you can listen to
something, why not listen to
some books on the way?
Because then you're learning a lot while you're
doing something
that you would've done anyway.
By the way, my favorite book to listen to
is Kevin Hart's audiobook.
It's the funniest thing ever.
I recommend it to everybody.
6.
Ask yourself: What is the experience that
you've always wanted to try.
Is it skydiving, surfing, taking a ballet
class?
Whatever it is, make time
as soon as you can to do a quick Google search
on how you can make that happen in 2018.
7.
Take control of your finances.
Make a plan to save enough money in your bank
that will cover your expenses for five months.
That's your safety net.
And if you already have that amount of money
saved, then start investing your money.
You can check out this video right here or
down below on how to start investing.
I've been using Betterment for more than a
year already and I highly recommend it.
You gotta make your money work for you once
you have that extra cash,
because it's smarter to put your money somewhere
that will make it grow vs.
just leaving it in the bank where it won't
really do that much for you.
8.
Invest in yourself in 2018.
I strongly believe in using our money to fuel
our future.
So instead of using your money to buy things
just to consume, use your money
to buy something that will help elevate yourself
and your career.
Whether you're a freelancer,
maybe investing in better software, better
equipment, or investing in furthering education,
taking classes, spending your money in a way
that invests in a better future for yourself.
9.
Declutter your closets or your space in 2018.
I find it so refreshing to declutter.
I always like to declutter whenever it's the
new year, so that I can get rid of old things,
get rid of old energy to make room for the
new.
I have a ton of decluttering videos.
You can watch the playlist here and the link
will be down below as well.
10.
And while you're decluttering, you might as
well gather up
some old things to sell for extra cash because
you know what they say:
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
So why not?
11.
Plan an artist date for yourself in 2018.
An artist date is basically you taking yourself
out
on a solo date doing something fun that fuels
your creative soul.
It could be anything
depending on what you're interested in.
So just ask yourself: Wouldn't it be fun if
I … ?
Fill in the blank, and then pick a date to
make it happen and have a ball.
12.
Write a love letter to yourself.
This is something I recommend everyone do
because it helps enhance and build self love.
And I know it's really awkward
and it's really weird at first, but just give
it a try and see what happens.
13.
Reconnect with an old friend that you really
love and care about.
I'm sure we've all experienced drifting away
from someone that we love,
and it's not that you stopped caring about
them.
It's just that your lives went different directions.
Wouldn't it be nice to just send them a little
message just to say, &quot;Hi, I still care about
you.
How are you doing?&quot;
I don't know, it might spark up something
nice.
14.
Reach out to someone you admire and compliment
them.
Whether it's someone
close to you in your actual life, or someone
you just follow on social media,
kind words can really go a long way.
I've personally developed real friendships
that started out as just complimenting each
other on social media,
because I see someone doing something really
cool.
And then I tell them,
&quot;Oh my god, you're so awesome.
I love what you do.&quot;
And then it turns into a real conversation,
and then it turns into a real friendship over
time, which is really cool.
15.
Do the Current Me vs. Future Me exercise for
2018.
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
it's an exercise in my Artist of Life Workbook
where you draw your current self vs.
your future self.
And I explain more in these videos.
Check them out.
Definitely do the exercise and tag me at @lavendaire
because I'd love to see your drawings.
16.
Redecorate and give your space a mini-makeover.
You can look to Pinterest
for some home inspo and just find new ways
to shake things up and refresh your space.
17.
Try stream-of-consciousness journaling every
day for an entire week.
I highly recommend trying this.
It's my favorite way to journal because after
you just learn
to flow from your thoughts to your paper and
you do it consistently every day,
you're gonna realize that you get clear on
your goals and what you want.
You get clear on how you should move forward
with life.
It's just the best thing ever.
18.
Go on an adventure in your hometown.
Usually, when we think of traveling,
we think of going to far off places, taking
a plane, or driving really far.
You don’t have to go that far to see the
places around you with new eyes.
Find a way to be a tourist in your hometown
for a day, whether you go to place
you've never gone before, trying new restaurants,
see things that you haven't seen before.
Have fun and look at your hometown with fresh
eyes.
19.
Find time to volunteer in the new year.
Get involved with a non-profit that you believe
in,
whether you're volunteering for an animal
shelter, homeless shelter, anything.
Just whatever strikes a chord in your heart
and you truly believe in
and want to help support, go do that because
the world needs more helping hands.
20.
Try yoga.
If you haven't tried yoga yet, definitely
make it a point to try it in 2018.
Yoga has so many benefits.
Doing it helps calm you down, de-stress, and
it helps you
obviously be more flexible, more strong.
And it really is a mind and body workout.
So you have a stronger mind, you're more patient,
you feel more balanced and grounded.
It just has so many positive effects that
there's no reason not to do it.
And if you already do yoga, make it a point
to improve your practice next year,
whether you want to do it more consistently
or hit some sort of goal,
like be able to do a headstand.
Yeah, why not?
21.
Dress up.
Ask yourself: What would I wear if I did not
care what anybody else
thought of me?
And it could be dressing up.
It could be dressing down.
Wear whatever makes you feel confident, beautiful,
and powerful.
For me, it means
putting a little more effort into my outfits
and just wearing new things,
experimenting with different styles, just
whatever makes me feel good.
22.
Dance more.
Even if you don't dance, or you hate it, just
try it,
by yourself in your room when no one's looking,
because at the end of the day,
you could still just laugh at yourself and
it will be fun regardless.
I truly believe
that dance is joy expressed in our physical
human form.
Dancing always boosts your mood.
It always makes you feel better, it makes
you happier.
23.
Wake up earlier than usual and have a slow,
mindful morning.
Sit in silence,
have some tea, listen to nature, feel the
morning sun.
Slow mornings are so calm
and beautiful, and they really make a positive
impact on your day
because how you start your day is how the
rest of your day is gonna be.
24.
Learn a new skill in 2018.
What is something that you've always to learn,
or maybe a skill that you've seen in others
that you really admire?
Why not make this year the year that you learn
that new skill?
So sign up for a course
or look up tutorials online, and get started.
25.
Clean up your eating habits in 2018.
Eat more fruits and vegetables,
try new healthy foods to see what you enjoy.
And if you aren't vegan already,
try reducing your meat intake by as much as
you can, whether it's a quarter, half, or
more,
because it's better for your health, it's
better for the environment,
and so much more.
I know a lot of people are very passionate
about veganism.
And I love the movement, I love what it stands
for, and I've read a lot into it.
But I do believe everyone is at a different
point in their journey,
a different part in the spectrum, so let's
respect everybody's lifestyle and their beliefs.
As long as you're making progress, then that's
all that people can ask for.
I also really want to share this bonus tip:
Take an ayurveda quiz and find out
what mind-body type you are, and what foods
and lifestyle suit your mind-body type.
This is something that I recently learned
about this year.
I learned about ayurveda
through this girl I interviewed on my podcast.
I'll post the link below.
But it was just so fascinating.
And learning about how different foods are
right
for different types of bodies.
It just changed my views on what &quot;healthy&quot;
really means.
Anyway, I hope you guys liked these new year's
resolution ideas.
If you want more ideas, you can check out
MuchelleB's down here and over here.
I apologize for the awkward lighting situation
in this video.
Wintertime is difficult for me because the
sun just doesn't want to stay out.
But yeah, hope you guys have a beautiful holiday
season.
And be on the lookout for more new year's-inspired
videos coming right up.
