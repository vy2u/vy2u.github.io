okay hi everyone welcome back to
lavender it's Eileen today I want to
share easy ways to meditate so these are
just tips and tricks for people who are
lazy at meditation people who are having
trouble making it a daily consistent
habit by the way if you haven't
subscribed to my channel yet make sure
you click down below to subscribe and
also click that bell if you want to get
notified of all my new videos hopefully
by now you know what meditation is and
how beneficial it can be for your health
and for your well-being if not then you
can check out this video I made already
called how to meditate that's more of
like an intro video on meditation
alright first tip I have for all
beginners at meditation is to start
small so don't think that you have to
sit down and meditate for like thirty
minutes or more at the beginning because
it can be really overwhelming if you're
not used to it so I would say start with
10 breaths okay if you can count to 10
then you can meditate just taking in 10
breaths in and out you can consider that
like one session like taking 10 breaths
and you can do that in the morning in
the middle of the day and in the evening
honestly that's already a good start
because when you're taking those 10
breaths you're bringing yourself to the
present you're centering your mind and
you're kind of getting like a taste of
meditation and what it's really like so
for me meditation is really like a lot
of just like listening to my breath
bringing my attention back to my breath
making sure I'm fully aware of the
present moment so start with the 10
breaths and if you feel like you can go
longer than that then you can start
meditating for like two to five minutes
at a time make it real easy so I like
using a meditation timer I use one
called Zen friend which I've shared in a
lot of my videos so start with yeah 2 to
5 minutes at a time and you can do it
once a day twice a day three times a day
it's really up to you but just start
small start manageable and take it from
there
remember that you can meditate anytime
during the day you can do it in the
morning right after you wake up or in
the evening before you go to bed or like
any
I'm just like take a break in the middle
of your day to recenter yourself and
meditate just like midday if you look at
it that way there's really no excuse to
not meditate because everyone here can
carve out five minutes sometime during
their day so there's always time to
meditate we just have to make that time
slip it in wherever it fits my next tip
is to use mantras and affirmations to
help you focus during meditation so if
you've tried to just sit there and
meditate sometimes your mind just like
wanders and it goes crazy and it's
really hard to like remember to stay
present and focus on your breath that's
natural because our human brains are
just like all over the place that's the
purpose of meditation is to learn to
train our brains to focus more but if
you're still like a beginner it can be
really hard to sit down and be still for
a long period of time so something
that's helped me is to just repeat a
mantra or affirmation which is a
positive or empowering statement just
repeat it over and over again to my head
so pick a phrase like I am supported I
am guided I'm protected or I am worthy I
am beautiful I am strong whatever type
of phrase that gets you feeling positive
and empowered use that phrase and say it
over and over and over to yourself in
your head
during meditation so you notice that
that phrase is kind of like your anchor
during meditation it helps you focus on
one thing so that your mind doesn't
wander like crazy and it also has
positive side effects because when
you're saying like an empowering
positive statement over and over again
like you just feel better about yourself
you feel more of whatever it is that you
keep repeating to yourself and
repetition is really a way to like
ingrain something in our brain
especially during meditation so it can
really add a positive effect - not just
meditation but your entire life like the
rest of your day as well my next tip is
to remember that you don't have to sit
down to meditate meditation comes in
many different forms so you can
technically meditate when you're doing
like kind of autopilot things like
driving cooking cleaning walking you can
use those activities as a meditate
of practice so all meditation is is
bringing mindfulness to the present so
being mindful of exactly what you're
doing immersing yourself fully in the
present and just not letting your mind
go on autopilot and wander around here
and there so for example when you're
driving instead of letting your mind go
on autopilot what I do sometimes is I
turn off the music and then I just focus
on my breathing while I'm driving and I
treat that as my meditation you can
essentially bring more mindfulness into
all these different mundane activities
that you do throughout the day and I
think that's the goal the goal is to be
able to be fully present and mindful
throughout your entire day my next tip
for an easy way to meditate is to listen
to binaural beats so binaural beats is
essentially an audio track that you have
to listen to on headphones so you have
to make sure the left and right ear are
separated the reason is because that
audio track plays like a slightly
different frequency in both ears so your
brain is not used to hearing like two
different frequencies in both ears at
the same time so what it does is it
cancels out that tone and it hears like
an invisible third frequency that is the
difference between these two frequencies
frequencies so the science might be kind
of hard to explain but I'll link an
article down below that helps explain it
a little better but essentially
listening to binaural beats puts your
brain into a meditative state after like
at least seven minutes so you have to
listen to it for at least seven minutes
or more and then you'll notice that I
don't know it's kind of like a massage
for your brain that's how I feel so I've
been using this app called sync tuition
and what it is is it's plays binaural
beats but it's also like highly produced
high-quality meditative sounds it just
sounds like relaxing music and each
track has a different theme to it so I
listen to sing tuition right before I go
to sleep so it's at night I just put the
headphones on in bed and the track is
like 25 minutes usually I doze off like
in the middle of the track I get really
really sleepy really really relaxed so
that by the end of the track I just like
you know
take off my headphones and I'm already
basically half asleep so I love it
because for me I kind of have insomnia
sometimes it's hard for me to fall
asleep so listening to binaural beats it
really is a lazy meditation where I feel
like I'm meditating but all I'm doing is
like lying in bed listening to music
right before I go to sleep plus it helps
me sleep better so I'll link that app
down below where you can listen to three
free tracks sing tuition claims that it
helps you strengthen your intuition so
if you're interested in exploring that
then check out down below you can also
do a quick youtube search of binaural
beats and you'll find like a lot of
different tracks but the ones that I
found on YouTube are pretty boring it's
literally like just the tone so I like
since it's intuition because it really
is like highly produced audio like they
put a lot of effort into making it sound
good for twenty five minutes so it's not
boring
in my opinion another alternative is to
just find soothing meditation music
online you can find that on YouTube or
on Spotify so these are not binary beats
but just like soothing sounds that help
you get into that meditative state if
you don't like meditating to silence
that it might be helpful to just play
some nice meditation music in the
background my last tip and a lot of
people love this one is you can totally
try a guided meditation so there are
apps like calm and headspace that are
really really popular that have guided
meditations that will lead you step by
step through your meditation and for
some people it's like their favorite way
to meditate for me personally not so
much I don't know why I don't like
following someone tell me what to do I
kind of like doing it on my own or
listening to music so it's really up to
you give it a try there's calm headspace
and you can also find guided meditations
on Spotify headspace has like a Spotify
playlist of their own guided meditations
also you can find some good ones on
YouTube
I know Louise Hay and Deepak Chopra are
really really popular for guided
meditations just because they infuse
this like purpose and meaning into their
guidance actually before I discovered
sing tuition my favorite thing to listen
to to help me go to sleep was Deepak
Chopra's guided meditations I really
real
really loved those because I think
Deepak Chopra's voice is really calming
and he sounds wise so yeah give that a
try hopefully by now you'll have some
new ideas on how you can incorporate
meditation into your life just really
look at all these different options
there are so many ways to bring more
mindfulness into your day and to always
remember to center yourself with your
breathing let me know if you try any of
these techniques let me know which one
is your favorites and hopefully
hopefully you can build a more
consistent meditation practice so that
you can reap all the benefits because it
really does enhance your life it
enhances how you feel and it'll bring
more peace within you alright I hope you
have a beautiful day thanks so much for
watching this one I'll see you next time
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
