Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old system of natural healing that comes from the Vedic culture of India.
Ever since I interviewed Sahara Rose on my podcast, I’ve been so intrigued by Ayurveda
and learning about what practices are best for my mind-body type!
I’m a Vata, by the way.
If you’re curious about your type, I’ve included a link to an Ayurveda quiz in the description.
Today I’m sharing some Ayurveda inspired wellness habits you can try to incorporate into your routine.
First, gently stretch in the morning.
This wakes your body up, gets circulation going, and energizes you for your day.
After getting up, try oil pulling before brushing your teeth.
Oil pulling is the act of swishing oil - usually coconut or sesame oil -
into your mouth for up to 20 minutes to clean and detoxify your teeth and gums.
Think of it as oil cleansing your mouth, letting the oil pull and collect all that bacteria in your mouth.
Do your best not to swallow any oil, because all of that bacteria is in it!
While doing this, you can boil water to make a morning tea to warm your body up.
Here I’m making a tea with apple cider vinegar, honey, and dried ginger.
It’s always good to start your day with a warm drink,
because something warm allows your body to warm up its digestive system.
When you’re done oil pulling, spit out the oil in the trash because the oil might clog your pipes.
Then, rinse your mouth with warm water and brush your teeth as usual.
Another Ayurveda habit is to scrape your tongue
using a stainless steel tongue scraper.
It honestly feels weird in the beginning but now I’ve really grown to like it!
After doing this, my mouth feels exceptionally clean,
which is great because your oral health is linked to your overall health.
Now you can enjoy your morning tea that you made for yourself.
I like that these habits overlap so I can multitask while letting my tea cool down a bit.
The next habit is meditation.
Take time every day to breathe, be still, and be present.
You could even take this moment in your morning
to express gratitude for your life.
Acknowledge five specific things you’re grateful for in your life.
You can say it in your head, out loud, or jot it down in your notebook.
This makes a huge difference in your perspective.
Similar to drinking something warm in the morning, Ayurveda teaches to eat a warm and light breakfast
to ease in your digestive system at the beginning of the day.
I used to have green smoothies every morning,
but since learning this, I’ve started to make warm oatmeal for breakfast instead.
I just sprinkle some chia seed, flaxseed, and fresh berries on top.
Another Ayurveda habit to try is dry skin brushing.
Dry brushing is a way to refresh and stimulate the skin and lymphatic system,
improve blood circulation, and release toxins.
There’s a specific way to do this so I’ll
link a step-by-step guide in the description below.
Lastly is the Ayurvedic habit of Abyanga,
or self oil massage.
Similar to applying body lotion, this is a practice of massaging oil on your body for 15-20 minutes
a few times a week to give your body love
and the feeling of stability and warmth.
This practice increases circulation, decreases effects of aging, calms the nerves, and so much more.
Again, I’ll share a link to detailed instructions
and all the benefits of this habit below.
Because I am a Vata - which is the cool and dry dosha -
I use warm oils like sesame oil to warm my body.
But make sure you take an Ayurveda quiz to
discover your mind-body type and learn more
about how you can specifically take care of yourself!
After you’ve taken the quiz, comment below with your dosha because I’m super curious to know.
Thanks for watching.
Make sure to subscribe and I’ll catch you all in the next one.
Love you all so much.
