grateful for all of you it means the
world to me

a song that I heard a couple days ago
and I fell in love with it it's called
bright by echosmith and if you listen to
the lyrics
if the lyrics are so positive and
beautiful and they honestly describe how
I feel right now at this moment in my
life I feel like as I continue to grow
and I share with you guys through this
channel I'm finding my voice and more
and more I'm living a line to my purpose
and it just everything is coming
together and it feels really good and I
just honestly I cannot thank you guys
enough for that I love you guys and just
listen and enjoy thanks e universe is
heaven and earth have finally aligned
days are good and that's the way it
should be you sprinkle stars on my
pillow k it's like a moving rushed

picked this thing up in a really long
time but anyway thank you guys so so
much I love you all so much I also want
to make an announcement that I'm going
to be filming a movie in Taipei in the
month of March and everything's been
super surreal literally by the time you
watch this video I'll probably be in
Taiwan prepping and shooting and stuff
but as of right now I am at home and my
flight is in about five hours so I don't
know I just had to make this video now
to capture this moment where I'm just
super thankful and grateful for
everything in life
there's exciting opportunities ahead but
also a lot of obstacles and a lot of
uncertainty but at the end of the day
I'm just happy that I'm taking a risk to
do something creative and to do
something that I want to do and live the
life that I want to live so if you want
to know more about the film I'll
probably write a blog post and put the
link in the description below and also
you can follow my Facebook and Instagram
lavend dare
I'll probably be posting photos and
please please please like our movie
Facebook page it's LA to Taipei all the
links are below please like and follow
everything because your support would
mean everything but yeah I just keep
doing you and chase what you want
because in the end it's going to be
worth it that's all I'm gonna say right
now and lastly thank you again I have to
go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
