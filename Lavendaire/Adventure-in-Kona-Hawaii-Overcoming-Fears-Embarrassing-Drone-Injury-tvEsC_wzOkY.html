I am lucky, I am blessed, I can't believe
I get to see the world like this.
Last week, I got the amazing opportunity to
explore Big Island, Hawaii with Hyundai and
drive their new Kona SUV around the island.
I fell in love with the white sand beaches,
warm ocean water, amazing food, and scenery.
It was such a refreshing getaway and I also
conquered a few fears too.
Special thanks to Hyundai for sponsoring this video,
and huge thanks to you all for watching, supporting, and making all of this possible.
What's up guys?
I just made it to Hawaii.
You see the beach?
It's right here.
It's so gorgeous here, and right now it's
the perfect time of day for lighting.
I'm just here on the Kona side of Big Island,
really excited about my trip.
I think I'm gonna try to see some sea turtles.
We're gonna go ziplining which I'm pretty
scared about but I think it'll be a good time.
Let's go to the ocean.
- When you hear the beeping, that means it sees the tree.
See this?
So it's our first official day in Kona and right now I'm driving to the other side of the island.
We stayed on the west side and now we're
driving to the east side for lunch.
It's supposed to be a really pretty spot,
so we'll see.
I'm just hoping it doesn't rain today so I
can go to the beach later or something.
It's so pretty here!
The trees are huge!
Wow.
So we're currently having lunch at this place called Palm Cliff House Inn.
It's a really cute house and it's on a cliff where you see the ocean.
The view is so nice.
It is a little rainy but thank god it's not pouring.
Got some food.
Especially excited about poke and all this guac.
Let's do it.
So my plan today kinda of changed around because
I didn't realize our lunch was on this side
of the island so we have no plans.
We're just going to drive around and stop
at wherever we think is pretty.
I'm here with Wilson. I saw a really pretty
bridge so we just parked the car and we're
just gonna go take some pictures.
As you can see, we got to drive around the
island in the new Hyundai Kona.
The Hyundai Kona is an all-wheel drive SUV
that's super tech-friendly and perfect size
for going on adventures.
My favorite tech features of the Kona are:
Apple CarPlay for playing music
and - check this out - wireless charging for your phone.
I've never seen this in a car before so it
really blew my mind.
Lastly, another feature that we used quite often was the Blue Link Destination Search with voice command.
- Please say the name of the point of interest.
- Mauna Kea Hotel
It's so convenient and even worked when our
cell phones had no reception, so I felt safe
knowing we couldn't get lost while exploring.
Honestly it was so comfortable riding and
driving in the Hyundai Kona.
This car has everything you need but not too
much that it's wasteful.
It was the perfect car to explore the island
with and super fun to drive too.
Check out the link in the description if you
want to learn more about the Hyundai Kona.
We made it to this place called &quot;Waipio Bay&quot;,
and I see it from here.
It's so beautiful.
It's a mountain, an ocean.
So pretty, right?
The sun is coming out on our way back to the hotel.
Driving towards the ocean on the other side.
Being in the sun makes me feel so much better. I love it.
It's so pretty here.
The sun is setting, it's on the water.
It's just gorgeous.
Love it.
Good morning!
Just had breakfast, now just walking and taking photos of the beach.
Today we're going ziplining and we're actually
going in a couple hours, so I have some time
to relax and chill which is really nice.
I'll just set up my drone and see what happens.
At this point, I thought it'd be a good idea to set up my drone and get some epic beach shots,
but keep in mind I just started using this so I'm just gonna let you keep watching and see what happens.
[Drone gets caught on umbrella]
[Gasp]
Oh my god.
Uh oh.
Okay, sorry.
Accident.
Mhm, that was bad.
Let me rewind that for you.
So what happened was: Lifting off the drone,
I was trying to get the drone in the shot
with the vlog so I put it close to me.
It got caught at the edge of the umbrella
above me, right around here, and started flying
around like crazy.
Look at my index finger.
It's already bleeding and I don't even know.
I'm just doing my best to land it as gracefully
as possible but people around me were watching.
I was, you know, very flustered at this moment.
I am freaking terrified flying this thing right now.
Dude, the drone cut my finger.
Do you see this?
These are my battle wounds.
This is so scary.
Also I got some cuts here.
Still gotta fly it though.
By the way: another casualty.
I sat on my sunglasses as I was trying to
catch that drone.
What a morning.
Alright, so we're gonna go ziplining now and the weather is amazing.
I hope that it is sunny on the other side of the island.
We'll see.
I was gonna drive today, but because of said injury, I will not be driving.
I just want to relax and enjoy this sun.
Check out the view!
We're gonna be ziplining through these trees.
Got the gear on, ready to go in the van.
Just kidding.
Phew.
- So, just sit?
I just sit back?
- Yep!
- Now?
Ready?
Whoo!
Yay!
Thank you.
Okay.
That was fun.
- Should we do it again?
- Yeah, we're gonna do it again.
Eight more times.
Now we're going on a long zipline that goes
over the river for a long time.
Whew.
We're going extra high up this time.
It is so long, but it is beautiful.
Wilson, me.
Oh my god, it's amazing.
Oh, this is fun!
I can do this.
Okay don't make it - oh my god, please!
Okay, seriously guys, look at my feet, look
at the river.
Yes, oh my god, I'm wobbly.
You're the worst!
[Screaming]
Wilson's literally the worst.
- It's not me, I swear.
It's not me.
Were you scared on that bridge?
- Yeah, it was just annoying when you were
making me wobble.
I can't walk straight.
- I wasn't making you wobble.
- Yeah, you were.
- That wasn't me, I swear.
- It was just doing that?
- Mhm.
Just finished ziplining and I feel great.
I'm ready to just chill out because that was
exhilarating and took a while.
It was like two hours.
Yay, what a great day!
This was actually a very exhilarating day.
We ended the night with the most amazing dinner
on the beach.
After dinner, we just sat by the fire,
shared stories, and laughed with some new friends.
I'm so grateful for this opportunity to explore Kona, meet new people, and stretch myself in new ways.
I learned something new about myself and about life, each time.
The island taught me that you can find beauty
and happiness in the simplest things like
breathing in the fresh air or driving on the
open road.
It's not so much about the places you go but
the people you share your time with and the
memories you make.
I also pushed myself to be more adventurous
and do things that scare me.
Each time I do this, it's uncomfortable but
I know I'm growing.
I'm inspired to bring this more into my everyday
life, just always making the most of the moment
and enjoying the beauty in all things the Kona way.
Hope you guys enjoyed this little journey.
Sending all my love.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
