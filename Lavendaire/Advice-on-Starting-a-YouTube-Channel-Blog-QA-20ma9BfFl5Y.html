video is going to be jam-packed with a
lot of information
you guys always give me a lot of
questions on how to start a blog how to
start a YouTube and today is I'm just
going to try to answer all of your
questions is essentially a Q&amp;amp;A video but
I'm just going to skip reading the
questions and go straight to sharing the
content itself and this video is going
to be focusing on the advice portion of
content creating and I'll make another
video where I get into the technical
side of YouTube what camera I use what
editing software etc and if you're into
blogging I'm going to make a separate
blog post on the technical side of
blogging like what platforms or hosting
services to use and later on I'm going
to make another video on how to start a
podcast so if you're interested in any
of those things make sure to click in
the description and check them out first
off I want to share what advice I have
for anyone starting out as a content
creator whether you're going to be on
YouTube a blog a podcast or something
else the first thing you have to know
your purpose why do you want to start
your blog or YouTube or podcasts why do
you want to be a content creator and
it's really important to know your why
because that sets the foundation for
everything else ask yourself is this
just going to be a hobby where you just
want to express yourself and do
something creative or fun or do you want
to take it seriously
and actually create a career out of it
whatever it is it's really important to
just get down to why you want to do this
maybe have like a mission statement and
put it on like a notebook or somewhere
you will read really often so that
you're reminded of why you started next
up is crafting your brand so your brand
is an extension of your voice it's your
message it's the feeling that you give
your audience it's your kind of
perception of the world essentially your
brand is usually an extension of
yourself
so for me my brand is live and air and
it's all an extension of myself it's
very dreamy and
and I like to talk about personal growth
and all these things ask yourself what
kind of feeling do you want to give your
audience what kind of message do you
want to share and you craft your brand
around that a question that I get very
very often is how did you come up with
the name lavender and I think it's
because a lot of people have trouble
coming up with that name for their
YouTube channel and blog because it's so
important your brand starts with the
name so for me I had been on YouTube and
have been making music under my own name
Eileen sue or my old YouTube handle was
like Eileen with it and it was just
something like a screen name from high
school but when I wanted to start
lavender my new blog and YouTube channel
I really consciously created like a word
I wanted to create one word that sounded
really pretty dreamy Airy something that
reflects my personality and I wanted to
make sure that word was something that
was not already on Google because I
cared about like SEO and stuff so I just
spent a lot of time brainstorming what
kind of names would be good and I kind
of listed a bunch of words that
described what my personality was and
what kind of feelings I liked and
there's no right or wrong way to create
a name you just have to spend a lot of
time brainstorming it's not going to
come to you at once but I think once
you've like found a name that sticks
with you and you can't forget it then
you found your name
so in short my tips on creating a name
are to brainstorm take your time be very
patient with it and it will eventually
come also be mindful of what else is on
the internet so you don't choose
something that someone else is already
using just make sure that name describes
your personality or that brand feeling
that you want to create the next tip I
have is you have to make sure that
passion and joy are at the center of
everything you do everything you create
has to be created out of passion and joy
if you create something that you're not
excited about that you're like oh this
is so boring it's not going to be good
and people aren't going to enjoy reading
it or watching it or listening to it you
really have to put your zest for life
into every
thing that you create you have to put
that passion there and also that passion
drives you as you continue creating
because being a content creator is fun
and it should only be fun it shouldn't
feel like a drag it shouldn't feel like
work
you should always focus on having fun
first and focus on the creating aspect
don't worry about the results or the
rewards that you want to get don't do it
for the numbers the money whatever do it
because you love it too because of the
passion and the joy epicenter the next
tip for new content creators is a huge
one and this is like the most important
thing that I tell all of my friends who
ask me about content creating tips so
you have to remember these four letters
q/v see a full disclaimer I did not come
up with this I learned this from Alex
icon from a podcast that he did like two
years ago I don't know if I could find
that link but if I could find it I will
post it in the description as well but
he said this in the podcast and I took
it and I learned a lot from it and I
it's basically a foundation in all the
stuff that I create so QVC a stands for
quality value consistency and
authenticity so when you're creating
content you always have to have these
four letters these four words in mind so
when you create content you have to make
sure that it's the highest quality that
you can create as possible it's okay
that you don't have like the best camera
or the best resources but you do the
best with what you have right now so
just try to create high quality content
because in this day and age no one's
going to watch a very blurry video or a
blog post that's not well edited you
just have to keep quality in mind just
do your best create the highest quality
content you can imagine next up you have
to make sure that your content delivers
value to your audience so value can come
in many different forms as long as you
give your audience something whether you
entertain them educate them inspire them
value is something that your audience
can take away from your content if your
content doesn't deliver value to your
audience
they're not going to come back and
they're not going to watch more of your
stuff they're just not going to be
engaged unless they're getting something
from your video think about the videos
you watch on Facebook you watch them
because they're interesting they're
funny they're inspiring they teach you
something make sure that your content
always does something where it delivers
value C stands for consistency which is
literally what I think is the most
important thing in becoming a successful
content creator because consistency
shows that you are a pro consistency
means that you are uploading frequently
at least have some sort of schedule
where you're uploading once a week or
twice a week whatever you can handle
being a content creator is really
flexible but you really have to be self
disciplined and have that consistency
you have to put yourself on a schedule
to create and upload things post things
on a schedule having a schedule shows
people that you're not an amateur you're
a pro and it kind of lets them know when
to expect to come back to keep following
your content it's so important
consistency is everything in life the
last letter stands for authenticity so
whenever you're creating content you
have to make sure that you were being
your authentic self be real be genuine
just be yourself because that is the
best version of you that you can be
don't try to be anyone else don't try to
mimic other people you can be inspired
by other people's styles but ultimately
you have to bring your own original
flavor out and that's how your content
is going to be engaging that's how
people are going to connect with you
because people can't connect to like
fake personas they connect with the real
person deep down so again those four
letters QV CA are quality value
consistency and authenticity it's really
one of the most important foundation
parts to think about when creating
content my next piece of advice for
people starting out is to just start now
start with what you have right now it's
better to start now with like less
resources and work your way until you
learn more eventually than to wait until
later like a future date to start your
blog or YouTube channel
just if you really want to do it start
now start with what you have is better
to start earlier and get through those
like sucky stages where you're not that
good at doing everything to eventually
like row and build and improve and get
to where you want to be sooner so the
sooner you start the sooner you can get
to that expert level that you want to be
at and the last tip I'll share today on
people starting out as a content creator
is to stop caring about what other
people think because you really have to
just be you stop caring whether people
are judging you for putting yourself out
there or whether people don't approve of
what you're doing I know there's like a
lot of factors at a lot of space while
like taking that risk to start being a
youtuber blog or whatever but you can't
let that get to you because not none of
it really matters what really matters is
that you have that fire in you that
wants to do it and you can't ignore it
you have to follow it and do it just for
a while just to try it out because
you're just going to regret it if you
don't give it a try moving forward let's
talk about my process as a content
creator so it really varies depending on
what I'm going through but I've tried to
set up this general structure that I
follow for my week so Mondays and
Tuesdays are my shooting and editing
days Wednesdays are my editing and
writing and meeting days so Wednesdays I
will write my emails my blog post and
I'll have meetings for the podcast and
I'll write the podcast on Wednesday to
Thursdays are the days where I record my
podcast I have more meetings and then I
have the afternoon to catch up on
whether I need to edit or shoot some
more Fridays I try to make my creative
and learning day where I can work on
music or take some online classes but
honestly most of the times I end up
catching up on more work on Friday
whether I'm like replying emails doing
interviews with people or like answering
comments or something so when I'm
filming videos I'm usually filming 1 to
2 videos at a time I've tried to fill my
three videos at a time but I just the
time just doesn't work out for me
because I like to use
for daylight and when the Sun sets I
can't shoot anymore so it takes me about
an hour to two hours to film a talking
video videos where I have different
scenes
I would probably swear that out over a
few days so I don't know how long it
really takes editing videos ranges from
like 4 hours to 10 or more hours per
video again depending on what kind of
video it is so if you guys watch my
words of wisdom videos it's just me
talking it's really easy to edit that
will take like 3 to 4 hours and a video
that is more complex with more scenes
and voiceovers that can take like 10 to
12 or more hours to edit another
question I get often is how do I come up
with ideas for content how do I stay
inspired so first off if you are truly
passionate about this topic of choice
then you will never run out of things to
talk about you might have little spurts
where you're not inspired and your stuff
but if you really love it there's always
some way you can go deeper there's
always different angles for you to go
there's always like you'll never run out
of ideas if you're truly interested in
it for me I get a lot of my ideas from
either journaling reading or whatever is
happening in my life at the moment so I
do morning pages where I just write
journal freely and sometimes I'll like
write things that I'm learning and going
through and I'm like oh my god it's a
great idea I should share that with
people on YouTube so that's where I'll
get some ideas other ideas like when I'm
reading a book that's really inspiring
or is teaching me something really
important I feel like I'm obligated to
share those things because I'm like oh
my god this is something that everyone
should know about so for me I get
inspired by knowledge learning
inspiration as well as art I think music
really inspires me as well and because
my topic is personal growth and
lifestyle design I'm always learning and
sharing what I'm learning and I know
that when there are times that I feel
like I don't have that much to share
that's a sign that I'm not growing as
much as I could be growing and so when I
don't have anything to talk about I know
that's a problem with me and I'm like oh
my god I need to go out and learn
something so that I have something to
talk about so that's how it is for me
essentially you get inspiration by
pushing yourself to keep growing in that
field of your choice also it's really
great if you could keep a document where
you have a whole list of content ideas
and you have a Content calendar where
you kind of schedule doubt loosely what
content you'll be posting in the next
couple months so it's really good to
have just ideas brainstormed beforehand
so that you don't run out of ideas when
you're there you're like oh my god I
don't have anything to post this week no
you have to always plan ahead have like
a list of content ideas and when you get
to that week you can either talk about
that idea or you could talk about
something else if you want but what's
important is you have those like backup
ideas you have a list of what you can
talk about in the future okay this is
the Google Doc where I put all my
content ideas so I call it just right
2016 I had one for 2015 up here I keep
QVC all the things that I want to
remember while creating content and then
down here is where I start so I have my
goal and I start with a month and then I
have all these content ideas for that
month and you go down next up I have see
I have all these ideas that I just
transfer over to the next month so for
June I have a few ideas and whatever
ideas I don't do I transfer to the next
month and the next month and then here I
have some more ideas down here
and at the bottom of the document I have
done so these are all the videos that
I've finished once I finish them I just
scoot them over to the bottom of the
dock so these are like videos that I did
in January all the way up to now so this
is all my content all this stuff and if
I open up my calendar this is how I plan
out when to post my content so going
back I have like a label for lavender
anytime there's a video coming out I
post like what video I plan to share
whether I have to write an email that
week and what podcast I'm going to post
etc all the other things I have to do
next up a lot of people ask how do you
promote yourself online how do you start
gaining a following so first off the
content that you create must be solid it
must be amazing content that people
actually want to see something that
actually benefits people's lives that's
the first and foremost because you can't
sell a product that is broken or that is
just something that people don't want
you have to give people something that
they want first of all and the question
here is how do you get people to find
your amazing content for YouTube I guess
we can start with the thumbnail so your
thumbnails are really important
thumbnails are like your advertisement
for your video so I'm sure you guys know
as you're scrolling YouTube you really
look at the thumbnails if it's
interesting if it's engaging then you're
like oh my god I want to watch this so I
guess just when you're creating your
thumbnails keep that in mind keep like
think about what's engaging does this
thumbnail really depict what this video
is going to be about it has to be
high-quality and get people's attention
make people want to watch it next up are
your titles descriptions and tags so you
really want to make sure that your video
and the descriptions are optimized for
SEO SEO is search engine optimization
and you don't have to get too crazy into
it it's like a whole other industry but
you just have to know that your titles
have to describe the content that you're
creating it's very obvious but don't
have titles that are like clickbait and
don't have titles that don't like it
doesn't correlate with the content you
want to make sure that people understand
what this video is going to be about
just by reading the title and you want
to pick the keywords in your titles pick
keywords that are frequently searched
you could use Google Adwords
search tool I'm not sure what it's
called I'll link it below but you can
use that to see what are the hot popular
keywords and you could pick the popular
keywords to put in your titles what's
most important is your title the first
few words of your description as well as
your tags so just tag what is relevant
to your content
next up make sure you take advantage of
YouTube's playlist annotations and cards
because I know more and more YouTube
ranks playlists in the search as well so
if you group your videos into playlists
that are like you know a good group with
good keywords whatever then you have
more chance for people to find your
content and annotations and cards are
great to keep people on your channel
watching your videos because once one
video is over you can direct them to
something else that's related and it's
just easier for people to find you the
point is you want to make things easy
for your audience you want to make it
convenient for them to keep watching
your stuff now we can talk about
promoting yourself outside of YouTube so
definitely take advantage of your social
media I think when you're starting out
you have to start posting and sharing on
your own personal social media your
Facebook Twitter Instagram snapchat and
be shameless about it just share what
you got because if you worked hard to
create great content then someone out
there will enjoy it there are a lot of
different ways that you can go and
market yourself online you just have to
be creative and you have to make sure to
stay authentic so for example you can go
on forums related to your topic and you
could post in those forums make sure
that you're actually like being genuine
and helping other people if someone has
a question in that forum you could
genuinely give them a real answer based
on their knowledge and then say like oh
by the way check out my video it's
relevant a lot you could also do this
with other people's blogs so if you see
a blog post that's relevant
then you could comment below with
something you have to say about that
blog post and say by the way here is my
website blah blah so there's a lot of
like small things that you can do to
like put yourself all over the Internet
I remember I put a lot of my videos on
Reddit when I just started because
there's like a whole personal
development group on Reddit you just
have to go out there and find your niche
find where people are hanging out online
and promote yourself in front of them
but do it in a very honest genuine way
actually try to add value to people's
lives don't just be like look at me look
at me just because you have to actually
help people and give them something
another way to grow is to collaborate
with people and I'm sure you guys have
seen tons of collaborations you have to
find somebody who has a similar audience
to you and when you work together it can
be fun and help you grow because the
audience's cross over and lastly you can
also start guest posting on other blogs
or magazines so if you like to write and
you're a blogger then feel free to like
write up articles for other people
that's a good way to promote yourself
too alright before I go I want to leave
you with one last piece of advice don't
sweat the technical stuff if you truly
want to be a content creator I know a
lot of the times those technical things
can be scary there's a lot of things
that you have to learn a lot of skills
you have to pick up to be able to do it
but everything technical can be learned
there's like so much knowledge online
all these YouTube tutorials that you can
watch to learn how to shoot how to edit
how to design how to use Photoshop how
to like do anything that you can imagine
so really you have to just do your best
create the content that you want to
create and all of that like technical
skills that stuff that will come over
time with lots of practice so don't
sweat the technical stuff all of those
things can be learned the most important
thing is your drive and your passion and
your desire to create and share with the
world thank you guys so much for
watching make sure you like subscribe
and share if this video helped you in
any way and I will see you in my next
videos bye
