so today I want to share advice that I
would give to my younger self and I'm
super excited because today's video is
actually an epic collab with a bunch of
badass women so it all started out as an
idea between Aaron Henry and myself and
we just thought like how cool would it
be if we just invited all the female
creators we know to do this video as
well so that together we can reflect on
our growth and share our insights for
you guys so I'm so excited to announce
that we have Aaron Henry
Michelle be Sara nurse Lynette Sanae
Rachel Lee sugar mama
naturally thirsty mom and Frankie Garza
on this collab isn't that amazing like
seriously I look up to every one of
those women
everyone's so unique and different but
just badass in their own way so make
sure you check out everyone's video we
have a playlist in the upper right
corner and everyone's video links will
be down below as well so make sure you
stop by give everyone some love tell
them I sent you
alright on to the video dear Eileen at
17 you've made it to senior year of high
school I know I know it's been a really
tough year for you you've been pushed so
hard in academics and the IB program
that you've lost motivation to wake up
in the morning you dread waking up your
body is so tired that even when you want
to go to school you physically can't get
up for it so you get into trouble a lot
of trouble and embarrassment because
you'll show up during 3rd or 4th period
so often that the authorities threatened
to put you into home school and your
classmates have a running joke of where
you might be when you're not in class
and all you're trying to do is not a
fail Spanish so you can finally graduate
well here's my advice for you number one
don't be so hard on yourself I know you
feel like a failure because you're
trying to live up to such high standards
you want to be the perfect student you
want to be successful but this year has
come crumbling
on you it's okay be as kind and gentle
with yourself as possible be proud of
how far you've come and grateful for all
the good things you have in your life
focus on the good instead of the bad
number two you don't have to fit into
the system carve your own path and hold
on to your big dreams there are more
paths to success and you realize at the
moment you might not understand your
path right now but in a few years
everything will make so much more sense
Steve Jobs said you can connect the dots
looking forward you can only connect
them looking backwards so you have to
trust that the dots will somehow connect
in the future number three get to know
yourself embrace and appreciate who you
are
explore what you're interested in figure
out what you like or don't like and
learn your strengths and weaknesses
getting to know yourself will help build
self-confidence and self-love self-love
is something you're not aware of yet but
when you finally do discover it it will
change your life
number four stand up for yourself be
more open and honest in communicating
what you feel and what you want no one
is going to understand you if you just
keep quiet to yourself number five don't
be so shy or scared to try to think that
you're interested in like dancing
singing or acting just go for it
you have nothing to lose and everything
to gain by trying number six trust your
intuition instead of asking everyone
around you about what they think I know
you like to blame your indecisiveness on
being a Libra but you have more in you
than you think you do so learn to trust
yourself
number seven if you want to make a
friend be a friend don't just sit around
awkwardly waiting for someone to come
talk to you make the effort to reach out
to someone first life is just better
with good company
lastly three words it gets better trust
me just be patience keep doing your best
and know that your best days have yet to
come
sending you lots of love Eileen from the
future alright I hope you liked the
video make sure you check out everyone
else's video up here and also down below
and now I'd love to invite you to do
this tag as well let me know in the
comments what advice would you give to
your younger self or better yet make a
video of your own and then tweet me that
video link so that I can add your video
to this playlist as well I'd love to
have like an epic playlist of everyone's
video like how amazing would that be
alright love you guys so much thanks for
watching have a beautiful day and I'll
see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
