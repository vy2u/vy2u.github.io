steal like an artist by Austin Kleon in
the book the other talks about how
important it is to incorporate analog
activities back into the creative
process what this basically means is to
go old-school and create with your hands
Cleon says that computers have robbed us
of the feeling that we're actually
making things because we're just typing
keys and clicking mouse buttons we're
just sitting and staring and being in
such a stagnant position halts your
creativity he says we need to move to
feel like we're making something with
our bodies not just our heads so whether
it be writing with pens on paper
strumming a guitar or an eating clay we
need to literally move to get our
creativity flowing this idea inspired me
to surprise my friend with all of these
school supplies when we were meeting up
to work we were meeting to brainstorm a
story concept for a side project and
usually we have our laptops out when
we're plotting this time we made it a
point to brainstorm with our hands and
analog tools like post-its paper and
colored pens it was pretty fun to get
crafty using our tools and we came up
with some good stuff that we probably
wouldn't have created if we were on our
computers computers bring out the
perfectionist in all of us because it's
so easy to hit the Delete key that makes
it easy for us to edit ideas before we
even have them
going analog allows our hands and minds
to go to work it's just more fun to
brainstorm that way and when you're
having more fun you're more creative the
flow that clown suggests is to first
create on an analog desk then when you
have a solid concept you can take it to
the digital desk to edit and publish
your work on your computer I hope this
inspired you guys to bring analog
activities back into your creative
process I know I'm definitely going to
be doing this more often thanks for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
it I'll be back with another video next
Wednesday until then have a beautiful
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
