favorites video I'm gonna talk about my
favorite things in beauty fashion music
and books this entire month so here we
go in beauty I am still obsessed with
Korean skincare brands so I have my
Innisfree soybean energy essence I just
bought this in Taiwan and I really love
it it's like the serum you put on right
after you wash your face it's kind of a
gooey liquidy texture which feels really
cool on the face I like it
alright the second product is also by
Innisfree this is their orchid enriched
cream and this is a face cream that is
super rich and creamy and I kind of have
dry skin so I love to just lather on
dense moisture for my face it's pretty
thick so I use it for nighttime for
daytime I use another cream but this is
just really amazing for your face it's
just like locks in the moisture I love
it so much
alright so the next product is by skin
food this is their famous
rice mask wash off I recently got this
but I used it a few times and I really
love it it's kind of a gentle exfoliant
where you rub it on your face for 10
minutes and then you let it set on your
face for 10 to 15 minutes and then you
wash it off and it's very moisturizing
and I just like the way it smells and I
like the process of exfoliating and then
leaving it on as a mask twice a week so
I have fun with that one
alright so my favorite fashion find of
the month is this cute little blush
backpack from forever 21 I bought this
for Coachella and I ended up just
wearing it every day since
I just really love it it's so perfectly
sized I could fit so many things in it
and I like this backpack thing where I
don't have to put so much weight on one
shoulder I can just carry it on my back
and not worry about it
next up my favorites in music so April
was an amazing month for music for me
first off it was Coachella so obviously
I had a lot of fun there I love to be
immersed in live music and so I was very
inspired but more so I
to albums to be obsessed with this month
the first one is purity ring's new album
called another eternity i listened to
the entire album from the first song to
the last song in the car and and i would
repeat it and it's just it was so
amazing there was not a song that i
didn't like i love the perfect blend of
trap ish vibes with the pop vocals of
purity ring i think they're just so
unique and I am just vibing to this so
hard I think I'm so inspired by their
album I want to make music like that and
I just love it so much
alright the next album I'm obsessed with
is Porter Robinson's worlds I've heard
these songs before but I think it was
after I saw him at Coachella that I went
back to listen to his entire album and I
really kind of listened to it this time
and what I loved that I found is on
Spotify you can listen to his commentary
for each song he kind of talks a little
bit about how he came to write the song
and what's it really about and I love to
hear artists talk about their process
and talk about the meaning behind their
work just because it adds so much depth
to the song itself and the arts and
honestly I think Porter Robinson is such
an artist he is a true creative first of
all at Coachella I got to stand pretty
close to the stage so I got to see him
and I didn't realize this but he plays
live piano live keyboard during the show
he also plays live MIDI drums and he
also sings a little bit and it's very
rare to find a producer that will do all
of those things live and so I was
thoroughly impressed also I think Porter
Robinson is great at telling stories
through his music and he has such an
aesthetic that you can call his own he
has found his voice through his new
album worlds and if you listen to his
commentary and you listen to his entire
album thoroughly like you will get it
especially if you known him before he's
thrown so much his music has
with him so I'm just like obsessed with
him he is such an artist I love him so
much
next up books all right so I started
reading yes please by Amy Poehler at the
beginning of the month and honestly this
book is just such a fun read I love
reading memoirs by comedians so I've
read Mindy Kaling and Tina Fey and so I
am just I look up to Amy Poehler so much
I think she is a boss and she has owned
herself her strengths and she I love
that she's open and she's vulnerable she
kind of admits her weaknesses and she
admits her flaws and how she's not
always been so confident in herself and
I love that and she's just she's so
funny I would love to have her in my
girl group if you know what I mean and
the second book is one that I read
through in three days
it is the life-changing magic of tidying
by Mari a condo this book is a game
changer I think I read through it so
fast because I was so excited about it I
was like yes I love decluttering and
organizing and just trying to cleanse my
life and so this girl is like a ninja at
being minimal and keeping only the
things that you love around you so this
week I've been slowly decluttering and
I've been getting rid of half my closet
and all of that good stuff if you're
into organizing and decluttering and
finding new ways to revitalize and
refresh your life I would definitely
recommend you read this book okay so
those were my favorite things from April
let me know which one spoke out to you
and if you have any questions about any
products or books or music yeah that's
it have a beautiful day thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
