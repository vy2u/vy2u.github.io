favorites so the funny thing is that
this month I noticed none of my
favorites are tangible products
everything is either like an event that
happened or an audio book or music
basically all intangible things that
have been my favorites but I actually
think that's ok because I feel like
intangible resources are easier for you
guys to check out so that you don't have
to go out and buy something it really is
as easy as like clicking a link so I'm
gonna start off with my favorite events
of the month because I felt like a lot
of cool things happened in April so the
first event that I got super excited
about was Oprah's supersoul sessions
number 2 so this was an event that was
held at UCLA where Oprah invited a ton
of amazing speakers to come speak their
wisdom and share with the audience at
UCLA Royce hall I found out about this
event through Maury for Leo's email list
so once she came out with that email
about like pre presale tickets I jumped
on that opportunity because I love Oprah
I love Marie Forleo I loved a lot of the
speakers who were speaking so I was like
I don't care I'm just gonna buy a ticket
I'm gonna go by myself and just enjoy my
time so I went on my own and I had so
much fun it was like the most inspiring
day ever because just so much wisdom and
that energy in that room was so great
because everyone was like you could tell
everyone was soul centered and heart
centered and everybody just was so
present it was beautiful so I'll show
you guys the pamphlet with all the
speakers that were there so Marie Forleo
Cheryl Strayed
Amandla Stenberg Chris Carr in theory
Eckhart Tolle Kerry Washington and Oprah
Winfrey I almost knew like everybody who
was speaking except for like two or
three but everybody impressed me like
everyone was amazing so I have to say my
favorite speakers were Chaka sand your
Chris Carr and india.arie I think those
are my three favorite speakers of that
event but I know that they recorded this
entire event and it's good
be posted online so I'll check if the
links are up if they're up I'll link
them all down in the description below
so you can watch all of the speakers so
I also want to show you how I have two
of these pamphlets Wednesday's part one
and the other one says part two and it's
cuz I took so many notes during that
event that I finish the spaces that they
gave you for notes on the first one and
I was like oh my god I need more paper
so I took a second one just to write all
of my notes for the rest of the event so
it was jam-packed with inspiration
wisdom knowledge all good stuff Oprah is
amazing
my next favorite of April was Coachella
so you guys might have seen my Coachella
vlog so I won't talk too much about it
but Coachella is always an amazing time
it was my third Coachella this year and
I went was like a solid group of my
closest friends and it was just so fun I
really loved seeing Halsey because she's
like my favorite and also the
chainsmokers who I really really really
loved the thing about Coachella is that
I absolutely love music and I feel like
I know a lot of artists there's a lot of
artists that I want to see it's really
hard to see everyone you want to see
when you go in a big group so I feel
like in the future maybe I want to like
break off and do my own thing because I
feel bad dragging everyone to like an
artist that only I know and nobody else
knows but I don't know there's just like
pros and cons to Coachella but
ultimately I have like so much fun and I
each year I'm like learning something
new how to do it better next time so
yeah another big thing that happened to
me this month that is a favorite is that
I got laser eye surgery so it I think
it's officially called LASIK but anyway
yeah something opens your I shoot the
laser in it so that you don't have to
wear contacts and glasses for the rest
of your life supposedly so I got this at
the beginning of April so it's already
been three weeks since my surgery and if
you guys are interested I can make like
an entire video on its own just about
the whole process of getting LASIK but
it's something that I've always wanted
to do since I was
teenager because I've been wearing
glasses since I was in fourth grade and
I think even like financially it's
better to get LASIK than to live off of
contacts and glasses your entire life
because contacts for me cost like 500 to
$600 a year which is pretty pricey so
considering that I don't want to be like
30 40 50 years old still wearing
contacts relying on contacts and glasses
every day to me it was like a great
decision and I'm so happy about it like
my eyes are 20/20 right now and it's
crazy because I could just wake up and
see the world so yeah leave a comment
below if you have any questions about
the process of getting LASIK and if
there are enough questions I'll answer
them all in another video another
favorite that I have from this month and
I'm sure will be my favorite for many
months to come is this new yoga studio
that I signed up for
so it's called core power yoga I don't
know if you guys have that in your area
but in Southern California they have a
few locations and it's a pretty pricey
yoga studio I've never registered for
any yoga studio before I've only done
yoga at like 24 Hour Fitness where I
have a gym membership but just I did the
two weeks free at core power yoga and I
fell in love with it it's hot yoga and
the studio is clean their locker rooms
are like super nice and fresh and it
just feels really great and I love being
able to sweat that much because I'm a
person that it's hard for me to sweat
actually if you put me in a sauna I'll
be the last one to sweat compared to
everyone else around me it's just
something weird about my body but I know
that it's good to sweat so it's just
good to do hot yoga so that I can sweat
easier and I feel like I get a good
workout from that so I decided to sign
up because even though it's pretty pricy
in my head I'm like okay if I'm spending
this much on yoga I'm gonna have to go
so it's kind of motivating me to go
exercise more and the first week that I
got my pass I did yoga six times that
week and since then I've been going like
2 to 3 times a week and I'm trying to go
3 to 4 times a week because I think
that's just gonna be my standard workout
for the next month to come alright
moving on to resources so I finished
reading power of now by Eckhart Tolle I
think I might have already mentioned
before you guys know that I love that
book I made so much content off of that
book but also after that I just decided
I wanted to try out audiobooks cuz I've
never really listened to audio books and
I know a lot of people do it so I was
like okay I think I'll try listening to
a book for once instead of reading a
book so this past month I started
listening to Deepak Chopra's audiobooks
the first audiobook I started with was
his famous one the seven spiritual laws
of success which is really great it's
only an hour and a half long so you can
finish listening to it in like two or
three days and after I finished that one
I started creating affluence
so creating affluence I've just finished
last night literally and I feel like
that one is another one that I have to
listen to again and again so I'm happy
that I started listening to audio books
through Deepak Chopra because I actually
really enjoy listening to his voice he
has this Indian accent and he speaks
from such a wisdom and you can tell he's
super authentic so I think it was a good
experience and so far I really loved
listening to like 15 minutes of audio
book before I go to bed and I think
before you go to bed is like the best
time to absorb that kind of information
because it just like sets in your mind
as you sleep and it really kind of fuses
into your life even when you wake up
alright we've begun to my favorite music
of the month so I'm still really really
really really loving my spring 2016
playlist on Spotify I feel like I have a
lot of really good songs on there and
usually I have like one or two favorite
songs from my playlist and I put those
into those sound waves playlist but with
the spring playlist I really like like
10 songs like they're they're all really
good so I really can't like move all of
them into my special playlist I think
they're just all really good and I'll
keep them on the spring playlist until I
get sick of them but I guess if I had to
pick like a few that I really really
enjoy one is called New York City by the
chainsmokers I just really loved the
melody of that song another song that I
really loved I
reduce it to my boyfriend and he loves
it so much more tonight if you please
play on repeat right now is gallant
featuring seal weight in gold if you
guys don't know that song please listen
to that already I'll link the YouTube
video below where they're performing it
in a studio and seal is so cool he's
like mature he knows what he's doing and
gala is like a young guy he's so fresh
and his voice can go so high that's like
his specialty so a lot of soul in that
song it's a great song trust me you'll
love it also a bonus song that I really
am happy to have found this month is o
mio babbino Caro and it's the version
that's in the Charlie Brown what's it
called it's my birthday Charlie Brown I
think that's what it's called but I for
some reason I've known this song for a
long time because of the Charlie Brown
special and I watched that when I was a
little kid we had it on like a VHS tape
where I would watch it again and again
because I loved the song that means
saying and I always knew that melody in
my head and I would sing it and I didn't
know what the song was called so one day
I was singing it and I was like you know
I should just look this up online and
see if I could find it so I looked up
Charlie Brown
Mimi song and I found it it's called o
mio babbino Caro and it's an Italian
song from an opera maybe and I made I
listen to the opera version I have that
on my Spotify but in my heart the
version that's the best is the Charlie
Brown one it's just so sweet and so
beautiful and if you guys have not
watched that growing up it probably
doesn't mean anything to you but I think
it's a beautiful song I'll link that
below so you can check that out too so
that's it for my favorites this month I
had a lot of things that made me happy
and they were all events and intangible
things which i think is pretty awesome
because I don't care much about buying
too many things I'm just about like
experiences and resources things that
will help me grow or just bring me joy
lastly if you haven't heard I recently
launched a new podcast called the lab
and dare
lifestyle where I'll be uploading every
Sunday on iTunes in the podcast section
so if you go in iTunes the podcast and
you look up live in their lifestyle
you'll find it please subscribe and
check out my podcast it's actually a new
medium where I could share deeper
stories from my life and more life
lessons because it's like a 20 minute
segment so I feel like I could share a
lot more about myself in 20 minutes
versus like the shorter form on YouTube
so it's just different I think you'll
see different sides of me on YouTube my
blog and my podcast but I'm just really
excited to get this going and that's it
for today
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
