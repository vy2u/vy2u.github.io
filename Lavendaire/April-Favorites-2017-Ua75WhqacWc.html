so it's time for April favorites and I
could not believe how fast this month
passed by because I feel like it just
started and then boom boom boom week
after week and now we're the last week
of April and I don't know where the time
went
it's probably because I was very busy
socially like I had a lot of fun this
month a lot of things going on I started
off the month traveling I was in London
and then I went to Coachella the next
weekend and then the past weekend was my
friends like surprise birthday party
over the huge get-together where we
spent a night in Venice Beach which was
really nice and then I was not with a
theme park with my cousin so I just had
a lot of like social events this month
and it was really fun I decided not to
vlog my recent trips to London and
Amsterdam because I felt like lungs
didn't do too well on my channel and I
was focusing more on taking photos for
Instagram so if you want to catch up
with like my travels and what I've been
up to
definitely check out my Instagram I've
been posting at least a photo a day and
basically everything that's happened is
on there alright so onto the favorites
first favorite is when I was in London
honestly one of the highlights of my
trip was going to the Harry Potter
studios who are at Warner Brothers in
London and that is just such a cool
place you don't know how excited me my
friends were to go to this tour I don't
know we were just so giddy and
everything felt so magical when we were
there like you can spend hours there
because you know over like 10 or more
years of filming all those Harry Potter
movies they have collected a lot of
props and sets and just costumes makeup
drawings of like the architecture design
it just it's really really cool I feel
like even if you're not super into Harry
Potter you'll still enjoy this tour
because it just shows how much goes into
making a fantasy film and I think it's
like a dream job to like be a part of
something like that something so huge
and like magical you can really be as
creative as you want and I just love
really see the behind the scenes of
creative work I love looking at the set
designs and looking at the sketches of
things seeing it from how it went from A
to B because we see the movie on screen
but we don't realize how it was made in
all the little details and so I was
fascinated I loved it so so much and if
you're ever in London definitely
definitely make a stop at the Harry
Potter store
my next favorite are these press-on
nails by Empress tips so I discovered
press-on nails and and persist at the
same time when I was listening to the
beauty and the vlog podcast where she
was interviewing like the founder of
Empress tips and so I never even
realized that press-on nails are SP so
for me I've tried gel nails acrylic
nails and also just regular nail polish
but all of them have their cons that I
just don't enjoy I don't like one gel
and acrylic nails ruin your natural
nails and then with normal nail polish I
don't like how it ships like within 5
days or you can less so it's like I'm a
kind of girl that I'm kind of lazy I
want to do it once and not have to do it
for two or more weeks honestly that I
feel is like never having to think about
my nails and just having them look good
all the time but I guess every two weeks
is good so press-on nails
basically they're just nails that you
glue onto your nail and the glue does
not damage your nails so taking it off I
think you soak it in hot water and then
it just comes off so this is my first
time putting on press-on nails and the
first time I did it I don't think I used
enough glue so immediately after that
day like they started popping off one by
one and so the second time I put them
back on I added more glue and after I
did that they lasted I mean it's been
like a week and a half now so I think
they would last a week and a half to two
weeks tops if you take good care of them
and if you put enough glue but even if
they pop off like I don't mind I'll just
like put some more glue and pop it back
on plus the set comes with like a lot of
extra nails so if you lose a nail you
can always like put one back on that was
like me at Coachella like I would
during the day and at night I was just
like put on a new one so I don't know I
just really like them I especially like
that it's iridescent so we can't really
tell in this video that I took but in
this photo you can see how it's like so
many colors and it just looks so pretty
so I'm super excited that I discovered
press-on nails I think I'm going to be
wearing these indefinitely for as long
as I can and just keep trying new
designs
my next favorite has actually been a
favorite for like I would say three
months ish since I got this in January
so it's the jus air highlighter in
citrine and this is a powder highlighter
oh she's just so fit on my good anyway
I'm just super into highlighting I think
it's so fun to just have like a shiny
face and normally I have dry skin so I'm
not even the oily skin type so I don't
care if I look shiny and oily I like
that look I like this do we look so I've
been really enjoying this highlighter
wearing it every single day for like
three months and I'm so sad that
literally today I opened it and I
noticed that it was like broken so I did
my best to like have the powder back in
but as you can see it's not very pretty
but I love it and it's definitely
something I would repurchase which is
pretty rare for me for makeup items my
next favorite is my favorite sunscreen
that I am so happy to have discovered
from my friend Jean I've been using this
for a few months - I don't know if I
ever brought it up so since summers
around the corner I thought I'd bring it
up this is the Biore aqua rich watery
essence SPF it's SPF 50 and it's a
Japanese product that you can get on
Amazon so I ordered this on Amazon it
basically took a month to ship because
it had to come from Japan but I mean it
was free shipping I think anyway this is
the best SPF for your face because it's
so silky
it's like watery that it just goes on
really smoothly it's so light that you
don't notice it the thing with SPF for
me is that they're so
dick and I feel like after I put the SPF
on it's either really oily like my
makeup just doesn't go well on top of it
so this is like a very lightweight but
it's SPF 50 that you can put on your
face and then it feels like you have
nothing on and that's like the best part
I even wonder if it's really on my face
because it's so light I wonder if it
just like disappears or I don't know
this you never wonder if like SPF is
actually working or if it's like already
washed off like you've sweated it off
but you don't even know anyways
definitely worth a try if you're looking
for a lightweight watery SPF for your
face
my last favorite of the month is a
photographer that I discovered named
Joey Elle and you have to check out his
Instagram account joey Elcom I'll link
it all below I discovered this through
my friend and he has a channel called
photos in color and he had a video about
like top tech 15 or something inspiring
photographers of our time so he listed
all these different photographers and
their Instagram accounts and I checked
out all of them I definitely liked that
video if you know if you want to watch
it because you'll get so inspired by all
those different photographers I
literally spent like a whole hour or two
in the morning going through everyone's
Instagram just I don't know feeding
fueling my creative soul but my favorite
out of those photographers was Joey Elle
I spent like 30 minutes or even longer
on his account because each photo is one
you have to like sit on and his captions
are just so good it just tells the story
behind the photo it just adds so much
more to the photo I specially love his
photo series and when he was in Syria
documenting the Syrian war because just
it brings you to that place and the
photos that he chooses it just looks
beautiful yes it's so like powerful at
the same time there's a lot of emotion
and each of his work for example like
this is my favorite photo the one with
the kids playing on a destroyed Isis
cake
and that is just such a paradox right
it's just so interesting to put those
two subjects together but it makes that
story so powerful and to me it shows
like human resilience and human joy the
childlike innocence and joy intermixed
with the devastation of war and
destruction and fear and it's crazy I
thought that was so fascinating and so
beautiful and here's another one of my
favorites where he had a photo of this
guy and then just read the caption just
read it
so I'll definitely link Joey Elcom
Instagram plus his website because you
can spend a lot of time to sitting with
his work and really getting a lot from
it getting a lot of inspiration emotion
or thoughtfulness whatever it is it will
give you something because that's what
good art can do it's so powerful that it
moves you in a way that you can't
explain with words
alright that's it for my favorites this
month let me know what your favorites
were and especially if you have liked
music recommendations I am in dire need
of new music so send them my way if you
have good tunes any genre is cool
alright see you next time love you all
