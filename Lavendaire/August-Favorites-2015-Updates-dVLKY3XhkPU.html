favorites video this month has been
pretty lights I don't really have that
many new favorite things but I guess I
will make favorites videos also life
update videos talking about the general
things I did in the past month I'm gonna
start with music since I feel like a lot
of you guys like hearing my music
choices and you're listening to my
Spotify playlist so thank you for that
here are my two anthems of the past few
weeks
the first one is carly rae jepsen run
away with me the y2k remix first of all
I love the song I love the original it
gives me so much energy but this remix
like it's so fun to dance to in the car
I find myself replaying this over and
over and just like hearing the little
like beats and the tips and tricks that
y2k does is so fun especially during the
chorus it's just really amazing if you
really love that kind of like off beats
type of music corruption then listen to
it it's really fun the second song is
colors by Halsey this song is so good
and I know that it came from a poem the
house II wrote previously but when her
albums released and I heard the song I
recognized the lyrics from that poem but
putting it into a song made it sound so
much better
Halsey is so talented and the song has
just been on repeat it's a banger
alright my next favorite is this new
hair color you guys know I love hair I
love pastel hair I missed having lighter
hair so much I bleached my hair last
week and I was so scared to do it
because my hair was dyed dark and just
bleaching it would have killed it but I
waited I gave myself a couple months
before I would go light again so I did
and now it's finally the time I did it
so after playing with colored hair all
of these years I've realized that the
holy grail of getting muted
Ashi tones with semi-permanent dye is
using silver Pravana silver so what I
did with this color is I mixed half of
the tube of privada silver and I put a
few drops of the blue and violet I just
feel like myself again my next favorite
is the buttercream lipstick by bites
this is in the color marzipan so how you
say that word oh it's marzipan I just
got this and I'm wearing it right now
it's this brownish color for fall and
I'm really digging just like a brown or
tint just because I have relatively
darker olives ish skin and I don't know
I like how it looks I also love the
magnetic closure of this lipstick I
think by is probably my favorite
lipsticks around because it feels like
quality you know alright those are
basically my favorites from the past
month aside from my favorite things I
had some pretty cool experiences this
month you guys have probably seen my
Sedona vlog where I went to stay at the
Sedona maca retreat and I got to meet an
interview ill cheeley this past Sunday
was also the solar body health
conference in Pasadena in California so
I got to meet LG we again on Sunday and
we had dinner and a big group and I got
to talk to him off-camera he gave me
advice in my career and life and I feel
like we're connected now in a sense that
like he's part of my journey now and I'm
so grateful for that also throughout the
entire month of August I ran my
Kickstarter campaign for my short film
called picture Taipei and by the time
this video is posted it will probably
have just ended so we've reached our
goal last week which I'm so thankful for
and I'm just so relieved that it's over
so I just want to say thank you so much
to all of you guys who supported and
shared my Kickstarter I just love you
guys so much I'm so happy that it's a
successful project and now we're gonna
finish the film and you guys are gonna
see it
time also I just want to quickly
apologize for not being so on points
this month on YouTube I haven't been
uploading as consistently because I put
so much energy and time into creating
that artist of life trailer that it took
longer than I expected and it really
threw me off on my schedule so the past
couple weeks I've kind of been like a
little off with making videos also if
you guys got to see that artists of life
trailer I thought you'd like to know
behind the scenes on that video I
actually came up with the idea to make a
trailer like that
way back in February of this year so I
started writing it in February and I
just wanted it to be so good that I
wrote some scribbles and I would put it
away
and each week or so I would just like if
I had an idea pop into my mind a phrase
or something great then I would add it
to that document so I had this big
google dog of like five or six pages of
just words like spilling out my story
and over the months I finally told
myself last month hey you got to finish
it you got to put down a shoot date ask
someone to help you and just get it done
so that's what I did and it was a big
project it threw me off but I hope you
guys really liked it all right thank you
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
