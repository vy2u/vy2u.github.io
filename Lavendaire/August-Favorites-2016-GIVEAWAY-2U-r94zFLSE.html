favorites so I do have a giveaway to
share with you guys if you follow me on
Instagram then you'll already know about
it but if not you can check out my
Instagram right now or wait till the end
of the video where I share more details
so let's talk about August August was an
interesting month for me because a lot
of different things happen I feel like
there was a whole range of emotions so
the beginning was crazy and busy and
overwhelming in a good way because I was
doing that five days to minimalism
challenge which was really fun and I
also premiered picture Taipei which is
the short film I shot in Taiwan last
year I worked on that film for like two
years and we finally premiered it to
like a full theater in LA it was very
nerve-wracking but very fun in the end
and we also like screened it again this
past weekend so the more times I watch
it the more I'm getting used to seeing
myself on that screen and I mean I'll
talk about my thoughts in my upcoming
podcast coming out this Sunday so yes
the lavender lifestyle will be coming
back this Sunday I know that I stopped
doing the podcast for a couple weeks and
I skipped like one week of videos on
this channel and that's because like
literally the week right after the
minimalism challenge like family became
my number one priority just like my
grandma had a stroke and she was in a
coma for an entire week and then she
basically like slowly passed during that
week and every day like me my cousin's
all went to my grandma's house everyday
hanging out with her hanging out with
family just to be there with her for her
last days so I just totally did not want
to think about work I was like okay I'm
not gonna edit a video I'm just gonna go
to my grandma's house and hang out with
family so that's why I these past two
weeks have really been like a lot of
family time and I feel happy to to do
that and really break my schedule
consistency because normally I'm like so
rigid with my consistent schedule but
for ones like that's why I feel like I
was like go-go-go I was so focused in
the beginning of August and then that
happened and then my focus all shifted
towards like going out of slow
pace and being with family and taking
the time to like really I don't know
feel the love and feel life around me
I'll probably elaborate more in my
podcast on Sunday so if you're
interested in hearing like my thoughts
and what I'm going through what I'm
learning
feel free to tune in but today we're
gonna talk about my favorite things from
the month of August my first favorite is
a video that I think you guys should all
go watch right after you watch this
video it's marie forleo's interview with
tony robbins called what it takes to
have an extraordinary life so you
already know that i'm a huge fan of tony
robbins documentary I am NOT your guru
basically this is like marie forleo's
interview with tony talking about that
documentary but tony also shares like so
many new fresh lessons that he's
recently learned cuz I feel like Tony
Robbins he's motivational speaker he's
been doing this for decades and you know
he has all the foundations and the
basics set and we heard a lot of those
things before but the things he shares
in this video is like next level it's
kind of stuff that he's recently
learning which is really fresh for other
people to hear as well I mean one thing
I love about this interview is how Tony
talks about the art of fulfillment so
previously he's been focused on the
science of achievement and a lot of
people are focused on things like
productivity how to become successful
how to do it faster how to do it better
and that's more of a science and now
he's shifted and he sees the importance
of the art of fulfillment and I feel
like I that got me so excited because
I'm all about the art of of filaments
like finding a life that is fulfilling
and meaningful to you it's not a science
it's an art and it really comes from
your heart and your soul and your
intuition and so I thought that was
pretty exciting to hear and another
thing that I absolutely love like I kept
repeating that part over and over again
was how Tony talks about suffering how
suffering is not a necessary part of
life contrary to what most of us believe
so I'll break it down real quick he
separates like our emotional physical
mental states into like beautiful states
and
suffering states so beautiful states are
like when you're happy excited
passionate etc and then this their
suffering states and there's a huge
range a Kareem range from being just
like nervous anxious overwhelmed sad
angry depressed and like there's those
whole range so even the suffering that's
on the lighter end of the spectrum like
worrying or feeling overwhelmed or
feeling nervous that is still considered
suffering so for example like feeling
overwhelmed about your work that is
something that people are like oh it
happens to everyone it's normal Tony
Robbins is like no it's not normal it's
not necessary it's you don't have to
feel overwhelmed and all you have to do
is decide that you're not gonna suffer
choose not to suffer if this doesn't
make sense to you just watch the video
yourself because they probably do such a
better job at explaining it than I do
next another platform that I've really
like dove into and you guys know this
from last month's favorites is webtoons
so last month i talked about helios
Femina which was michelle fawns comic
and after i read that i mean it's on a
hiatus right now so i'm like oh my god i
want something else to read so I started
reading two other comics that I've
fallen in love with and they're like so
much better than Helios Femina they're
just more like encapsulated
encapsulating so the first one is called
sirens lament and it's really like one
of the most popular comments on webtoons
and it's about sirens aka mermaids and
it's I mean it's love and romance and if
you like reading anime or manga like
you'll love it and another one that I'm
reading is called untouchable and that
one's about vampires but it's not like
the typical vampires that like suck
blood and whatever basically it's about
this girl who is a modern-day vampire
and the way modern-day vampires are
instead of like taking humans blood they
just have to like touch humans to absorb
their energy and basically she's like
chasing this guy who tastes good this
human boy but that boy is like has OCD
and he
doesn't like to be touched and so it's
it's just really fun and entertaining so
I've been just like reading that at
night instead of like reading my usual
books but it's been a really nice break
and I have a lot of fun with it they
give me like a lot of feels and I don't
know I feel like it's a very interesting
type of feel that you get from reading
something like this versus like watching
a movie or watching something live my
next favorite is an audiobook and this
is my second audio book on audible that
one of you guys recommended to me so
thank you so much for recommending it
it's Sara Bareilles book called sounds
like me and I'm a huge fan of Sara
Bareilles like once I read that comment
that suggested it I was like I'm on it I
ordered it and I if you know about my
background I started singing on YouTube
in high school so one of my first songs
that I sang on piano was Sara Bareilles
love song and then I also covered
gravity and then I covered king of
anything her audiobook is broken down
into essays and each essay starts with a
song so in the audiobook she actually
sings to you the song and then she tells
you the story behind that song and I
love love love hearing like the
background of artists how they work and
the stories behind their work so I've
just really been enjoying this audio
book I listen to it when I Drive and
I've decided that with audible I'm only
gonna listen to audiobooks of like
memoirs or stories not self-help books
because with self-help books usually I
read them on my iBooks or Kindle and I
love to highlight and take notes and I
like to reread parts because I really
want to like engage with the content and
really absorb it really learn something
and I when I'm listening to an audiobook
it goes one way through and it's really
annoying to go back and rewind to listen
to things again and I can't take notes
while I'm driving and I miss things
because when I'm driving I usually have
GPS and when the GPS says something and
tells me where to go it like covers up
what the audio book is saying and so
that really bugs me so yeah only stories
and
more's for audiobooks and shameless plug
if you don't have audible and you want
to listen to this book you can sign up
for a free 30-day trial using audible
trial calm and air so sign up listen to
this book you can cancel it at any time
alright my next favorite is my absolute
favorite product of the month and if you
watched my last video do you feel pretty
that video has this product so it's the
lineage lips sleeping mask and I forgot
to mention in that video that this thing
smells like cherries it just smells so
good it's basically this lip mask it's
kind of think of like a thick thick lip
balm that you put on your lips before
you go to sleep and then you sleep with
it and when you wake up your lips are
like super soft next up I'm really
loving these honey products so I just
like honey in general and so when I got
sent these samples of honey products I
just like I've been using them everyday
and I love them so much so the first one
is the royal honey essence by skin food
and this is like a little honey serum
that you put on right after you do your
toner and the next one is called the
honey sleeping mask by re Tom I'm not
sure if I'm pronouncing that right at
all but it's basically a honey sleeping
mask that comes in this pouch and a
sleeping mask is kind of like the lip
mask it's something that you put on your
face right before you go to sleep and
then when you wake up you wash it off so
the point of a sleeping mask is to lock
in all of the other steps that you do
with your skincare so Korean skincare
has like so many steps you have like you
cleanse your face you have toner then
you put serum then you put a moisturizer
and then I guess you could put your
sleeping mask
sleeping mask comes on last so yeah this
honey sleeping mask literally smells and
almost feels like honey except it's more
gel like and it's not sticky like honey
but yeah it's really inspiring me to try
to like make actual skincare products
with honey by myself because I feel like
it's pretty doable yeah honey is like a
great product that's it for my favorites
for the month now let me talk about the
giveaway so this is like my
back-to-school giveaway where I'm giving
