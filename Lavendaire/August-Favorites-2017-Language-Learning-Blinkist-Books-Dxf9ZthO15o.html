it's Eileen so today I'm gonna share
some favorites from the month of August
but before I begin I have to say like
thank you guys I love you so much just
the response on my last video my life
update where I just shared how I'm doing
like honestly like all the comments were
so supportive so loving and I was just
like I don't know it blew me away just
because I just see that there's so much
good in the world so many beautiful
Souls like yourself I really appreciate
how understanding everyone is and I can
tell that so many of you come from a
place of compassion and it was just
amazing like I honestly feel like this
is the best community ever you guys are
so amazing so thank you thank you thank
you
alright so time for August favorites if
you saw my update you know how my August
was it was pretty eventful actually like
I had a weekend in Palm Springs with my
girlfriends it was my boyfriend's
birthday week we did so many things I
him to fly an airplane for the first
time like with a co-pilot
which was pretty cool and obviously I
got my hair done which was like a big
symbol for change so that was my August
so my first favorite is actually a
bundle of things it's all related to
language learning so I have some
language learning apps that I discovered
and that I really enjoy and especially a
podcast for learning Mandarin so I think
this whole language links thing got
jump-started because I started watching
terrace house aloha states which like if
you guys have seen my previous favorites
I was in love with the terrace house
Tokyo and yeah so I just had this urge
to like learn Japanese so I started
downloading all these learning Japanese
apps just because I want to learn at
least the basics so I could understand
what they're saying in the show and
learn as I go because I do want to like
go back and visit Japan and be able to
say common easy things so that's how I
got started
and obviously like I'm Chinese and I do
speak like basic Mandarin and Cantonese
but my Mandarin is like really really
rusty I don't get to use it that often
so it's always like a goal for me to
improve my Mandarin so I found this
podcast that I really really liked it's
called learn Mandarin now podcast and it
has like over 200 episodes each one is
like really short like 5 to 10 minutes
and I just started from the beginning
and just relearn the basics I like to go
through the basics really quickly
because even though I know most of these
words there are sometimes words that pop
up or like formal ways to say things
that I don't necessarily know how to say
so I felt like I wanted to go through
everything in the podcast I went through
like 40 episodes so far so yeah if you
guys are interested in learning Mandarin
i definitely recommend that podcast i'm
sure that it might be tougher if you're
not familiar with mandarin at all
because i don't know I feel like she
goes through things once so you might
have to like reapeat episodes again and
again to get it ingrained in your head
but for me so far like listening to an
episode once or twice is good it's like
a good refresher sometimes when there
are words that are completely new I do
have to listen to it a few times to get
it in my head and then I have to just
like I don't know I like listening to
the podcast and repeating after what she
says again and again I like learning
languages by listening versus learning
languages just by like apps and playing
games cuz I think it's so much I mean
for me I think it's more valuable to be
able to speak and listen to a language
versus like reading and writing a
language so I'm not too focused on
reading and writing I know how to like
spell things out on the alphabet like I
know how to text in Chinese and that's
yeah I don't need to learn how to write
it another reason why I'm like getting
into learning Chinese and I want to
continue practicing it is because I
don't know if you guys know but my dad
lives in
China he lives in Shanghai and I only
see him every few years so it's like I
want to see him I plan to visit sometime
in the next year and I want to be able
to communicate with him because his
English is not good and my Chinese is
not good and there's always that like
disconnect where I'm trying to express
myself but I say it in English and he
doesn't get the full meeting and
vice-versa so it's pretty tough so I
think I want to improve my Chinese to
the point where I can have like deep
conversations
in the language instead of like I'm
hungry I needed to go to the bathroom
like easy things my next favorite is an
app that I actually mentioned like years
ago I think like 2014 I made a video
sharing about the app and then I just
got on the app again it's called blinka
stand I know a lot of you out there will
love it it's basically an app that gives
you key insights of the world's top
best-selling non-fiction books so you
can get through like the main points of
a book by reading it or listening to it
in like 15 minutes
so it has like all these little blinks
as they call it and as you listen to a
book each blink is like two minutes tops
so it's like really digestible and it's
a great way to learn as you go because I
personally love listening to books now
versus reading I still enjoy reading I
just take too long to read and for
someone like me like I have a huge
reading list a lot of books that I want
to read but I read really slowly so it's
kind of frustrating like I want to be
able to get through all these books but
I can't really so with blinka I can
actually listen to all these books that
are on my reading list and then if
there's one that I think is particularly
interesting I want to find out more
about then I can pick up that book and
read it so it's like a really good way
to like preface all these topics and
decide what book you want to read so
here's my library of books that I've
saved that I want to listen to and I
haven't even finished adding all the
books that are on my list but things
that I've been listening to recently are
health-related books there's a book
called how not to die and another one
called eat to live and I've been
learning a lot about health through
those little blinks and it's been really
helpful to get through the blankets
because I know
that's the actual book like how not to
die my friend recommended it to me it's
like a Bible it's like really thick and
really dense so books like that I don't
really want to spend like a month trying
to get through it I'd rather just listen
to the short version the key insights on
plinkus if you're curious about bling
kiss I'll have a link down below where
you can get a free trial and you can get
20% off your yearly plan so make sure
you click that link on desktop because I
think it only works on desktop to start
your free trial don't download the app
before you click that link
my next favorite of August is the audio
book the power of vulnerability by
brené Brown and if you guys haven't
heard of burn a brown like look her up
she has an amazing TED talk about
vulnerability so the power of
vulnerability is actually not her
reading a book it's actually listening
to burn a brown give a lecture on
vulnerability and shame and just all the
components that make up a wholehearted
life it's what she calls it so basically
her point of the book is you can't live
a full meaningful life without being
vulnerable vulnerability is such an
important part of being human and so
many times like a lot of us have a wall
up we have some sort of filter we're too
scared to show our true selves but once
you are able to open yourself up and be
vulnerable then you step into the space
where you allow yourself to be like 100%
who you truly are and it's really
powerful so it's a pretty long audio
book I think it's like over 6 hours but
she goes through like all these
different aspects and I think as you're
listening to it you can start to
incorporate those things into your life
I guess you can say that listening to
that book encouraged me to be more
authentic and vulnerable in my work
which is why I uploaded that life update
video because I think normally I
wouldn't post something like that it's
just like listening to that book
definitely influenced me even without me
realizing it until now but yeah and then
I'm just gonna drop in this other
favorite that is just a new audio book I
started listening to I know guys I'm
sharing a lot of books and audio tape
related things this month but I've
started listening to Kevin Hart's
it's called I can't make this up life
lessons and Kevin Hart just always makes
me laugh like I like blurt out laughing
listening to his stuff like it's just so
he's he's vulnerable but he does it in a
funny real way and it's I don't know I
look up to him so much and I definitely
like see the similarities between Kevin
Hart's upbringing and Trevor Noah's
upbringing because you guys know that I
loved Trevor Noah's like memoir his
audio book if you like to laugh and if
you like to hear real life lessons from
people who are successful like
definitely listen to Kevin Hart's um
audiobook I only started it like a
couple of days ago but I am loving it so
much so far so I had to just drop it in
alright that's it for my favorites for
August I know it was really centered
around books and learning but that's
just what I was into this month so I
hope you find something that will bring
value to your life so now I do want to
ask you guys if you have any questions
for me I plan on doing a Q&amp;amp;A type video
but more of like um if you were to have
a coffee date with me what would you ask
me what kind of things would you want to
know like just tweet me your questions
at lab and dare actually I think it will
be even cooler if you could send me a
voice memo of yourself asking the
question so just ask the question send
it in like an audio file you can record
it with your phone pretty easily and
then I'll have a link down below to a
Google Drive folder or you could upload
that audio okay we'll try that for now
if it doesn't work uploading then you
can email us at Kerr at lab and dare
calm and then we'll try to work it out
but hopefully you'll be able to upload
the audio file into the folder so then
it actually feels like I'm actually
talking to you we'll see how that goes
but if you have any questions record
them send them to me and yeah we'll see
how it goes alright have a beautiful day
love you all so so much and continue of
being lights in the world alright bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
