rut where I felt like my life lost a
little bit of light and I was lacking
inspiration so I'm proud to say that I
am over that hill but you know what it's
totally normal it happens to everyone we
kind of stumble off the path here and
there so today I wanted to share just
some different ways to find inspiration
so if you're feeling a little uninspired
hopefully one of these tips can help you
first thing you need to try is list all
the things you love to do so there are
things that make you light up things
that you're passionate about things that
make you come alive so make a list of
all of those things that you've done in
your past that have made you feel
amazing and then after you're done with
your list pick a few things and start
doing them so whether it's playing piano
doing yoga
playing guitar cooking hiking whatever
make sure you get in touch with the
inner child in you everybody has an
inner child that likes to play and once
you tap into that then you'll start to
feel more playful and inspired in life
another thing you can do is explore a
hobby that you've always been curious
about or go learn something new I
absolutely love learning so sometimes
when I'm in a rut
I just find myself exploring YouTube
reading articles watching documentaries
just diving deep and seeing what sparks
my curiosity is and just learning I just
love to learn and in learning you might
find some inspiration there next I
recommend you go out in nature and just
spend some quiet time alone maybe you've
just been on this hamster wheel and you
need to get your mind off of this crazy
cycle and just take some time to breathe
meditate listen to the sounds of the
ocean or the trees or the birds whatever
it is get back in touch with nature and
your soul next you can listen to
podcasts or audiobooks to find some
inspiration I love listening to podcasts
or audiobooks while I'm taking a walk
outside so
kind of killing two birds with one stone
getting exercise but also feeding my
mind and my soul with some good stuff
so I'll with some of my favorite most
inspiring podcasts in the description
below I don't know about you but I love
music I get so inspired when I find new
songs that are just so amazing beautiful
that take me to another place when
you're feeling uninspired this is
actually one of the best times to just
do something out of your comfort zone so
travel do something different do
something that scares you because only
when you push those boundaries of your
comfort zone you actually kind of give
yourself a new energy in life you feel
revitalized and you kind of feel scared
but excited at the same time and it's in
those moments where you grow the most
another thing that I highly recommend is
to go out and talk to people just talk
to your friends talk to strangers
talk to people that you've lost touch
with this is the best time to just make
those connections just listen to another
human being story get to know someone
else learn someone else's perspective
you'll definitely find some inspiration
in other people another thing that I
love to do is journal you guys know I'm
all about journaling I have so many
videos on journaling but it's really the
way that I talk to myself it's the way
that I work through whatever inner
issues I have going on so usually when
I'm feeling uninspired in a rut or any
other emotion i journal it out and then
I get to the core of why it might be I'm
feeling that way so journaling is a very
very powerful tool to get to know
yourself uncover what's really true in
you lastly you can also collect and seek
out inspiration for yourself so go on
Pinterest start grabbing images that
inspire you quotes that inspire you find
people who inspire you collect it all
put it on your Pinterest or put it on a
vision board just because the more you
go out and seek it the more you're going
to bring that energy
to you it might not happen immediately
but focusing your mind on the things
that get you inspired will bring some
new energy into your life and my final
piece of advice is to just relax be
patience go with the flow because you
can't force inspiration to happen it's
just something that happens when you
don't even try so you can do all of
these things to kind of enhance the
possibilities of getting inspired but at
the end of the day life happens the way
it happens and you have to be okay with
its ups and downs it's totally normal to
have high points and low points if life
didn't have its ups and downs it would
be boring it wouldn't be worth it so
just stay on your path don't give up and
you'll be okay you'll always be okay
alright that's it for the video
love you all thank you so so much for
watching make sure you follow me on
Instagram because I share a lot during
the week I share a lot of stories and
good photos so I'll see you guys there
