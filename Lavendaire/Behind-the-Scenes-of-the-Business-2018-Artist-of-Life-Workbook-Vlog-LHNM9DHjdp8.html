Eileen so you probably know that I've
created something called the artist of
life workbook I've talked about it so
much on this channel hopefully you know
about it
so today I wanted to share the vlog of
my journey to creating and shipping and
getting this workbook out I just want to
show like the behind the scenes of the
business side of things
and I was just gonna make this like a
normal vlog but I realized I have a lot
of like holes in my vlogs because I'm
not good at thinking to vlog sometimes
so I thought it'd be better if I just
narrate it like this so I actually
launched the artist of life workbook for
the first time in November 2016
in November or December and it launched
as a digital PDF workbook that was it
and I got a lot of people asking for a
print version so I scrambled and I made
a very small sample size of print
workbooks for the 2017 artist of life
workbook so that version will hold a
very special place in my heart because
it was the time that I took like a big
leap anyway that first print workbook
was kind of an afterthought like I
didn't put so much effort or planning
ahead in creating that so it just came
out really really last minute like
delivered in like late January or
February of 2017
so for 2018 s version of the workbook I
was like okay this year I've done it
before I know how to do it better this
time I'm gonna start a lot earlier and
so after gathering feedback around
August was when I started to actively
work on the next version of the workbook
so in August that's when I went shopping
for journals that I liked found like the
colors that I liked the materials that I
liked the papers that I liked and I sent
that to my manufacturer but yeah in like
August and September I was really
working on like completely redesigning
the workbook just making it a lot better
than it was last year and designing it
in color because the first version was
just black and white so the second
version was like prettier
exercises were more refined I added more
so yeah I was really proud of my design
for that one so fast forward a little
bit I finally get the first sample of
the artist of life workbook and
immediately upon like seeing that first
sample I was like oh my god the cover is
so bad because the font was too small it
was aligned to the sides but I realized
that with books you have to align it to
the fold so I had to just redo the front
design and in the book I think I just
found a couple typos and fixed that for
the next versions I also did love the
material from the first sample so I
asked them to give me some other options
of materials so then I waited a few
weeks maybe like a month for the second
sample to arrive and the second samples
they I don't know why they sent me so
much maybe it's because so you have to
pay like $600 each time you get a sample
made just because they have to like they
have to recreate that mold for the gold
foiling of the cover I don't know it's
just basically an expensive process but
I was like I have to see a sample before
I you know pick the final product so
they created all these samples and I
have a lot of extra covers by the way if
you guys want one for some apparent
reason let me know I could send some to
you so here's the point where I was
sorting through the second round of
samples I'm kind of confused why they
sent me so many different covers oh I
feel about this right now it's too thick
so this is before I thought it was a
little too small and it's not like the
boss so I made it bigger but I think I
made it too big
it's kind of hard to catch upon seeing
the second round of samples I realized
that I made the font a little too big it
just looked too overwhelming on the
cover at this point in time we were
cutting it real close there was no time
to have another round of samples made
sent to me and then me to decide yes or
no if I like that sample then go into
final production so I just basically
shrunk the design of the font a little
bit so it was like bigger font than the
first sample smaller font than the
second sample I just hope that the happy
medium would be
perfect so I had like a small version a
big version and then I was like okay
hopefully the next version will work and
I didn't have time to see it before it
was printed I was just like let's just
hope this goes well so that third cover
design was the final version that you
see on all of your artists of life
workbooks so at this point I have these
samples that I'm supposed to shoot with
to promote the artists of life workbook
because if I were to wait for the final
version of the artist of life workbook
to be done and sent to me I would have
had to wait until Christmas and there
was no way I was gonna wait till
Christmas to get the books then take
photos and then sell it because it was
too late it was already New Year's so I
was cutting it real close so I had to
have a photo shoot with the sample
workbooks I don't know if you guys
noticed but the photos and videos
promoting the workbook that I shot with
Karen the cover design is actually
slightly bigger than the actual version
of the artist of life workbook and the
reason was because we had no time to
wait for the final one to be made we
just had to shoot with something so you
could imagine me at this point like I'm
super nervous I'm super frustrated and I
was just very not confident in my
product I'm like I don't think it looks
good I don't think it just doesn't meet
my standards of like how good I want it
to be but I already booked a dates for
the photo shoot with Karen and I was
like I'm just gonna show up with these
books and see what we can do and luckily
like honestly I'm saved by Karen Rosalee
because she made the workbooks look so
good she is like a flat lay Queen and
everything about her aesthetic is soft
dreamy beautiful girly feminine floral
like everything that I love and so I
feel like thanks to Karen she brought my
workbook to life like she really brought
my vision to life she went above and
beyond anything that I could have
expected of the workbook and honestly
guys the highlight of this whole
workbook journey was that day having a
photo shoot with Karen because we're
just too creative friends working
together like getting excited about
creating pretty things together and that
was so fun also because for me and
oh this is not the final version like
it's not gonna look right and then
Karen's like girl I know how to do
Photoshop I can make it smaller if you
want and so I'm like oh my god I forgot
that you could Photoshop photos and
Karen is like a whiz Photoshop I'm used
to like videos and in videos you can't
really like change images like what you
see is what you get in a video but with
Photoshop thankfully you can like edit
things so it let me show you this photo
right here where there's like three
workbooks the workbook numbers are
actually photoshopped they were
essentially different sample types and
we just made it look like the the one
sample that was the best-looking sample
after the photo shoot I was literally
like high on life I was so excited I was
so happy and like a few days after that
I was working on creating the pages for
my shop so I stayed up all night to like
wrap things up finish everything make
sure it looks good so it's about 1215
a.m. right now and I'd literally spend
the entire day working on my website
working on like the product pages for
the digital work book print work book
and the mastermind and I didn't realize
that it would take me this long it took
me like all day basically went in my
head I was like I could do it in like
three or four hours so I wanted to do my
launch today but I mean it's way past
the time that I wanted to lunch
and you know what it's okay because now
that it's night it's kind of this like
quiet time where I feel like I can
breathe again like this whole day I was
just been like you know stuck on my
computer but uh I just wanted to capture
this moment because I don't know I'm
just excited cuz it turned out so pretty
okay maybe I don't have the energy to do
like a lively vlog right now because
I've just been like zoned in and then I
launched it in the morning and then I
went to bed and then when I woke up and
I wish I've logged this but I was too in
a nightmare state to vlog it but when I
woke up like my website basically was
down everything crashed like once I sent
that like first email blast to the
soft-launched people my website was
maybe up for like three or four hours
for it crashed because of like the
traffic and who knows what so yeah after
launching my site people were trying to
buy the workbook and yet it continually
was crashing and you guys who were there
experiencing it you get it it was
frustrating for everybody okay and I
wish that no one had to deal with things
like that but technical issues are a
part of reality and so like I spent like
a whole week with like two different web
developers and like working with tech
support with my hosting provider boring
boring background stuff okay brushing
over that whole chaotic scenario I have
a friend named Lynette who was
organizing an event called a vision
board soiree where she was bringing like
a few influencer friends there to make
vision boards and she asked me like hey
Eileen can i buy some of your workbooks
or promote some of your workbooks to the
influencers there at that event and I
was like oh my god yes so because the
workbook was still in production at that
point I basically paid extra to tell
them to just like finish the first 40
workbooks and heirship it to me like
ASAP so I can make it in time for this
event okay unboxing this for the first
time this is the final workbook
okay here's the final product the final
workbook opening it for the first day
all right
binding looks good colors pretty good
so the event was a success and it was so
nice to see people like hold my workbook
in their hands and look at it and say
like wow this looks so pretty this looks
high-quality like it just felt so
amazing it was definitely like I felt
like I won that day you know like I
accomplished something and I was really
proud of myself so today I'm back at the
office I'm wrapping the influencer
workbook so I ordered like a special
batch to send to like my influence or
friends and stuff
by the way on over there we're dealing
with a shipping problem so right now
there's a problem like connecting my
website orders with their shipping
software and so I guess it's a good
thing that we didn't get the workbooks
today because then I'd be even more
anxious that we have the works books but
can't ship them yet because of this
issue so we got to work on this issue
it's already like 5:00 p.m. and it's
like Christmas basically so yeah working
overtime so after that events was
waiting for the actual actual shipment
of the workbook so that I could prepare
to like send them out to you guys
ASAP keep in mind that this was like a
week before Christmas where we were
expecting to receive the workbooks to
ship out and I'm just gonna let the
videos speak for themselves yeah I'm
back at the office for the third day in
a row and we're expecting the workbooks
to come today I know like basically the
plane was delayed three times and it is
the week of the holidays so I know what
I've learned this week is shipping can
be really unreliable like they'll tell
you it they told you it was gonna come
Monday and then they said it would come
Wednesday and now it's Friday and the
guy says he's stuck at the airport and
he's gonna come here by 6 or 7 p.m. and
it's Friday before Christmas so the good
news is we did figure out the issue on
why my website wasn't connecting with
their shipping software so I don't know
I feel like every step of the way there
was like a problem or something goes
wrong and then you have to figure out
how to fix it and you just deal with it
and that's life that's business by the
way my brother's here so I picked him up
from the airport yesterday and he came
with me he was a great hey so we got a
call from them saying the shipment will
come at 10 p.m. today so we're just
gonna just wait till tomorrow to do
everything because no one's gonna be
packing orders at 10 p.m. here but it's
fine
I think the workbooks are gonna go out
whatever they're meant to go out and
there's not much that I can do at this
point except wait and then tomorrow
morning which is Saturday the Saturday
before Christmas I'm gonna come here
with my boyfriend and we're both gonna
work on shipping these workbooks
hopefully I can find people to help
so holiday season equals a ton of delays
and it's not that I didn't expect it
it's that like I started earlier but
because of all the mistakes and errors
with the samples I think I really just
like pushed it to the limit just because
I wanted the cover to look so good and
so what happened was in one week our air
shipment got delayed three times so what
happens is like you're supposed to send
something on the plane
but another company a bigger company
like Apple who's trying to sell iPhones
during the holidays as well they take up
all the space and so your small shipment
gets pushed back to the next plane earth
on the next day and this happened three
times where we got pushed back and back
because I'm sure a ton of other much
bigger companies have much more
important products to sell during
Christmas but yeah so that happened and
Saturday morning was the time we finally
got the work books arrived at the office
and Saturday is a difficult day because
the post office closes early around like
1 or 2 p.m. so that morning I asked my
mom and my brother to come to the office
to help me package as many work books as
we could so we did our best we might
have finished like 3 to 400 work books
packaged them and then delivered them to
the post office just before it closed so
that was the Saturday before Christmas
more boxes in the trunk
and the boxes in the back seat at the
post office we just finished unloading
all of these boxes
that is the truck the last truck of
today to ship them out so we made it
don't many work books as we could
Merry Christmas is actually Christmas
and we weren't planning to come in today
but Wilson wanted to come in to do some
work for just a couple hours so I came
with him so I could just package
somewhere have focus by myself so after
Christmas people came back to work so we
finally got help on packaging and
shipping the work books at that point we
were pushed back because of the delays
we were just doing our very best to
catch up but it was just a chaotic few
weeks just shipping out that like first
huge chunk of work books as you can
imagine we had to deal with a lot of
angry customers and I felt really bad
that I couldn't deliver early before
Christmas or just like as expected and
so it was just a whirlwind because we
definitely like didn't expect so many
work book orders I there was one time
where one customer email was so like
long personal and hurtful that I
genuinely felt really really really bad
and really disappointed in myself that I
just I mean I'll just show you a few
clips today I got like the angriest
angriest customer email saying that it's
unacceptable all these shipping delays
and it's supposed to be a new year
workbook but it shipped after New Year's
and basically I think what really sucks
is like the person was genuinely hurt
and said that it looks horrible on lab
there's part in my part it's bad PR
which I understand yes at the socks what
customers are mad at you and yes I
personally feel bad but it's I'm trying
to be as perfect as I can but when
you're just starting out and when you're
just learning you're not gonna be
perfect and you shouldn't let that scare
you from trying because you have this is
what I've said before and I'll say it
again you have to be willing to suck you
have to be willing to suck in the
beginning if you're starting out as a
business owner you you kind of have to
take this you have to be willing to
make mistakes in order to learn from
them and I've made a lot of mistakes
this year and I've learned a lot I've
learned that I have to start a lot lot
earlier in planning this workbook shout
out to Justin and Alice who have been
helping us work on these orders from the
fulfilling side and the customer service
side it's been a whirlwind and it's not
easy guys
but I'm definitely thankful because my
problem is a good problem we had many
more orders than I ever ever predicted
let me tell you guys this is a long rant
but my original order of workbooks this
was 500 I thought I did I wasn't even
sure if I could sell 500 and then right
before I started selling it my
confidence got boosted and I was like I
think I could sell a thousand so I made
an order of one thousand pieces and one
I lodged I think about like 200 or 300
people bought it in one day and then I
think it was during those first couple
days after launch when I'm like oh my
god I might need more than a thousand so
I ordered another thousand and that's
why these shipments came like separately
and then somewhere along down the line I
was like oh my god I don't think 2000 is
enough so I had to order another
thousand and guys when I set my goals
for the workbook this year
my biggest goal like my minimum goal was
I want to sell 200 workbooks and my
biggest goal my reach goal was I want to
sell 800 workbooks and we've sold over
2000 so it's like I didn't expect this
it's definitely like I'm so grateful
that it's above and beyond everything I
expected but with that success comes a
lot of problems and issues and just with
a greater number of customers you have a
greater number of angry customers a
greater number of like problems coming
up so
even if someone hates me it's part of my
learning and it's part of my growth the
failure is part of my journey
it can make you teeter-totter when you
get messages like this because on one
hand you know that you have to keep
going no matter what
on the other hand when people like are
so upset because you want to cry and
give up because on the insecure side it
makes you feel like should I even try
but on the bright side obviously people
want to keep buying this thing so you're
gonna have to learn how to give it to
them but can you really feel I feel bad
so the customers who expected better of
me because I if it weren't my ideal
world obviously I tried to do everything
like perfect I want everything to be
high-quality all my content on my videos
so delivery the customer service I want
everything to be high-quality yes that's
what everyone strives to be everyone
strives to be high-quality but I think
you just have to learn to be okay with
sucking and be okay with the the
transition of the journey and the in the
middle part learning how to get there
and even though sometimes you want to
give up you just have to suck it up you
just do it anyway even before hate you
in the end this whole experience was a
whirlwind there were highs there were
lows there were a lot of things that
were unexpected and I definitely learned
a lot and I'm learning how to better
manage like a large amount of orders and
hire people to help with like customer
service and shipping all the stuff that
is completely new to me so I'm learning
and it's a process but at the end of the
day I'm super proud of what I've created
and my favorite part really is the
creating part and the photo shoot like
creating something beautiful creating
something that can actually help people
in their lives and I'm I'm really
grateful and proud to say that I've
created something that adds value
because I truly believe in my work book
I truly believe in the mastermind
program and that it really genuinely
helps people's lives and that's the best
part of it the best part is at the end
of the day
I believe in this product and I'm so
proud sometimes I can't believe that I
made this thing like it was hard I
procrastinated it took a lot of like
just over years of learning these
exercises putting it all together making
it look good so much of creating a
product is just like incremental steps
of improvement so yeah I don't know it's
a journey and I'm grateful to be here
and I hope that this sheds some light on
the behind the scenes of starting a
business running some an online business
selling something there's a lot that you
don't see on social media even though it
might look really pretty on the outside
it might be like a completely different
story on the other side so I mean what I
want to tell you guys is just to be
empathetic to everybody who's trying to
do something anyone who's making an
effort to do something they're trying
their best so be empathetic about that
don't put people down don't judge others
because when you do that it just makes
people want to quit or it's just putting
negative vibes out there so so just be
more thoughtful be more compassionate
and empathetic and this is how I see
other people too like now I'm a lot more
forgiving to businesses and I'm a lot
more forgiving to just people in general
because I realize that everyone's doing
their best and it's things are not easy
you you learn as you go that's just life
so I hope you enjoyed this if you have
any questions let me know in the
comments below and I'll do my best to
answer them in some future videos and
stuff but yeah check out the artist of
life workbook if you haven't already
love you all so much and I'll see you
next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
