to be more engaged in the present moment
I feel like being fully present is
something that we all too often forget
to do we often drift off into either the
past or the future contemplating our
past or being anxious and impatient
about what the future holds we also
enjoy getting distracted by technology
and social media I mean how many times
have you been out to dinner where
everyone is on their phones it's like
we're here but not really our bodies are
here but our minds are elsewhere let us
remember how much the present matters
it's the only moment we have control
over the only moment we can shape
through our immediate actions and
choices the past is dead and the future
is yet to be born but the presence is
alive and it deserves our full attention
more and more I'm trying to fully live
in the present to make sure that I'm
engaged and giving myself 100% to the
people I'm with the places I'm in or the
situation at hand this has really helped
me appreciate my surroundings and who
I'm with rather than being on my phone
or thinking about something other than
the now
and tell myself this moment is the most
important because I actually have
control over what happens here depending
on the actions I take or choices I make
I can choose to soak in this moment and
enjoy it fully or to do something in
this moment that takes me forward and
makes me better I can shape my life
starting with this exact moment in time
and that is so empowering so instead of
focusing elsewhere
give yourself to the present appreciate
what's in front of you and make the most
out of what you can be alive vibrant and
well most importantly have fun thank you
so much for watching I love you guys and
I'll see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
