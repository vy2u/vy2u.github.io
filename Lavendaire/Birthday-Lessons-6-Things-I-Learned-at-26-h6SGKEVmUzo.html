soon so today I just wanted to do a
casual video sharing the biggest lessons
I've learned this year so this was a
pretty big year for me I'm currently 26
turning 27 I know it sounds old going
into my late 20s but this year has
really been the year where a lot of my
dreams are like real like it's just kind
of crazy when I look back at the journal
entries I wrote in 2012-2013 I wished
for all of these things and a lot of
them have come true like I wanted to
create meaningful content I wanted to
have a successful business I wanted to
inspire people or create some positive
impact on the world which I am so
grateful to do now and just I don't know
I feel like each year I'm getting closer
and closer and closer to creating my
dream life and this has been the
transition period where I feel like I'm
going more pro so I think in the
beginning you feel like an amateur
you're figuring things out I'm
constantly learning constantly pushing
myself and I always want to do things
the pro way and I want to act like I'm a
pro so I'm actually like pushing myself
towards that and as you can see like
this is new this is basically my present
to myself a new computer because having
like a desktop for the first time is
like it was part of my dream setup and
since this has been the year where
financially I can say that I'm doing
well and I'm very thankful for that I'm
like I can finally afford my dream setup
like I can start building what my dream
looks like in my environment with the
things I have around me so yeah growing
up all right
so let's jump into the biggest lessons
I've learned this year number one you
are in control of the way you feel so
lately I've been feeling more
light-hearted more joyful and not taking
life so seriously and I think that
that's something that comes with age as
you realize that things are not as
important as you think they are life is
kind of like a game
it should be fun even though there are
challenges and obstacles that come along
the way like I think ultimately my goal
in life is to have fun honestly my
purpose statement is be kind have fun
create beautiful and meaningful things
so I've been learning to be more light
in everyday life and if something
doesn't go my way I learned to kind of
like shrug it off laugh about it and
then try to see like the situation from
another angle like what's funny about
this or what good came out of this
negative situation so you can always be
in control of the way you feel it's all
about becoming aware of like hey if I'm
feeling sad like I can change that I can
tell my mind to switch it and I know
it's not easy at first I think when
you're starting out it's hard to get out
of like whatever emotions you're in but
I think I've gotten to a point where I
can learn to like be present and snap
myself out of different emotions quicker
number two always start with gratitude
and appreciation so this applies to your
day start with gratitude and end with
gratitude and more specifically I put
this quote on my notes whenever I do a
podcast interview so this year I've done
a lot of interviews for my podcast and
it got to a point where sometimes I
would get tired I'd be like I have to
record another interview or like I just
kind of dreaded it because of like just
the social anxiety or I was lazy for
whatever reason I just wasn't looking
forward to doing some of them and I was
like what the heck like why am I so
ungrateful you know these people are
giving me their value and their precious
time and it's worth a lot so it's kind
of disrespectful for me to not be
excited about recording this interview
with someone so I always tell myself
like I have to start every meeting or
every interview with gratitude and
appreciation so before I do any meeting
before I do any interview I'm like okay
start with the gratitude and the
appreciation like I'm so thankful that
this person took the time out of their
day to meet with me to chat with me and
I value their time I value them as a
person
and it changes your mindset changes the
way that you feel the changes the way
that you think and I think more value
comes out of starting with that
gratitude and appreciation number three
money is just a tool and it's something
that makes you more of who you are so I
was inspired by the book you are a
badass at making money by Jensen chair
oh I listen to the audiobook and it
really reshaped my thinking around money
so to be honest guys in my first few
years like after college and starting
this YouTube channel I didn't have that
positive relationship with money I
always said things like oh I don't want
to make money I just want to help people
or I don't care about making money I
want to make art and I saw it as like
mutually exclusive and in reality like
money makes you more of who you are
money is just a tool so money doesn't
have this like negative connotation
because I think a lot of us are raised
with this belief that money equals greed
or money is evil and I certainly like
had a little bit of those thoughts as
well just naturally ingrained in me and
for me it was like you choose money or
you choose art and now I realized that
it can be one in the same and having
more money and more resources will allow
you to create more of what you want to
create like you'll have more resources
to create higher-quality art and you
have more resources to do whatever it is
you want to do so when I say like money
makes you more of who you are if you are
a stingy or a greedy person no matter
how much money you'll make you're still
gonna be a stingy and greedy person and
if you're a generous and kind person
then more money will allow you to be
more generous and more kind so that kind
of like changed my mindset and I think
this was the year where I really started
attracting more money to myself and my
business because previously I think I
probably like blocked money from coming
in I was struggling and this is a year
where I just started allowing money to
come into my life and not judge this
transaction just see money as a tool as
a resource for me to do more good
the world number for you can always
continue pushing yourself outside of
your comfort zone so it's something that
I have to constantly remind myself like
continue to be outside of the comfort
zone continue to get uncomfortable
because that's how you grow this is not
something new that I've learned this
year but what I've realized as I get
older is that it never gets easier like
you just keep pushing and you keep
pushing and what you do is you grow your
comfort zone because before you were
comfortable with this and then you
pushed it a little bit and then you're
like okay this is comfortable now and
then you push it even more and push it
even more and that is life isn't that so
what I've learned is that you have to
keep pushing it's always gonna be
uncomfortable there's always the fear
there's always resistance when doing
something new but that's what makes life
worth it you know that's what makes you
accomplish such crazy big amazing things
is when you push yourself that far so
I'm looking forward to continue like
making myself feel uncomfortable even
though it's just like mmm I'd want
sometimes you just want life to be easy
but if you really want to do something
amazing like it's not gonna be easy
you're gonna have to push yourself
another thing I learned this year was
how important self-care is and how
important it is to make space a lot of
space for yourself so I now know that I
need to make time for things like
morning pages meditating exercising and
in my ideal life
I don't really ask for so much all I
asked for is to do something that's
positively impacting people make money
doing what I love and have enough free
time have enough space to give back to
myself just to do the little things that
I enjoy doing so a lot of this year was
just understanding how important
self-care is and how I don't really need
that much to be happy I just need like a
free day some hours to give to myself so
that I could tidy up my space because I
feel like a mess when my space is not
tidy I feel like a mess when I have like
a lot of clothes that are unfolded so
time to do that time to journal time to
meditate time to do yoga and exercise
maybe some extra time to just like sing
walk around dance around the house just
because that's the stuff that makes me
happy so know the things that make you
happy and the things that make you feel
nurtured and taken care of and make that
space to do it make it like non
negotiable it's super important for your
well-being your mental health like
understanding that the hustle is not
that important not as important as your
well-being honestly I could go on and on
about lessons that I've learned but I
want to keep this short so I'll give one
more and this is something that came up
recently because of all the tragic
events happening in our world so is to
understand that there is both dark and
light in the world and except that they
both exist but no matter what learning
to stay with the light learning to be
the positive example through not just
your words but your actions I think it's
so important to stay focused on seeing
the love in the world stay focused on
being a living example of love because
that is the only way that you're going
to influence the people around you
that's the only way you're gonna spread
that love to your community and the
world really needs more love honestly
this is something that it's not
something I learned this year but it's
something that I've been reminded of
more because when tragic things happen
in the world where when you see bad
things happen to good people it can be
really easy to live in fear it's easy to
put up a wall and be like I hate people
or I don't want to be part of this
society it's easy to do that but you
really have to step up see beyond that
stay in the light stay in love and just
do your best you know we're just one
person but if everybody can be a living
example of love that makes a huge
difference so I understand that I can
only control myself so that I'm just
trying to be my best version of an
example of love and I hope that through
this platform I could encourage other
people to stay in the light not turn to
fear or hate or judgments but stay
loving
just believe in the human race and do
whatever you can to make a positive
impact on the world around you all right
I'll leave it at that
thanks so much for watching and being
here with me today
sending you lots of love and comment
below with whatever you're excited about
right now I'd love to know what you're
up to and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
