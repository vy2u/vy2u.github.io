want to share a quick little story about
a revelation I had when I went to the
gym and glasses for the first time so
what happened was I ran out of contacts
and so for a few days I had to just wear
my glasses as I waited for some new
contacts to ship in and this is not a
story about me being self-conscious in
my glasses I love my glasses and I wear
them all the time but this is more about
the experience of running and exercising
blind because I hate to run in glasses
it jumps and it fogs up and my eyesight
is pretty bad so it's a negative 4.5 or
450 I really can't see anything
everything's blurry except for
whatever's like this close to my face
anyway what I noticed as I was running
on the treadmill with a blurry world
around me I felt different I felt more
like in the zone of myself so normally
as I'm running I'm listening to music
and I'm fully aware of everything around
me and I guess I kind of drift off my
eyes will like look at the TVs and see
what other people are doing this time I
noticed that I just got so into my run I
got so into my music and I was like
dancing and singing if you can see me at
the gym I'm the crazy girl with the
headphones blasting and I'm like lip
syncing and doing dance moves as I'm
running because I'm having so much fun
so that was me I felt like I could turn
me on because the world was like turned
down
so everything was muted and I really
didn't care about how I looked because I
couldn't see other people's faces I
couldn't see anything really in the
world and I felt like I was in my own
zone so that was kind of like an aha
moment that I had as I was running I was
just able to express myself more freely
because I was not aware of what was
around me so actually the first video I
made for lavender was how to stop caring
about
other people think of you and I still
think that's such an important topic
that's like a foundation on how to be
yourself how to be original and how to
express your true self in this world you
really have to stop caring about what
other people think of you to be able to
turn your inner self on so for me I
noticed that when I can't see people
around me when I can't feel the real
world around me then I'm able to tap
into my true self and just express
myself in a bigger way I noticed this
when I perform so when I'm singing on
stage I always would rather perform in
front of thousands of people in front of
a huge audience than in a small intimate
group of like my closest family and
friends and that comes from experience
because when you perform on a big stage
in front of a lot of people the lights
are shining on you and you cannot see
any faces and even if you do see some
people like you can't see their facial
expressions and so that gives you just
kind of the freedom to open up be
yourself
immerse yourself into the song and the
performance because you can't care about
what other people are feeling you can't
see it you're not aware of it but when
you're in an intimate setting where with
people you know then that just makes me
so much more nervous because I can see
their face I know what they're thinking
or I'm just scared of showing my true
self because I'm so aware of all these
people and all these eyeballs looking at
me and that's the same thing with
YouTube I feel like I can be more of
myself through this video because I'm
really just looking at a camera at home
I'm super comfortable here I can never
speak this way to like my close friends
which is really weird to say but I guess
that's the introvert side of me where
when I'm out with people I'm the kind of
person that I kind of filter myself for
a shift a little bit of Who I am
depending on who I'm with so to be able
to tune
being out and Bloor the world out I
realized that's how I can tap into my
true self and kind of turn myself up
also to continue my story of me at the
gym on the treadmill blind I was dancing
and having so much fun in my zone that I
my hand got caught between my earphone
wire and my phone and I kind of like
knocked it and knocked my phone onto the
floor and which is super stupid and
super embarrassing because I'm sure it
made a very loud noise but I just wasn't
aware of it so something like that if I
was aware of the world I had my contacts
or glasses on I would have been a little
bit embarrassed but because everything
was so blurry and I just didn't care I
was like what okay I picked up my phone
plugged it back in and kept going and I
just really cared less because I could
not see anything around me I also did
another stupid thing as I was working
out after running I was doing some
squats in the mirror room and I was
squatting and on one of them I kind of
like lost balance and I almost fell on
my butt and normally I feel a little
embarrassed because people are in the
room and it can see me but since I was
blind I really couldn't see anyone's
facial expression so I was like huh
whatever keep going so I feel like that
was like a mini lesson for me a mini
revelation to just live like that even
when I'm wearing contacts and glasses
because yes there's a world happening
around me but if you can learn to tune
that world down and not care as much
about what everyone's thinking or what
people are looking at you then you can
just be more free to be yourself in the
end it really doesn't matter and it's
all in your head I'm planning to make an
ask me anything video soon so if you
guys have any questions for me anything
whatsoever feel free to tweet me at
lavender and I will pick my favorite
questions and answer them in an upcoming
video also I noticed a lot of people are
finding me on Instagram I'm trying
to be better at Instagram I'm not that
great I treated it as my personal
account just to post my life and stuff
but I think now I have to kind of be
more on point with Instagram so if you
guys want to follow me there at lavender
I'm gonna try to just be more active
uh-huh all right so that's it for this
week thank you so much guys love you see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
