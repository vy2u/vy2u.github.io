so it's the beginning of the year and a
lot of you are asking me about book
recommendations so today I wanted to
compile just a short list of books that
I highly recommend you read in 2018
these are all books that have highly
impacted my life or changed my life in
some positive way so I'm also gonna
share my reading list for this year it's
not the complete reading list but just
like the immediate five or six books
that I'm planning to read next and I'm
gonna include audiobooks as well because
that's been like my new favorite thing
listening to books and reading them at
the same time or I mean different books
but you know what I mean so the first
book that I highly recommend you read is
a classic it is this one it's called the
success principles by Jack Canfield Jack
Canfield is the co-creator of Chicken
Soup for the Soul the really popular
series of books and yes it's kind of big
and to be honest guys I've only finished
like 70% of it it's on my list to finish
this book but I you know reading most of
this book has already changed my life so
much I read this book I think in 2013 or
2014 this is really the book that helped
change my mindset on how to be
successful how to build these new habits
how to build my mind make my mind
stronger that I can be able to persevere
in my journey and just I don't know it
gives you such good insight on what
makes people achievers and what makes
people succeed and it's definitely one
to pick up if you're looking to create
your dream life because so much of
creating this life that you want and
chasing your dreams is mental so much of
it is like stamina how strong is your
mind how patient can you be how positive
can you be how optimistic can you be
like all of those things that are
mentioned in this book the next books I
don't have a physical copy of because I
read mostly on my iPad using iBooks and
now I use the Kindle app more so the
second book that I'm highly recommending
is called the slight edge by Jeff Olson
so this is the book that you want to
read if you want to
how to be consistent in life whether
it's consistent with building positive
habits or consistent at making YouTube
videos or consistent at whatever it is
that you want to focus on this year this
book really paints the picture of the
power of small actions taken every day
because baby steps taken every day can
add up to huge change and a huge
difference over a course of like years
so it talks about compounding which is
related to investing but it also talks
about like compounding in terms of like
compounding your actions it's definitely
a book that changed my life and set the
tone for my work ethic with YouTube and
my career so I've definitely recommended
this book before but I think it's worth
mentioning again because it's such a
good one the next book that I recommend
is for creatives anyone who's on a
creative journey it's called the war of
arts by Steven Pressfield I feel like
this is one of those classic books that
all artists should read the other
classic book is big magic by Elizabeth
Gilbert and I recommend that all the
time but I recommended that last year so
I wanted to switch it up and recommend
the war of art this book is just one
that will teach you how to get over
resistance resistance is the thing that
keeps you from doing your work I've
talked about it in my procrastination
videos it's basically what makes you
procrastinate and not be as productive
not face the work it's because of its
fear basically so it teaches you what
resistance is and how to beat it the
next book that I want to recommend is an
audio book it's the power of
vulnerability by brenÃ© Brown so this is
not really like a traditional book it's
more of a series of lectures I think
they're actually live lectures held by
Brene brown and Bernabe Brown she's had
the TED talk also called the power of
vulnerability I believe which is really
good so you should watch that but this
is like a long lecture over multiple
days where she just goes really in-depth
about vulnerability and shame and it's
just one that I found myself listening
to and getting so many feels and so many
new insights on just emotions and human
beings how we are and how there is power
in being vulnerable so
that book audiobook inspired me to be
more of myself and step forward and open
up and be more vulnerable in my everyday
life with my family friends and on
YouTube because that's how we make
genuine human connection is when we're
vulnerable and if you don't have audible
then I have a link down below where you
can get like a free trial for 30 days
but if you don't want to listen to this
audiobook and you're looking for like a
physical book to read than any other
book by brenÃ© Brown I would recommend as
well the last book that I want to
recommend is a cute one and it's a quick
read it's the life-changing manga of
tidying up so I've already recommended
the life-changing magic of tidying up so
many times I've read that book like
maybe two years ago so my friend gave
this to me as a gift it's basically like
a comic book version a storyline version
of like con Mari coming in to consult
this messy woman and it's a really cute
comic I read this in like two nights so
it's a fun refresher if you've read the
life-changing magic of tidying up if you
haven't read that book then this is like
the quick read version of it I think it
teaches you like the basics of the
kumari system and so if you have any
friends who don't really like to read
but you want to like kind of like give
them an idea of con Mari how to tidy how
to declutter then I would recommend
gifting them this book I've already had
like two friends who asked to borrow
this book and I might just like buy
extra copies for them because I know
they won't return it if I give it to
them but anyway if you've gone through
the con Mari journey then this book is a
really great refresher and it will
inspire you to want to like tidy through
your things again because it's been
quite some time since I lasted like a
major tidy and even though she says you
don't have to do it again I feel like
since I'm moving in a couple weeks I'm
gonna be excited to like do it again
just as I move into a new space all
right now I'm gonna share some books
that I plan to read this year and I'm
gonna share some audiobooks as well so
my first book that I'm gonna pick up
next after I finish reading my current
book which is girl code by Carol alwal
liebe the next book is called everybody
lies and this is a
look that my brother read and
recommended to me because he really
loved it he said there was like a lot of
things that blew his mind so it's a book
about data and internet searches and how
you can like find out a lot about human
behavior and human interest by like
seeing what people search on Google so
I'm interested to see like all the
random facts and stories in that book
and then the next book that I want to
read is one that I was recommended by a
friend Cyrus at global creator camp so
he's also a youtuber from France who
talks about philosophy so he recommended
the book sapiens and this is a book that
is says it's a brief history of human
evolution so I'm interested in just like
I don't know learning more about humans
human behavior like I don't know
everything related to that another book
I want to read this year is called the
storytellers secrets and this one is
written by someone who wrote another
book called talk like Ted
so his books are about public speaking
how to tell a story and I want to read
that book just so I could learn how to
better tell stories because it affects
like my videos and my podcast so just
how to improve my craft in that way
another book that I'm excited to read
this year is creating magic 10
leadership strategies from a life at
Disney I'm not sure if that's the title
cuz the titles pretty long but it's
written by a guy who worked at Disney
for like decades and he teaches like
their leadership strategies how they
keep their team motivated and how Disney
has such a positive culture so I'm
looking to learn how to be a better
leader how to lead a team how to create
like a positive culture with laugh and
dare and stuff as well and I have to
shout out to Nicky from our mastermind
group because she recommended that book
to me and I think this author wrote like
a ton of other books related to Disney
management there's one called like time
management magic that if you know if I
like this Disney book I might read that
one as well and the last book I'll
mention is one that's been on my reading
list for like over a year I'm sure it's
called in the company of women by grace
Bonnie I first saw grace Bonnie
on an interview on marie forleo's
channel which is amazing
the way if you guys don't know marie
forleo check her out but i've heard so
many great things about this book it's
basically a bunch of interviews with
women entrepreneurs and i don't know
i've heard it's really inspiring it
makes you feel empowered as a woman and
a business person so I'm looking forward
to just get inspired by that I really do
think 2018 is like the year of females
if not like last year it was already
ramping up but this year is like the
year that females are dominating we have
the time's up thing going on we have
just I don't know girl bosses stepping
up and I feel so powerful I feel like
it's like the best time to be a woman
right now
lastly I'll share some audiobooks
because they're like my new favorite way
to consume books I love listening to
audiobooks while I Drive so I'm
currently listening to light is the new
black by Rebecca Campbell I got
recommended this book by my friend
Lynette's so I'm loving it it's
definitely very like heady and it
definitely inspires me in terms of like
light and consciousness and spirituality
and stuff I think for first-time
listener if you're not used to these
terms it might kind of like throw you
off but I don't know I really like it
next up on my audio book lists are the
untethered soul I have this book
downloaded already so after I'm done
with light is the new black I'm gonna
listen to that one cuz I've heard so
many great things about it so I'm not
sure if it's best to listen to that book
or read that book but I guess I'll find
out by listening to it and then after
that I plan to listen to judgment detox
which is Gabrielle Bernstein's new book
so that's what's on my audiobook list so
far I do have a wish list which like
after I'm done with a book I usually
just look through my wish list and see
if I want anything or just look at
what's new and see if I want to listen
to anything new definitely let me know
if you have recommendations on must read
books and must listen audiobooks this
year I'm super excited about like
finding new things learning new things
and as you might be able to tell like
I'm kind of reading books outside of
self-help
and personal growth because like the
books that I recommend related to that I
feel like I read them maybe two or three
years ago and any newer books I feel
like they don't have as strong of an in
packed on me as the first books that I
read I think because when you first read
these books you're like mind blown and
it's so inspiring and it really changes
your life but after you've implemented
things you've learned from those first
few books then any new books you read
are kind of like the cherry on top and
it doesn't feel as transformational so
that's why I feel like I always
recommend older books versus like the
newer books that I've read not to say
that the newer books are not as good
it's just like personally I felt more
like impacted by the early books that
I've read but anyway I'm just looking to
continue expanding my mind in different
areas and continue learning for the rest
of my life I love learning I love just
reading about new things discovering new
things so yes any recommendations are
greatly appreciated
not just in self-help but in everything
else - all right have a beautiful day
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
already and I hope you do some reading
tonight all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
