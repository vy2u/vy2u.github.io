ideas that have inspired me lately to
break through my creative blocks and
finish the songs that I started to write
this vlog is hugely inspired by
Elizabeth Gilbert she is my favorite
writer she's the author of Eat Pray Love
the signature of all things and recently
her new book big magic Eat Pray Love is
one of my original favorite books it's
the book that inspired me to go to Italy
so it really is so important to me and I
got to hear Elizabeth Gilbert speak in
New York during a trip so I feel like
Elizabeth Gilbert has always been around
my life and she's just been part of my
creative journey and now with her new
book big magic I'm so excited to dive
into that because it's all about
creative living beyond fear so as I was
waiting for the book to come out this
week I found that Liz Gilbert had a
podcast called magic lessons that she
created to lead up to the book so I
started listening to that podcast and oh
my goodness it was so inspiring
basically what I'm sharing today are the
ideas from the magic lessons podcast
that kind of inspired me to get my
creative juices flowing number one do
what you are called to do usually that's
what you are afraid to do the most so
this one is so true with all creatives
usually you have a feeling inside what
you truly want to do and usually it's
the thing that scares you most the
reason why it scares you is because it's
so important to you that you don't want
to mess it up you may be scared to even
try but if you have any calling to do
something it is like the universe
telling you that you have to do it
you're being led to it so it's up to you
whether you want to pick it up and run
with it or ignore it but being creative
is all about being brave so you have to
do it you just have to number two there
is such thing as having too much
reverence for arts you may be respecting
your art too much you may be holding too
high of a standard for it so there was a
songwriter on the podcast who was
talking about how she has so much
trouble writing songs
feels very slow and she just can never
create to whatever she wants to create
up to her standard and I can relate to
this so much because I have so much
respect for music it's probably too much
respect for music I love it too much
when you love something that much then
you hold such a high standard high
expectation that whatever you create
will never meet that so everything is
disappointing everything is discouraging
the advice that Liz Gilbert gave this
songwriter was to just chill out to stop
caring so much about it stop setting
this art to such a high standard just
create something create anything it
could be stupid it could be simple it
could just be whatever Liz Gilbert
talked about one of her friends who was
an artist and was creating his whole
life he said that when he was younger he
took his art so much more seriously and
as he got older and more experienced he
came through this aha moment where he
just realized all I'm doing is creating
jewelry for people's minds you know when
you're creating great music or great
writing you're not exactly saving the
world I mean you are just creating like
decoration and something beautiful
jewelry for people's minds so yes
art is beautiful and amazing and
important but no it's not so high such a
high divine thing that you have to hold
such a high standard to it so I think
the point of it is just to take your art
less seriously and that's going to help
you be able to create more and improve
yourself as you keep creating number
three you don't have to publish it but
you must create it so when you're called
to create something usually what you
create comes from personal experience
and sometimes it's scary because you're
writing about people you know you're
writing about things you've been through
and you may be worried about what other
people think about that art or your you
may be worried about hurting people in
your life you know if you're writing
about anyone close to you you don't want
to hurt anybody but at the same time you
have a calling to express it and to
write it down or create something out of
that so this lesson is just telling you
that if you feel like creating something
expressing something writing something
whatever you have to create it just
create it don't think about what other
people are going to think don't even
think about publishing it because you
can create it first and then later you
can edit it or decide whether or not you
want to publish it sometimes you don't
even want to publish it at all but it's
worth it to just create it and get it
out of your system because it was meant
for you to express number four you have
to be able to sit through the boring
tedious work in the beginning in order
to get to the flow of the creative
process so in creativity there are no
shortcuts there's no way to really be
productive in the creative process
because a lot of the beginning stages
are the tinkering the editing the trial
and error a lot of failures you know
nothing may work in the beginning and it
could be very frustrating but you have
to learn how to sit through those boring
tedious stages in order to get to the
flow where your creative juices are kind
of like flowing out and exploding and
you're doing your thing because you're
not always going to be inspired but you
have to put yourself to work in the
beginning and sit through the hard
stages and then you're good eventually
you're going to be able to create
something wonderful so a huge part of it
is just to be super patient and
persevere in your work all right I hope
these tips help you guys out please feel
free to listen to the magic lessons
podcast and also do check out the big
magic book by elizabeth gilbert also I
plan to do and ask me anything video so
