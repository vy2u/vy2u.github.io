today I'm going to talk about confidence
how confidence is built how it works and
how the more confidence you have the
more risks you're going to take and the
more likely you're going to be
successful so this is more of like a
story time I'm going to tell a few short
stories about my life just to give you
examples of how confidence has been
built in certain areas of my life and
has not been built in other areas of my
life and the results of that so let me
start with this poker metaphor I got
from this guy named Todd Herman so
imagine a poker game there is one player
that has a huge stack of poker chips in
front of him and there's another player
that has a small baby stack of poker
chips the person with the bigger stack
of poker chips is more likely to take
riskier bets because they have more
chips to start with and the riskier bets
are usually the ones that will win more
those poker chips represents a person's
confidence it represents all the small
wins that have built up over time so the
person with more confidence the person
who has had more small wins in their
life that person's going to be more
willing to take big risks and thus win
more and the person with a small baby
stack of confidence and baby stack of
wins is not going to take those big
risks and I think so much of life is
just confidence so much of success is
just having the confidence believing in
yourself that you can do something and
you have to have that faith basically
the way that confidence is built is
through small wins the more small wins
you have they like stack on top of each
other and build your confidence because
it's like little steps of validation so
the more small wins the more validations
you have in your life the more confident
you're going to be if you have no small
wins and you just don't even try you
just like let it be then your confidence
is not going to grow in that area if
you're just stagnant so let me just
paint the picture I'll give a lot of
different examples from my life
so if I look back at who I was as a
child I was super shy super like scared
to do anything pretty insecure not like
a naturally confident person so I was
very soft-spoken very malleable when I
was young and just kind of like floating
there like very passive even though now
a lot of you see me as I am today as the
person behind lavender like I'm so much
like a thousand times more confident
today than I was when I started I'm
naturally like just a kid that was like
unsure of myself very quiet very like
just not going to stand up for myself
type of person so that's the starting
point that's where we're going to start
out okay someone who's very insecure
very unsure of themselves on a very like
weak foundation let's put it at that
growing up I've never been good at
sports so one of the most traumatizing
memories I have of my childhood was I
think when I was in fourth or fifth
grade and you know you have to do sports
as part of school and we were playing
baseball so you know me at the baseball
bat like already naturally like I never
hit the ball but there was this one time
that I finally swung and I actually hit
the ball like it wasn't a good hit but
like I hit the ball and I stood there
because I froze I didn't know what to do
and then all the kids in the stands were
like run run Eileen run okay okay you
can cross I ran it so I ran the first
base okay and that was it and then I
don't know if you guys know how the game
baseball works but I obviously didn't
really understand the rules I was at
first base and then the next kid is like
up to bat so all of a sudden this boy in
my class I think he was like my crush
which made it hurt more but this boy in
my class was like teasing me he's like
run run run like telling me to run while
it just like wasn't supposed to be my
turn to run I didn't know I just heard
someone yell run because all the kids
were yelling run earlier so so he would
yelling run and all some kids joined in
and I was like okay you run run run so I
ran
based and then the teacher like blew her
whistle and she's like what are you
doing and she like made me go back and
she like got mad at me for cheating and
I was so hurt because I didn't know what
I was doing and I'm like a goody-goody
like I never tried to break the rules on
purpose and I just felt like I got in
trouble and I look stupid all the kids
were laughing at me because the teacher
yelled at me like laughing at me because
I was running cluelessly I didn't know
what I was doing anyway that was
embarrassing and it was traumatizing
because I think it's one of those
memories that I go back to and I connect
sports to that event and it makes me
scared to try again in sports that's not
the only time I've been embarrassed in
sports at school like there's been
countless other times like I think that
same year or the year after that I was
playing soccer we had to like practice
kicking the ball around the field and me
being clumsy instead of like kicking the
ball like here's the ball my foot would
go on top of the ball and like I would
fall down because I just like rolled off
the ball how ridiculous right so I just
remember being embarrassed and knowing
that my peers were watching me and what
made it worse is like after PE class
this my friend was like I saw you had a
little trouble there I leaned and then
just like you know I mean it's just so
embarrassing especially when you're
young and all you want to do is either
like not stand out and just blend into
the crowd or I mean try to look cool but
I don't know not make a scene not
embarrass yourself so with a whole
history of similar stories like that me
being embarrassed in relation to sports
like it just made me scared to try in
sports and so I never really tried
anytime that we were required to like
play a game or do anything competitive I
just wouldn't want to try I think in my
head I associated like if I try too hard
I might fall or I might make a fool of
myself I might look stupid and so I was
too scared to try that hard and so I
just kind of like I just believed that I
was not good at it and I left it at that
and that has followed me through for the
rest of my life literally like it held
me back I don't know what my potential
could have been if I had actually tried
in these things so my confidence was
never built in the world of sports
because I never had those little
victories I think it's like my first
experiences with sports as a child I was
shot down and I felt like you know
someone was stepping on me and squashing
me and so my confidence just ended there
and it just never was like built up
again so on the other hand let me talk
about how I had small wins and victories
in another area of my life and held that
those up my confidence over time alright
so let's go back to where we started
remember I started out I was a shy girl
just not so confident in myself just yet
so basically my whole life I have been
into things like music I loved singing I
love dancing I played piano I took piano
lessons since I was like a baby
literally like a child I started really
early so singing and dancing I would
only do it to myself I closed the door
in my room in secret I never told any of
my friends at school I think I mean my
mom probably knew I like to sing my
brother was too young I don't think he
even noticed but um piano lessons so I
think I would say one of the first small
wins that I had were piano I was good at
piano so I just remember like there's a
memory where I overheard my piano
teacher talking to my mom and she says
something like yeah Eileen's really
talented she's really talented at piano
and I want to enter her in competition
and just hearing that as a kid it was
kind of like being that's a small wind
that's like validation and so like
obviously my confidence bumped up a
little bit from that experience so boom
I had a little bit confidence in piano
and then I joined band when I was in
fifth grade all the way through like the
first couple years of high school so
being good at the flutes like I was
sexually dur I was chosen to play the
piccolo
things like that is like Bing Bing like
validation small wind validation so
obvious
even more when you have the more
confident you are so since I was in band
you know in band there's always like a
colorguard which is like the dance team
of the band it's like a group of mostly
girls who stand through the flags twirl
rifles and stuff and I remember always
always looking up to those girls always
thinking they're so cool and deep down
like I really like to dance too and I
really wanted to try it out but I was so
scared to I didn't know that I was cool
enough or good enough so all throughout
high school like I just watched those
girls or those dance groups from afar
and I just didn't have those small wins
in it yet but I had small wins and music
so that kept going so I was good at
piano good at band and then when YouTube
started in 2000 it was like 2007 where
when I discovered YouTube that was the
time where I started to upload YouTube
videos of myself singing and playing
piano and I did it just because I was
inspired by Mario digby first of all she
was like it blew my mind how someone
could just upload a video for themselves
singing and it ended up on the radio so
I just did it I uploaded videos and I
did it in secret like I didn't tell any
of my friends at school just because I
didn't have the confidence yet to admit
that this is something that I enjoy so
eventually one of my friends and band
found one of my singing videos and she
was like I mean I saw your video on
YouTube I didn't know that you sing and
just hearing that she actually liked my
singing it was like being like another
small win of validation and then word
spread to more friends in school and
obviously like people watched my videos
I never like boldly talked about it but
if people came to me and talked about it
or asked me about it I would be like
shyly like yeah I do make videos like
really really shy but I have to give
like a lot of credit to that first
YouTube channel that I started because
it gave me so much confidence if it
weren't for putting up videos on the
Internet
I might never have showed people this
passion like literally it was I was that
shy so my senior year my high school put
on a product
for Greece and that was a time where I
became obsessed with wicked the musical
and I absolutely loved musicals so
obviously I garnered up the confidence
that I had and auditioned for Greece so
even though I didn't get any lead roles
I was like a chorus member in Greece
that was like being literally it I was
like a small validation for me even
going to the audition and singing and
seeing the smiles on people's faces
people who have never heard me sing
before that was a small validation so
you can see like all these validations
are like adding up all these small wins
so after the production was over they
held a banquet for theatre kids and
people who were in the musical - I guess
celebrate the end of the year and I
didn't even go to that banquet because I
wasn't actually in theatre I wasn't I
didn't really talk to anyone in there I
just like came I sang I danced in the
background and then I went home
literally like that random girl but the
next day at school someone came up to me
and was like hey Eileen did you know you
want an award last night like you
Wanda's award and I was like what are
you talking about so I went to the
theatre place and I realized that they
gave me this award
it says rolling high school theater
department for Greece outstanding
ensemble member and it just like blew my
mind so thing there is another small win
another little validation because I
didn't know I was good at singing or
dancing or performing and this was like
just another one of those things that
built my confidence so the next year
when I went to college my freshman year
at USC I heard of auditions for another
musical on campus and because I had such
a fun time doing this musical and I felt
confident now is the performer onstage I
went to that audition and I sang and
turns out I was casted as the lead of
that musical so it was called
unforgettable and just being the lead of
a show is a big deal like I've never had
anything that big in my life so that was
another another huge win so through the
variances I gained so much confidence as
a singer and performer but at the same
time remember I still wanted to be a
dancer but that same year I went to like
the audition the the part where you
learn how to do the choreography for the
dance team at school but I chickened out
like I was too scared and I just didn't
show up at auditions so that was like a
whomp-whomp but the next year my second
year of college I made myself do the
auditions and then I made the hip-hop
team at USC so boom boom another small
win and then throughout college I was
randomly posting on my music YouTube
channel and I think it was like my
senior year where I made a cover of a -
Berlin song that - Berlin actually
reposted on his Facebook so thing that
was another win because it was like whoa
the actual artists recognized my music
and he actually liked it what the heck
and then I made a cover for like Nicky
Romero and he tweeted that so it was
like ding ding ding all this like
confidence built from small wins in
music and so that's how I had the
confidence to pursue music when I
graduated I decided not to get a job you
guys know the story I didn't get a job
pursued music made an album all that
confidence is thanks to all the small
wins that I've had in my life back to
the very beginning point of that piano
teacher believing in me literally like
that's where it probably started no it's
probably started with my mom and dad who
made me go to take piano lessons that's
where all this confidence and music and
performing probably started but let's
move on so I pursued my music career but
I also had the confidence as a performer
to pursue acting and I also got a job as
a spokesperson and producing videos for
a Food Festival and I got that
confidence because I've been doing
YouTube for so many years for fun
through my music so after a few years of
performing and also producing videos for
work I had enough confidence to start
another
which is my current channel lavend dare
because I already had so much like
background knowledge on how to make
videos how to shoot how to edit how to
do audio how to edit audio because I
learned how to produce music and stuff
so boom boom boom all of these
experiences all of these small wins and
confidence has just built up one after
the other and even as I started lavender
in the beginning you know no one was
watching I was unsure that it was even
interesting I was like I can't find
anyone else my age talking about
personal growth on YouTube maybe no one
wants to watch it maybe that's why no
one's making these videos but I had this
like inkling within that I'm like you
know what no like I think it's only
going to grow I think there's going to
only be more and more people who are
going to be aware of this stuff so I
believed in myself and I kept it going I
was consistent and you know hitting like
my first thousand subscribers first five
thousand ten thousand all of those are
like small wins and little victories
that have really contributed to my
confidence and now I feel like I'm so
confident as a person I've grown so much
thanks to all of these little
experiences within the realm of
performing music creating all of that
stuff but don't forget about like the
sports and active side of me that the
confidence has not been built up
literally it's like this like I'm like
up at the stars and my confidence as a
performer and all of that stuff but down
here like I don't believe in myself
playing basketball you know but who's to
say I couldn't have been good at it if I
started early and had those small wins
in that area you know so think about
your life think about the small wins
you've had in your life that have built
up whatever confidence you have in your
life and if you feel like you're not
very confident at all then maybe it's
because you didn't get a chance to build
up those small ones maybe like me in
sports you were squashed you have some
negative experiences back then that made
you not want to try anymore honestly all
of these win
come from trying it comes from putting
effort and even if like the first time
you try you might fail like when I first
auditioned almost audition like I
chickened out I didn't do it but I had
to come back a second time and make that
win happen so basically what I'm saying
is your story is not over yet your story
is yet to be written it's up to you to
make those efforts to make those small
wins and just know that the more you try
the more effort you put in the more you
practice that something the better
you're going to get it and the more
confident you're going to be in your
ability to do that thing because you've
done it so consistently you've put in
the time you put in the effort so
confidence comes from efforts it comes
from trying okay so keep trying keep
practicing because the more you do that
the more confidence you're going to
build in yourself and the more
confidence you have the more risks
you're going to be willing to take and
we all know the more risk you're willing
to take the more results you're going to
get in return the more success you're
going to find in your life so honestly
this is advice I would give to everyone
at any stage of their life build your
confidence by making those small wins if
you fail out something don't let
yourself feel defeated and stop trying
not trying is like the worst thing you
can do because when you stop trying like
that's it you've stopped
you're not making progress so if you
want to make progress on something you
actually have to put in the effort you
have to try and once you like just see a
little bit of progress you're going to
believe in yourself more and honestly
the number-one thing about success is
you have to believe in yourself
confidence comes from believing in
yourself it's all like one big thing
it's all interconnected so I hope that
my story can shine some light on your
life and your story so let me know what
you think in the comments let me know if
you can relate to my story and just find
those areas of your life that you can
build confidence in alright have a
beautiful day I love you all so so much
see you next time I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
