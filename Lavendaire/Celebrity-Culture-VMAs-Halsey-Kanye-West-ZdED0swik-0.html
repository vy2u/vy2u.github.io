something that I felt compelled to make
it's gonna be a little bit more of a
word vomit thought vomit because I have
just ideas and things that I'd like to
share so the VMAs happened this past
weekend even if you didn't watch it or
if you don't catch up on celebrity
culture it's kind of hard to ignore it's
because you see it everywhere online on
your Facebook and Twitter feeds and just
on all these top trending or highlights
articles around the blogosphere so I
spent yesterday catching up on the
highlight clips from the VMAs I did not
watch the whole thing because I don't
have cable TV I don't really watch TV
anyway and before I go into anything
else I just want to say first off Tori
Kelly was amazing she killed her
performance was so great and I've known
her as an artist for quite a while and
I'm so happy that now she's on a
mainstream stage and that more people
are finding out about her raw and true
talent aside from that if you're caught
up with what happened at the VMAs and
all those like celebrity beef and this
and that I hope you realize that first
and foremost this is a show to entertain
you and MTV is a channel and they care
about ratings and so a lot of these
things are kind of done to exaggerate
the drama and get people talking get
people more engaged into the show and so
not everything you see on screen is real
that should be a basic foundation of
what you should know as you're watching
anything in media kind of take
everything with a grain of salt and
really think for yourself
aside from that I noticed that Halsey
was at the VMAs so I kind of fell into
this Halsey rabbit hole on her Twitter
feed and like just getting submersed
into the Halsey community so yes I found
a policy but kind of like immersing
myself into the community around her as
an artist made me inspired to make this
video so if you guys don't know who
Halsey is she's a rising
singer-songwriter artist star she's
gonna be big that's what I believe and
she has
region of social media fans cuz I think
she started as someone whose tumblr
famous myspace famous YouTube famous and
so she already has a fan base before she
came out with her first debut album
what's special about her is that her
fans are so into her like super duper
into her these are the generation of
kids who are so into artists like the
one Directioners and people who love
ariana grande and they these people make
their Twitter avatar into this artist
and their username might have the artist
name into it basically the main point of
this video and what I want to say is
that you should never ever idolize
somebody celebrity idolization is not
healthy for your mind I read this in
turning pro by Steven Pressfield he also
talks about not idolizing people because
when you idolize someone and put them on
a pedestal like that you're mentally
telling yourself that this person is
better than me and I really wish I was
this person or this person is goals and
that is putting yourself down you know
what I mean really you are not better or
worse than anyone else out there all of
these celebrities are human beings as
well they're normal people like you and
I and you have just as much greatness in
you as these people that you see on
screen so yes these artists are amazing
and they've done great things because
they definitely worked hard to get to
where they are but what you should do is
not idolize them but just enjoy the work
that they create if you love an artist
enjoy their music enjoy this person's
movie it really is about the arts and
the work because that's what comes out
of them that's how they express their
true self it's not about wanting to
become everything that this person is
and thinking whatever they think is cool
is cool you know so I think that is a
problem with celebrity culture you know
we put so much emphasis on this person
what they wore what they said and who
they are and we kind of turned them into
immortals and we see them as
demigods basically and I know this
happens not just with mainstream
celebrities but also YouTube celebrities
as well I went to VidCon and the kids
there are crazy yeah I just want to say
that you should not idolize someone you
can admire someone but you are just as
great as all of these people out there
you may not have realized that yet or
you may not have gotten to that point
but you are you are you are so as an
artist as a personality I would not want
someone to idolize me instead I would
rather so much to inspire and empower
everyone else out there to see their
greatness to see the greatness that they
have within them because everybody is
awesome everybody has a light in them so
you are no better or worse than anyone
never idolized someone never put them
above you and also vice versa don't look
down on people don't ever look at
someone as they are below you because
there are no true hierarchies yes there
are social hierarchies and all of this
stuff going on in our worlds but if you
really look at it deep down we're all
human beings we're all equal we all have
our own stories and reasons for why we
are the way we are we're all on our own
individual journeys and you cannot judge
a journey for anything you cannot judge
and compare one person's journey to
another and this brings me to Kanye
West's video Vanguard acceptance speech
at the VMAs if you haven't seen it go
watch it
he might sound a little rambley to you
but if you really pay attention to the
truth of what he's saying oh my goodness
I teared up so I may not listen to his
music all the time but I fully support
Kanye West as an artist and as a human
being because I believe at the heart of
it he gets it he is trying to put out a
message out there to kind of wake people
up there's a video of Kanye West
speaking on time I'm gonna post that
below because after watching that I
really got to understand him even more
than what he's trying to do so basically
he's someone that's not afraid to make
himself look foolish in order to get the
message across so a lot of people might
think Kanye's
crazy he's arrogant he's so full of
himself but if you really just listen to
the words that he's saying and where
he's coming from what he really is is
he's confident and it really is the
media that's kind of twisting his words
because the people writing these
articles or the people listening to what
he's saying aren't as confident as he is
so they think he's being arrogant but
really I think he's got to the truth of
it that he is great and he has unlimited
potential just like you and I are great
and we have unlimited potential so what
he was saying in his acceptance speech
is really we have to teach our kids
self-confidence and self-love that they
really can do whatever they put their
minds to because this whole time in his
career people are putting him down for
being too confident
who are we to put someone down for being
too confident for loving themselves so
much why do we put people down like that
it shouldn't it be celebrated to love
yourself so I I did my research I was
reading all of these articles on people
talking about the top 20 most arrogant
things that Kanye West has done or the
stupidest things that he said and if you
really pay attention to the quotes Kanye
never says that he's better than anybody
out there better than anyone he compares
himself to he compares himself to
Picasso and Steve Jobs and the Great's
of the world and the media and the
reporters put him down for it they're
like Kanye who do you think you are why
would you even think of comparing
yourself to Steve Jobs or Picasso or van
Gogh and I'm like but he is just as
great everybody's just as great as the
Great's we are all great and so if you
are telling somebody else that they
they're not as great and they're too
arrogant for putting themselves in that
position there's something wrong with
you so I just I just think that he sees
it and he's not afraid to kind of be
over-the-top about it to make a point
that we should love ourselves and we
should be confident and even if we've
made mistakes in the past like he has we
can overcome it our mistake does not
make us even though the media will kind
of like replay mistakes over and over
and over again and dramatize everything
that's not truth that's not what's real
what's real is us we are real you are
real I am real and we are all great we
are all just as great as one another as
these celebrities as these greats of the
world because we have that unlimited
power in us so don't let anyone put you
down you know love yourself be confident
and do what you want to do so when Kanye
calls himself a god he's not saying he's
the God the only God we are all gods we
are all great we all have that in us we
are all a piece of whatever created this
universe we are part of that so don't
see yourself as anything less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
