what's up guys welcome back to lavender
today we're going to have our second
episode of artist of life and I'm so
excited to introduce my dear friends
Clarissa way so Clarissa is a freelance
journalist who recently backpacked all
across China Taiwan and Tibet and she's
written stories for Vice eater le times
so many more and she's been on TV on
Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods with
Andrew Zimmern I'm so excited
yeah thank you so much for having me and
coming over yeah
so we met when you were writing about
Chinese food and I was working at 66
night market a Food Festival in the area
so I feel like I've seen you grow so
much and blossom into like a new woman
basically yeah I remember I think I was
in New York when I first heard of the
6:00 to 6:00 night market and I knew is
gonna be a big thing and I think that
was around 2012 or 2011 and that kind of
marked a shift in Chinese food I think
in Los Angeles yeah it was like a big
trend yeah right to talk about Chinese
food and you were basically yeah she was
writing about all the Chinese
restaurants in the area yeah and I mean
I want to talk about like your shift in
your journey so can you talk about your
dreams and goals then versus like your
dreams and goals now yeah I so I think
then I mean I was still in college a
senior and then I just really wanted to
write and become a journalist and I kind
of started writing about Chinese food in
Los Angeles because it was the only
topic that I knew more about than the
average person I would say because I
knew the language and so then a lot of
things are just focused on restaurants
you know top ten list holes or like the
weird things you can eat stinky tofu
whatnot and then now it's changed to
more of I'm a lot more conscious of
where food comes from and that's kind of
my goal trying to get people to think
about where our food is coming from so
before it was more on like the trendy
surface level right
dude and then now you're going deeper
yeah because it was like you know a lot
of people are obsessed with yellow or
obsessed with going out to eat that's
just the culture of Los Angeles but
after doing this for four or five years
it's kind of like what's the point of
all of that you know we're going out to
eat and I'm always writing about these
restaurants but it's like why do I find
a restaurant trendy or why do I like it
and it's because you know people in the
media push it through yeah okay so let's
talk about your huge trip to Asia can
you talk about why you decided to go in
the first place
sure so I had been writing about Chinese
food for such a long time and it was
like I just need to go there and granted
I've spent considerable time in Taiwan
and China already um but this time was
like I'm going to get in deep and talk
to people yeah I don't know the source
exactly and then I'm really glad I did
because I found out our perception of
what Chinese food is there is completely
different from what it is like reality
for example we think of the eastern
south eastern seaboard side all the way
from Guangdong Area Hong Kong to
seung-hi as a huge seafood place or a
huge fish place and but I think a you
know because of pollution a majority or
a good chunk of lakes and rivers are
highly polluted now and so the fish that
we wax poetic about isn't actually fresh
fish and there was a one huge example it
was in Chinese New Year's and I was
taking a cooking class and there was a
song hi ie and auntie and I asked her oh
you're gonna have fish for Chinese New
Year's right because fish um it's a
symbol of unity and it's something that
people in the south eastern side eat a
lot and especially for Chinese singers
you have to eat a whole fish and she
just kind of laughs at me and she's like
no I'm not gonna eat fish why would I
eat fish at this point I'm kind of
shocked so no one eats fish anymore yeah
and she's like it's disgusting it's so
dirty like why would I eat fish Wow
and she was kind of you know getting on
me for not knowing that - I see so I
know that you started in the cities and
then you decided to go to more remote
areas you can talk about what attracted
you to those like rural areas sure so I
started in
seung-hye because it was just kind of
what was familiar to me like taipei and
some hi you know my goal is to learn
about the food and when I went there I
kind of realized the food culture was
very similar to that of the states and
that you know people want trendy brunch
restaurants with the perfect Instagram
yeah I mean they don't have Instagram
they're the perfect WeChat frame and all
the food people didn't really know where
the food was coming from it was all
centralized distributors and I just like
wasn't getting this story I wanted I
remember going to the city of Russia
which has a Swedish food in all of China
they have pork ribs which are just
covered in sauce like sweet sugar and
I'm Jenny yang a friend of mine and I
were standing in a grocery store and it
just we just started yelling like why is
the food here so sweet and all of these
old like Chinese grandmother's kind of
gathered around us like town hall-style
and like on the street you're joining
the grocery store and the guys are just
frustrated and we were just like talking
really loudly and Chinese but then it
drew the attention of all these like
Chinese grandmothers and everyone was
like I don't know this is the tradition
of our ancestor yeah and it was just at
that point I realized that people in
this city are out of touch with their
food culture not that there's anything
bad with that is just that's not their
priority right because their priorities
you know working in an office getting
money there's no connection to the land
so after that I decided to book it to a
very remote town and at the base of
Yellow Mountain because I figured that
is where I'm going to learn more about
food you have these people who know how
to grow food so what did you find when
you went to that area yeah so I was in a
hostel and then I'm at home son I'm at
the base and then that owners really
liked me and after that they said okay
come with me I'm gonna take you to my
Lodge on my old house and it's a
mountain that if you google it there'll
be no information about it online and
automatic I mean it's on the map
technically but no one knows about it um
and we like hikes to a graveyard because
it is the birthday of her dead the
hundredth birthday of her dead
grandmother and there were just like so
much of vegetation there and they use
human feces to fertilize the soil and
it's called a night
soil and if it's done properly it's
actually really a it's really good for
the soil yeah I'm and then when we were
cooking it was like you know River frog
that they caught it was like Horo their
own food greater food and it's not a
trendy hipster thing for them there it's
because they're so isolated it was kind
of a flashback to the past almost okay
it kind of made me nostalgic for what
could have been or what was let's talk
about your biggest struggle like I know
you've had a lot of like rock bottom
movements and your journey because I saw
you post about yeah so can you share
like the big one yeah I mean um battling
in the trains and I say battling and
trans is like getting a ticket was
really hard just because the culture
there is people don't line up and oh
yeah a lot of that is just because back
then they had a fight to get their food
and so that's just kind of ingrained in
the culture so that was frustrating like
waking up every day and just being like
okay it's battle time like you got to
war after war out there
yeah and then actually one of my lowest
points was living in a large city I was
in Taipei and I'm for a while writing
about restaurants I mean I was hired to
put together a guidebook of the best
restaurants there and I say a low point
um because I just like did not like the
work I was doing um it was great harder
to do just to write a guide book okay
and go to 200 restaurants in a couple of
months and it was a great gig and I met
a lot of great friends there but just
that work made me realize just how much
I don't like the rest
ya know what you wanted to bring about
what I want to write about also in
Taiwan what I started to see is that
there are more coffee shops and tea
shops and French restaurants are the new
hot thing there so all the cool things
that we like about Taiwan here in Los
Angeles you know stinky tofu will offend
all these authentic things people in
Taiwan don't necessarily probably be
they're like sick of it they're kind of
sick at right
I'm granted there were a couple of
players who are trying to change that
and try to elevate that cuisine but by
and large the average person is more
obsessed with western style yeah I think
that goes for a lot of Asian Asian areas
that are modernizing
yeah and so that was very frustrating to
see how Western modes of consumption is
what asian mode of consumption is -
they're consuming how we're consuming
because of Hollywood because of the
media so we kind of set the standard
here Cassander yeah so I heard you got
kicked out of Tibet he tell me about
that yeah so I wanted to go to Mount
Everest and I was at the city right
before Mount Everest when the tour guy
called me into the PlayStation she says
there's something wrong with your
documentation the place London talked to
you
Oh should go in there and the woman
looks at me and she said why don't you
have an entry stamp on your passport and
I gone in with my American passport and
I tell her well I had gone into China
with my Taiwan passport and apparently
you can't do that because in China they
don't recognize Taiwan and they
recognize Taiwan is part of China and is
a Chinese person you can't have dual
citizenship so long story short it was
just the problem the documentation and
she's like oh I can kick you out or no I
can put you into jail but I'm just gonna
kick you out I bet so go back to the
main city go to Lhasa and get the first
ticket out um but they had closed the
airport a couple days before because of
a government official I'm not really
sure um so there was no ticket out so I
was kind of stuck in Lhasa by myself for
three days but it was so how'd you get
out you just had to take a bus and I
took a card to Lhasa and then there was
a flight out yeah there were no
available flights earlier than what I
had so I was just stuck in Lhasa so what
did you want me um I wanted to bet in
rock concert cuz I had did a girl there
uh-huh who was Tibetan and she just took
me to a local rock concert which was
awesome yeah and I met some very famous
artists as well like oil painters
awesome I was like really cool I don't
I'm regretting but it kind of suck not
being able to go to Mount Everest yeah
but I'm sure like when things go wrong
it leads you to something better yeah
right yeah it was really cool um I mean
on that car ride back I met a woman who
introduced me to a professor who turned
the entire country from town organic
yeah and then I didn't artists idea yeah
so I mean I was upset but I didn't have
a mental breakdown because of that
because at this point I've been used to
so many things going wrong
yeah totally yeah he talked about what
you think was the most memorable part of
your trip overall yeah and so the most
surreal was camping with Tibetan nomads
it's about in grasslands and Lum Wilson
soutane province and why that was so
surreal to me was that they can make so
much out of so little so they live in a
yak hair tent and this space is you know
probably as a little bit bigger than
this table or patio
yeah um and they're able to you know
make their food um have dinner there
their entire life just revolves in this
tent and over here in America we have so
much land yet we don't really know what
to do with all of it you know or we're
using it in a very inefficient way so I
saw people for example when people cook
they only use you know one butcher knife
whereas here people really confuse if
you give them one pitcher net they have
to have older like fancy paring knives
and they're different size like so
exactly or you know they just have one
cutting board and they just make do with
what they have and so I think that
lesson being in such a remote place
that's seeing how much they had with so
little was the most surreal yeah so you
really don't need that much no not at
all oh let's talk about their lifestyle
like yeah I even look like to be a nomad
so it's really hard for a woman um they
have to wake up the woman and they're in
their 20s and they have like two
children already yeah and they wake up
at 4:00 I am in they milk their yak and
then during the day they have to dry out
the milk curds because they use it
that's like part of their food they just
eat dairy and yak because nothing grows
up there because it's surviving
everything from yak milk basically yeah
cheese and butter yeah but now with the
introduction univ motorcycles and roads
they have vegetables but mostly they
just make butter cheese and milk and
then go red or rice that they make it
into a thing called samba it's um black
tea with Highland barley powder like a
flour and butter and then they need it
so it's kind of like a protein bar
interesting yeah yeah and then the women
also have to heard that yak - so they're
out and then dinner doesn't start until
9:00 10:00 p.m. Wow and then they sleep
and then they wake up and they sounds
like all day of work yeah and then also
if you think about it
and it's not a big tent so they're
always bent over and I realize like how
flexible they were because they're
always kind of been bent over position
yeah okay and just like making food or
like cleaning things they also have to
lay down the yak poop and then let it
dry in the Sun and there's a pile
everything you stand for it's for fire
so every single a man has a pile of just
dried yak poop and the woman will carry
it in on their backs and they also carry
in the water from the stream yeah it's a
really hard hard lifestyle yeah how has
your trip changed you as a person yeah I
think it's made me really aware of where
food comes from for example I was at
tunngle which is the last traditional
fishing harbour in Taiwan and I just saw
hundreds of sharks
he's like strewn across my feet um and
that's bycatch so bycatch is when you're
you have a long net and you're trying to
catch say mahi-mahi or like ahi tuna but
then the sharks will come in and so I
realized that you know bycatch happens
all over the world and even you know in
places like the United States but the
difference is that in the United States
were not a lot of bring the Sharks in so
we don't see it where as time when you
actually see it what do they do with it
they'll actually sell their meat but
it's actually the cheapest kind of meat
ironically sure not cheaper this is
cheapest so one of the cheapest well
yeah tunas and most expensive bluefin -
yeah but there are like so small um and
then when I was hanging with the ocean
tribe that I made zoo in Taiwan they
basically said we're out of fish and it
was so kind of jarring to me that you
know this tribe knows more about the
state of our earth and consumption
patterns and the average City person and
we're the one who's who we are the
people who are consuming so much so is
this just happening in Taiwan or is it
like happening everywhere else it's
happening everywhere else so it's a
global issue um for like I said earlier
all our consumption patterns are
interlinked so you know 90 percent of
our seafood is imported whereas an
imported from it's imported from China
and spiny lobster in California and 95
percent of that
given to China so it's all interlinked
um and it's we need to kind of address
it from both sides um it's just that in
China and Taiwan it was easier to see
because here everything's kind of behind
closed doors because of regulations for
good reason too but there there are no
regulations yeah so it's gonna in the
thick of it and I was able to talk to
people and kind of at the beginning of
where they're starting to develop and
become more like the United States so
it's more broad there and I was able to
find more stories but the same thing
happening here
um for example um algae blooms you know
that's happening in China it's ruining
their water supply what is happening
with algae bloom happens based on
industrial runoff and the lake is so
rich with minerals that the algae will
bloom and it makes the water toxic and
you can't drink it so year after year
the algae of blooms are getting more and
more severe and that's actually
happening in California too another
parallel is desert vacation so what
happened with the Dust Bowl was that
because we're punting a lot of crops
that ruin the soil layer on and then it
just became a desert and that's
happening so much in China right now I
remember being on at a Tibetan Plateau
and then next to it I sell sand dunes
and I was like cool this is like a
two-in-one deal we come here and like
hang out with the yaks in the plateau
and then I can like slide on sand dunes
and I go by those sand dunes natural or
they work exactly so I go back to the
hostel and the hostel owner says I mean
that's happening because of desert
vacation they're turning these places
into farmland and it's ruining the soil
layer so there's warming too much yeah
farming way too much um yeah because
they have to feed all these people all
the first world exactly which is like a
vicious cycle it's a vicious cycle
um and they're also just consuming like
Americans you know meat wasn't a really
big part of the Chinese diet I mean pork
is really big but I mean if you go to
any Chinese restaurant the meat is kind
of on the side or this is a little bit
but because of again American pattern of
consumption may be more of a hue exactly
I see clearly there are a lot of issues
wrong with our consumption side
go like where food comes from where do
you think your ideal world looks like
how would you want us to shift for the
future I think we can generate value out
of waste and there's this whole concept
called the blue economy which is um
gÃ¼nther partly is a really good
resource for that um but for example you
can grow mushrooms out of coffee ground
and tire yeah and Taiwan there's the
technology to convert plastic into fuel
um just a lot of things we can be using
the waste that we generate into making
something very valuable you know if you
own a juice bar and you have orange
peels you can turn that into something
yeah I saw a company that was converting
coffee grounds into clothes and coffee
grounds are really good with absorbing
odors and so they sold that to you know
Patagonia and different sportswear
places because you know when you sweat
it'll absorb that odor where that
company based Taiwan Oh Taiwan is a huge
innovator for these technologies it's
just marketing huh so do you think it's
just an issue of like timing it's gonna
take a long time for these things to
catch on or I think it's awareness Yahoo
I before I went on this China trip and
saw things for myself I knew of all of
these issues about you know global
warming climate change etc but I didn't
realize how relevant it was until I met
people so I think it's telling the right
stories and letting people see how
relevant it is to each and every one of
us for example when I talked to a tribe
member at the most remote tribe in
Taiwan he says when he was young you
know at 11 a.m. or at 10 a.m. it was
bearable and they could work in the
fields but now by 10:00 11:00 it's so
hot they can't even work and he's of the
global world because of global warming
and then so you just realize how
relevant it is yeah it affects everyone
yeah but here we don't see it as much
because we all get our food from the
same areas um and it's a very
centralized there's a go-between that's
what we see here we don't talk about the
supermarket yeah
but then if you I think in Los Angeles
if you go out of your way you'll be able
to see it so lastly I want scuba diving
finding lobsters and spiny lobsters er
apparently I didn't eat it but it's
tastier and sweeter than the Maine
lobster so why aren't we eating it here
because Chinese people have bought it so
all of that is getting shipped to China
and only scuba divers kind of get access
to it so in your opinion what's
something that we as regular everyday
people can do to like start improving
the way things are um I would say start
very small and here's an example I don't
know how small it is but um pal for
never been in a huge strat for years is
the one of the worst droughts in history
but instead of watering our green lawns
we could be using that water to grow to
food forests
um the water that we get is all imported
from Colorado or Studer from Colorado in
Northern California we can be using that
water to grow food which is much more
efficient and it generates that yeah or
you can kill your lawns my lawns are a
waste exactly they're wasted land they
don't do anything if you kind of realize
if you walk towards suburb a you won't
see many birds or butterflies or bees
because there are no native plants
really work to if you have native punch
to attract native pollinators a new
creative food forest um and it's just a
much more dynamic space no I think and
if you plant native plants they won't
need as much water as these New England
plants that we have that requires so
much water it doesn't make sense so a
lot of it is like really being aware and
educating yourself yeah is a native plan
how to be efficient
exactly also like did you know is
sprinkler when it sprays out water 50
percent of that water is actually
evaporated oh yeah so like doesn't do
anything yeah so it's like what are we
doing we're just kind of following these
paradigms that we're given yeah you're
Dom in a system like how things have
been yeah I think another thing that
people can do is to be more aware of
what they eat Joe and I know eating out
is a huge part of our culture here but
if we had more times where we cooked for
one another or went to farmers markets
and were more aware of where we came
from I don't think we would just buy
things for the sake of buying things so
it's having a relationship
- and that was something I realized in
my travels the people who had a very
intense relationship with the land and
with their food they were much happier
in general there's a lot of scientific
thing but the hash is something I notice
yeah why do you think so
and so what I the best example was the
most remote tribe in Taiwan right and
because they all had a vested interest
in their land everyone works together
and I think that's kind of everyone
wants the community exactly everyone
wants community but community is created
when you kind of have a common cause or
certain values right and when your value
is on that land you not only take care
of that land so it's fertile and it
feeds you and choose you but you work
together and you have no common thing
and it's not something abstract which
can be you know that just depends on
different values it's not a religion
it's a physical thing that you can
cultivate and work on together yeah and
I like our culture now we're so isolated
we live in our own homes we like get in
our own little car and we don't really
connect yeah it's that whole philosophy
of being present right and so there's
men totally being present and like I
guess spiritually being present like
physically being present how many people
actually know you know the composition
of our soil or no no I don't cultivate
that and you know the state of our land
here in LA it's you know kind of said
there's a lot of lead in this soil
really oh yeah and we have the highest
amount of empty parking lots and all of
you guys it's um and we can be using
that to grow things to cultivate the
community um and to grow food because
food does at the end of the day bring
people together yeah it does
but if you go to a restaurant and you
just gather around food it's a very
temporary thing but if you have a
relation ongoing relationship with the
land ill not a little grow the community
yeah as well
awesome now I want to ask you now that
your trip is done what's next for you
and so now I'm really focused on finding
up where things where food comes from in
America too because I found that out for
China and that was really cool but I
think it's much more relevant if we tie
it back into our own land and I'm I
might be going to a farming program in
Iowa
I just want to learn more about how to
grow our own food and where food comes
from so that includes like going scuba
diving and I'm taking a hunting seminar
Wow like which fish is actually edible
yeah and I'm really into native plans so
like a corn is a huge native staple here
is like their main thing they used to
make a corn pudding and a corn mash Wow
hey corn we don't like it we don't know
we could be using that right um you can
make different concoctions with like
elderberry which grows wildly when you
go hiking so I think the more I
understand about local like very local
and I'm not talking just like your
backyard like that local the more you're
able to teach people about it and
there's not a lot of knowledge out there
you're basically saying we have so many
resources like in our backyard but we're
not really being efficient with our food
yeah so let's just take Los Angeles or
California for example okay well let's
start with the United States the United
States controls more ocean territory
than any other nation on her yet 90% of
our seafood is imported that doesn't
make sense
yeah where does it go it goes yeah yeah
um so in California when I went scuba
diving
there's hundreds of Unni sea urchins on
the ground and like as an Asian person
we love Unni that's like really
expensive they're kind of invasive but
no one's eating them or if we are
catching them or importing into Japan or
China or other countries maybe I'll pay
more for it they'll pay more for yeah
and it's not it's because they'll pay
more for it but it's also because
there's no local demand so we educate
ourselves on what's invasive and what's
local we could totally change
consumption patterns and I think this is
up to the jobs of chefs and people in
the media and just the general public
people who are buying things um when I
was in sit on province
I went foraging for an herb called the
fish mint and it kind of tastes like
cilantro and then I googled it in
English and I realized I think in the
East Coast it's considered an invasive
plant and all these like gardeners are
talking about how do I get rid of it
like I hate that you mean like it's a
weed and yeah okay um
in lens all guns with province there's a
plan called pen Whitehall which they
make into and they put into the noodles
and that's what makes it stretchy when
they roll it they have it in Joshua
traits considered Oh like a pest also
there's just so much of it so some
things we consider here like we not
useful are actually useful for yeah like
the first time I went scuba diving um I
saw sea urchin and then on the boat I
was like why aren't we eating the sea
urchin everyone's like you can eat sea
urchin that's silly because American
people don't yeah yeah Western people
yeah there's not part of the culture so
I think this cultural slop and a lot of
indigenous people I'm in the United
States they have that knowledge and
believe it or not a lot of them are
still like it's not a thing of the past
they still exist it's still very
relevant to so kind of my vision and
this is a little bit you talk utopia if
you will it's just what if we had
suburbia with food forests in our front
yards with like fruit trees and then
like kids would want to you know they
could gather the fruit and there just be
more interaction between people yeah and
I'm really convinced there's just a
correlation between taking care of the
land and taking care of your community
and just happiness in general yeah so
like if everyone grew their own certain
fruits or vegetables and you can share
with and sharing it with people too I
mean we have front yards that are green
and no one uses it people don't roll
around and yeah anymore but if we had
you know a food forest and with so many
different types of varieties it wouldn't
just be people - it'd be if you go to
the Arboretum you'll see hummingbirds
and butterflies and all of these
different furniture a lot of interns bad
yeah yeah and and why I had that theory
is if you go hiking out in the mountains
any hike you go to and you see a
stranger people will say hi - yeah the
person that's just the culture - when
you're in nature because it's like you
are not the main thing there yeah and I
think if we bring nature and we stop
separating it with you know fences and
like making it a weekend activity if we
just integrate ourselves with it we
would have a much better
community I love it I think it's
beautiful so last questions you have any
advice for any aspiring writers
journalists or travellers out there um I
think put yourself in a zone that you
are not comfortable with because I think
that's where the best stories will arise
so I think I started with that last year
I went to Nicaragua to hike volcanoes
that was the volcano trekking guide and
that was an experience I did not think I
was going to write about or just like
kind of want to take a break and it was
so out of my comfort zone that I just
found a lot of different stories because
things were just new and different and I
saw things from a different perspective
from that so I think if you want to be a
writer if you want to be a creative
person and you're out of ideas and you
just think you're in a slump then put
yourself in a zone that makes you
uncomfortable because that will change
your perspective writing things thanks

person I think you're so cool thank you
