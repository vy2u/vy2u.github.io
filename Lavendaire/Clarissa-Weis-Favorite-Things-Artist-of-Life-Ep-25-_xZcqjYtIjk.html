enjoy the tea this is a tea set so this
is a guy wine and all of this is from
China and Taiwan um I really like tea
because I think it's a way to just kind
of get people together and share with
them where she comes from and different
elements of it and it's also a very nice
and aesthetic thing that you can share
with people so it's a really calming and
meditative practice for me my version of
yoga is tea second I really like hiking
um I got into hiking about three years
ago and I think it's the way I just
really connect with nature and kind of
lose yourself because when you're there
you're away from the city and away from
other people and you're just climbing up
the mountain with one goal in sight next
is scuba diving scuba diving is one of
my loves I wanted to be a marine
biologist when I was a kid and I think
my parents did not let me and I you know
my 23rd birthday said I would get
certified so now I try to go scuba
diving as much as I can and there's this
weightlessness to it and it feels like
you're flying so I would always kind of
have dreams of me flying through but
controlling that flight with my breath
and I realized that scuba is exactly
like that you control your movements
with your breath and it's very very
relaxing
lastly books so I really like reading
nonfiction books or scientific books
about where food comes from or edible
foods so this is a guide to foraging in
California and it just has a list of
edible plants and kind of how to process
it and it's just very useful because I
go hiking a lot and
teaches you what you can kind of take
home and make into a tincture or into a
selves and how to eat it which I find
you know it's free food and then there's
my Kindle which has all my books in here
and this is just how I pass time by
reading books on you know the seafood
consumption chain or how mushrooms grow
and I really think reading is really
important because this is how I kind of
learn what's going on in the whole food
chain this is my regulator and this is
just one part of the scuba set this is a
dive computer so it records you know how
many dives I've been on my death and
this is really important because you can
get decompression sickness when you're
scuba diving which is aka the bends
it'll tell you you know wanting to do
your safety stop means you have to hover
15 feet below the water so all the
bubbles basically so you don't get sick
so this is very important when scuba
diving and this is the mouthpiece where
you breathe through also I'm very
important to so in California if you go
scuba diving is probably best to have
your own gear just because it's
expensive to rent and bring most serious
divers in California have their own gear
so um I take very good care of my scuba
gear compared to everything else
