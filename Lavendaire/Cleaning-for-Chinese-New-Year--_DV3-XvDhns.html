that's right it's Chinese New Year and
as a tradition a couple days before
Chinese New Year we always clean the
house and get everything off on the
right foot when we start off the new
year so I wasn't really planning on
making a video today but I was just
planning on cleaning but since you guys
love to watch cleaning and decluttering
and organizing I thought why not just
film the process and share this with you
so feel free to clean your own home if
you like you don't have to you can just
watch me clean my mess
literally I've been in a state of mess
lately and it's a good opportunity for
me to just start fresh like reset my
space because I've been really needing
that so let's go woman I thought of you
like a guy but the minute that I realize
that you were a mess with it and I
wasn't gonna take anybody a pan no
longer that's assuming Hagin all the
words I wanna hear you have wandering in
the cash and now you can take it back we
got some magic sorry we want to do up
with me we got too much going to lick up
above it where'd your life head you lie
you lie next to me and you're lying next
to me
Oh laughs man
Janet I only what I need and you can
already know already in the castle we
got too much sorry
they want to do with me to wake up
another where'd your life head you lied
to me and you lied to me there is
madness Oh Janet I know you were the me
and you can uh nobody knows already in
the castle we got too much sorry we want
to with me
without the mother where'd your life
give your life you live next to me and
you're lying next to me ha
have you lied to me
alright that's it for today's video by
the time this video is up it's probably
already into the new year the new Lunar
New Year or Chinese New Year whatever
you want to call it by the way if you're
of like the golden rooster
I believe so as a little fun being
comment below with your Chinese
horoscope and if you don't know what it
is you can totally google it I am a
fourth so what are you I'd love to know
put it in the comments and I will see
you in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
