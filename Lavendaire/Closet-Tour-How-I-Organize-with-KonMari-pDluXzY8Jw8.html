you a little closet tour of my clothes
after I've decluttered and organized the
con Mari way so before I go in my closet
is definitely not big at all its normal
size at best and I've already cleared
out half of my stuff and so what's left
are only the clothes that spark joy in
me so if you haven't checked out my
videos on the con my method I'll post
them on this screen right here but let's
get into it all right let's start with
the hung clothes on the left
so Mario Kondo says to hang your clothes
so that they rise to the right so you
put the heaviest and longest stuff on
the left and then the lightest and
shortest stuff on the right so on the
left side of my closet I have my coats
and then it goes lighter to some
cardigans kimonos and then I move on to
some dresses and the dresses go from
heavy to light material as well so
that's what I got on this end and then
on this end I have these vests on the
side and some flannels long-sleeve and
then some light sweaters blouses and
then I move on to some t-shirts and then
tank tops here I have some crop tops and
then I go into some even lighter tank
tops that are more spaghetti strappy and
then on the right I just have some
skirts that look better when hung up
okay so close that rise to the right all
right let's move on I have these drawers
down here and this one is my tank tops
so tank tops sleeveless stuff below it
these are some t-shirts these are all my
t-shirts heavier ones bigger ones in the
back smaller lighter ones in the front
and then down here I have some long
sleeve sweater types that you know are
just longer sleeve right and then over
here I have a jewelry box sitting on top
and this is the spot that I'm
designating for my purse that I'm using
at the moment here I have the top for my
accessories so I got some bracelets
necklaces necklaces rings and then some
assorted random stuff around second
drawer I haven't declutter yet because
these are tech accessories but I'll show
you is just just generally like music
and camera stuff and this drawer are my
pants
so jeans hands and here are some
leggings over here alright so if we go
on to the top here are my sweaters and
hoodies so the heavier ones are on the
left the heavy hoodies hoodies hoodies
and then it gets to crewnecks and then
some sweaters and yeah
there you have it all right over here on
the center divide I have some cardigans
this is a super long cardigan and these
just look better and feel better folded
so I folded them there these are my
shorts that are not jeans so there's the
more colorful ones and stuff here are my
jean shorts and then here are some
skirts that I honestly rarely wear then
on the bottom I have whatever these maxi
skirts and maxi dresses that just
they're too delicate to be hung because
they'll you know stretch and stuff and
then this is kind of ugly but I'm going
to show you guys anyway down here I have
this little mini shelf and I keep some
purses over there these are some pajama
and workout pants and then here are just
my pajama and workout t-shirts and tank
tops and stuff so kind of the ugly
clothes alright let's come over to this
drawer over here so here at the top are
my scarves scarves I have the heavy
knits ones on the left and then it gets
lighter and lighter to the right and
along the edges these are just some knit
beanies headbands turbans
all right and the center one are my
underwear so I'm not going to show you
guys and then this one on the bottom are
my socks sock drawer okay so these are
ankle socks I mostly wear black ones but
yeah these are just stockings and I
rolled them up the way Mario Kondo
recommends you and here I just have
fuzzy socks I wear in the winter and
some long miscellaneous socks all right
that's all I have for my little closet
tour I know it's not much but I just
wanted to show you guys a little bit of
how I organized and folded my clothes
the con Mari way so at the end of it I'm
definitely feeling so light because I've
thrown out half my closet and I only
kept the things that sparked joy and I
honestly have so much extra space in my
closet like look at all these extra
hangers that I don't know what to do it
but I just wish you guys luck on
organizing and decluttering your closet
hope this helps good luck
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
