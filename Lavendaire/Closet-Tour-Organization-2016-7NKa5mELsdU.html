a ton of space here so it was fun
rearranging all my clothes for this new
place we'll start on the right side this
is where I turned to first to start
building my outfits these are my tops in
order from heavy and long to light and
short on the top shelf I have a jewelry
box and a pouch with hair accessories I
also keep it drawing up there by Miss
mindful I bought this at a night market
and had it hanging in my old room
I guess I'm saving it for when I
decorate the walls to my new room below
my tops is this plastic dresser in the
first drawer I keep my accessories in
the second drawer on my foldable shirts
and tank tops and in the third drawer
are my pants and leggings moving on to
the next side I have a random assortment
of clothes on the top shelf I keep my
hats and headwear in the big basket are
my hats and beanies in this other basket
are my caps ear muffs cat ears and
Leonard my white tiger stuffed animal
I found him while cleaning my old things
at my old house and it brought back so
many memories that I cried I love this
thing so much when I was little so I
keep it here cuz it makes me happy
moving down I keep my skirts hanging on
the right and on the Left I have a
hanging shelf where I keep my scarves
cardigans long-sleeve shirts and socks
check out my socks I am so proud of them
so the right of my socks is my drawer
with more unique socks and stockings I
like that they could line up on the same
level like that going down the drawers
are my underwears and bras so I won't
show those and I keep my shorts and
foldable skirts in the bottom drawer in
the last two shelves on the left I keep
a couple maxi dresses that are too
delicate to be hung and a couple scarves
that I don't wear as often alright let's
swing over to the other side here I hang
all my dresses from formal to casual
long to short on the other side I keep
all of my outerwear on top I have my
hoodies crewneck sweaters and then knit
sweaters in the drawers below I keep
workout clothes / pajamas the top drawer
are my lighter workout tops the second
drawer are warmer and thicker tops and
the bottom drawer is where I keep my
sweats and workout pants and shorts it's
funny because I've decluttered more than
half of my wardrobe and now I have
almost double the space I used to have
but I like to be able to space out my
clothes like this so I could see my
pieces easier there's more room to
breathe and it's easier on the eyes
that's it for my closet tour please give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see more videos like this and don't
forget to check the description for
where you can get these hangers and
organizers thanks for watching guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
