sharing some lessons that I've been
relearning and ingraining in myself I've
been doing this new meditation called
the liberation Kriya and it's a
meditation for a fresh start I first
heard about it from Gabrielle Bernstein
she's a youtuber I'll put her video here
but actually her video wasn't super
clear so I found a better video taught
by this other woman who gives a better
explanation on how to do this meditation
I'm not going to teach you because I
don't feel qualified to but check it out
so this meditation is Kundalini Yoga and
so we basically have to hold a pose kind
of like this you hold it for nine
minutes and you do this meditation every
day for 40 days
if you skip a day you have to start all
over again
from day one so the first thing you're
going to notice when you try to do this
meditation is that it's hard it's hard
to physically hold your arms up for a
long period of time and I mean you're
trembling and you're trying your best
not to give up and you realize it's all
mental and what I love about the video
with the old woman teaching yoga is that
she says if you feel like you want to
put your arms down
my best advice is don't basically if
she's saying if you feel like you want
to quit don't just don't quit just keep
going because it's mind over matter and
you can do it so that's what's been
pushing me to continue this commitment
I'm on day 16 today and I've definitely
learned a lot over this two-week period
of doing this meditation so over the
course of many sessions I've developed
these mantras that I tell myself to get
me through to finish this
so most importantly my main one is
patience and perseverance you know I
just have to be patient and breathe
through it nine minutes is a matter of
time so it's only a matter of time
before the nine minutes is up and it'll
all be over so I just have to be patient
and sit through it and perseverance is
to just simply keep pushing to not give
up and to be mentally strong it's
basically being strong up here so that
your body can take it down here and it
really works patience and perseverance
another thing that I've been telling
myself that's been extremely powerful is
that you're not going to die this is not
going to kill me like sitting here for
nine minutes with my arms up is not
going to kill me as bad as it hurts as
hard as it is to stay still everything
so what doesn't kill you makes you
stronger right I tell myself that I'm
not gonna die in this nine minutes so
the only outcome is that I'm gonna be
stronger from this and I'm going to grow
and that's pretty exciting that you know
I know that out the finish line I'm
going to gain something I'm going to
take a little step further and improve
myself and I have you know over these 15
days I've definitely developed muscle
like this muscle whatever the skull is
like rock-hard now and like more and
more you become stronger and stronger
physically and mentally and now when I
do this meditation it doesn't hurt and I
don't have trouble with it physically
now it's more about mental and it's
about being patient now and just sitting
through
minutes of time so I feel like I've
gotten over the first hurdle with this
meditation and I I feel like maybe like
every quarter every ten days you'll
learn something new from it but it's
been pretty cool to try this out and
experience it and learn new things from
just a simple 9 minute exercise that you
do every day so I guess the main things
that I want to share today were the
points patience and perseverance if it's
not going to kill you it's really going
to make you stronger and it's a very
exciting thought that if you don't give
up then the only outcome is you're gonna
grow and you're gonna keep getting
stronger and stronger and stronger every
day so it can only go up from here so
don't give up because if you give up
then you have to start all over again
right so I think it's pretty cool I just
wanted to share that bit with you my
journey what I'm going through right now
let me know if you guys thought that was
interesting let me know if you're gonna
try out the meditation in the comments
but check it out do your research I'll
put some links in the description box
for what I read or the videos that I
watched thanks for watching I will be
uploading a video every Wednesday so
