it's Aileen today I wanted to share a
little exercise that I got from the
artists way by Julia Cameron
it's called imaginary lives so this is
just something that's fun to spark your
creativity spark some inspiration in you
especially if you're the type that's
passionate about so many different
things so the question is simple is just
if you had a five imaginary lives what
would you do come up with at least five
imaginary lives of course you can come
up with more if you want I have like ten
or more but yeah it's just a way to
brainstorm hmm if I got to live out all
of these different lives what else would
I do with my life so personally if I got
to live out imaginary lives I would be
an interior designer because I really
like beautiful spaces and one thing I
really admire on me song from song of
style she's a fashion blogger but I
think she's an interior designer or
architect by trade and I think that's
super cool if you watch her videos on
her house renovation and her spaces
they're just gorgeous and I think it's
so cool to be able to like create a
beautiful space like I just like that
another thing I could do is probably be
a photographer I love taking photos I
think it's similar to doing videos so
yeah recently I've been getting into
flowers so another like ideal imaginary
life I would live is to be like a
florist for like huge luxury events like
not even weddings the like celebrity red
carpets where you have like giant floral
installations and very like high-class
stuff like I would love to do something
like that I think that's cool that also
goes with like creating pretty spaces
another thing I would definitely do is
be a musical theater performer I love to
sing I love to dance I love to act and I
really like theater and I think it's so
fun to like perform live so that's
something that is up there I would also
be a film colorist these are the people
who color grade films like they don't do
the shooting or anything it's all
production where all you do is you just
change the colors of the scenes to
change the mood I think that's super
cool I love color grading and I guess
that's kind of what I do with YouTube
already but like just to do it for films
like I think that would be really cool
another thing I love is skin care so
it'd be super cool to be like a skin
care chemist I'm not sure if that's a
real job title but like whoever's like
making those serums lotions face masks I
just think that's super cool to like
concoct things and also source like
organic high-quality ingredients for
your products and stuff like that would
be a pretty fun job lastly I love hotels
and resorts and just the clean fresh
luxury feeling that those places give so
an ideal life would maybe be like a
hotel designer or like build a bunch of
like hotels and resorts like how cool
would that be actually I was like
considering going to hospitality school
when I was like applying for college but
in the end I decided not to go to like
Cornell for hospitality I decided to go
to USC for business and I do not regret
it like it's fine I don't need to do
hotels I love what I do now so if you
want to join in on this exercise I'd
love to hear what your imaginary lives
are so make a list give me at least five
comment below with your five or more
imaginary lives and then once you're
done making your list look at each
imaginary life and ask yourself is there
something that I could be doing in my
current life that is related or similar
to that imaginary life I don't mean
pursuing it as a career I mean doing
something for fun so one of my imaginary
lives was to be like a florist for big
events well I don't have to be that but
what I can do is I can go into my
backyard clip some roses and put
together a little bouquet for myself
little things like that also with like
skincare chemists I can totally like
research and learn about skincare test
them out on my own which I already do
already and most of my things in my
imaginary lives I already do with
YouTube like color grading taking photos
and designing spaces I mean actually for
something like that interior designer
imaginary life I would probably
recommend
spending a day to redecorate your room
or rearrange your space things like that
where you can kind of dabble a little
bit into all of those imaginary lives
that you're interested in because it
does reflect who you are it reflects
what you're capable of and it doesn't
mean like you're not allowed to do it
because you're heading on this one path
like definitely there are no rules to
life you could be pursuing one career
but you can be pursuing a lot of
different hobbies on the side or just
pursue whatever little things that bring
you joy in your day it doesn't have to
be so serious just think about it as
like just a way to live out all your
little passions and stuff like I said
this is like perfect for people who have
a lot of interests a lot of passions
because it's a good way for you to you
know explore what else you're possibly
curious about what else you could be
good at what else brings you joy so I
highly encourage you guys to try to do
something as this week related to one of
your imaginary life so definitely write
the list
comment below but this week your
challenge is to pick one imaginary life
and do something similar to that vein
