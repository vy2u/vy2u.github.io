today I'm going to share my 2017 current
me versus future me that I'm doing in my
artist of life workbook so I've shared
about this exercise before you can watch
that video the link is down below but
basically currently versus future me is
something I've been doing since 2012 and
it's a way for me to reflect on where I
am now versus where I want to be and
it's nice to see like a visual
representation of how I've grown through
the years
so here's my artist of life workbook
super proud of it and flipping through
the current me versus future me page but
you guys can use any notebooks literally
you can just find a notebook that has
two pages laid out side by side so you
can draw a current me on one side and
future me on the other so usually you
start out with the current me and do
your best to draw your current self as
you look like right now because it
brings that real aspect to it so I'm
drawing myself please don't judge my
artwork I'm like not an artist in that
way and drawing my fluffy socks that I'm
wearing at the moment because it's real
all right so when you're done drawing
yourself you just start filling out the
page with how you feel right now like
where your life is a picture of how
things are for you so for me I feel like
2017 is my year things are going good
with Ladd and there I have momentum and
I'm creating constantly but on the other
hand I feel like I'm getting very busy
and I'm feeling tired all the time
so actually I find myself dreaming and
wanting to live slower and kind of step
back have more time to do things just
for fun to explore my creativity just
for fun and simplify my life I'm also at
a place where I'm getting a lot of ideas
lately creative ideas which is not
necessarily a bad thing
I can't complain and also I'm like super
grateful for everything I have in my
life right now my family my friends my
boyfriend I have an awesome support
system and all of you guys online I am
so inspired and empowered by all of you
and our Facebook groups are just amazing
also I am not that healthy lately I need
to do a better job at taking care of my
body so I'd like to be more fit at the
moment and my biggest challenge of the
year is I want to write a book this year
and key word here is challenge because
it's hard it's not easy I've been
wanting to do this for
so long and I think my biggest challenge
is I need to find a way to make time to
write the book because I feel like I
have a lot of content that I'm creating
consistently and it's hard to find those
pockets of time you really have to
prioritize and lately I've been meeting
and connecting with more and more
inspiring people which is super awesome
and here I'm writing about how I'm lazy
in my self-care because I'm not where I
want to be there but in general I'm
happy with where I am I do have some
struggles with time management and
figuring out how to get everything done
but in general I'm pretty confident
right now I feel like I'm focused on
just growing what I have and very
thankful for what I do have
okay now it's time to draw the future me
the me I aspire to be
so here again please don't judge my
drawing because I can never do myself
justice I always have like high hopes
for what I want to look like in the
future I want to be super stylish super
chic super confident and of course
healthy strong and fit
so in general I love to live a life
where I am balanced and at peace and
most importantly free freedom is so
important to me because I just want to
live a life where I have financial
freedom I don't want to worry about
money I want to have creative freedom
location freedom time freedom basically
I'm just that kind of person I want to
be able to do whatever I want whenever I
want however I want so in my dream life
I am constantly inspired and I get to
spend most of my time just creating art
and having fun with life I want to be
truly living in that way ideally I have
a small team that supports my business
and it's going to be virtual and remote
because I'm not the kind of person that
wants to go into an office every day and
again healthy vibrant glowing having a
lot of energy and again focusing on
lavend dare hopefully in the future
it'll just be a bigger community
spreading more positivity empowering
more people and I really want to empower
people within the community to take real
action to make real positive change in
the world I think I can't do it all so
I'd love for people to step up and help
make things happen together I think
that'd be awesome
also a big part of my dream life is to
be an author and a businesswoman with
best-selling books and to be able to
create products that can genuinely help
people and enhance their lives in some
way I just really want to live a life of
abundance where I'm putting good out
into the world constantly I also want to
travel often so a big part of my dream
life is to volunteer abroad and in the
future I want to build schools and
empowering programs that can help people
from all over the world
lastly I want to be more chic stylish
and eco-conscious I do want to live a
beautiful lifestyle but at the same time
I want to be socially responsible and
live a life where I have like art in my
home and pretty cultured and stuff like
that and of course self-care and
self-love is super important to me and I
want to be better at that as always I
still want to be learning growing
reading constantly because that's always
just a big part of my life so there you
have it
current me versus future me and this
time I decided to do a little bit extra
I pulled out my notebook and I decided
to jot down notes on how I could close
the gap between my current self and that
future I feel self so as I was
brainstorming I found that it was pretty
obvious what areas I needed to work on
in order to achieve that future self so
for example like I needed to be better
at time management finding a team so
that I can make more time for myself and
also being healthier finding a healthy
and fit routine things like that but I
hope you like today's exercise if you
decide to do a current me versus future
me feel free to tag me at lavender thank

lot alright bye guys
