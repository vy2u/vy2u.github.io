I'd share this DIY rose oil as a fun way
to preserve your Valentine's roses for
much longer
or maybe this recipe will be a good
excuse for you all to go out and buy
yourself some roses why not you deserve
it
this rose oil can be used for
moisturizing and pampering your body
hair and nails it's all natural and
super easy to make
first heat up a pot of water while you
wait for the water to boil pick 2 to 3
organic roses to prepare one cup of rose
petals
then have some fun shredding those rose
petals once the water is boiling turn
off the stove pour one cup of grapeseed
oil into a glass jar you can also use
jojoba or olive oil if you want add the
petals into the oil and then use a
wooden utensil to swirl them around
next cover the jar and place it into the
hot water warming the oil will help
release the scent from those petals
when the water cools down completely
remove the jar then let the jar sit for
at least 24 hours leave it in longer for
stronger results this next step is
optional use a sieve to separate the
rose petals from the oil and it's good
to go personally I prefer to keep the
rose petals in the oil I'm even adding
fresh petals because I want to let them
sit and make the oil stronger over time
I hope you liked this DIY rose oil
recipe please give this video a thumbs

is so much easier to make the link is in

Valentine's weekend bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
