hi everyone it's Eileen welcome back to
the lab and their lifestyle today I am
so so excited to have my friend
Suraj Raval so let me read his bio and
then I'll bring him in so Suraj Raval is
a data scientist best-selling author and
YouTube star who's on a warpath to
inspire and educate developers to build
artificial intelligence he'll teach you
how to make games music chat BOTS
self-driving cars and much more so me
and Suraj met at YouTube Nextup which
was basically like a week-long creator
camp at YouTube space la and he's like a
cool guy first of all he has a great
personality and the second of all he's
like so smart and he worked so hard on
everything he does online so I'm so
excited for you guys to meet him through
this podcast so hi Suraj hi hi everybody
hi lean is also awesome or just awesome
together that was a great time I used to
be I'm excited to be here I know and I
was so much fun so much fun Hey yeah so
let's talk about your background so that
you kind of get a gist of who you are I
mean I don't know much about your
background - can you talk about your
life before YouTube totally yeah
so I was born in Houston Texas to
immigrant parents from India and it was
a yeah 18 years in Houston I could not
wait to get out of there I was like man
this place is like boring and like races
so you know I just I just kept my head
down and I was like I got to go to
school so I went to school in New York
Columbia I spent a couple years there
and then I moved to San Francisco and I
started doing some contract work and
time jobs and eventually I started my
youtube channel about a year ago there's
like the highest level that was a real
quick background okay so first of all
like what did you study at Columbia and
what jobs did you have so here's how it
went down when I went to Columbia when I
was 18 all I cared about was like making
money because like my parents never had
money cause it's focused on money so I
was a finance major and I wanted to be
an investment banker but then what
happened was I got suspended when I was
a freshman for stealing a laptop I know
why he wearing ya know his first
semester and I yeah I know and I saw I
got suspended for a semester for doing
that and so then I for that semester I
couch shark around Europe for three and
a half months yeah it was pretty like
borderline homeless but like houses
shall encounter turned Europe and one of
the hosts I stayed with his name was
Alex McCall and this guy ended up
writing the book on JavaScript and
becoming this huge dude later on but he
he inspired me to study computer science
instead of finance and he showed me that
it wasn't just about making money it was
about making a positive impact in the
world so if I didn't have that you know
weird experience of getting suspended I
wouldn't have met Alex and none of this
would have happened so it's crazy how
these things you know turn out that's
crazy I mean first of all your parents
let you go to Europe after you got
suspended no think about it no
definitely not so the whole story about
my parents is like I am if you look at
me as like a you know an Asian American
an Indian American kid I'm like the
worst like child that an Asian parent
could have because I don't listen to
anything they say they said don't go to
Europe they said don't date white girls
they said don't you know you have to get
a PhD you know they said all that you
have to live near us and Houston you
can't go far I just did exactly whatever
I want to and that's I'm kind of you
know why I feel like I'm feeling success
right now yeah I mean did you always
have that like like that inner compass
like you're like I know what I'm going
to do I'm just going to do it yeah
pretty much pretty much yeah and and you
know at first I always felt you know
guilty and I
all bad about it like this is not what
you're supposed to do look at what
everybody else is doing
don't you want to be a good kid like you
know this other Indian kids my parents
would always compare me to all these
other you know Indian kids in school and
all the grades they made and stuff and
you know part of it was good because it
helps me study and get the great
necessary to go to school at Columbia
but the moments of it was just like I
don't need this you know what I'm saying
like I had I had idols growing up and I
think my idols got me through all the
bad times but I always idolized Walt
Disney and I idolized you know all these
these great people in the world and okay
and so there's actually another thing
that I want to say so when I was 18
years old I legally changed my name to
Jason Scott Revell Wow I changes on my
passport I change it on my social
security card I change it on everything
because I always wanted to do great
things and I felt like and when I was 18
growing up in Houston Texas like the
only way to do great things was to
anglicize your name to be white I wanted
that privilege I wanted to be able to do
great things without it being like oh
this Indian guy did I wanted to be Suraj
did it or the not Suraj obviously
intellection yeah exactly
so I went by that name for three years
in college I try to completely change my
personality you know I didn't want
anyone to know you know anything about
me in fact I even told people yeah but
yeah I'm not like half Italian you know
I didn't I don't know yeah you know what
I mean so I had a lot of self age I had
a lot of self a and that's something
that is pretty common I would say super
common but I know like a couple people
who have done that Asian Americans
who've changed their name from something
Asian sounding to like Jay Cameron
that's like my friend he changed that
night yeah he went from Tuan which is
like a Vietnamese ish name to Jay
Cameron and it got him better jobs in
finance and it's the thing you know like
just because it's yeah I understand but
it is very interesting
yeah for sure I legally change it back a
couple years ago yeah okay
so let's talk about your you two
channel what made you start your channel
you were working at a job doing computer
science right let's talk about actions
transition yeah so when I was in you
know I was looking for a job I got
rejected by so many jobs because I was
applying to the wrong position I was
applying to a specific role called iOS
engineering it's like making iPhone apps
I didn't really care about it and you
can really tell on my face if I don't
like something and I think the
interviewers could always tell like you
just guys not that interested
let's not in but then I applied to
Twilio as a different role when I was so
fed up okay I'm gonna apply has a
developer educator turns out that was
the role that I was best at educating
other developers and so I got that role
and I worked there for eight months
it was great team great people I learned
so much from them and then I was fired
because well there were two reasons one
is because I started my youtube channel
on the side while I was there and it was
really affecting my performance and they
like gave me some warning they're like
listen you know we know you're
passionate guy whatever but you gotta
focus on the work and I was like you
know I tried to but you know I just love
doing the YouTube channel and I also
tried to get them to make you know more
developer videos but they didn't believe
that developers watch videos can you
believe that and how did they learn did
by my success right now baby here in
blue they invade their right we don't
even need this guy look fire hammer you
know like whatever like well we'll get
someone who's focusing on the on the
writing not the videos like this is not
developers don't watch videos like food
my boss my boss was bought they all told
me this and they didn't let me speak at
the conference that everybody else had
to speak at they didn't think I was good
enough public speaker so you know as you
know some rappers would say look at me
now I'm getting paper so that's the
whole story so now are you like not
friends with anyone you're like take
that well you know I have maintained
professional relationships with people
there so yeah okay that's that's great
well you didn't really talk about what
sparked how you started your channel was
it like because you were so interested
at that job you're like oh wait I want
to do this on my own
yeah made you really start
well my boss there really showed me that
developer education with it was its core
the craft in and of itself like this is
a this is an actual skills that being
able to communicate technology is a very
unique skill set and it's an emerging
skill set as well and as technology
propagates through our industries of
everything it's going to become more and
more important and yeah like he she so
basically he was my inspiration to
realize like hey this is a thing hey I'm
good at this let me let me try to what
is a good medium for for showing this
and I thought YouTube
I thought YouTube would be that medium
and so I started making some videos at
Twilio so you know we'd spend my nights
there and I remember like the Vista like
the Hagrid of Twilio like the
groundskeeper dude he would always see
me in like the conference rooms and I
had like it's like hack to get a green
screen and life is like what are you
doing here it's like midnight on a
Saturday I was like no no no I I'm just
making a video and he's like what are
you this weird kid whatever that's the
life the life right yeah yeah so okay I
want to talk about your videos because
anyone out there listening you do have
to check out Suraj's channel i'll post a
link in my you know on the show notes
and stuff but basically I for example I
watched your latest one how to make an
image classifier and it's just like the
amount of work you put into your videos
it's crazy because first you have like
so much technical research and knowledge
behind it and have the right of script
and then you have like a mini wrap in
your videos and then you put a bunch of
like memes and montages of like
different clips of different places it's
like you're putting so much together oh
yeah and then you have to like actually
teach us how to code yeah it's a lot so
how do you what's your process how do
you handle that
well I'm first of all I really
appreciate you watching my videos thank
you so much like I'm one of those like I
know it's none of the other youtubers
like post their videos on their newsfeed
but like I don't give up I just post it
so I really appreciate yeah so how do i
how do i oh yeah I mean I um so it's
I've been doing it I release one weekly
video every week and I've been doing
that for about a year now and I noticed
myself getting better and better every
and what I try to do is challenge myself
like what is something like so I don't
get bored right like if it's too easy to
make I'll start getting bored so once I
initial videos or just you know me
coding there were that much and I was
like how can I make this more
interesting so then I started adding in
skits like how can I make this more
interesting how can I let me start
adding in you know like like intros
different things and then I think one
thing that I was the most afraid of
doing which really made me realize the
big of this bigger realization was like
adding the Rastas videos because no one
does Beth you know what I mean no one
does bellend
no one raps about something as complex
as dimensionality reduction anyways so
it was so in the audience was like I
didn't even I didn't they were blown
away but what happened was when I
started rapping that's when my channel
starts blowing up and so I realized like
you've got to do what only you can do
you have a very unique skill set all of
you watching this you have a very unique
skill set you might be probably don't
even realize but when you when you find
a way to put all of those pieces
together in a way no one else does you
will find success yes oh my god that's
exactly what I was trying to get at
because it seems like you really use all
of your gifts and you bring in all of
your personality all of like your music
pays your communication skills plus your
knowledge of this coding and stuff like
everything is used so it's it's just
super cool to see you be able to use
everything that you have and like yeah I
think that's the goal that everyone
should aim for right cool put all of you
into your work yeah another question I
want to ask is like all of the stuff
that you're teaching is it stuff that
you already know and you're teaching it
or do you actually go out and learn
certain things so you can teach it on
YouTube when I first started the channel
I literally was just like super excited
about learning this stuff and basically
every week I would be like learning to
sew that because like then you don't say
what I just learned so that when I first
started a channel now you know anything
is I'm moving so fast that it's hard for
me to even realize how much that I know
now but really like for these past like
10 videos I haven't done any research
from what I've learned over the past
year if you like teaching something such
it's like literally the best way to
learn anything I agreed I thought how I
am with my videos too because whatever
issue I'm going through and whatever I
need to learn I make a video about that
so it's like a way to teach myself as
I'm teaching other people yeah yeah and
have you found yourself like getting you
you you understand it better like when
you teach it yes and something I do is I
go back and I watch my old videos to
learn from my old self okay no I just
yeah I just I know it's it's interesting
I I actually cannot watch my old videos
I'm like I'm like this is so bad like
I'm so much better now like oh yeah in
terms of video quality yeah I'm better
but because mine's personal development
like sometimes they're like lessons that
even if you've heard it before it's good
to like remind yourself of this that's
true
so when I watch like a video like two
years ago I remember what I was going to
him like oh yeah yeah it hits me again
yeah so okay another thing that I
noticed you're doing is you're teaching
a class through Udacity ya know in you
know what's so funny literally a couple
days ago I was on Facebook and it the ad
for that class popped up on my feet it
wasn't posted by you it was there ad
with all your views I was like so proud
oh my god yeah so if you want to tell us
about what exactly you're doing there
yeah so so the CEO tweeted me he's like
hey Suraj we love what you're doing and
I actually said no at the time because
I'm like you know I'm just focused on my
channel I don't want to become Udacity
Suraj but then he was like very
persistent and he's like no no no
seriously just like come meet at the
mountain view like we just want to talk
I was like all right fine
so you can meet Sebastian Thrun which is
the guy who like started Google echoes
like okay yeah I'll come yeah you know
like yeah you lured me over basically
Sebastian and the whole crew there are
just super friendly people and they
explain that you know what we're going
to let you keep your brand what will
make this Suraj Rabaul deep pointing out
like yes that's what I'm talking about
not deep learning and you know I'm just
ended but specifically Sir Roger Bowles
be fine
and how they guess I'll do it I get to
have all my videos be on my channel
they're free but like also they have
like extra content and that's what
people pay for so I've been working with
them every week on this cool so it does
it go along with the content that you
post on your YouTube yeah pretty much
yeah so I'm just I'm just doing what I
always do and then posting videos on
YouTube what they're doing is they are
in they're on their website for people
who sign up they're creating extra
content not video content but like
written content to aid students okay I
see so your videos plus some extra
content that people pay for exactly and
so what they do is they they don't even
know what our agreement was like I'm not
going to tell them the video I made so
they're just a surprises everybody else
in the video comes out that's so funny
right yeah didn't they have to make
content around that like oh he's using
you know this library now like all right
let's put rush to make some homework on
this and so does that mean you have to
like show them your video beforehand
before you post it or is it really like
literally when you posted it literally
Frank you agree right there yeah oh my
gosh
okay that's cool though okay I so can
you just like briefly explain what is
deep learning yeah totally
so deep learning is a new technology
that let computers learn so anything
like when we think about programming we
think about okay like let's say I want
to you know code a baseball game like
you know I want to make a little
baseball game so then I would say like
first I'm going to code you know what
the map looks like and all the graphs
are be there and then I want colors I
want people then I'm going to code the
game rules and I'm going to code you
know the players but that's that's the
traditional way of thinking about
programming like step by step
instructions but deep learning is
instead of saying like here are all the
steps to reach this outcome which the
outcome would be to have a baseball game
here's the outcome have a baseball game
learn all the steps you need to create
the baseball game so it's instead of
writing out all the steps we write these
very small rules like I want it to be a
big map like very generic rule but I
want there to be a big map and I want
there to be ten players and I want it
and a computer will learn all the steps
to generate a game just like that
and we found that this is being used
across every industry and this is going
to take over all of computer signs
everything is going to be learning it's
gonna be learning and adapting to our
needs in real time Wow okay I see how
that relates to AI and like you know
self-driving cars things that disease is
it kind of like they learn through
experience exactly they learn through
experience see that's cool and kind of
creepy yeah and I love yeah yeah I mean
part of the creepiness is just like we
just haven't you know it's such a new
technology and we don't have that many
people talking about it and in terms of
popular culture all we have for AI is
the Terminator and like you know
everything is just AI apocalypse
but really there's their sense that the
apocalypse would be human you know what
I'm saying it's not about the AI the AI
just does what we tell it to do the
apocalypse is like if someone bad gets
in control of his power so what we're
trying to do what I'm trying to do is
democratize it so everybody has access
to it instead of one company like you
know I won't say names like no yeah
that's true I mean but at the level
obviously these computers learn super
fast so don't you think it is like
surpasses everything like you know they
it's exponential this growth of learning
yeah I'm glad you recognized it yeah
it's totally exponential and I mean the
goal is for it to be smarter than all of
us so then it can help us solve all of
these problems that we're having a lot
of people said you know think like well
you know it's too late for climate
change it's already too late a lot of
people think you know it's too late for
you know a lot of things but with
especially because we haven't thought
about it the right way an AI could use
data that we could never even dream of
looking at because it's able to and so
and say okay this is actually how you
solve it you never thought about this
it's like oh of course definitely see
the possibility of like this changing
the world in so many ways in every
industry totally yeah yeah very exciting
all right before we go on I have to tell
you about our sponsor fresh books so if

the interview yeah so let's talk about
your life your dream life so I guess
with what you're doing now if you maybe
look forward like five years do you have
an idea of what future Suraj will fall
looks like totally so so you know James
Bond right to life yeah there there's
not a brown James Bond so like basically
I want to be brown James Fox that means
like I want to be in movies I want to be
I want to be like I want to be like
really well-known because it's not just
about me it's like we're as high as I go
I'm taking AI with me and it's about
getting AI into the public consciousness
and making it a very normal thing that
everybody understands so I will do
whatever I have to do all rap dancing do
anything I can to brings attention to
myself and in and then it has a
consequence
ai so basically when I will get my dream
life I'm like in movies and I'm like
dude have big big production projects
like Kanye West run away you like that
short film 30 minutes long nobody's so
cool to do something like that
oh my god I can totally see it it's so
cool yeah yeah cuz you're bringing a
level of entertainment to computer
science and I haven't really seen it
done right absolutely a personality like
this so you're a star dude thank you
yeah sorry
um yeah that's all so I can't wait for
you to be there and you better not
forget me oh I want no no I definitely
long yeah we taught you how to collab
with the silver hair thing I'm gonna do
your hair yeah I can do it whatever
color you want you gotta do it yeah are
you going to be up in SF anytime yeah
like I am actually but we'll talk about
that after the power I agree cool yeah
okay so last question I have for you is
what is the biggest lesson you've
learned so far in the past year
hmm Wow yeah because you've had a big
year right this was this was a huge year
can you just recap to everyone out there
what happened to you this year because
you you just started your channel and
then you did YouTube Nextup plus what
else yeah and then Elon Musk shared my
video on personal Twitter feeds of Elon
Musk watched my video oh my god you
don't know to you I you know who I am
and you know what he is he is obsessed
with AI like every single interview talk
but you know he's watching my videos you
know he's a fan my gosh that's crazy
it is crazy the White House contacted me
the chief data scientist at the White
House DJ Patil was like hey Suraj we
love what you're doing could you make a
video for data gov and he CC this other
guy and so then I was like yes
absolutely but then they but then I
never replied so but you see you have
their email and it's you know I mean
that's power
it was very absent I look like encrypted
should in the email like that's cool
yeah so the biggest lesson I've learned
the biggest lesson I've learned is
there's this popular notion out there
that you shouldn't be - you shouldn't
believe in yourself too much now that
sounds kind of like it sounds kind of
like obvious like wait what are you
talking about but like if I were to say
like you know I'm awesome immediately
that's going to put off like 30% of
people like how can you think that
you're awesome you know I don't think
but you really you have to believe in
yourself to do anything great really
like when I was making YouTube videos
that Tullio after I got fired
people were like laughing you know like
what does this guy do and get it the
people who I talk to the most like my my
most trusted friends were like
dude this YouTube thing is like not
going to work like you have to get a job
at Google like you're a smart guy like
dude do whatever no one in Silicon
Valley is doing this no one had even
thought about doing this and I just I
just I had idols and I used their
influence to to I try to copy what they
did but for different things so I just
that's the biggest thing I learned no
matter what anyone else says you have to
tell yourself that you're awesome and
just keep doing that over and over and
over again yeah I love it
so all about believing in yourself and
having that confidence even when
everyone around you tells you that
you're stupid I'm not going to be doing
this because it's so true like I see
your world the Silicon Valley world like
everybody has something better to do
whoo that's why I look at you I'm like
wow you could have done so many other
things but you chose to do a youtube
channel but in one year like look at
everything that you've done because no
one else was willing to take that risk
so it's really cool I really love that
all right so how can our listeners find
