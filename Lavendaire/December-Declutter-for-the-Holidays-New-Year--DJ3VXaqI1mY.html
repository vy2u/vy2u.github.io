my channel lavender today I wanted to do
something called December declutter
where I declutter my closet for the last
time of 2016 and start the new year
fresh so by the way if you're new here
hello welcome to my channel I hope you
subscribe and you stay for the ride I do
videos on personal growth and lifestyle
design and we try to keep it a very
beautiful loving and supportive space
here but yeah December declutter I got
this idea because I had this pillow okay
I had this pillow that I really don't
like it's like really stiff I never like
to sleep on it and I just thought why
not donate it because I don't want it
but this could be someone's treasure I'm
sure someone out there will need some
nice soft warm bedding so I thought you
know since I'm donating that might as
well donate some other stuff too so it
just was a good time to clear out my
closet again especially during the
holidays and during winter time it's
like cold and I'm cold and I have a roof
over my head I have everything that I
need I realize I'm super blessed but I
know that there are people out there who
need more than they have and so I think
it's a great opportunity
December declutter to kind of give away
the things that you don't wear anymore
all those warm clothes and warm blankets
pillows whatever it is to make somebody
else happy for the holidays also for
those of you who don't know I've been
decluttering my stuff since 2015 right
after I read that book the life-changing
magic of tidying up I have a whole
playlist of like minimalism and
decluttering videos this is like
probably my fourth or fifth iteration of
my closet but you know minimalism is a
journey and there's always room to grow
a room to improve more to declutter so
let's see what we can do today
got everything I want but I just wanna
think money can buy and go around in
circles but I just can't say goodbye to
and I know it's been
we left all the lovey I know I know if
you can't let
if only I got stomach
ah
thinking neighbor neighbor cause I don't
know how to get back to the feeling we
once I don't know
if only I got my time and line my I give
every
money made me go blind I want you if
only I could stomach
my money can buy
member
thinking neighbor and debug as I don't
know how to get back to the feeling you
want I know it
if only I could have my time and
I give everything away
for a lovesong strong
money made me go blind
if only I could stomach
my money can buy
alright I hope you liked that video
thanks so much for watching if you'd
also like to do a December declutter for
