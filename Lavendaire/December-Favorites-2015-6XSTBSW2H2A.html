favorites video it's the last video of
the year since 2015 is ending and we're
gonna move on to 2016 I'm excited this
month I don't really have any tangible
favorite products to show you guys
everything is pretty much intangible but
I guess that's okay
my first favorite of the month is the
holiday giveaway that I did earlier this
month I just really enjoyed reading all
of your comments on Instagram if you
guys don't know what I'm talking about
check out my Instagram and just scroll
through the last few posts and read the
comments of those posts I think my
favorite was probably when I asked you
guys to share your favorite healthy food
because that gave me a lot of
inspiration for like healthy foods I can
make and also your favorite quotes and
that was really inspiring just to read
through all of the comments yeah I loved
it so much so thank you guys for sharing
your comments it was pretty fun taking
all of those gifts to the post office to
send off all around the world so that
was the first time I've done something
like that my next favorite is Pantone
color of the year for 2016 I'm the kind
of person that really gets into these
things I don't know why but I enjoy
reading about Pantone color of the years
and I've been doing this for the past
few years but this year is special
because there are two colors and it's
the first time Pantone's
announced two colors as their color of
the year so the two colors are rose
quartz and serenity and right off the
bat I love those colors because I just
love pastel pretty soft colors but I
also love it because of the meaning so
Pantone usually chooses colors that
reflect what they believe is happening
in the current culture so whatever's
trending they try to kind of embrace
that within a color
the reason Pantone chose these two
colors for the color of the year is
because they feel that in this current
culture consumers seek more balanced
mindfulness and peace and so I think
that really does reflect the way society
is moving today
I'm just excited about it I love it so
much I love it so much that I decided to
make it my phone's homescreen and lock
screen so on my lock screen i have rose
quartz and on my home screen I have
serenity and these are just cropped out
from Pantone's photos they have a few
photo sets where you can download
wallpapers I'll put the link below in
case you guys want to download it as
well but I love that texture of like
sheer fabric just the movement of fabric
I think it's so beautiful that's
probably one of my favorite textures
ever so that's plus the soft colors
really really just it appeals to me so
much it I think it just reflects my
personality I like that soft dreamy feel
my next favorite is a website that I
just discovered this month
it's called Ebates basically it's a
website where you can get cash back from
shopping at stores that you would
normally shop at so like Amazon
Nordstrom Walmart etc etc so I learned
about this from another youtuber who
posted a video about it and I promise
this is like not sponsored I'm not paid
to talk about this at all but I signed
up after watching that video and I
didn't think too much about it so I
clicked through Amazon they said you
would get 10% back from Amazon home
services so I wasn't really getting
anything from home services but I forgot
about it
I bought something else on Amazon and
then I left it at that a few days later
I got an email saying that I thought
five dollars cash back from a purchase I
made that was fifty dollars so I was
like oh my god I don't know if you call
that a loophole but basically if you
shop through that button on the Ebates
website then you get that percentage
cashback even if you don't necessarily
buy the thing that they say the cashback
is for so this is kind of tricky I don't
know if that makes sense to any of you
guys but if you're doing some shopping
might as well just sign up for it it's a
bonus to get something back for what you
pay for so yeah I just thought I'd like
to share that websites because it's
something that I wish I knew about
sooner but yeah not saying you should
shop more or anything but if you are
going to shop this is just a way for you
to shops more
and save some money my next favorite is
a youtube playlist by my girl Kajal
Pandey it's called A Course in Miracles
workbook lessons for those of you who
don't know it Course in Miracles is a
book that is kind of the foundation for
a lot of spiritual teachings I don't
know how to describe it exactly because
I haven't read the book and I haven't
done too much research on it but I do
know that one of my favorite books a
return to love is kind of the
interpretation of a course in miracles
basically it's a book chock full of
wisdom but the negative side is it's
really hard to tackle and it's really
hard to get through but what's great is
Kajal makes a video for each lesson
so she's just started a couple months
ago it's so far she has about eight
videos on her playlist where she tackles
one lesson at a time and I just think
this is a great way to just get your
feet wet and start learning about the
Course in Miracles it's also very
inspiring because this wisdom is just
real it's deep and it's something that
you can really sit in and it takes time
for you to you know ingrain that in
yourself so yeah if you guys are into
that kind of stuff and check out her
playlist on YouTube all right next up my
favorite end music I've been listening
to the song on repeat it's called it's
all in vain by wet and it's definitely
like smooth R&amp;amp;B very chill I love this
girl's vocals like just listen to this
artists in general look up wet on
Spotify and their music is so cool it's
so good it's very soothing and it has
that tinge of 90s R&amp;amp;B that I love a book
that I really enjoyed reading this past
month was mini killings why not me I
love Mindy she's so funny I think this
is just a very light very fun read I
just really enjoy reading the
autobiographies from comedians because I
think their outlook on life is just
something that I kind of want to embrace
you know I want to be able to take
myself less seriously and acknowledge my
flaws but also just feel confident and
also laugh about it at the same time and
I feel like people like Mindy Kaling
me Poehler Tina Fey they all do that all
right those are my favorites from this
past month I hope you guys have a happy
new year thank you guys for being with
me in 2015 I'm looking forward to 2016
if you guys have the time or you have an
inkling to do so please leave me a
comment with what videos you want to see
from me
in 2016 I would love to know I'm
collecting video ideas and I'd love to
kind of plan out a better schedule of
videos next year yeah so hope you can
help me do that all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
