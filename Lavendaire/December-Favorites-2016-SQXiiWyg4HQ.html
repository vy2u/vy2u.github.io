today we're gonna talk about December
favorites and no I did not forget to
film my favorites it's a little late
just because like holidays everything is
just crazy and my length is thrown off
during that time so now I finally have
time to like sit down and talk about the
past month you know reflect on the last
month of 2017 so December honestly my
theme for the month was workbook like
literally everything was focused around
that 2017 Artist of life workbook and I
spent so much energy just creating it
refining it and starting that Facebook
group prepping the webinars and trying
to get the print workbooks made which
was a big big headache and a long long
process so yeah that was like a huge
learning experience for me and I don't
regret it at all because it was so much
fun super rewarding super fulfilling to
just be able to create something that
can really help you guys and create
something that I could use myself to for
this year and many years to come so I'm
just like thrilled about that workbook
and I'm so proud of it so yeah done with
that gonna leave it right there
so I'm too mighty summer favorites I did
have a few cool things happen this month
the first favorite experience of the
month was definitely getting to take a
film colouring class by this guy named
Otto he is a colorist color scientist
and he worked on a super cool project
like Marco Polo season 2 Game of Thrones
fantastic beasts and the what was it
called fantastic beasts and the blahblah
that JK Rowling movie anyway this class
was offered by YouTube space la and it
was like a full day class from like 9:00
to 4:00 but I just found like so much
passion in that class first of all
because the teacher was amazing I just
think the way that he taught color
harmony and he used music as a metaphor
so I totally understand metaphor I
totally understand music and so he
combined like color with music and it
just it was so beautiful
and I really can't begin to explain it
because then I just start teaching the
class about coloring but it was just
really really really amazing like
basically as I was watching that class I
was so inspired and I seriously
considered like could I be a film
colorist can that be my career and
although I'm not sure I would pursue it
it's something that in a second life I
would totally do it just sounds so fun
and of course I get to color my videos
here and you know moving forward I am
equipped with better strategies and more
knowledge on how to manipulate color and
tones and light and darkness to really
create a mood and emotion with my work
and it really is awesome honestly if you
guys like like to filter photos on
Instagram like you would love this class
I have loved to filter and create make
things really pretty basically and I
just I loved it I absolutely loved it it
was so inspiring not to mention I got to
meet some other cool people there my
next favorite is actually something bold
that I did to my face so basically I got
my eyebrows tattooed and I know some
people might be judging me like why
would you ever do that but I wanted it
you know I have friends who have gotten
their brows tattooed and maybe it's an
LA thing but I just feel like this year
has been the year where I started to
invest in like things that like help me
with my time like I don't want to spend
so much time I don't want I usually
spend like 15 minutes 10 to 15 minutes
doing my brows if I put on makeup and I
don't want to do that I don't want to be
lazy also I got like lash extensions
this year so I feel like lashes plus
brow tattoos like when I'm working out
wearing makeup
I still I still feel great I can wake up
and on the daily I don't really wear
makeup at all I like to keep my skin
fresh and let it breathe so yeah I
actually got my brows done by this woman
named Aria Chopra's in Beverly Hills and
she is amazing I will show you her work
I'll link it below but basically they
reached out to me to ask if I wanted to
get my brows done
and after I did some research I found
out that Daria is a teacher she has her
own Academy where she teaches other
people how to do permanent makeup and
she is just like well known and well
renowned so I trusted her so basically I
went in and I had my brows like measured
Aria has this like sticker thing that
she sticks that measures your brows and
then she kind of starts drawing the
ideal shape that might look good for
your face and then you kind of like
tweak it
tell her you want it thicker or thinner
or whatever so the whole process took
like maybe a couple hours but it didn't
hurt at all don't worry they put like an
aesthetic gel and the only thing that
was like a little bit creepy too it's
like basically it's called micro
bleeding so they use a little tiny micro
blade to draw those like fake hair
strokes and you can hear the strokes
going so it's like subconsciously I know
that like it's cutting my skin but I
mean it didn't hurt it was more like me
psyching myself out but yeah if you guys
are interested in getting your brows
done and you're in the LA area
definitely check Daria out or any of her
students because I think she has like a
whole community and she there's like a
whole hashtag based on like her Academy
so I'll post those links below all right
so next favorite I have are my favorites
in music I have a couple songs that were
on repeats this past month so the first
song is Bruno Mars if I knew and if you
watch Bruno Mars karaoke the carpool
karaoke video which if you have it you
have to watch it like that just made me
fall in love with him even more because
I think he is like a star of our
generation he's just so talented he's
been performing since he was like four
years old so he has the stage presence
he has the dance moves he has the voice
and he's just so great so if I knew was
one of the songs that he's saying in the
car with James Corden and after I heard
it I had to like find out what that song
was and it's just so beautiful I love
the doo-wop old-school vibe and after
listening to that song you really made
me like go back and listen to like
grease the musical songs and it made me
appreciate that kind of
music again and my brother came back for
winter break and basically we sang the
song will be harmonized it just for fun
and that was really nice and then it
goes city major so the next song that
was on repeats is alone by Allen Walker
so this is more like an EDM song but I
just I really like Allen Walker's ear
for music
he's like the 17 year old that came out
with a song faded that blew up and this
is like his next single I believe but
it's really good it's really fun and
it's just one of my like car jams both
of these songs are on my winter 2017
playlist on Spotify so I've created a
new playlist for this season and yeah if
you want to listen to my playlist you
can check it out links are all below
my next favorite of the month is this
probiotic supplement I got this brand
and this product from Chris Carr if you
guys don't know who she is she's a
health and wellness blogger she actually
has cancer and she's had cancer for over
ten years but she's been battling it
with her health regimens and she's just
like very inspiring
I saw her speak at super soul Sunday
with Oprah and I just blown away by this
woman literally she had an article about
gut health and how I think 80% of your
immune system is in your gut so if you
keep a healthy gut then your body will
be healthier and so the number one thing
about keeping a healthy gut is to have
probiotics which are healthy bacteria in
your gut so if you want to do more
research on this I'll link those
articles below but definitely taking
this every morning has really made me
regular in going number two TM I also
like this whole fall and winter went by
and I did
really get sick like I was never
seriously sick I think there were a
couple times where I had like just a
little bit of like sniffles or something
because I went snowboarding but I mean
aside from that I was I've been pretty
good this season like no major flus your
fevers and maybe part of it has to do
with taking this probiotic every day I
don't even take it every day I take it
most days but I think this year I want
to be more consistent with taking this
every day so yeah I forgot to mention
that in December I went snowboarding so
I'm just gonna pop this into my
favorites
too because that was super-fun the last
time I snowboard it was 2014 I actually
have my own board and boots since like
high school
I've been going since like I was a
freshman year in high school so it's
been almost like a good ten years since
I've snowboarded although I'm not very
good I'm just like average it took me
like ten years to get to this certain
skill level where I could like kind of
carve and snowboarding and this time I
took my boyfriend it was his first time
snowboarding ever and he was like scared
and he thought he would fall but he did
so well like he he'd done really well
his first run he only felt like three
times and that's like that's not normal
and by the end of the day he was
snowboarding like faster than me and he
was like anyway I don't know it was fun
it was cool to get to hang out with my
brother my boyfriend my cousins and it
was just like a quick day trip to Big
Bear but I think we definitely want to
go back this winter and snowboard more
because now my boyfriend's fallen in
love with it so yeah alright my last
favorite of the month is definitely by
far the artist of life mastermind
Facebook group just because I am just so
inspired by all of you in there honestly
if you're in that group you know how
amazing it is
I just feel humbled when I'm in that
group because you know when I'm doing
these YouTube videos it feels like kind
of a one-way communication
even though yeah you guys can comment
and I do see the same people comment
here and there I think Facebook just
brings everyone to the same level and
everyone can post and say things it's it
feels more like a community where it's
interactive and I feel like I
just the same as everyone else I'm not
any better than anyone in that group
everyone's doing cool things I think
most of what I love about it is how I
really recognize all of you guys are
human I mean obviously you're human but
it just being in that Facebook group
seeing the introductions hearing where
you're from what you're passionate about
it really brings you to life like I
maybe have seen your name on my videos
for like years but after that Facebook
group I really feel like I know you more
as a person rather than just a username
and so it's just been so amazing I can't
even begin to describe that feeling
where it's like wow these people are
cool and like we all relate to the same
things we're all interested in like
self-improvement journaling reading
health wellness like it's awesome
because I've never been able to connect
with people who are exactly interested
in the same things that I am I feel like
in my real life most of my friends
weren't any we're all different which is
great cuz we can bounce off of each
other but it's just cool because I never
recognized that there are so many people
out there in the world just like me who
literally from all corners of the world
we have people from Australia Singapore
Germany Pakistan India all throughout
America UK Canada just everywhere and
it's so cool honestly one of my life
goals was to be global and I wasn't even
sure what that meant I thought I would
let you know I wanted to travel a lot I
wanted to make friends from all over the
world and understand cultures and this
is like just like my dream come true
basically to be able to have the
supportive group of like-minded people
who are from all over the world but who
share the same similarities to want to
better themselves and do some good in
the world and it I just there's nothing
better than that it's just amazing so
thank you guys if you're in the group I
love you you know that and yeah that's
definitely like one of my favorite
things one of the things I'm most
happiest of about creating this year all
