volume two of those sound waves a series
where I share my top three favorite
songs at the moment alright so this
volume is basically all females because
I love female vocalists and I didn't
make it that way but it just turned out
to be my three most played songs of the
month so here you go the first song is
called someone new by banks and this
song I absolutely fell in love with when
I heard it I was listening to her album
and the song really stuck out because I
mean it's acoustic and her vocals are so
raw and I literally cried like multiple
times hearing the song over and over and
over again it was on repeat and it was
you know during like some rainy days in
LA and I just this a song hits me so
hard it's so good the lyrics are amazing
and normally but he listened to banks
she sings to like these dark beats and
she's kind of like underwater R&amp;amp;B
weekend ish too but she surprised me
with this song which he just did it
completely acoustic and she sounds so
good singing it it's just a really great
song you have to listen to it the second
song is called lips by Marion Hill and
Marion Hill just goes so hard I
discovered them on Spotify it's actually
a duo and the singers name is Samantha
so her name is not Marion it's just a
false
I don't know stage name this song is so
fun once I heard those hip hop beats to
Samantha's jazzy voice together it just
was like wow okay just like I remember
hearing it for the first time on Spotify
and I just couldn't stop bobbing my head
I was like wow this is really cool I've
listened to a few of their other songs
I'd recommend the other one called got
it as well
my conclusion is that Marion Hill is not
super versatile because all her songs
sound the same they have the same tempo
they use the same instruments but I mean
I think it doesn't matter because they
have that one sound and that one sound
sounds really cool and so just you know
that's their strength the third song is
called
East of Eden by gsella de gsella de is
essentially an artist that is kind of
lana del rey plus Florence and the
Machine
but with cuter and happier vocals and
that equation equals gold to me because
I love everything about that so this
song is really fun and I especially like
it because the verse and the chorus they
do a switch-up and I'm not sure how to
explain it but if you understand music
the verse has like a bass on every
quarter notes and then the chorus has a
bass on every half note so it goes from
like one two three four boom boom to
like boom okay I don't really don't know
if I make any sense at all to you guys
but just listen to the song and you
might know what I'm talking about
because when songs do that switching
thing like it just is super head bobbing
action in the chorus because you just
like whoa and it's just that it's so fun
if you still don't know what I'm talking
about after listening to the song
there's also another song that does the
same thing it's called new scene by
Felix Cartal so listen to that one and
listen to is Ella day and you will know
what I'm
talking about so there you go those are
my top three favorite songs of the
moment of the month of December actually
please let me know which one is your
favorite out of the three and also let
me know what have you been listening to
lately because I love to discover new
music so if you like my taste in music

else I think that's about it so I will
