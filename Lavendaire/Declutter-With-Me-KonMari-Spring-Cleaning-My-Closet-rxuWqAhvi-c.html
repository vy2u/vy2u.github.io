Welcome back to Lavendaire.
Today I am back at my home.
This is my old bedroom.
I'm actually back for the week to record podcasts since it's quieter here.
The sound quality is a lot better here.
As I'm here, I thought I might as well go through and declutter my old closet,
do some little spring cleaning.
Today's video is in collaboration with Myka Stauffer.
She's also another YouTuber who does a lot of KonMari, declutter videos, clean with me videos.
And she's just a very sweet mom.
She has so many kids.
She has a baby that she recently adopted from China, and she's just a really cute person.
So check out her channel.
Check out her video where she's doing some spring cleaning as well.
With this closet I actually do want to keep some clothes here for when I come home.
I have clothes that I can use to work out
or go out in briefly.
But I know I don't need that many clothes
in there.
So today we're just gonna go through everything,
dump everything out KonMari style.
Hopefully my life will change again after
tidying this time.
Just a quick tour of the closet.
I have these tops.
I would say I took half of my closet away.
This side I have some dresses left.
On this side I have some jackets and stuff.
I also didn't pack a tripod or any of my main cameras.
This is just a temporary vlogging camera that
I'm just using today.
But when you have nothing, you just stack boxes.
Okay, I didn't think that I had that many
shirts, but taking the clothes off one hanger
at a time, my arm got tired.
So maybe that is a little bit too much.
Okay I think I'm gonna get started with the
outerwear here, because it's gonna be spring
and summer soon, so I don't think that I need to stay warm in LA.
I probably won't be wearing these jackets
and coats, so it'll be easiest to start with that.
Again, the process is: I'm gonna pick up each
of clothing and ask &quot;Does this spark joy?&quot;
and if it does, then I'll put it in the yes pile.
If it doesn't, then it goes in the declutter/donate pile.
Actually this does spark joy because I got
this when I was in Italy, and I think that it's
a fun color for a blazer.
This one does not spark joy.
You know how some clothes are a waste?
You buy them and then you never really wear them.
And you keep it because you think that you'll
wear them someday, but you don't.
To be honest, these sweaters are mostly sentimental sweaters.
These are college, dance team, friends' brands.
So I think I'll be keeping most of these.
Okay, I'm gonna move onto this pile now.
These are, I guess, vests and dresses and tops, and then my folded clothes.
There was a time I thought vests were so cool, like these random fabric vests.
I had so many and I kept two of my favorites, but I really haven't worn them since like 2012.
So far, that's the keep pile.
Over here is the discard pile.
Alright now we're moving onto the folded clothes.
I'm just a lazy person.
I don't want to unfold them and fold them
again, so I'm just gonna keep them folded.
Alright, last section are the PJs and workout
clothes, so let's get to it.
Honestly, I love PJs and workout clothes because I love comfortable clothes to lounge around in.
Especially the clothes that I'm picking to
keep at this house are really just comfortable
workout and sleep clothes.
That's really my priority.
I forgot to mention that I already decluttered a little bit previously, because usually every once in a while,
I'll just go pick out the stuff I don't wear
anymore and put it aside.
These were bags that I haven't donated.
I just kept them aside.
This bag of clothes and then another small
stack of clothes.
I'm gonna add that to this current discard pile.
Can I just say that I feel like a lot of the
clothes that I've decluttered are black or
muted colors
or very old, low-quality clothes that have
just been really worn out.
And I feel like I'm really decluttering and
clearing out the old energy that I've had.
I think I was a different person when I bought
these clothes, and now my style is more bright,
fun, playful with fashion.
And I want to wear more bright colors I guess.
I feel like I'm at a happier place and so
my clothes reflect that.
Also, the clothes that I'm trying to buy now
are more high quality, because a lot of these
clothes are really cheap and poorly made.
So yeah, I think my taste is geared more toward
high quality clothes, fashion.
Maybe because I'm more mature, but I like
to think it's because I'm leveling up in life.
Alright, so now I'm gonna put all of these
clothes back in the closet,
and for any clothes that I especially like,
I'm gonna put those in a pile to bring to
my apartment.
Okay, final look.
Ended up with this many hanging shirts.
And then that many shirts.
And then this many shorts and pants.
Over here, we have some coats and kimonos, stuff that I like but aren't really gonna wear right now.
Those are some sentimental sweaters.
Notice I put them all on one side and it's
empty the rest of the side.
Sentimental tank tops go here.
Dance.
And these are sleeping and workout tops.
And then I have just a couple pajama pants,
a couple pajama shorts.
Alright we're done decluttering for today.
I feel like I got rid of 35 to 40% of the
clothes that I had in that closet, which is
pretty good by my standards.
What's nice is I have a lot of extra hangers
in that closet now that I could just bring
over to my new place.
Don't forget to check out Myka's spring cleaning video.
I'll link it right here and also down below.
Let me know if you like decluttering videos
and if you want to see more.
I feel like now, I am so used to decluttering
and cleaning that I don't feel the need to
vlog it all the time.
I just did this one because it's like spring
cleaning theme.
But yeah, how are you guys in your tidying,
decluttering journey?
Let me know.
I feel like this is the perfect time to just
freshen up your space
because it really does make you feel like
a weight is lifted off your shoulders and
it makes you feel like you're ready for a
new start.
So hope you guys enjoyed this one.
I'll see you next time.
Love you.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
