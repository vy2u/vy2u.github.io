addition to my room it's a corkboard map
where I'm going to store all my precious
memories from travel and life I'm super
excited about it if you've seen my room
tour video you know that I've kept my
walls white for the longest time because
I was scared to commit but today I'm
just going to take you to decorate with
me so the first step was to take out the
cork board pieces and arrange them in
the right way so this was pretty fun
it's kind of like a puzzle
to decide where to put it on the wall I
decided to use scotch tape first so that
I could like change it if I wanted to
before committing once I felt like it
was right it was time to commit I love
that these are peel-off stickers because
it just makes it so easy for me to stick
on
I was kind of being a little
perfectionist I wanted to get everything
at the right angle at the right distance
and spacing just to the best of my
ability now it's time for some Polaroid
so I did not use the camera but instead
I used this insect printer that prints
photos from your phone I thought that
was super cool it's so convenient
because we have so many great photos on
our phone and you can also reframe the
photos to however you like and then
print it out which was really really
helpful so I already pre selected photos
to print out these are photos from my
travels and I'm mostly focused on the
people from my travels and the memories
that I created with them instead of
focusing on like monuments and things
because to me the people are more
important because people that I love in
my life they're near and dear to my
heart so I wanted to remember all the
moments of joy with these people in all
of these different places the exception
being Milan I decided to print out the
Duomo because I studied abroad in Milan
and it's a place that's near and dear to
my heart
so here are all the photos and now it's
time to put the pictures up so I wasn't
sure if that was Iceland but since it
looked similar to where it would be I
put my photo from the Blue Lagoon up on
that part of the map I had a photo that
we took from filming picture Taipei and
I realized that there was no Taiwan on
this map because I was like a small
island next to China so I decided to put
this photo just where Taiwan would have
been next is a photo of my parents my
dad lives in Shanghai actually so I
wanted to put that picture in Shanghai
when we went to visit him and if this is
the point where I realized like these
Polaroids are really big and the map is
too small so we're just going to take up
all of China here it only looked so
small on the map as well but yeah
putting up Milan for the memories I had
a photo with my friend in Verona so I
realized that I should probably pin the
two photos
number one area because they're both
Italy technically next up is this photo
of my mom and my cousin when you were in
Japan it's a photo of them laughing
while walking up the stairs and it's an
actual candid photo and it makes me so
happy to look at it because I love them
both so much and they just look so happy
then I have a photo of me and my girls
having hypee in London's so yeah I
realized that just three photos took up
a lot of syrup I wonder what this map
will look like you probably won't even
be able to see the map after I add
photos to this being I decided to put a
picture of my family on the right on top
of China just because I felt like it
balanced it out plus I had another photo
of us that I was going to put on the
California side by this time I realized
I have too many great photos from
California and not enough space so I
picked for one of Coachella one of my
cousins one of my boyfriend and one of
my family and I just put those four as
close to California as I could on that
side of North America but obviously
there's not enough space but I still
think that this looks really cute and
it's really simple so far this makes me
really happy to look at and I can't wait
to add more photos and more precious
memories onto this map
