thought I'd show you a quick little tour
of my desk this is where I work almost
all the time someone requested that I do
how to organize your study desk video so
I thought it'd be a fun thing to just
show you where I work how I organize my
things and where the magic happens
you
so first of all this chair that I'm
sitting in is like my favorite chair
ever I've talked about it on my November
favorites video it's just so comfortable
and so sturdy I can sit here all day and
not get tired of it
so usually right in front of me I have
my laptop I do all my work here
bla bla bla laptop so to my right I'll
usually have my planner this is my Muji
2016 planner this is what I use to get
an overview of what I have to do this
week here I just put like the things I
have to do during the week and here I
put like what I need to focus on what my
goals are for the week are and over here
I'll have my notepad of my daily to-do
list this is where I put down like just
everything that I need to do during the
day starting from what's important to
the least important so I had an original
notepad that came with this cute little
foot board and I ran out of that paper
but I found a new notepad to go with it
I just really enjoy having my daily to
do's and once I'm done I just rip it off
throw it away and then start out the
next day here is an acrylic stand that I
got off Amazon it's actually bigger than
I liked but I bought it so I'm going to
use it here I have what I know for sure
by Oprah this is one of my favorite
books and I just keep it here just
because it gives me good vibes and I
enjoy reading the quotes from here this
is a notebook that I use to take notes
on meetings and calls and video ideas
just random thoughts this is my morning
pages notebook if you guys have watched
my morning pages video this is like
maybe like my seventh or eighth morning
page composition notebook
I love morning pages and back here I
just have some scratch paper it's really
cute this is like from when I was in
elementary school but I found it and I
like it and I just use it when I need
scrap paper here I keep my collection of
Muji pens I absolutely love Muji pens
this is like half of my collection but
these are my most views pens I love
switching up the colors whenever I do
morning pages and the kind of thing I
have some scissors sharpies
highlighters and a ruler just for my
writing needs so here's a candle that my
friend jazz made you guys might know her
as life by jazz it says love over fear
I don't really burn candles but just the
saying makes me happy and it's a really
nice reminder to keep on my desk this is
like a cell phone holder that I got from
Japan it's made from a really light wood
I bought it at like a street market um
but I just thought it would be cute to
put post-its in there and be organized
in that way and then over here I keep a
post-it that says the action is here and
it's just a little reminder for myself
to focus on the present moment and
handle the work that I have in front of
me so if you guys listen to magic
lessons the podcast by elizabeth gilbert
you'll know where this is from but this
is just a saying that really inspires me
and empowers me to like get to work over
here I have this new diffuser it's a
yuzu citrus fragrance diffuser by bloom
I just got this like a couple days ago
but I'm obsessed with the smell it
really smells so fresh and sweet and it
makes me very energized and excited to
work on my desk this is my lamp it's a
LED lamp that I really love because of
its shape it looks like a lily flower I
talked about this in my November
favorites so you can check it out there
as well
and there you have it a tour of my study
desk or work desk I will post the links
to where I got everything in the
description so if you're curious you can
check it out there thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
