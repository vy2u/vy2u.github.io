cold here compared to Taipei but I'm
really happy because it's been raining
in Taipei so we love the rain and we
came here so first things first we're
headed to eat Korean BBQ it was funny
because I asked our MV landlord where
can we get Korean BBQ and he gave me
this look like you need BBQ yes exactly
that's what I like so off we are walking
oh here we are okay
on our first day we met up with my high
school friend
young Jenna was so kind to take us
around the city as our tour guide and
translator
so far feels really clean open and it's
kind of like a New York but in Asia
while we were there a woman came up to
us and gave us these beautiful handmade
paper lotuses I thought that was so
special the random acts of kindness
really made my day and it just made this
place that much more magical
we stopped for coffee in this
traditional Korean house turn cafe in
hanok village here's a tour of the
inside so you can get a feel for what
homes used to look like in the area so
cute and unique and here we are planning
what to do this week Kim really went
above and beyond and helped us organize
our entire trip best tour guide ever I'm
so grateful for kind people in the world
like him and the woman from the temple I
mean such good people all around the
world and I just want to share that
magic with you all our last stop of the
day with this artsy area called Ames ago
this place was so cool but unfortunately
my camera ran out of battery I can't
wait to share more of Seoul with you all
in episode 2 in the meantime you could
watch my adventures in Taipei thanks for
watching love you all and I'll see you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
