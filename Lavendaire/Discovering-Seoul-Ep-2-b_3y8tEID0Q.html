building which is will be big
entertainment company in Korea so we're
gonna check that out and then we're
gonna go kay we just settled into our
new Airbnb apartment in Seoul and it's
so cute
we had a life record of elevators on the
way here so we took a metro it's only
one metro stop away and so we had all of
our luggage and what happened is we went
through eight elevators
to get here so one from our old
apartment six within the metro system
and transferring and everything and then
once more here but finally over here so
cute right
so we had this rice cake vendor right
outside of our apartment and it was so
good like we were so addicted we went
back for it multiple times the rice
cakes are warm
chewy and stretch and this delicious
spicy sauce and these reviews are proof
that this place is the real deal
so we're at the National Museum of Korea
exploring and we're about to go inside
but it feels so spacious and monumental
here it's really awesome
but we are exploring Itaewon this is the
foreign area of Seoul right and we got
some bomb Mexican Korean fusion food
called chorion oh and now we're just
walking down this alleyway it feels like
London so maybe they got that influence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
