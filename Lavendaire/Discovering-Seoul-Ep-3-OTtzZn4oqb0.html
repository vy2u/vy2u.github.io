bakhoum palace this is the biggest
palace in Seoul and it's the made one
although there are many palaces in the
area so we're in the back of the palace
and this is a place where the king and
queen and/or the king and his concubines
would go on dates and it's so cute here
this is totally a date place
all right so right now we are exploring
Kiawah women's university area even for
stories and there's a lot of street food
and shoe shops in this area
trigonometrically exhausted right now
but we're gonna be troopers and keep
exploring so right now we are at you
while women's university and this
building is famous because it looks like
when Moses parted the Red Sea and so
it's pretty gorgeous to just stand here
between these two buildings that look
like water because they're like glass
and well lit basically there's like
restaurants cafes libraries and a
theater just a bunch of stuff here how
awesome would it be to go to school here
what's up guys today we are shopping in
young goat and Yun dressed up for the
occasion look at him so sticky and
wooden Dorothy's here
and we're on a mission we're gonna find
skincare contacts and classes for me
I believe it's been less than two hours
and we already did our damage it's
really fun to shop here it's really easy
all the skincare stores are right next
to each other and they have multiple
along the same line and they if you
spend over 50,000 won then you get a tax
refund let's say you can't get it but
there's a lot of like beauty components
notice but it could be feel overwhelming
but if you know what you want to get
then you can make that up all these
doors and should it be to that free
samples the more you spend the more
samples you get I'm so excited to try no
it's all about the faithful yes
we are checking out the lantern festival
and chungu Chowan River I've totally
butchered that I don't know how to speak
Korean Who am I
but apparently this is like a long
stream where they have lanterns on the
water and it's really beautiful
total date place super romantic
