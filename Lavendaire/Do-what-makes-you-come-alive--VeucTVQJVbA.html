sweaty in my car but I feel like this is
the best place to vlog right now so
lately I've been feeling a little
unmotivated not really in the mood to
work and it part of it could be because
I just went on a big Europe trip that
kind of reset my life and also like a
bunch of other stuff that I mentioned in
my podcast episode 11 on motivation but
what I've been realizing these past few
days through like writing morning pages
and meditating it's really that I need
to start doing more things that make me
come alive and I think that's how I'm
going to find that momentum of that
inspiration again so I've realized that
I've had these things on my list for so
long basically there are like things
that I would love to do just for fun
just because I want to do them things
like painting taking a dance class going
to the Getty Museum etc these are all
things that I've written and on my to-do
list seems like the beginning of the
year and I haven't done them because
work and social life has really gotten
in the way which I know is not a good
excuse
basically this is me and a part of my
journey where I'm realizing that I've
been focusing too much on like career
goals and I really need to like step
back from doing so much and really give
more time to myself because self-love is
really important and it's really
important to just do things that make me
happy and actually follow through with
them instead of just keeping them on a
list for later on because later on may
never come you really have to make time
for these things that you've always
wanted to do for example today I plan on
finally going to the Getty Museum which
is probably the most famous museum in
but I've lived in LA all my life and the
Getty has been on my list of places to
go to since like college was which was
like eight years ago
oh that sounds weird anyway I have never
gone and today I feel like I have to
finally go it's been on my bucket list
for too long I need to just make time to
do the things that make me happy that
make me come alive that make me feel
inspired so
