most days no makeup repeating my outfits
and don't even get me started about my
hair I never know what to do with my
hair I'll be honest I don't always feel
pretty just pretty lazy recently I
watched a Mimi Ikon video about why you
should always dress your best she says
every day is a special occasion
every day that you're alive you should
be presenting your best self to the
world I always talk about self-love and
inner beauty but I can't deny that
feeling pretty can boost your mood and
enhance your confidence and note that
I'm saying feel pretty because sometimes
people can look pretty but still feel
otherwise today I'm going to share a few
things that make me feel pretty using
some of my favorite Korean beauty and
skincare products from yes style
skincare is my favorite way to pamper
myself I love layering on the products
to nourish my skin so here I've already
washed my face and swiped some toner on
now I'm going to use the Misha time
revolution essence which is one of the
most popular Korean skincare products
out there it's known for repairing your
skin using fermented yeast and guys this
thing works wonders then I'm going to
apply this super aqua watery cream by
nature Republic which is great for
combination skin and just feel so
refreshing and hydrating next I'm going
to use the Linney's lip sleeping mask oh
my gosh guys this is like my favorite
product to use right now it's like this
thick lip balm that you wear before you
sleep that nourishes your lips overnight
it's so great if you have chapped lips
at night so even though it's still
daytime I still like to use it and just
wipe it off whenever I need to
putting on basic makeup even on days
where I don't leave the house can really
boost my confidence first I'm going to
prime my face with this cushion primer
by Innisfree and industry is like one of
my favorite Korean skincare brands that
I've discovered when I was in Seoul now
I'm going to use my favorite cushion of
the moment which is the w lab snow CC
cushion in number 23 so I used to use
the lineage cushion but after I got
darker over the summer I now use the W
lab one because the colors darker and
suits me better then I'm going to pop on
my brows I wish it were that easy in
real life and then of course I got to
have my eyeliner so I always prime my
eyes before applying liquid liner and
that's just how it stays on forever
and once I get started I just can't help
myself I got to contour my face a little
bit then it's time to highlight so here
I'm using the W lab 3d highlighter stick
and highlighter just make me so happy
because I love seeing my skin shimmer in
the light it's just so fun next I'm
going to pop on this royal lip tint
honey balm it's like a really pigmented
lip balm that is made from honey so it's
really smooth really moisturizing
another simple way to feel pretty is to
give your nails some love and care so
first I'm going to use this neo gen
cuticle smooth away essence which is
like a thick gel slash oil that
nourishes your dry nails and cuticles I
kind of neglect my nails I'm usually
wearing like chipped nail polish or
nothing at all but I have to admit it
does feel nice when your nails are
freshly done like you just feel pretty
and you're like so ready to be a hand
model for Instagram photos pretty also
goes beyond what the eye can see
sometimes all you need is your favorite
scent to make you feel beautiful it
really is the little things so these are
just a few things that make me feel
pretty confident and powerful let me
know in the comments what simple things
do you do that make you feel pretty
thank you guys so much for watching and
thanks to YesStyle for making this video
possible I hope you have a beautiful day
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
