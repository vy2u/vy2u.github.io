today we're going to talk about why done
is better than perfect and I'm going to
tell a little story so in 2013 I came
out with my first album it was called
honestly and the way it came together
was I actually gave myself a challenge
to create a birthday mixtape that year
because I just wanted to create a set of
original songs plus remixes and give it
out for free on my birthday just to see
if I could like push myself to make a
lot of new music so I gave myself a
couple months to work on all this music
and I was like cranking it out like
crazy and I did meet my deadline I
released a birthday mixtape on my
birthday in October and I thought to
myself like I already have some original
songs why not write like a couple more
to make a full album so that's what I
did I came out with the album like a
month after I did my birthday mixtape
and although it was great and I was
really proud of it I felt like I kind of
rushed through it and I didn't give it
my best work I just I mean I did the
best I could do in that given time but I
it wasn't perfect you know I knew that
if I gave myself more time it could have
been better so after that I told myself
alright I want to create a second album
one where I could really give myself as
much time as I needed to get it done
I wanted enough time to really tinker
with the music and really perfect it and
make it amazing and see how great this
album can be so spoiler alert
the second album never happened it never
came out because I just spent so many
months like playing with ideas and
tinkering and really not finishing
anything because I just had such high
expectations for myself I set the
standard so high I'm like alright I
might give myself as much time as I need
to create like amazing work and I think
I gave myself too much time
and it was never finished so the lesson
here is really done is better than
perfect it was better for me to give
myself a set strict schedule a hard
deadline to really finish a piece of
work than to give myself like as much
time as I needed to get it done there's
something called Parkinson's law that I
shared in a very old video of mine but
basically what it states is that your
work will expand according to the time
you allow it to be completed so for
example if you give yourself two weeks
to complete something it will take two
weeks to do it if you give yourself two
years to do the same exact thing then
that work will expand and fill up that
two years of time to complete so really
the lesson here is set strict deadlines
set like a specific timeline for
yourself to get things done so this time
around when I was working on my workbook
I did the same exact thing I had that
mindset because I learned that done is
better than perfect so I had the idea to
create my 2017 artist of life workbook
in around October and I knew that it had
to be out by like mid December you know
to prepare for the new year
so I had that set amount of time to get
done I procrastinated like the first
month so I really worked on it for one
month and when I made that announcement
video that I was coming out with a
workbook I actually hadn't finished the
workbook I basically like started it
before I was ready I announced it before
it was done just the fact that I
announced it before it was done it
really gave me a lot of motivation to
finish it because so many people were
you know depending on me to get this
done I was starting to take pre-orders
yeah same thing for the print workbook I
basically put out pre-orders for the
print workbook because I wanted to see
how many people were interested and I
was getting pre-orders before I even
knew how I was going to get this
workbook made so starting before you're
ready putting it out there into the
world announcing it making it public
those are things that can really put a
fire under your eyes and motivate you to
finish what
set out to finish so moving forward in
2017
my big goal this year is to finish
writing my book and honestly I've had
this goal for a while I think last year
I wanted to write the book I didn't do
it I basically came up with like a table
of contents and that's it and this year
I'm probably like scrapping that and
starting from fresh basically my goal is
to just finish the book this year it
doesn't have to be good all this book
needs to be is done because in my eyes
if you have such high expectations for
yourself if you want to make things
perfect it's never going to be finished
you're going to give yourself too much
time you're going to care about it too
much when in reality it's better to just
like do the work get it done even if
it's not perfect even if you're not
ready just do it you know I know a lot
of you have a goal this year that you
want to finish some sort of project or
maybe you want to start a blog or
whatever it may be
listen to this advice done is better
than perfect it's better to finish it
first and then you can you know tweak
and improve it later even if your
project is something that like once you
release it you can't tweak or improve it
because it's already out there that's
okay take that as a learning experience
you've had that experience of working on
something and finishing it and then the
next time you start another project you
can apply what you've learned and
improve it there and then you just have
to you know keep doing that keep
improving in little increments but the
most important thing is to just finish
your work done is better than perfect
alright I hope you guys liked today's
video let me know what you think in the
comments and also I want to know what is
the one project that you want to finish
this year post that in the comments
below and I know that just posting it
making it real that will push you to
actually finish that project even more
so good luck with all your endeavors
this year hope you have a beautiful day
I'll see you next time in my next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
