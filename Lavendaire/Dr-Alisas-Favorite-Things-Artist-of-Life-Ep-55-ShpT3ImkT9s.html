about some of my favorite things first
off I really love handmade things so
whether those you know it's cards you
know or letters so you know different
things like that
moving colors and I work with kids too
an adult
so having crayons markers colored
pencils watercolors as options those
really bring me joy when they see them
do it and I get to do with to number two
I love yoga and I in addition to
meditation I do yoga when they can and
to be really present on the mat and just
focus on the mat and your breath it's
such a relaxing experience I highly
recommend you try doing yoga
number three is a weighted blanket and
it's from a mom who I used to work with
and she has a child with autism and she
you know started a non-profit soothing
stitches project that makes affordable
low cost beautiful Inc it's for kids
because it can be super su moving you
know to help them calm down or as they
go to bed so I love to bring this to my
sessions or to use it on myself as well
number three is journals and books so I
love to write I started when I was young
in middle school when my mom had to fly
back to Thailand for my grand grandpa's
passing to the funeral so I was crying
and she told me to write to her so I
started writing then and
have continued the practice and found
that it's really helpful also have my
artists life workbook so that's still
part of the writing process and just
getting your thoughts out right getting
your ideas out so that they can become I
do
I love Dharma books and you know
spiritual and feel-good books you know
for example lean in or bees or NASA
galaxies and the company of women books
that make you feel good and empowered
you know entrepreneurs or self-help
books in this is a book of the about the
queen of Thailand and it's in English
and Thai so I can read both and so it's
been really nice to keep up with my Thai
- and my last thing is this rock that I
think I found at the discount or a
dollar store but I really love the
simple message to choose love over fear
so in your decisions that you make in
each day ask yourself if you're doing it
out of love or out of fear
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
