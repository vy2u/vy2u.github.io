today's an episode of artist of life the
series where we feature real people who
are actively creating their dream life
so we find out how they got to where
they are and kind of learn the lessons
that they've learned in their life that
you can apply to your life so today I'm
so excited to have my friend RJ Lim aka
voce the music producer from LA
backstory we met through your cousin we
were both kind of working on music and
we have to have a song together yes that
out some respects alright guys
yeah post that in the description but
yeah since then he's just gone off with
his music career and it's really
inspiring really cool to see what he's
been doing so I was I wanted to share
your story with everyone how did he get
into music the music has been part of me
for a really long time a lot of my
families we sing so that's how I started
off I was saying karaoke when I was like
a little kid and my 7th grade my parents
got me like a little drum set which is
super cool I didn't really get too good
at it nor did I like Chris who like
music then or just you know thought of
it as a serious thing but so eighth
grade came and I got like a little
electric guitar too and I started that's
when I started kind of like writing
music just covering songs and stuff like
that draw high school I was in choir and
out of high school I just I was just
interested in being one touch with music
and to actually you write music so
that's how that's how I got here yeah
yeah I was kind of yeah well it's kind
of like a really straightforward like
kind of path I knew
music was always something that would be
like a part of myself yeah yeah and it's
cool if you learn like different
instruments and you're saying so yeah
yeah kinda like let me work together
yeah it was like a plus for me that I
can actually cover songs too rather than
just like remix ting grabbing samples
from different music yeah I take that as
a classes yeah so when did you start
like learning how to produce on like
April 10 and it was about I would say
about like four years ago I actually
didn't start with Ableton I started with
a program called FL oh yeah uh and I was
I was using that for about a year or so
then I just gradually caught on to
Ableton for the most part is because I
could play life yeah with Ableton Phil
and his wife shows are so much it's sort
of us and get honest with you so what
would you say is like your biggest
challenge so far biggest challenge is
probably like writer's block really
wanting to create something amazing and
most of the time it's not the case
because it's just really really hard
writing music sometimes it comes like
really quick other times just takes like
a long time to just even like think of
like even a chord pattern you know and
stuff like that so how do you write as
well really like slows down like the
process of like releasing music and
suffer that really kind of like being
relevant I guess but yeah yeah just
writing music in general it's a really
hard thing it's tough yeah I mean I
think I see a lot of people because it's
like for me like when I try to sit down
and write a song I it'll be like two
hours I'm like I have nothing yeah yeah
yeah yeah and that's one of my troubles
too I sit on write music and I just like
keep it on loop even on
like you know them all of a sudden I get
tired of what I decided yeah do you get
sick of stuff cause you when you're
creating it you have to loop at all the
times
yeah and it's something that I have to
have to learn as well that you know if I
think something is like pretty cool
first time I hear it I you know I just
try to keep it like that and if I get
tired of it I just have to stop myself
changing it
oh really yeah because a lot of the
times I'll change it and it'll you know
it'll make something different from what
I initially like viviana change
provision mm-hmm so yeah it's something
that I have to learn as well to not get
tired of the song you know before it's
even done yeah I mean how do you like
get past writer's block to when you do
have it I look through inspirations on
like SoundCloud YouTube a lot of friends
I have like a few producer friends
online and stuff like that
and I just I just listen to you know
their their stuff and I try to you know
try to incorporate their stuff and you
know try to change it up a bit and yes I
like some of your biggest inspiration
set online online um first what do you
think in general I loved on there okay
um back when I was writing music in high
school she was one of my biggest
inspirations or she in writing yeah
songwriting is incredible yeah and his
guitar skills um yeah I kind of always
do him like for like my guitar skills
right now because it all looks like one
phase like in my life where I was like
binge like watch videos of him and try
to learn like his technique and stuff
like that and yeah he's probably one of
like my big inspirations and I have a
few other like inspirations like the
electronic music like Porter Robinson
I'm uh yeah yeah for rugby that is
amazing yeah especially his live shows
like he actually captures
you know he captures you and he like
being done is during this there's a lot
of emotion yes yeah sorry telling him
and it's amazing like I've seen a couple
of the shows and like it's something
that I would watch over and over again
la yeah if I had a chance to yeah and
it's funny because I can totally see a
lot of course like in your work kind of
like just aesthetic in general like the
very cute bright colorful yeah yeah and
I think you know I also think he is like
influenced a lot of artists too a lot of
artists within this generation it's
because I feel like it's because like
he's he's got in that staple that you
know gives everybody this feeling in his
music I've always felt it even with his
older son too and I knew that he was
actually something special that's when
he was like 17 16 when hello yeah yeah
that's fair yeah yeah but I mean it it's
incredible because it makes you know
kids nowadays like it makes kids
nowadays see that's possible yeah and a
lot of people now are like making music
and yeah so many as people popping up ha
yeah yes a lot of unknown artists
like young unknown artists that deserve
to be noticed and yeah those are those
are those people that like I try to
listen to okay they're like grabbed
inspiration from as well so let's talk
about your album because you have to say
you came out with cotton yes and right
right
yes so let's talk about them where when
were your inspiration and how did you
create them for bright bright was like
my first EP for the five column and this
is um this is a time I was still
learning
you know Ableton and while I was
learning that always you know it's
messing around it was it was kind of
like a mess around like album and the
reason why is called bright is because
that was around the time that I I kind
of felt that this is what I really want
to do
so it was kind of like a a change in
life it was like everything's like
bright like you know everything yeah
I started like noticing you know
different lifestyle like lifestyle
changes and myself and and it was good
it felt good and didn't use it kind of
it kind of supported that as well it was
like bright and colorful and stuff like
that and a lot of atmosphere so yeah I
actually roll up about 20 songs for an
album but I decided get picked you know
feel them just just to kind of like
support each other and stuff like that
so what happens to the ones that you
reject do you post them online
separately uh
leave them okay sometimes okay sometimes
I'll like find like vocals and stuff
like that and I'll like kind of make a
remix or something like that usually all
have likes composition and if it doesn't
work out I'll try to like make something
out of it kind of and yeah some of the
news some of them are actually like
remixes that I posted on soundcloud but
I took them down because like detail
like copyright oh yeah we should be
annoying with that yeah yeah so kind of
tennis sucks
but yeah that's where like usually like
all the other music go or I just like
use them for like new music okay yeah
cool and then cotton without kaki
cotton was just like a fast-paced like
album that I wanted to release it was
very bright very colorful much more
colorful than the bright album which is
weird because bright is like yeah right
yeah so cotton um was written within
about two months it would say so yeah
it consisted of five songs as well but I
did have collaborations with this album
one being Los Mochis which is my best
friend John Kay yeah
and he's he's one of my inspirations as
well
you know outside of like the music world
you know as a really close friend I was
like you know one of my outfit brothers
he he's very musically talented but yes
like I I collaborated with him
it was a cold called song called cold
but let's all tell me what huh
and it was just a it was just like a
song that me and him like it was like it
was like kind of do time you know like
we always wanted to make a song together
and I was like you know this would be
perfect for my album so I collaborated
with him and another one of my
inspirations is Timnath soul I forgot to
mention his name earlier he has today
miss timid soul and he's from I believe
Michigan okay uh and she's super
talented he is he's someone that I look
up to a lot especially and I
collaborated with him
with a song called picking fated which
did extremely well and I know what I
used for my podcast yeah my podcast
asbestos music yeah also like a bunch of
other youtubers like Jen and use of his
musings it's so cool I love her she's
right we're just so excited when I will
use your song yeah I didn't believe it
at first
haha genom yeah she was like she's an
amazing person she's so down-to-earth
easy to talk to I met her once tonight
at Coachella and she was she's so cute
like me she said she's so pretty and her
her I believe fiance now then he's such
a cool guy too
I believe he's like a drummer yeah but
yeah they're cool people as a Kolya so I
want to ask you a lot of artists have
the struggle of like starting a project
and not being able to see it through and
finish it what is your secret for
finishing sauce because I feel like you
create songs really fast I do it is a
struggle for me as well so but what I
usually do is I just say like screw it
like it's
you know a a lot of times a lot of those
times like the music that I make are
just kind of like force done because I I
tend to take a lot of time on like
certain parts of the song and I get
tired of it so what I usually do is I
just like say you know okay this is done
like you know forget about it this part
is done forget about it you know and
when I would just like put the pieces
together and like I complete the song if
I feel it you know I'll be like yeah you
know sometimes I don't and I just you
know say screw it anyway I'm going to
finish it and you know I just continue
to mix it and and just finish writing
the track it's more like kind of mental
yeah yeah because there are a lot of
times where I'm just like tired of my
music and I'm just like ah I don't know
if I want to releases but um it's
actually weird because the music that I
spend more time on and the music that I
get tired of more are usually the songs
that that people like like my fans like
actually enjoy better than say the ones
that you know I sprint and like right
and I like it Chris Lilley and I really
send people just you know like the ones
that I spend more time why did that
happens with music I don't have people
like simplicity maybe like if it's a
simple melody that kind of people don't
like it but like you're sick of it
yeah yeah oh interesting yeah it's weird
how like the more times like you spend
on it the more you know you get tired of
it and it ends up being you know a good
song and as to were like where my songs
that I personally like that take me like
say like a couple of hours four hours to
write a you know that's the song that
you know not so many people like it's so
weird because I like it and you know
right so do you have a good judge of
like when you make a song and I know
people are going to like this or you
you'll have no idea it's a gamble really
yeah because there are a lot of songs
that I've released and you know this is
going to be the one yeah the one but it
ends up you know just you know doing
okay I gotta fine as long as you like it
right like don't worry about what yeah
yeah yeah that's for the most part as
long as you you know you love what
you're doing and you know you're
actually doing it and yeah yeah that's
great yeah do you have like the song
that you're like the most proud of yeah
I liked my song called
it actually was timid soul okay um it's
a remix of mark radio uh oh yeah he was
formerly called spaz yes toward if we
did a song we did a remix of one of his
songs off of his promise album it was
called uh it was cool it wasn't truly um
it was cold no wasn't lovers and wasn't
truly I'm like brain farting here's okay
Oh mark what is it Morgan right here on
this treated oh yeah but then that was
that song to me again and meant a lot
because it was like actually one of my
first collaborations with somebody and I
got to see how another artist works and
it helped me a lot in producing as well
Tim Mitchell since he was someone that I
look up to and he was still willing to
collaborate I learned a lot and that was
a song that I was extremely proud of and
yeah yeah it means all to me
like when you say collaborate how does
it work are you just like sending pieces
of song together
oh I don't know yeah so for Tim Isola
and I we collaborated twice for the
remix of markrony DOS track we he had
like the skeleton of the track and he
sent it out to me to like kind of like
you know finish the puzzle and I did
that and for the kissing fader track
I sent him like the tails in and be like
and kind of my did you communicate as
you're working on it you're like oh what
do you think about this or do you just
kind of do
you um for me I kind of like I kind of
like do it like do myself yeah like you
know do whatever I have to do and just
like extend it and if they like it then
you know so they'll like it this is it's
a really good experience to like
collaborate it I think I think it's
extremely important if you learn as an
artist yes yeah so let's talk about your
aesthetic cuz you have a very specific
look and feel to your songs and like
your album covers and everything where
you where as I come from uh I just like
things but to be very like vibrant
colorful yes especially lately I've been
inspired by a lot of 80s okay like
videos art and stuff like that
but anything that's like you know very
colorful very bright upbeat that's
something that I just try to go for yeah
a very feel-good vibe yeah I think
they're all happy yeah yeah and that's
what I want like my sense to feel as
well and that's kind of like a good
thing about my music it's like a
feel-good vibe and you know I feel good
when you know my the people that listen
to my musically feel good yeah yeah
spreading happiness yeah yeah yeah so
yeah so it feels really good to know
that a lot of people are actually
enjoying it so do you have any like
goals for this year what's next for you
in terms of like music or life for this
year release another album I want to
release I'm hoping to release like a
full-length album this time rather than
just uh you know like a Python when my
previous I won't but yeah that's one of
my goals uh and just to do more shows
and just to spread out my music you know
in general and create my music to create
created yeah yeah growling yeah and do
show it here and there as well
yeah I think that's so cool that you're
doing more shows because they you yeah
it's like another skill to perform life
like sitting at home writing music right
yeah and it's pretty I think it's pretty
typical now for producers to actually
perform now I think it's a way to market
their music as well which is extremely
important people out there they're
making like amazing music and it has to
get out there somehow so I'm totally
yeah
do you have any advice for like aspiring
music producers out there who want to be
like you start like creating stuff and
doing shows I would say for the most
part just be yourself
and that's how you'll find your like
unique staple of yourself and be true to
yourself I would say if you really want
to do music just you know follow your
dreams yeah make it work somehow
okay mm-hmm it's tough it's really tough
but and there's a lot of like obstacles
that all that you can experience but it
shouldn't stop you if that's what you
really want to do and that's what I
admire about you you've been doing it
consistently for all these years you
know like it takes a lot a lot of work
the perseverance part yeah yeah it does
and I want to like give a shout out to
like one of my close friends Ian it's
actually it's actually Marco Dido oh
yeah he's kinda like a fan too I love
his music and she's always been there
for me yeah I him at a show down in New
York my girlfriend and I we went to New
York and we saw him and droppage oh my
god yeah all dresses I love them both
yeah
dress is amazing yeah so I met I met
mark in New York then I went down to SF
I went up to the bay and they had a show
there too so I was like it's kind of
like I was like following there you know
so we ended up going through the
shoulder there and I met him up over
there again too
uh and we just got closer and you know
if I needed help with something he would
you know totally be there for me
he would always actually you know like
my dumb questions and all that stuff and
he says so it is just such a he's such a
genuine a patient like person and he is
he's kind of he's kind of helped me
overcome like the challenges of an
artist because how I can give you advice
yeah he would give me advice he would
tell me like you know some kids
experience and how he coped with it
stuff like that so that's really yeah
yeah yeah and like before you met him
you were like a fan of his music right

similar and it was bound to meet but I
think that's so cool that you met him
and he actually like became Francis's
