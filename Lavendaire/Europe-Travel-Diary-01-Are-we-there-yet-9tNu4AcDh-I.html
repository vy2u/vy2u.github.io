right now and I'm heading over to dinner
with my friend Judith I thought it would
be fun to vlog the our Europe trip from
the beginning because today is June 2nd
and it was only like a couple days ago
where we decided that we would go to
Europe on a June 21st that's the
tentative date that we're gonna leave so
we have about 20 days before our trip I
feel like Europe is a big trip but I
mean June is just quit her job and she
has time and so I was supposed to go on
vacation that week too my friend was
supposed to get married in Indonesia
that week of June 20 something but sadly
that wouldn't got canceled
drama but that's besides the point
the point is I wanted to go on vacation
that week I had planned it out but the
wedding got canceled and I wasn't going
to go anywhere until Judith called me it
was like do you want to go to Europe
sounds like oh maybe
we're gonna we're gonna plan it
I feel like I'll be okay because I feel
like all the for one I will sleep for
sure so today is June 10th and we have
to book our Airbnb today I feel like
it's so last-minute I hope there are
still Arab being these left but
basically the situation is we are flying
a lot of budget airlines in between
cities and European budget airlines they
charge so much for like baggage fees
just to like check in a bag costs like
$70 or something like that so we've
decided that we're gonna try to pack
really light and only bring a carry-on
for the entire trip so we'll see how
that goes I think I'm going to make a
how to pack video because that should be
interesting so I'm basically trying to
finish all my work in the next 10 days
to cover like the weeks that I'm
traveling in Europe so I've made like a
list of things I have to finish before
June 20th and on the list I have like
four or five videos that I want to
finish three podcasts and my webinar I
have to work on my webinar create a
worksheet for it and if I have time
hopefully record some songs umm but yeah
hopefully I could like finish everything
get it all scheduled to post and then I
could go to Europe and just have fun
just booked our air B&amp;amp;B ease of going
back to Italy yeah
waiting in line for a while here
out of the airport because our flight
I've never had a basic aliy we're like
calling it over to go home so I could
like do some work and edit some videos
yeah we're going to get to Iceland which
is our layover
and I think either
and the good thing is I think I'm gonna
try to make it to the Blue Lagoon
because we have like an evening in
Iceland so
we're going to Iceland I mean I'm not
angry I just it's nice because when we
got to London we're going to stay with
my best friend's hotel so we didn't
really like pay for a place so it's not
like we're losing my
just new experiences stay positive
so we're kind of back home right now
look at your dad sleeping and I'm
basically booking tickets to the Blue
Lagoon
so for our layover we can go to the Blue
Lagoon and check it out and what's
really nice is we get to ride to the
airport with Jayne who's my friend who
lives in London she came back to LA for
the weekend and she's going back to
London and we're basically gonna go
there together except we're gonna stop
stop by Iceland first and she's gonna go
straight to London here it is Blue
Lagoon ticket from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m.
because the Sun doesn't set there and
they open till midnight hope we make it
and now I'm just gonna edit my video I'm
so happy I get to edit whoo hi Jane hi
we're riding with me thanks Ben for
driving us to the airport no problem
so we shall meet again in London in two
days actually after we go to the Blue
Lagoon can't wait
