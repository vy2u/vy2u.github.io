of many vlogs that I'm gonna make during
my trip studying abroad in the lab oh
god I feel like it's not getting used to
talk in front of camera it's really
where people are watching me Here I am
in London waiting for my second flight
to get into Milan
kind of nervous kind of scarcely first
time traveling internationally by myself
I'm so happy to be here it's very sunny
but honestly I'm just so happy because I
feel super comfortable here I feel like
I'm at home I could totally live here
again if I had to we got here we took a
train from Rome and now we're just gonna
explore Duomo and this area open up
through the waves cut through hypnotized
by the sounds of breathing man hold
tight hold tight chemicals so we're
walking through the world's first mall
it's called galleria vittorio emanuele
ii something like that and this is where
I used to walk through to get gelato on
my study breaks
it's just really really I love it
you make me
me
it's my third day in Milan and I can't
believe I didn't come here my first day
this is the Duomo is the Cathedral in
the center of Milano
it's like you cuz there's a wedding
going on oh no no no oh Oh beauty
by eating my hand so we're walking down
via torino this is like one of the main
shopping streets in Milan from the Duomo
and this is the street that I had to
walk out every day to go home so it was
like really hard to control myself
because like there's aura vertigo all
these other stores are out here so this
is the first Mooji that I ever
encountered because I mean obviously I
walked past it every day and so this
store is what introduced me to Mooji now
I'm obsessed with Mooji pens it's
stationary so there you have it
Mooji and Milan okay so Mooji is right
here and across the street from Muji is
this place called
Oh Jesse oh and this is my favorite
restaurant in Milan only because I have
good memories here and the clam linguini
here is really really good all right
well it's my last day in Milan but stuff
for time I've been here in two weeks and
then linguine and clam is the best meal
what is going on Yelp
fresh out the ocean here in serious like
debate wanted though I don't know if I
can finish the whole thing but I would
definitely slip on
Oh
I totally just read into the stationery
store where I bought my notebook that I
use for record me versus speak for me
the guys watch that video and I
mentioned that I finished that notebook
and I'm in Illinois Jacquet more in via
San Vito
alright we're walking on the streets via
San Vito this is where I used to live
so ok here we are I lived in this
apartment veinticuatro I just want a
picture here obviously I could go inside
and I believe that's why I rented my
guitar that I used when I was in Italy I
had a really hard time like explaining
to them that I just wanted to rent one
for five months but yeah this is where I
rented my guitar
line hold tight
their whole time
