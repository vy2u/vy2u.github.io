favorites so this past month was a
really beautiful fun and eventful month
for me especially this past weekend
because I just gave my first TEDx talk I
felt like it went pretty well because I
practiced like a lot a lot a lot and I
met a lot of great people a lot of very
inspiring people people who are doing
awesome things and some of you guys came
out so those of you guys who I saw and
hung out with hi thank you so much for
coming it was so fun so this month I
feel like I have a lot of favorites
because a lot of things made me happy
and excited so I'm gonna share some of
my favorite products that I used as well
as a documentary of podcast and a lot of
music I'm gonna save music for last
because I just have so many favorites
this month my first favorite is the
bloom yuzu citrus fragrance diffuser
bloom is a company that my friend helped
start so I found out about this when she
was running her Kickstarter campaign so
this is just a reward because I
supported her Kickstarter they sent me
this diffuser and oh my goodness it
smells so good I'm so glad that I picked
a yuzu citrus it's so refreshing it's so
sweet but it's very revitalizing I feel
like it gives me a lot of energy I don't
want to use this bottle up because I'm
gonna want to keep buying more and more
and more again my next favorite is this
BH eyeshadow palette this was actually a
gift to me from my friend who was
staying with me from Taiwan so her name
is so fun and she worked with me on
picture Taipei when we were in Taiwan
and she came to LA last month to go to a
makeup convention so she stayed with me
for a week and this was a gift that she
got for me from that makeup convention
so since she left
I opened the eyeshadow palette and I
started using it and since then it's
been my go-to palette for my eye makeup
I just love it so much because it's so
neutral but there are so many different
types of neutral colors you can just
create so many different combos it's
basically all that I use my next
favorite is this brightening youth serum
by moon this is a serum made up of
prickly pear seed oil argan oil and rose
essential oil
and so it's basically a serum that you
put on your face after cleansing it was
sent to me by joy provision so they're a
clean natural makeup and skincare
retailer and I think pretty sure they're
a startup so I'm just getting into
discovering clean and natural makeup
skincare brands I think it's really
important to kind of be aware of where
your products come from and what they're
made of so yeah if you guys have any
recommendations for like more brands
like this for me to try I love it my
next favorite is a documentary called
twin stirs and if you guys haven't heard
of it you have to check it out it's on
Netflix so the story is there were two
Korean adoptees who were twins separated
at Birth one grew up in America one grew
up in France and they didn't know each
other until like the French twin
discovered the American twin on the
internet because she is an actress I
knew about this documentary for a long
time coming and I don't know what took
me so long to watch it I also have to
preface it with my own story because I
feel like I'm connected to this
documentary in a way that made me enjoy
it that much more so in 2013 I worked on
my first short film that I ever produced
it was called the night market and on
that film like I worked with a producer
and an actor who are both in twin stirs
so during that time that we were working
on that first short film I knew that the
story was going on in real time and I
even got to meet Anais who is the French
twin I met her on set and it's so crazy
to just watch their documentary now
because wow I didn't realize how
powerful this story was I mean first of
all it's a crazy Parent Trap you don't
believe this is real life kind of story
but second of all like the twins like
they're so human and they're so sweet
and it's just so beautiful to watch
their emotions in real life and you just
have to watch it my next favorite is an
episode from a podcast so you guys
probably know who Anna Akana is she's a
youtuber so she has a podcast called
explain things to me which I enjoy
listening to Random episodes depending
on who that person their interview
so what they do is they interview people
from all professions of the world and
for that one episode you get to learn
about what this person does and they get
to explain to you the details of what
they do which is really fascinating to
me so the episode that I really really
enjoy is the quantum physics episode
this is just because I've always been
interested in quantum physics I think
it's so bizarre how the reality that we
know is not you know it's not absolute
truth I love the idea of superposition
and how something can be in two places
at once
until an observer looks at it I don't
know if I make sense to you guys it
depends on how much of quantum physics
background you guys know but just listen
to this podcast it will give you a good
introduction to the concepts of quantum
physics and also what someone who
studies that can do in life and how you
apply that to life and I just think it's
very fascinating and it's great to learn
new things that we don't understand
so lastly I'm gonna share my favorite
music in February and I'm just gonna go
through like everything because you know
I have a lot of favorites so first of
all I started to wake up to big-band so
there's a playlist on Spotify that's
big-band it's kind of limited because
now I feel like I know most of the songs
that I want to look for more big-band
songs to wake up to I love waking up and
like listening to Big Bad because it's
just so brassy and jazzy and it makes
you feel good and it makes you feel
classy but also like confident and it's
just been really fun to wake up to that
and I'm in the process of making like a
wake up playlist because it's hard for
me to wake up in the mornings but when I
have the right music it can really like
get me started on the right foot another
song that I gained more appreciation for
this month is all my friends by snake
hips featuring Tinashe and chance the
rapper so I've known this song for a
while but I think this month I actually
got the time to listen to the lyrics and
that's because on Spotify they now have
this like genius app where they show you
the meanings of the lyrics and I was
just kind of like reading that and it's
like oh my god that's interesting so if
you really listen to the lyrics
what Tinashe brights i think she is so
smart she's a true artist
Tinashe is just a creative girl the way
that she words things and the way that
she tells stories is like poetry next
another favorite song that I have from
this month is don't let me down by the
chainsmokers I consistently really enjoy
all of the chainsmokers singles so I
think I'm just like a big fan of them I
really loved roses and I like Kanye and
I just love their songs they're like a
perfect mix of electronic and pop you
know another song that I really love
this month was by Machine heart it's
called circles featuring Vanek there are
two versions of the song I like the one
that's featuring Vanek it's really fun
this is like the time of the year where
music starts getting more happy and
poppy to me on my playlist and I'm just
getting ready for that springtime summer
vibes that I love so much I just I love
I love happy music yes I know I shared
like too many music favorites this month
but I can't help it I just had to
mention everything that I loved so if
you guys are too lazy to look up these
songs one by one I'm always constantly
updating my favorite songs on my those
soundwaves playlist on Spotify so if you
want to just subscribe to that and not
ever have to listen to my music
recommendations again that's fine
because I'm always updating that
playlist alright that's it for my
favorites from this past month thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
