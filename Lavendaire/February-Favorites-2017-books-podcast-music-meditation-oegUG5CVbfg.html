good to see you so today we're going to
talk about February favorites as usual
most of these things are non tangible
experiences or resources that have
inspired me so I guess first I can talk
about my hair I have new hair this is
kind of like transition here so if you
notice the last time I had a video my
hair was like black up here I let my
roots grow out for like a year basically
so I didn't bleach my hair for a year
and it grew pretty long so I had my
cousin come over and help me bleach the
roots because it was a lot but it's okay
right now it's not exactly even so this
is why I don't make hair videos because
it's I do it myself and it's not
professional it's not perfect but it
just gets the job done so I might like
go in and reach it again because it's
you know Asian hair going from black to
like blonde you need to do it in steps
you can't do it all at once you have to
do like maybe two or three sittings so
yeah maybe two sittings for me so I did
it once I'm going to go back and
continue bleaching out like the oranjee
parts but yeah I'm happy because this is
me I like playing with my hair so that's
one favorite of the month another
favorite is I made another artist of
life episode interviewing my friend Sora
gang Sora Yang is like a hip hop dancer
choreographer teacher and singer and
she's just an amazing very empowering
girl person but definitely watch that
interview if you haven't already artist
of life is like my passion project it's
really the series that I put the most
heart and energy and time into and it
really is like everything that I'm about
you know interviewing people who are
creating their dream life because I
can't teach everything there are so many
things we can learn from all these
people in different industries so what I
try to do is I try to paint a picture of
that person's life style and personality
in each video so each video will feel
different depending on that person's
personality
like the first one I interviewed my
friend Karen Rosalee who's really
currently a pretty and dreamy similar to
my aesthetic so I wanted to start with
her and then my second friend Clarissa
way she's more of like a nature Riau
story girl and then now surah yang the
third interview she's like urban hip-hop
more like fierce and strong so it's
really cool to be able to like have
videos in different styles that kind of
showcase this person so please check out
that video and that entire series
because that is like the core of what I
want to create alright on the subject of
dance so I started taking dance classes
again this month so this was something
that has been on like my bucket list
maybe for like a year I think last year
I put on my bucket list I want to start
taking dance classes again and I want to
take contemporary dance because I used
to dance hip-hop on a few teams and
contemporary dance I feel like is more
suited to my style I actually like to
flow and be more emotional with my
dancing instead of like hitting hard and
stuff so I thought that you know I
should pick it up but it was just
something that I left on the back burner
and I was scared to do for the longest
time I just didn't like I just didn't do
it but this month February was self-love
beam that I thought it was about time
that I give some time to myself and do
things that will really bring me joy so
I signed up for like a path to this
nearby dance studio and I started taking
contemporary dance classes and hip-hop
classes and it's just so fun to dance
again I stopped dancing for like three
years and just being in a class
especially like that contemporary class
our instructor was really inspirational
she said this quote that I posted on my
Instagram she was like the hero and the
coward start at the same place they both
feel the fear they're both scared to do
whatever is in front of them the only
difference though is that the hero steps
forward despite that fear and that makes
all the difference so
she was talking about how like this we
should step up and perform full-out and
just feel it it was so beautiful it's
totally like totally my vibe so it was
really fun to just start dancing again
alright my next favorite is actually a
youtube channel so this is like an
earlier favorite at the beginning of
February I was like just binge watching
videos by amber Scholl and if you don't
know who she is like I'll put her link
below check her out I found out about
her through a podcast called beauty on
the blog which is also a favorite I
really enjoyed that podcast but yeah she
did an interview on beauty on the blog
and Amber's story is that she just blew
up on YouTube I think in like her first
three months on YouTube she got like
300,000 subscribers and the her
interview was talking about how that
happened it's kind of an anomaly but
just watching her videos after learning
about her I'm like yeah she cuz there's
everything that she has because first of
all she's so entertaining her
personality is like way out there
outgoing really funny really fun and her
channel is all about like looking
glamorous on a budget so sure story is
like she was super broke didn't have a
job with I mean she had like a job
driving coast mates which is like uber
for food delivery and she was just like
scraping by and just not you know what
I'm just going to post a link to her
video on like her youtube story because
I feel like she has that like Cinderella
story on YouTube she went from like
super broke having nothing and she
started her channel and then all of this
stuff happened and there's a lot behind
it I don't know I thought it really
inspiring and really touching to just
like see her growth and see everything
she's been through
yeah so if you guys want to get inspired
and also be very entertained definitely
watch amber shoals videos like it's just
funny because our styles are not the
same at all I am not even the blinged
out glamorous type of girl but I just I
can connect with her as a human being I
like her personality and I watch her
videos for her personality not really
for like learn
how to like bling out my bras and stuff
so like I was saying another favorite of
mine for the past like 2 or 3 months
actually not just this past month is the
podcast Beauty and the blog hosted by
Erica Vieira this one's for all the
aspiring youtubers out there you don't
even have to be like a beauty youtuber I
don't consider myself a beauty youtuber
but I can learn a lot from this podcast
because she interviewed people how they
grow how they like just I'm going to
develop their brand and all this stuff
and to me it's interesting because I
like to learn I always love to learn
about like the industry how to grow my
brand and my business so if you're in
sub that
check out beauty and the blogs podcast
you'll learn a lot trust me alright next
let's talk about my favorite book of the
moment I'm actually reading a book and
listening to a book I'm reading the seed
of a soul by Gary Zhukov which I love
it's one of like Oprah's recommended
books I think she recommended it in her
book and I just heard about it it was on
my reading list for a long time I put it
in my artist of life workbook to read
this book so as I was like reviewing my
workbook at the end of January I was
like you know what I should I should
just like pick one of these books that I
said I want to read and buy it and start
reading it so that my first choice was
seed of the soul it's a spiritual book
and it will really open your mind to the
universe and what else is out there that
you are not aware of kind of just it it
explains things like intuition like we
can't really use science to prove what
intuition is but I'm sure you and I both
know that it does mean something
intuition comes from something we do
have like some kind of guidance from a
higher being whatever you want to call
it but I just love that book it's it's
really eye-opening and I look forward to
reading it every night so that's that's
something another book that I am
currently listening to on audible is
Anna Kendrick's scrappy little nobody so
I love to listen to comedic memoir
just as I'm driving so that's what I
like to use audible for I like using
audible for more like memoirs and people
talking about their lives I kind of like
fluffy fun stuff and I like to like
physically read books that are more like
deep and spiritual and needy in terms of
content so yeah I have one spiritual
book that I actually read every night
and then Anna Kendrick's book I listen
to in my car and it's just fun I like
her personality and it's just
entertaining that's all I'm going to say
about it by the way I do have a link
where you can get a free audible trial
with a free book so if you want to
listen to any of these books for free
then the link is down below if you click
it sign up you don't even have to pay
for the subscription like it helps me
out anyway if you just do the free trial
moving forward let's talk about my
favorites in music the first song is
electric by Amina bras not sure how to
really pronounce her name but she's made
really dope songs her voice is like just
that sultry gorgeous tone mixed with
that like electro underwater beat type
of music um yeah so I made an Instagram
video where I was driving and I used
that song as a background music and I
just really like that song it's a song
that I've been playing on repeat another
song that I love is the song from Alana
how far I'll go so I literally just
watched mulana this past weekend and I
know I'm late to the game but yeah I
don't know anyway I've heard the song
like online even before I watched the
movie and when I watched the movie I'm
sick and like it just made me want to
cheer up and she was singing it just
because number one the melody is so
pretty the people who work for Disney
obviously know how to craft gorgeous
inspirational songs like when they wrote
the song they were writing it to be the
hit song like there's a formula to it
and there's like a specific there are
specific chord progressions that sound
inspirational and sound beautiful and
always move people no matter what even
if you use the same chord progressions
and so many different pop songs like it
always sounds good so that's like
of them but just also like the lyrics
and the story behind it obviously it's
what I'm all about following your heart
and your calling and exploring and going
out into the unknown it's it's
everything up.that is my life so I
really really related to mallanna I love
that movie and at the end of the movie
I'm just like pain she's so cool
mallanna is so cool and I just love the
direction that this knees taking
empowering females more putting them in
hero roles instead of the damsel role
and I'm just honestly grateful that I
live in an era where I can see the shift
happening you know like when I was
little I watched movies like Snow White
and the Little Mermaid and Cinderella
versus like now I see things changing
and it's a wonderful time to be alive
it's just I'm grateful to witness this
history happening so yeah about the song
though I've listened to the song and the
whole soundtrack on repeat for like the
past few days and seriously even after
like a hundred times of listening to
that song I will like still kind of tear
up as I like singing along with it for
some reason it just really moves me
alright my last favorite of the month is
a meditation that I've been doing again
so a couple years ago I did something
called the liberation Korea and it's
like a meditation in Kundalini Yoga like
a 40-day challenge it's very specific
where like you hold your arms up like
this every three minutes you change
positions and then that's another three
minutes you change again the meditation
is in total nine minutes and you do it
every day for 40 days if you skip a day
you have to start the 40 days all over
again and it's because I was rewatching
an old video of mine where I was like
sharing about the meditation and what I
was learning from it and I realized that
it really shifted my mindset is really
strengthened my mind to really like
embrace patience and perseverance and
commitments and I started doing it when
I was like in my first year of lab and
dare and I think it's because of that
strong mindset that I had that I could
stick through with my YouTube channel
and really stay committed to
even though it was getting hard even
though there was no reward all of this
stuff so I thought that it really
impacted me back then and it would be a
good idea to try it again because now my
new challenge is I'm trying to work on
my book proposal on my book so I'm just
doing that meditation but if you guys
are interested you want to join along
definitely try it out so I'll post the
video on like instructions on how to do
this meditation in the description so
check that out I'll post like my old
video you can watch 2014 me as I was
doing it back then but it's just been
really strengthening already I'm only on
day six so far but the thing about this
meditation is like when you're holding
your arms up for nine minutes honestly
the first time but in the first three
minutes I was already dying and like
your arms are shaking and you really
want to put them down but like don't
because if you put them down that means
you've gave up and if you've given up
you have to start all over again so it
really is realizing that you are
stronger than your body your mind is
stronger than your body and just being
aware that you know if I have my arms up
no matter how much it hurts I'm not
going to die just by having my arms up I
will survive and if I can survive this
pain then I will be stronger so whatever
doesn't kill you makes you stronger
truly do believe in that anyway you have
to try it for yourself there's nothing
that I can explain that will truly like
instill it in you unless you do it
yourself so yeah liberation Kriya very
very powerful alright that's it for my
strawberry favourites thank you so much
