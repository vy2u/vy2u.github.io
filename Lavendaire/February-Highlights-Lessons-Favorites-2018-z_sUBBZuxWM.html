dare so today it's another February
highlights lessons and favorites and
before I get started I want to make a
quick announcement my podcast the
lavender lifestyle comes back this
Sunday so make sure you tune in whether
it's on iTunes or my blog I'll have all
the links down below the podcast will be
uploaded every Sunday starting March 4th
so look out for that I also wanted to
share about the artist of life
mastermind because I'm not sure everyone
knows about that so I have the artist of
life workbook which I'm sure you've
heard about but there's also a
mastermind which is a Facebook group
that goes along with the workbook so we
do monthly goals monthly reviews twice a
month I do like a live chat with q and
a's on different topics and stuff and
it's very very engaged so if you're
looking for something very personal with
a supportive group of like-minded people
to just keep yourself accountable
towards your goals then this is the
group and I just wanted to share now
because we're about to start forming new
mini groups for our next quarter so many
groups are where we group four to five
people in the mastermind together who
have similar goals for that quarter to
just be in a facebook chat and keep each
other accountable for the next three
months so January through March was the
first quarter of the year and then we're
gonna start signups for next quarters
mini groups now basically from like
throughout the month of March we're
gonna be taking like surveys on what
your goals are for next quarter and
match you up with people who have
similar goals as you because it's more
fun to work towards your goals together
especially with people who could help
you out with your goals alright so let's
move on to my February highlights
so the first highlight of the month it
was Chinese New Year so that was a super
fun weekend I usually spend the entire
day with my family the day of Chinese
New Year we go to a few different
temples in the area we pray and then at
night we do like the red envelope thing
where the adults give money to the
younger kids and it's just a lot of fun
family time we have dinner and just a
lot of traditional stuff that we do
another big part of my month of February
was doing a lot of podcast interviews so
you guys I've already recorded like 15
or more episode
for the podcast so I have them recorded
way early in advance this year I just
wanted to see how it would work if I
would batch them together so I felt like
in February I spent more time recording
podcast like every day I would have
multiple recordings lined up and then I
had less time for videos so next month I
definitely want to be more consistent
with uploading videos and also Instagram
so my theme of March is consistency but
for the February it was about the
podcast which is pretty exciting because
whenever I get to interview new people
each time I meet someone like just
talking to them I learned so much so
February has been a lot of lessons too
much that I could probably share in one
video so I'm just gonna share like a few
lessons later at the end lastly a big
highlight that happens just a couple
days ago is I got an opportunity to go
to Stanford to guest speak at a class so
it was a digital marketing class I went
on just to talk about my story and what
I do with lab and dare and tips for
people who want to get into like video
marketing and that was very intimidating
at first like I was actually very very
nervous to go to do that event and I
have a vlog recorded which I'll post on
my vlog channel but in the end it was a
great experience I'm so happy I went
because I haven't done like a real
presentation like that in years I
haven't made a slideshow in years and it
was good to kind of get that practice
and get my nerves going and then face my
fears and then realize that it wasn't
that big of a deal after all and I feel
confident with how I presented and I'm
happy with it so honestly at each stage
of life even though you feel like you
might have made it far enough and you're
happy with where you're at I feel like
life always throws you more things to
scare you like scary things like the
Stanford speaking thing it scared me and
I it meant that I had to step up and
face it to overcome those fears and put
myself in that uncomfortable zone
another thing is part of the reason I
moved to this apartment is to be closer
to the city so I could go to more events
and network with more people in the
creative industry and so I've had to
force myself to go to different events
this month to just like step
out of my comfort zone go to these
social events by myself and try to make
new friends or talk to strangers when I
go just it gives me a lot of anxiety I
get nervous but I know it's good for me
so I'm gonna just put myself out there
experience these very uncomfortable
things so this month a common theme I
had to tell myself was be brave do the
brave thing even if it's uncomfortable
and so continually I have to push myself
and go out there do those scary things
okay moving on to favourites of February
I was really excited to get to this part
sooner so in the beginning of the month
I was really obsessed with the greatest
showmen album and I think now it's kind
of died down a little bit that wave was
really high like maybe last month but I
love the song this is me that's like the
anthem of that soundtrack so if you
haven't seen the movie definitely go
watch it there are so many great songs
very pretty songs on that album but my
favorite is this is me just cuz it's
very very empowering it makes you feel
strong it makes you embrace everything
that you are all the flaws all your
weaknesses and it's really just a song
that I've constantly like saying to cry
to just dance to in my car it's one of
those feel-good power songs and it's
amazing it's totally my favorite my next
favorite is the snow app so I recently
discovered it I believe it's a Korean
app so it just has so many filters a lot
of like face filters and it just does so
much more than the usual Instagram
snapchat or any other apps that I've
found you can get so creative with it
that's why I love it so much I just
think the filters are higher quality and
look better so usually I'll take videos
with snow app and then I'll save it and
then upload it to Instagram stories so
if you guys are interested in being more
creative and creating prettier Instagram
stories or using better like cute face
filters and check out snow app my next
favorite is the dyson animal cord free
vacuum I know I'm getting there
because I've moved into a new apartment
we've been shopping for like new home
appliances and the Dyson was one that I
really wanted to try out because
had friends who have told me that it's
totally worth the money and it's amazing
so I bought it and the first time I used
it to vacuum I was like mind blown oh my
god this is life-changing
first of all it's so light second of all
it's cordless I've always used like
those heavy corded vacuum so I don't
know it's a whole new world for me and I
feel like Dyson is very high quality
it's just so well made and it's strong
it's just a great vacuum and I love that
it's light enough that you can like you
know clean things that are in high
places it's just really cool if you're
looking for a vacuum this is worth the
money and it's something that like if
you want to buy a gift for your parents
if they like cleaning and they're still
using like old school vacuums definitely
consider it next up is my favorite show
at the moments yes I've gotten into a
new reality show on Netflix this one's
called hiyori's bed and breakfast so if
you followed me for a while you know
that I loved Terrace house which is a
Japanese reality TV show and now he orys
bed and breakfast is a Korean reality
show and I found it randomly it just
caught my eye because I like this kind
of stuff the concept is Hiyori is this
Korean pop star I've actually known her
since I was like in junior high but
she's older now she lives on an island
in a big house with a lot of land the
show is about Hiyori turning her home
into a bed-and-breakfast where she gets
guests coming in and outs multiple
guests staying at her house at the same
time so there's a lot of like strangers
interacting you meet a lot of different
kind of people young and old and it's
really interesting because for me I love
people watching I think I like reality
shows more than like dramas and stuff
cuz I like real life I like just the
mundane funny moments funny awkward
moments of everyday life you know it's
similar to terrace house in the sense
that there are people coming in and out
but it's just different because this is
a Korean pop star and it's funny cuz she
hired a staff someone to do the kitchen
work and housework who's actually like
another Korean pop star named IU and
it's fun to watch the show and then
listen to their music
afters and in some episodes they're
actually like making music and recording
so I'd like to see that aspect of their
life as well so I've only watched six
episode so far and just to give you a
comparison I feel like Tara's house is
focused more on like strangers forming
romantic relationships but he auras
bed-and-breakfast is more strangers just
forming friendships and different type
of relationships like an old person and
a young person and I definitely cried
more watching hiyori's bed-and-breakfast
there's just some like sweet touching
sad moments so yeah this also leads me
to my last favorite of the month
it is a song by IU called through the
night so like I mentioned IU is like the
kitchen worker on the show here his bed
and breakfast and on the show she's like
this awkward like young girl who's kind
of clueless doesn't know what to do but
then when you listen to her music she's
like transformed into this like angelic
goddess and she has an amazing voice
very pure very soft and beautiful and
I've become obsessed with IU I've
listened to her album and previous
albums and really loved her really
respect her and through the night it's
just such a pretty song it's so pretty
I've been singing it all the time
even though I don't understand the
lyrics by the way if you guys know of
any good songs you want to recommend to
me specifically songs with like female
vocalists that are fun to sing doesn't
have to be a ballad it's just a song
that's like fun to sing verses like the
songs on the radio right now in America
are just not cater to vocalist is more
like cater to the beats and production
so I'm just looking for songs to sing
and especially if you know like Chinese
whether it's Mandarin Cantonese songs
I'm trying to like you know stack up my
KTV list of songs that I could sing when
I go karaoke so definitely recommend all
your songs down below alright those are
my February highlights thanks so much
for watching make sure you check out my
podcast and also check out the
mastermind group if you want to be part
of a mini group for next quarter and
onwards
alright I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
