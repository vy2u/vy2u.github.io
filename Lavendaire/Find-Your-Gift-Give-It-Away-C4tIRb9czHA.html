gift-giving and it's another play on
words it's actually inspired by a post
on my friend Josh pan made on Facebook
he wrote
find your gift give it away that's
living and I thought this was so simple
and beautiful and such a great way to
put it you know we have gifts and what
you should do is you need to find those
gifts and then hone them and then give
them away share them with the world
because that's how you contribute and
that's how you make an impact I honestly
believe that we are all blessed with a
unique set of skills talents life
experiences etc and you know through all
of that we have strengths and those
strengths are our gifts and if you don't
use your gifts and you don't share them
then that is a complete waste you're
being selfish you know you're doing as a
service to the world because you're
keeping all of that amazing potential
inside and nobody gets to benefit from
it for example Josh Penn is an awesome
music producer and artist and he has a
unique set of gifts which include being
really great and making awesome music
and posting really thoughtful deep
content on Facebook you guys should
follow him on soundcloud and facebook by
the way I'll post the links below but
through his gifts he has the ability to
make people happy and make people think
and that is contributing to the world in
his own unique way so we each have our
own unique set of gifts in which we can
contribute in our own way
and I believe that you got to find it
you got to just home what you got and
share it also it's important to not
compare your set of gifts to anybody
else's your gifts are yours and yours
only and they are unique and they are
just as important as everybody else's
out there here I want to share a quote
that I saw in a marie forleo video I'll
post that video link below because that
was a really good video too but the link
is by Martha Graham and it goes like
this
there's a vitality a life force an
energy a quickening that is translated
through you into action and because
there's only one of you in all of time
this expression is unique and if you
block it it will never exist through any
other medium and it will be lost the
world will not have it it is not your
business to determine how good it is nor
how valuable nor how it compares with
other expressions it is your business to
keep it yours clearly and directly to
keep the channel open you do not even
have to believe in yourself or your work
you have to keep yourself open and aware
to the urges that motivate you keep the
channel open I love that quote so much
it's so good and it's just so
comprehensive to this topic of finding
your gifts and then giving it away it's
not your job to judge yourself or to
compare your gift with other
it's just your job to find it hone it
and then use it share it don't let it go
to waste because that is a lot of great
potential to make a positive difference
in the world
so in shorts just do you because you are
unique and you are awesome and the world
needs your gifts whatever you got to
bring to the table find your gift give
it away that's living don't forget to
subscribe we have a comment below and
have a beautiful day I'll see you guys
