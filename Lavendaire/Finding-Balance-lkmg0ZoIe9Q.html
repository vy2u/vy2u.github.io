quote that I've been thinking about
lately and the quote is success at the
speed of balance so I know that not
everyone will agree with me because I
told this quote to my brother and he
just like scoffed at me because he's
more of the type who believes in
hustling hard going fast making
sacrifices
bla bla bla be in the fast lane which is
fine too but lately this quote really
has been a centerpiece in my life just
because I want to live a life of balance
where I feel like I'm growing in all
areas of life not just in my career or
work and so with that you do have to
kind of balance things out and not give
your all to just one thing so the way
that I want to balance my life is I keep
track of five areas of my life that I
want to be hitting every day so I want
to be either doing something in this
area each day and moving forward
in whatever way that I can so the five
areas are health relationships career
personal growth and happiness so each
day I make a journal entry in my journal
and I list you know health what did i do
today did I grow in health today did I
grow in relationships you know who did I
talk to in what ways did I grow my
relationships with others and career
obviously what did I do to move forward
today personal growth is usually I make
note of whether I meditated in morning
pages or read a book and I try to do
those things every day so and make sure
that I'm always growing and happiness I
keep track of my happiness level each
and every day and that's the area where
I kind of take notes on what I'm
grateful for in the day so keeping track
of those five things and making sure
that I'm doing something for each thing
is how I try to stay balanced but
obviously it's easier said than done you
know there are
days where I feel like I'm doing more of
something and less of another and I'm
not hitting those five things every day
for example when I came back from
traveling I felt sluggish and I wanted
to make health my number one priority
and get that back on track so I started
exercising every day eating clean and
just focusing more on health I felt like
I was growing in that area but I was
taking away time from the work that I
usually do so yeah I'm still working on
finding my balance but I do believe in
the phrase success at the speed of
balance because I feel like if you're
hustling too hard or you're kind of
focusing too hard on one thing you lose
out on the other areas of life that are
equally as important so how do you guys
keep balanced how do you know you're
focusing too much on one thing and not
on the other I don't know it's up to you
it's your life you can do whatever you
want but I'm just sharing how I'm going
about my life now and I feel that
keeping balance is great for feeling
peaceful and calm just go at the pace
that you feel comfortable at I believe
in this although I do believe you have
to step out of your comfort zone and
push a little harder but in order to
keep from being overwhelmed and stressed
you really do have to devote time to
your well-being so health relationships
career personal growth and happiness
those are the five things that I track
every day you might be tracking
different things whatever is important
to you track that and good luck thank
you so much for watching guys and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
