today I want to jump start a new series
for this month called back to basics and
this is a series about spring cleaning
your life it's about going back to the
basics back to the foundations of what
really matters in our lives and today I
want to start with finding meaning in
life because I feel like it's so
important yet it's something that not
everybody thinks about enough before I
jump in I do have to share that like
these past couple weeks were like major
recovery mode for me I feel like I
traveled I went to London and Amsterdam
and when I came back I think it was like
the flight back plus the jetlag and I
don't know but the next morning I woke
up with like the gnarliest cold I've
ever had not ever but like maybe in the
past two years but yeah I just took many
many days to have to get some rest and
recover I'm still recovering now but I
feel so much better
but at the same time my website was also
down for like over a week and I was
trying to get it back up like every day
working with my hosting server and my
developer friend and it's just like
things going wrong all these bumps in
the road all these obstacles which you
know I embraced because I know it's part
of life
it's life were perfect all the time it
would be boring so life is supposed to
be imperfect we're supposed to have
challenges and obstacles and just things
happening to us
but at the end of the day there's still
so much beauty in life and I'm still not
phased I feel like I remained calm
through it all and it can still be in
love with life because I have so much
meaning and so much fulfillment just in
everyday I guess what I want to say is
that everybody goes through their own
struggles everybody's fighting their own
battles so you can't judge other people
at the same time as they're going
through these struggles like it is still
possible to love life and enjoy life and
find meaning and fulfillment through it
all first
well in these past couple days you know
I've been really sick my websites down
nothing's working
and at the same time I've been finding
such beauty in things like music in the
morning like listening to music making a
green smoothie in the morning dancing in
my kitchen just talking to my boyfriend
and my brother keeping connected with
the people that I really really love and
there's just so much to be grateful for
there's so much love so much beauty that
I am just having a ball in life still
even when things are not perfect so for
me it begins with beauty and love in my
world and that's where I find meaning so
I see Beauty everywhere in nature and
flowers and arts in music movies in
culture and the little things beauty in
sleep sleep is such a beautiful big it
makes me feel so great you know there's
beauty and so many little things a cup
of tea or a nice painting on your wall
whatever it may be there is beauty
everywhere and there is love everywhere
I think of all the relationships you
have in your life all the love that is
around you so much so that there is
definitely enough to be grateful for so
let's talk about meaning let's break it
down here for me I think having meaning
in your life is having a life that's
worth living having something to live
for something to look forward to and
it's just something that gives you a
full appreciation for life I really
think having a meaningful life is a life
that you can fully love and appreciate
that gives you something in return
so I think you can break it down into
different areas you can get meaning from
your passions if you're passionate about
something in life it gives you meaning
whether you're passionate about a hobby
or activity like if you love sports if
you love dance music whatever it is
maybe you're passionate about your job
like me I'm passionate about creating I
love art I love making things pretty
like taking photos thing
like that gives my life some sort of
meaning because a few of my passions
meaning can also come from your
relationships so think about the
relationships that make your life worth
living the relationships are so
beautiful so full so loving that it just
it's really all that matters to you in
your life your relationship with your
family members significant others
whatever it may be relationships to even
people you you've never met maybe the
people who inspire you people you admire
your idols
maybe those relationships give your life
some sort of meaning as well next you
can definitely find meaning by giving
back to others by helping others by
contributing to the world in some way so
this is why service always feels good it
always feels good to give because
there's something I think that peels
your soul when you give to others it's
kind of like you help another human
being that like connects you with them
and it's something that's very spiritual
that just gives your life that boobs
that beauty and that meaning so if you
ever feel like you're in a rut and you
ever feel a little lost or your life is
just kind of blah do something to help
someone else or like gives back in some
way because that will just fuel your
life with so much new energy this is a
huge part of why I do what I do through
live and air through these videos
because to me just when I share what I
learn when I create that's half of the
equation I love creating yes it gives me
meaning but the other half is that I get
such positive feedback from you guys I
genuinely feel like I'm helping others
and it's just so fulfilling there's
nothing else I'd rather do because
honestly hearing your comments getting
your emails just knowing that I'm making
some difference whether it's just in one
person's life it really just makes my
entire life feel like it means something
so giving back in any way shape or form
can definitely give your life a lot of
meaning meaning can also come from a
hunger or a dry
that you have within so maybe you have
this very deep burning drive to do
something specific or to reach some sort
of goal or accomplish something to
create something that can fuel your life
and give your life meaning
so that's very specific it just depends
on your personality
maybe you've discovered something that
you're really interested in that you
really want to pursue or maybe you've
discovered like a cause a pain in
society that you really really want to
help solve that can give your life so
much meaning and just talking about this
actually I think this relates to both
the passion and the giving back segments
of meaning so I guess you know there is
some overlap here and I'm sure there are
other ways where you can find meaning in
your life these are just a few that I
want to start out with and I want you
guys to ask yourself these questions
like what gives meaning to my life where
do I find meaning in my life because
maybe you feel kind of blah right now
and I totally get it because I've been
there I've been there where my life felt
like it had no meaning and I felt like I
had no reason for living and it's not a
very nice way to live you know it can be
very depressing it could be very just
stagnant it could be very bland and I
definitely want you guys to be able to
see life with a new perspective to be
able to put meaning to add and bring
meaning to your life and see the beauty
and the love that's around and also just
decide what matters most to you in your
life and to bring more of that into your
life so there's a lot of different parts
to this and I know it might sound messy
now because it's kind of disorganized in
my head but I've made a worksheet for
you that you can download print out and
fill out to help you explore what brings
meaning to your life so if you want to
explore this topic further then I
recommend you click on that link in the
description below to download that
worksheet and work on it for yourself
because we're all different here I'm
curious to know where you find meaning
in your life because it might be
completely different from the way I see
it in mind so that's it for today make
sure you stick around to watch the
upcoming videos in this back to basics
series I'm super excited to just go back
to the
simple things and just remember the
things that are most important to us
focus on the stuff that's most important
to us simplify as much as possible so
I'll see you in my next videos have a
beautiful weekend I'll see you next time
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
