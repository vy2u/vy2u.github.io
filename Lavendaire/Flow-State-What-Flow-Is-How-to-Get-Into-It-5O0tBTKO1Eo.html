this week like I wanted to because I was
stuck in a flow State making music which
is good and I'm happy about I was
actually working on a remix that you can
check out right here on my new music
channel and for the past couple of days
I was just just immersed in creating and
producing and practicing remix inge flow
is one of my favorite things it's one of
my favorite words and I just wanted to
share it with you guys so flow is when
you are completely involved and immersed
in whatever you're doing and you forget
about yourself you forget about whatever
is happening in the outside world and
you are so focused on doing that thing
and you are enjoying being so focused on
it usually your best work is created out
of flow State because that's when your
brain is operating at its optimal level
and flow is fun flow is cool because
when you're in that flow state you lose
perception of space time and everything
and nothing matters except for whatever
you're doing how do you get into flow
well if you check out this chart flow is
defined as that corner area of the graph
where you are doing something that you
are relatively good at and something
that is challenging for you on that high
level of skill so flow happens when you
are challenged but not to challenge
because you're good enough at that thing
to overcome that challenge and if you
continue to do this then you essentially
grow flow pushes you to growth because
you are learning and overcoming all of
these challenges so the more you do the
more challenges you overcome and you
know more and more you have to find
things that are more challenging and
more challenging and more challenging to
reach that flow state because you are
getting better
I'm better at it so if you didn't know a
flow was before now you know you've
probably experienced it before you just
didn't have a word for it but it's a
pretty cool thing I hope you guys can
all reach flow state and do awesome
stuff and make awesome things and share
with the world please check out my
previous videos I have a video on
self-love and how to love yourself
better and I also have another video on
happy power poses check that out please
like subscribe share my videos do what
you want you don't have to do any of
that but I would be happy if you did bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
