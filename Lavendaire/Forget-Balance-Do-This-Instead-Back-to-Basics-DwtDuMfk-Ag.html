so today I want to go back to basics I
want to simplify our lives go back to
what's important so this series is all
about spring cleaning your life just
going back to the foundation of what
really matters so today I want to just
say forget balance and do this instead
so I've always been an advocate of
balancing all different areas of life so
I would focus on health relationships
career personal growth and happiness and
sometimes I would throw in creativity
and I would try to be growing in all of
those areas a little bit at a time just
trying to balance everything but I came
across this blog where they wrote I
don't believe in balance because you
know life is always one way or the other
and it got me thinking it kind of like
flipped my mindset a little bit because
I'm like okay what if that's true what
if balance is never attainable because
perfect balance
you know that's perfection and as we all
know life is never perfect there's
always one thing that pulls us more than
the other thing and there's always one
area where we're falling off more than
another area and yeah that is very true
in my life as well even when I'm trying
to work on all these things at once so I
realized that you know maybe it's not
about balance maybe we can simplify this
make maybe we can make it easier so
instead of trying to do all these things
at once instead of trying to fill your
plate and try to balance all these areas
of life what I just ask myself what is
the biggest thing I need right now what
do I need right now and then give that
to myself so as you might know I talked
about it in my previous video that I
spent this past couple weeks like
recovering because I was SuperDuper sick
my website was down nothing was really
going right and at that time I knew that
the thing I needed most was
rest I need a time to just take my own
personal vacation stay in bed get a lot
of sleep and just recover instead of
stressing out about like oh my God my
websites down let's get it back up up up
let's try to do all this stuff
I let myself slow down and rest because
I knew that's what my body needed and I
knew that the other things could wait so
maybe you just ask yourself what is the
thing that you need the most right now
instead of asking yourself like okay how
can I juggle all of these things at once
ask yourself what's the one thing that
you need to give yourself right now
maybe it's rest like myself or maybe you
need to support yourself financially so
you need to focus on your career
building that or maybe you've been
working too hard maybe you need to focus
on you know exploring your creativity or
having fun or maybe you've been
neglecting your relationships and that's
something that you need to work on and
put more love and energy into so
whatever it is ask yourself what do I
need right now what's that one thing
where I can give more of myself to what
is that one area I might have been
neglecting that I can take care of now
so make it real simple ask yourself what
is that one thing and then look at it
work on it do what you can do your best
and that's it all right I hope you liked
today's back to basics quick tip right
here ask yourself what do you need is
the most right now what does your life
need what do you need and then just give
that to yourself do what you can to
nurture the areas that need to be
nurtured alright that's it for today if
you haven't watched the previous back to
basics video make sure you watch that
that's the video about how to find
meaning in your life plus I give out a
free worksheet that you can download to
help you explore what gives meaning to
your life alright have a beautiful day
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
