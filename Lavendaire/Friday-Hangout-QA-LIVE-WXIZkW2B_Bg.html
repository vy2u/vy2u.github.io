to batch shoot a lot of videos because
I'm gonna be traveling in April I'm
going to Coachella
I feel like Coachella is like a trip
because it takes like five days out of
your schedule so I'm going to Coachella
next week and then I'm going to China
like right after Coachella
so just I'll be back for a few days and
then I'm going to China to see my dad so
I'm gonna be gone like half of April so
that's why I'm trying to like record
videos in advance and stuff so yeah you
see Isabelle has a baby shower for a
friend reading your journal Oh
reading books cool um Kimberly asked
what is your current skincare staple I
should have brought my skincare stuff I
what's my staple not everything is my
staple I'm using this witch hazel toner
so when you're looking for toners look
for like toners without alcohol and then
it's a toner with a witch hazel there's
a bunch of different brands that have
witch hazel in it but like I love toners
with witch hazel and then I'm still
using my SK 2 essence the bougie one and
I love it I'm like almost done with the
bottle that I think I'm gonna have to
repurchase another one cool this is so
much fun like seeing what you guys are
doing and then a happy April is that
crazy that March is over and it's April
already I don't know if you guys are
doing the workbook too
if you have the workbook digital or
print just a reminder to do your own end
of the month review so I did my March
review and even if you don't have the
workbook it's a good time to like review
your month and a good time to review the
first three months of the year like we
finished quarter one and then we're
going into quarter 2 so in my workbook I
have like a quarterly review section
where I write down like celebrating my
wins what lessons I learned how I did
what am i excited about moving forward
and then there's like a planning section
for like q2 so my cue to focus is
renewal I'm trying to like refresh
things and I think it's a good time to
refresh things because it's spring so
I'm trying to like make a new youtube
banner I want to make a new podcast
cover art I don't really like my podcast
artwork so I'm trying to make it better
where the text pops out more but I think
I have to plan like a photo shoot for
that so I'm trying to like just up my
game and make everything look prettier
but yeah let me know what you guys are
focused on for next quarter what do you
want to accomplish from April to I think
it's June yeah April to June cool
ok I'll answer some questions someone
asked what weekend are you going to
Coachella I'm going to weekend one I've
only gone to weekend ones before and I
don't know I'm not opposed to trying
weekend 2 in the future but I love I
love going weekend one cuz the grass is
still green
I think after one weekend of the
festival everyone stomps on the grass
and it's basically like dirt the next
week so yeah umm good lady asks how do
we get your work book go to lavender
calm slash shop and then you'll find my
work book the digital print version and
then the mastermind program that I host
as well so if you guys like talking to
me live I actually do this twice a month
in my mastermind Facebook group but
that's like a very exclusive
but if you want to join though all the
info is on my website under lab intercom
so you can find that and yes we do ship
worldwide to most countries the only
thing is shipping takes long if you're
like in Asia or Australia it just takes
long but we do it is an option carrion
asked can you do more live streams yeah
I think it'd be fun to do more live
streams maybe like once a month or
something um okay
Ulysses can you do a room tour so I'm in
my apartment there's not much in this
room and it's kind of messy right now
cuz I'm organizing makeup but that's the
bed I want to change this this came from
like my boyfriend's old room we put that
up I like that it says calm isn't that
cute it's from society6 and I wanted to
keep the room really simple because it's
just a place to relax and then here I
have okay yeah I already showed you guys
in the beginning but like area this is
where I sit and do my makeup I really
like sitting with a big mirror so I'm
putting my makeup here filling the
drawers up with makeup and then um else
about it everything else is kind of a
mess like I just have like you know
boxes and stuff so yeah hi I'm maudlin
so good to see you oh yeah thank you
guys for listening to the podcast yeah
if you guys are not caught up with the
podcast catch up now cuz the seasons
getting really good I'm talking about my
podcast like it's a show but really
though because I so this whole week I
didn't post a video partly because of
things being pushed back but also
because the whole week I was recording
podcasts so I recorded maybe like 10
more episodes this week and officially
starting actually no I have one more
tomorrow but after tomorrow I'm done
with this whole season so the season
will go to like end of August but I have
some really really good guests on the
podcast everyone brings something unique
to the table we have artists authors
spiritual leaders and
um I don't know I love meeting people
through my podcast and to be honest guys
I because I'm an introvert I'm always at
home
it's the podcast is my way of like
making new friends and talking to
strangers and it's really amazing how
like you can talk to a complete stranger
for the first time and have a very deep
conversation if you know how to ask the
right questions literally you guys you
can like walk up to a stranger on the
street if they're willing to talk if you
just meet a stranger and you're in a
conversation like you can talk about
anything and you can get really deep
just I don't know that that just baffled
me because I think I I feel like I get
deeper with conversations on my podcast
with strangers versus like some friends
you know when you're at a party you try
to keep everything surface level but um
I don't know it's really interesting
all the Risso said I love the air in May
Henry podcast with your interview thank
you yeah I did a Erin May Henry she's
also youtuber she interviewed me for her
podcast so if you go to my Facebook or
something like I've posted the link to
that I actually haven't listened to it I
want to listen to it this weekend
sometimes I don't listen to myself when
I'm on like when other people interview
me I just do the interview and I usually
don't really listen to it again cuz it's
awkward to hear yourself I'm scrolling
back you guys have a lot of comments
favorite movie Moulin Rouge although
that's kind of outdated because that was
my favorite movie in since high school
so a new favorite movie would that's
hard but I like things that are musical
and romantic things like lala land and
the greatest showmen and um like
romantic comedies those are my favorites
to watch what's another one that I
really really like I can't think of it
right now how many episodes are in one
season
diaries of Sarika so for my podcast it
varies because I would say it's between
like 25 to 40 episodes one season right
now it's gonna be a short season
previously I did a hiatus in the winter
during the time I was selling my work
book but I think it's smarter to keep
the podcast going during the winter so
instead of taking a winter break I'm
doing like a short podcast season taking
a little like fall I think it's fall
break yeah a little break in the fall
and then coming back in winter so I can
have the podcast and promote the work
book at the same time during like New
Year's so that's the only reason why
this season is especially like a little
bit shorter I'm just drinking water in
this cup I'm reading your comments if
someone says they really like the
managing your money podcast with Jesse
Meachem he's the founder of you need a
budget calm so I interviewed him like I
think was the last season where we
talked about money I mean sorry there's
a lot of I feel like the comments are
like repeating are you guys just writing
comments over and over again Eileen have
you been to other music festivals if so
which ones I'm where I haven't been to
that many of I think Coachella is the
main one and I've been to a long time
ago I've been to Warped Tour which is
the rock music festival it was in high
school where I you know rock bands
during high school like rock was really
in I think now it's not even a thing
anymore I think that caught that warped
or is is gone
it's not even in business which is
really sad but I've been to that I
haven't been to any festivals outside of
LA yeah
Lilian asked have you heard of row a row
eNOS I yes of course so we were at
Hawaii together last week but the funny
thing you guys probably watch her videos
too but Rowena and I both went
u.s. see she's a couple years younger
than me but we're in the same major so
we have mutual friends and like maybe
two years ago when I was doing lab and
there she was just starting her channel
she reached out to me for advice so I
actually like got on a call with her and
gave her advice like two years ago so
it's crazy to see that her channel has
recently blew up a little bit and she's
where it were so similar where we're
both INFJs which is really surprising so
I don't know I feel like yeah I'm proud
of her and it's cool that she's like
coming up and doing her thing and I
think that she has a great personality
she's really fun and so yeah it's cool
to see more and more people talking
about self help and self-care because I
think when I started my channel it was
really rare to find videos like this and
that's why I started making videos like
this because I'm like people my age
aren't talking about self-care or
self-love or self-help spirituality all
these topics I used to think I was weird
for being interested in them but but now
I think it's more of like a norm and
it's it's coming up so I appreciate that
jessica says rock is still alive yeah I
know it's alive but I said Warped Tour
is dead and I know that because I read
the CEO of Warped Tour post like on
Facebook about how he's shutting down
the thing I know it's so sad
what was my major it was business and I
focused on marketing and international
business cool hi honey licious from
Korea I've been obsessed with kpop
lately more so just I you and just
watching videos of like Korean variety
shows and I noticed that all the variety
shows have the same people over and over
in Korea is that how it is I noticed the
same faces of these guys they're like on
every single show
okay there's so many comments I'm like
going through them Clarissa asked how do
you learn from failure I think that's a
good question because if you're asking
that then you already know that every
failure is is there so that you can
learn from it
I think we're meant to make mistakes and
we're meant to fail and the worst thing
is like failing and then blaming it on
someone else and not taking
responsibility for it so whenever you
make a mistake or you fail don't don't
blame it on other circumstances or other
people like really ask yourself like is
there anything that I could have done
better
to to make this situation better and
it's I think all you need is the
awareness and self-reflection and from
there you'll you'll figure out what
lessons there are to get from that
situation Col Yin said how do you read
comments I on my screen I just see like
all these bubbles and I'm just scrolling
there's a lot of comments hi black pearl
do you have any recommended books lately
yes okay I've been I listen to
audiobooks a lot now so my favorite one
that I'm listening to right now is
wisdom of Sundays by Oprah Winfrey it's
so good it's like a collection of her
interviews on her show super soul Sunday
so it features a lot of different people
which I like so it's kind of like a
podcast and a book in one
okay
okay you know what I haven't even
started to organize my stuff so I'm
gonna be organizing my makeup really
quick but feel free to keep asking
questions I'm just trying to organize
here is it boring if you can't see what
I'm doing I wish I had a two camera
setup so that there's a camera here and
a camera here so you can see both but
I'm just gonna verbally tell you what
I'm doing right here is my makeup drawer
I have just two drawers like one on top
one on bottom the top one is gonna be
for like eyes I don't one will be for
like lips does that make sense I mean I
think we're gonna organize them from top
to bottom in the order that I do my
makeup so like the face foundation or
concealer stuff first and then I make up
and then lips cuz I do lips take the
last and then highlighter last I really
don't I don't know how I'm gonna fit all
this stuff okay what else is interesting
to talk about oh like definitely I'm
coming out with my Hawaii vlog soon once
you see that guys watch that video
because I have like I had a drone in
accidents it's healing now basically I
had six cuts here on my finger from the
drone propeller and the whole accident
was caught on camera
so yeah that's what happens okay also I
I do want to do a giveaway where I give
away like assorted makeup cuz I get the
scent makeup and too much for one person
to use so I feel like I should do like a
giveaway
I think this was a bad idea trying to
organize all you guys are talking to me
right now I'm just realizing okay fine
I'll look at your um your copier
questions
well island did I visit in Hawaii I went
to Big Island and it really is a huge
island because I've been to two other
islands I've been to Oahu which is where
Honolulu is and I've been to Maui and
yeah Big Island it takes like you can't
drive around the island in one day it
really maybe you can in 24 hours but it
really takes like four hours to go to
here and four hours to go there that you
really have to stay there a few days to
see everything you see have I read
miracle morning by Hal Elrod ask Larissa
I actually haven't I think I've listened
to like the bleakest which is the
shortened summary version but I've heard
so many great things about the miracle
morning and a lot of people do that so
yeah what time is it they're asked no no
it's about like six twenty ish right um
guys let me know what videos you want to
see next like comment below so I can go
back and check like what you guys are
looking for the I think the challenge
was with my channel is that I talk about
so many different
vyx and some of you are only interested
in certain ones like you might only be
interested in productivity where I try
to talk about you know self-love and
spirituality and other stuff too or some
people might only be interested in like
wellness or I don't know I just feel
like the topics are all over the place
and I think that it all falls under the
umbrella of like you know creating a
good life for yourself but sometimes it
could be a mess and I'm thinking I'm
considering testing out doing like a
like in June I'm gonna test out doing
like the whole month about creating your
dream life from step by step kind of
like every video is part of a series of
this journey starting from like finding
your strengths finding your purpose
finding your why to like crafting your
ideal day like that's what I'm gonna try
to do in June it's it's hard because
like yeah I'm thinking should I do like
a whole series on journaling like a
whole month on journaling or should i
suspend everything out kind of like once
a month there's a journaling video once
a month there's a self-care video once
like I really I'm not sure so if you
have any comments or feedback I always
would love to know just leave it here
and if you're not in our Facebook group
the lavender lifestyle community like
you can join that group to just look up
live and dare at lifestyle and you can
always post your feedback there because
I'm always trying to like I don't know
like understand what you guys want at
the same time I have to balance it with
the kind of videos that I want to make
for myself so that's just part of being
a creator and youtuber but yeah thanks
for sharing your feedback
Aisha asks are you planning to write
your own novel not novel per se I don't
even read novels fiction I rarely do I
love nonfiction though and I would I
will write a book I don't know when I'm
gonna try to war I write it this year
it's not my focus for the next three
months but the following three months
maybe in like the fall and winter I will
I'm not trying to rush writing a
because I think I'm still trying to grow
like the YouTube in order because I
think once everything is like more solid
when you come out with a book then
publishers will want to publish your
book because you have something behind
you I think if you do it too early it
might not be right I mean depends like
if you have like a burning desire to
write something now then write it but I
don't really have a burning desire I
just have the goal of the future that I
want to publish a book one day about you
know self-help and creating your dream
life so but the thing is it's not like
sparking in me so I'm not trying to
force it for example like when I came up
with the idea to to create the workbook
like this workbook it was like fiery
like I really I had ideas pop into my
brain like every day every night before
I went to sleep it was like a burning
fire that I had to wake up and work on
it and I know that that's like it I
really think it's divine it's like a
connection to the universe in some way
that when you have that kind of
inspiration like you should follow it
you should have reject it but you can't
if you don't have that kind of
inspiration then it depends like you
don't have to force yourself so I'm not
trying to force myself with a book maybe
I have to like live a little more learn
a little more but yeah that's why I'm
not trying to rush it I'm just taking my
time with it
Angelica asks does attending networking
events help you grow your business in
your opinion is it a good investment of
your time sure I think it is a good
investment but it depends on what you're
doing and it depends on what stage of
business you're at because if you
haven't even started then maybe it's not
a good time to like network because you
don't have anything to show for it you
can't just be like networking be like oh
I want to start this thing but if you
know like you can't I feel like at that
stage your priority should be like
getting your business off the foot off
it's what getting it off to a good start
and then networking comes when you need
like it's always nice to meet people
just first of all to meet other
entrepreneur
so that you can talk about things and
ask them questions like maybe they know
something that you don't and you know
something that they don't I think it's
good to like make friendships so you can
learn along the way like that but I
don't yeah I don't I don't really go to
events that often and I think that like
I like going to conventions where I hear
people talk and then lately I'm going to
more like you to be events just to meet
other creators and that's because I'm
trying this year I'm trying to network
and build like I don't know get make
more friends in the industry so that I
don't have to do everything by myself so
I don't feel as alone but it really
depends on like the stage that you're in
I think you definitely have to balance
it and focus on your priorities
networking isn't always a priority
sometimes it is though but it just
depends on your stage sorry I'm trying
to
car Kari says make a video on how to
love yourself I have a lot of videos on
how to love yourself you can look up
self love lavender or lavender how to
love yourself I think those are a good
place to start just FYI um Elizabeth
said she would love a business building
series how you started what made you
grow yeah that is interesting and I
think I should test it because I feel
like is building a business and a brand
is something that some people are
interested in but other people are not
for example I shared my artist of life
workbook like vlog behind the scenes of
the business and that vlog didn't do so
well and I think the hard part with
YouTube is like there are so many things
that I could share but you have like you
guys vote with your views basically like
the videos with more views are the
videos that the audience wants to see
and so it's kind of like as a creator
you kind of have to do more of those
kind of videos now that you're limited
to it obviously like I post vlogs here
and there or talk about different topics
here and there but it's I don't know why
my vlogs never really do well on my
channel even though I I try so much
harder on vlogs blogs are harder to edit
then like sitting down talking videos
like there was a vlog that I really
liked where search this up on my channel
later it's um thumbnail says curious
soul and I think it was hiking with
Clarissa hiking with Clarissa way that
was such a interesting video cuz
Clarissa she's like um she's like a
nature lover she knows a lot about
plants local plants in LA and she is a
freelance writer who travels the world
and and learns stories from like tribes
and like indigenous people she's such an
interesting person so I made a vlog
about that of us just like two girls
chatting about nature and stuff like I
thought I was so interesting but no one
watched it and that's just because I
think you guys are always searching like
how to not procrastinate or how to be
more productive so it is a challenge as
a youtuber because you want to share
certain like things that you think is so
fast and
and yet like you know people want to
watch something else so I think that's
just it's fine I also do have a vlog
channel that I want to upload more on so
if you don't follow the vlog channel its
hello lab and dare that one is where I'm
gonna post more vlogs and those that
channel is really for like videos not
meant to be pretty
it's just videos to communicate how I
feel and it was my outlet to express
myself because I feel like with this
channel the main channel I have to make
the video so pretty so nice and there's
a quality to it I mean oh yeah so
sometimes I just want to make videos
that aren't necessarily high quality or
pretty it's just I just want to
communicate something or express myself
in a different way so that's what my
blog channel is for hello lab and there
so that's why I opened that channel
because I know people don't like vlogs
on this channel so I started another one
cool have I read stories on Wattpad no I
haven't what is Wattpad I'll look that
up later
Aisha Nicole asks you spoke about the
struggles of creating the workbook what
is a realistic project timeline for
creating a product like your workbook
the first time I would say a year start
a year before you expect to launch it
maybe a year is giving yourself a little
extra time so I'm trying to I'm starting
on it like this month so April and I'm
gonna try to launch it in beginning of
November so April May June July so 7
months start 7 months before you plan to
launch it something like this
honestly earlier is the better so I
would say like a year
yeah um what's my zodiac sign Libra and
in Chinese zodiac I am a horse and the
thing about it is my boyfriend Wilson
you'll meet him in my Hawaii vlog I'm
sure I've posted him in certain videos I
don't show him often but anyway he's a
horse as well because we're the same age
we went to school together and because
like both of our Chinese zodiac is a
horse I'm always running around I'm
always traveling and I'm always driving
like around LA all the time and like my
mom she's always like it's so exhausting
watching you like move so much because
she likes to stay at home stay in one
place and Matt I'm actually like you
know going here and there and here and
there all the time and the same with my
boyfriend he's always going like here
they are here there and I feel like
we're always like running around in
different directions if there's events
that we have to go to sometimes we can't
even go together we have to like meet
each other there and drive separately
and that's like annoying to me I just
wish like I feel like other couples they
always seem to like go together to
events they always drive together to
certain places but it always happens
that we're so like our lives are so I'm
moving around that we always drive
separately meet up here meet up there so
anyway yeah oh
until then asked will you be vlogging
your time at Coachella I don't think
I'll be making an official vlog but I
will be taking clips to put in like my
highlights video cuz or yeah my monthly
highlights yeah cuz I think vlogging
takes away from your experience with
that time so I'm trying to like live
more in the moment
honestly like I give it to daily
vloggers it takes a lot of energy to
daily vlog and then you always have to
think about how do I make my life look
interesting or what angle is gonna be
cool to show or what little scenes can I
put here and there and you're really
like like directing a movie of your life
in a vlog if you want the vlog to be
good because sometimes if
living life like but it's not exactly
interesting or you're not exactly
getting the interesting shots that you
want if you're really just not thinking
about vlogging so it's it does take like
a second brain to vlog so I like to get
shots that I you're here and there but I
don't want to commit to like a full vlog
just depends on how I feel Ashley says I
just started listening to your podcast
and it's amazing it makes me feel
empowered oh that's amazing
thank you do you have any book
recommendations which are in a similar
style of my podcast or earlier I
mentioned my favorite book right now
that I'm reading is Oprah wisdom of
Sundays her other book what I know for
sure is also really great and I have a
list of all my favorite books on my
website just go to lavender calm and
then you'll see the resources tab and
then you'll see the favorite books and
you click that the link is I think I
already know the league is lavender calm
slash favorites slash books so that is
like it's like a bookshelf my favorite
books bookshelf
someone asks would you consider snapped
our Instagram stories rather than doing
full vlogs I don't know if you guys know
I always Instagram stories maybe that's
why I don't blog as much because I'm
always Instagram story and everything so
I have a lot of fun doing Instagram
stories so if you don't follow me on
Instagram get on it high violin so
excited you caught this too cool someone
says to give BTS a listen I will I think
I'm like girl voices more than guys so
I've been listening to more girls on
kpop like just IU Taeyang
there's another girl he'll heal you and
I don't know how to pronounce it but and
then in terms of guys it's just like
Taeyang that's it he has like one song
that I really like um
Olo it's Angela says how long did it
take you to have a sustainable income
from doing YouTube content content
creating full-time from doing YouTube
okay I would say the first year there's
no money in YouTube the second year
there's money trickling in and it's not
even to cover like much of your personal
expenses so I was still like working or
just spending from my savings I was
living at home I really didn't have that
many expenses and then maybe like two
after two and a half years to three
years that's when I started seeing
income but it really is like it's not
like one day was like I could fully
support myself it's really like it
slowly goes up and then it fluctuates
because every month is different if
you're having a good month and that's
great but sometimes you'll have like a
slow month and then you'd be like oh
crap
I didn't make that much money this month
and so it's very unstable and then I
would say the point where it finally
felt like I didn't have to well I don't
even know if I'm still at the point
where I don't have to think about money
anymore but honestly it was when I
started solving my workbook because once
I started solving my workbook I had
another main stream of income
and like I honestly I think I make more
from my work selling my work book then
YouTube I think I mean in the past year
I'm doing more like brand video so that
helps too but yeah I would say like year
three you probably year three is when
you start you can quit your job and have
a full time income and then it just
grows from there but at the same time
it's always a little unstable like every
month is different so so yeah I Pilar
from Chile
did you struggle with finding time for
your morning routine we just started
it's been hard for me meditating and
journaling what advice would you give
honestly my advice for like a morning
routine is don't feel like you have to
do it every day I know
yes it's beneficial if you can make time
but sometimes life happens so don't feel
guilty about not getting it done if you
don't get it done in the morning get it
done in the evening or sometime later in
the day before I was so strict on myself
and I have to wake up or I have to
meditate in the mornings and then if I
missed meditating in the morning I would
not meditate for the rest of the day
because I'm like I missed it already
it's over but I didn't realize that you
can meditate any time of the day if you
just carve out five ten minutes in the
afternoon or in the evenings or even
journal in the afternoon or evening so
if you don't get to your morning routine
in the morning you can still do it later
on in the day make time for it in the
evening don't feel so restricted with
that you know that's my advice
Victoria any tips for having clear skin
drink a lot of water eat a lot of fruits
and vegetables it's it's very obvious
but I think ultimately what you put into
your body is what like you know shapes
it obviously there's so many factors to
having good skin genetics viously
I'm not like going through hormonal I'm
not a teen anymore so I don't have
breakouts so yeah I think yeah drinking
water eating healthy and I also
obviously I do a lot of
here so every day I take time to like
wash my face every day take off my
makeup every day call me
I wonder if this video continued yeah I
think it's working
yeah exfoliate your skin and then I put
toner a trick that I've shared before in
my videos is to put multiple layers of
toner so I have dry skin so I really
like the hydration so I put toner and
then you kind of like Pat it in and then
you put another layer of toner and if
you have time go up to like five to
seven layers but you don't always have
to do so many layers but I do toner then
I do essence then I do serum then I do a
moisturizer then I do eye cream then I
sometimes I do like a heavier cream to
like seal it all in the sleeping mask I
don't always do all steps but when I
want to pamper myself I do a lot a lot
of steps for my skin I honestly another
tip to have great skin and great health
in general I think is just to be a
happier person because I really think it
affects it might sound weird but I
really do think that like stress
actually that's pretty understandable
stress creates breakouts and pimples not
getting up enough sleep you'll have bad
skin for that so I'm not getting enough
sleep stress being just unhappy and
negative angry with your life I think if
you're in a place like that it manifests
into things in your health or in your
skin so it really taking care of
yourself is not just the outside it
really is like what you feed yourself
what food and drinks water you drink to
like the positive thoughts that you feed
yourself and and really like being
optimistic about life being grateful
looking at what you have in your life
versus what you don't have looking at
what's going right in your life versus
what's going wrong because there's
always something to be grateful for
there's there's so much beauty in life
so I think I really do think that if you
have a beautiful mindset you become more
of a beautiful beautiful person I know
that might be a stretch obviously you
can debate me on that but that's I
really think that everything is
you're connected I've been doing this
for like 40 minutes I'm gonna have to
wrap up in like five minutes cuz the Sun
is setting and I really actually wanted
to organize today but this was super
super fun I guess I'll keep this video
up and then I will read through your
comments later because I want to see
your suggestions for like videos that
you want to see from me okay hold on
yeah I think that's it
any last questions you want to ask me
before I go let me know but it was so
good to see you guys thank you for
joining and I hope you continue to keep
up with my channel on my journey and I'd
love to like keep up with you guys here
like every time I post a video like feel
free to like update it on how you are
cuz I love seeing like the same
usernames comment like I really do
notice and I've noticed like the people
who have watched my videos since like
2014-2015 which is crazy because I never
realized that I've had this channel I've
had this channel for almost four years
guys it's almost my 4 year anniversary
and it doesn't feel like it was that
long it the years really flew by and I
feel like I was really struggling the
first two years and then slowly things
started to pick up and then 2018 is like
my year like I feel like a queen this
year I not to sound cocky or anything
but I feel like so much more confident
in myself and my youtube and it's really
grown like we recently recently hit 500k
subscribers which is crazy so I feel
like this year's if everything feels
more solid I think like I was saying
earlier
everything was so uncertain shaky like
my friends are like going to law school
and med school pursuing real careers and
I'm here like I'm not really using my
degree she like I don't know if this is
gonna work out like that's how the first
couple years really felt and and I
really had to like stop caring about
what other people thought of me and just
do what I like to do and share what I
believed was worthy of sharing
because I really do think it's important
to share these these thoughts and topics
of like you you create your best life
when you honor your true self you have
to really embrace who you truly are
be authentic in this world stop caring
about what other people think stop
worrying about other opinions and chase
your dreams as cheesy as it sounds it
really is like the core of my message
and I hope you guys remember every day
that you are an artist of life and you
can create your life in every way that
you want every little detail from your
morning routine to your career to your
family to your relationships everything
so so I think that's why I trusted in my
message I really believed in my message
so much that I kept doing YouTube and
then finally everything fell into place
so yeah I'm grateful thank you guys I
love you so much and I'll catch you in
my future videos my March highlights is
coming out soon I think we would try to
post that tomorrow or Sunday so look out
for a new video sometime this weekend
and then I'll have my Hawaii vlog out
early next week I know the timing is so
weird for my videos but just click that
bell so you can get notified because my
schedule is a little off sometimes but
yeah love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
