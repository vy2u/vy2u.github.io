video is about getting comfortable with
being uncomfortable and it's all based
on my experience working on my first and
new podcast the lavender at lifestyle
and before I go into the story I have to
say that my podcast is live on iTunes
I'm so excited so you guys can check it
out the link is in the description
please listen to it if you liked it
leave a good review if you don't like it
that's fine too because I'm still
working on myself I'm working on it
it'll get better in time basically the
podcast is a 20 minute segment where I
tell a story a very personal story for
the first half of the podcast and then
the second half I will be giving like
life lessons and tips that I've gained
from that experience so it's all about
how to become better as a person how to
create your dream life just how to
become everything that you want to be
the first episode that's up right now is
about my story of how I got started in
YouTube hosting singing cover videos in
secret so I was super shy I didn't tell
any of my friends that I sang or even
posted videos on YouTube and eventually
people started finding out without me
doing it on purpose so I'm just telling
that story how I've always been really
shy and insecure about performing and
sharing my talents and how over many
years I had to overcome my fears and
insecurities and finally gain confidence
to perform live so there's a lot of good
stuff in that lesson and I mentioned
Elizabeth Gilbert who's one of my
favorite writers and I know a lot of you
guys out there are fans of her as well
so give it a listen let me know what you
think comment below now I'm just going
to share my experience creating this
podcast how it was super uncomfortable
and over the past two months I really
had to grow more comfortable with that
uncomfortability so not sure if you
watched my heart-to-heart video that I
posted almost two months ago where I
shared that I started working on a
podcast I recently signed with an agency
that's helping me develop my skills as a
personality so like speaking skills
story
skills on camera skills writing skills
etc and they're just working on helping
me grow the business side of my brand
outside of creating content on YouTube
so they encouraged me to start a podcast
because that is like the best way in
their eyes to develop your storytelling
and speaking skills which after doing
like eight podcast so far it's really
improved my confidence in speaking the
point is the idea was not mine to start
a podcast it was totally that agency's
idea and I was willing to do it I'm
always willing to try something new and
I just never dope into that world of
podcasts I didn't know how huge it was
now I know that it's a whole platform on
its own and so many people get
successful from having podcasts and I
notice the trend that a lot of youtubers
are starting podcasts as well so there's
something in there so for this podcast I
actually work with a media trainer who
coached me on skype sessions every week
on you know what I can talk about how to
deliver my story how to format the
podcast all of those details and it
really is my coach Jani who forced me to
get out of my comfort zone because for
me I think I was comfortable with
creating videos on YouTube I was
comfortable sharing like this amount
just like this amount with my life the
part that's inspirational the part that
I like and she pushed me to share like
everything like go deep go scary go
emotional and that was so scary for me
especially in the beginning so I think
my first couple topics she went easy on
me and I kind of like warmed up and then
I think the third and the fourth podcast
she was like all right I want you to go
like really dark I want you to dig deep
into your childhood like fears and
failures and all of that sadness which I
actually was a pretty sad child you guys
too probably don't know that and it was
just like a new experience like
literally I remember the night before I
had to deliver my podcast like for those
emotional ones I was like I was crying I
was writing my notes and crying I was
like how am I gonna deliver this podcast
without break bursting into tears and it
was really hard but at the heart of it I
know that she was pushing me in a good
way it's not like she was forcing me to
do something I was completely not okay
with I'm willing to share my story
because I think it's important to always
share and I'm willing to be vulnerable
because I know that in this day and age
like vulnerability is what helps you
connect to people and it's what really
is how you be honest and true with
yourself and how can I stand here
claiming that I am honest and true if
I'm not willing to share those scary
parts of myself so those first few
podcasts were like oh my god it was so
difficult and I would also get like
writer's block I would have so much
resistance and the thing is like this
agency they put me on a schedule where
every Thursday this lady Nancy goes on
Google Hangouts and we Google hangout
together and she records my podcast so
it's like a thing where you set up a
time and you have to do it because
someone's there to keep you accountable
if it were up to me and I were just
recording the podcast on my own I would
procrastinate like crazy I would just
not do it and also if you're recording
on your own you could like stop and
start over again and you know delete all
of those mess-ups
but when someone's there recording for
you it's like literally a live take
where she gives you 20 minutes she has a
timer and you go as it's a live show
even if you mess up you just keep going
so that's something that I had to learn
and deal with just doing something in a
live format because I'm so used to
messing up all the time on camera and
being okay with it because I could
always edit it out I mean with the
podcast I think we are doing a little
bit of editing but when we record most
of it is like it's just one take I'm not
doing multiple takes so all of that it's
like new experiences for me I noticed
that I was super uncomfortable but I did
it you know
at the end of the day like step one is
like showing up you have to show up one
time I almost did not show up like I was
supposed to deliver a podcast on
Thursday and Wednesday night I was like
oh my god I don't know what I'm going to
talk about like I don't have my content
and it takes it takes me like six hours
to create a content for a podcast
because it feels like especially at the
beginning it felt like I was preparing
for a 20-minute speech which takes hours
to write and prepare and it's not like a
script that you write you just write
bullet points but you have to organize
and you have to know at least what
you're going to say anyway that
Wednesday night I did not know what to
say
and then Thursday morning I was like
 I have to write something so I woke
up early and I tried to type and I just
couldn't finish so you know what I Emil
Nancy I was like I'm sorry can we
reschedule for Friday can we just like
move it one day later and that was the
one time that I rescheduled for the next
day because I was not prepared with my
content like it just got so bad that I
would procrastinate and push it to the
next level and add so much resistance it
was so uncomfortable that I could not do
it and when I pushed it back I was like
okay I have a day to like really compose
and work on it and just go through it
don't avoid it just get through the work
that's how you get through it so I did
that and it was a hard process in the
beginning and I think as the week's went
on it kind of gets a little bit easier
and easier
but there are some weeks where I'm like
I don't know what to talk about next so
it's kind of hard to come up with
content so it's just a new platform a
new medium that I've been learning and
what I've learned is you have to be
uncomfortable and I guess I'll just
share some of my tips on how to be
comfortable with being uncomfortable
I mean step one was show up you have to
just show up to that uncomfortable
experience because it's so easy to just
hide and avoid it like push it away but
show up that's like half of the work and
the second thing is to just relax
do your best to relax it's really hard
at the beach
but that's your goal your goal is to be
able to relax and be yourself because
you are only 100% yourself when you're
chill and you're relaxed and you're free
to do whatever to say whatever and the
next tip is to just do the work
literally just do it just start it just
start taking action because action is
the only way you're gonna like get
through that obstacle like your fears
are so scary but you can't go around
them you can't avoid them the only way
through your fears is like directly
through them because that's how you get
that full experience and you conquer
that and once you can like show up what
was the second one
Oh show up relax and then take action to
do the work and just get through that
fear that journey is going to be
uncomfortable and annoying and
frustrating but it's you're going to
grow so much you're just gonna like
blossom and just become more confident
as a person and you're gonna be able to
tackle the next obstacle the next big
thing so I think that's what I'm
learning about getting uncomfortable
putting myself out there you can't be
afraid to look dumb you just have to do
it and if it sucks if you mess up that's
okay because you just keep getting
through that you just keep moving
forward keep moving forward keep going
through whatever is behind you is just
in the past don't look back don't regret
anything just keep going and that's how
you get comfortable with being
uncomfortable thank you guys so much for
