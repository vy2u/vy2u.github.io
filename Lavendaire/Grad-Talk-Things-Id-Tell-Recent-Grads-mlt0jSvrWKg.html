that it's been exactly two years since I
graduated college so I thought it'd be
pretty appropriate for me to make this
vlog about things that I would tell
recent grads first of all be excited to
start your life so many people around
this time are saying things like I don't
want to grow up or I feel so old and
everybody who's older than you is
looking at you like you're crazy because
you are so young and you have your whole
life ahead of you that's very exciting
you have the opportunity to take your
life wherever you want to go and you
have all of these years ahead of you to
do it you don't realize how lucky you
are until you let go of the past and
look to your future your future is so
bright once you see that you're in such
a coveted spots and everybody wants to
be in your shoes don't take it for
granted secondly if you haven't done so
already I would take the time to invest
in yourself figure out the things that
you really love to do the things that
make you come alive and excited and
think about the kind of impact that you
want to make on this world and the ways
that you can contribute I would take the
time to write your life's mission
statement or purpose statement if you
haven't done so already and just live
according to that you can't plan exactly
what's going to happen for you in the
future but as long as you live aligned
to your purpose and your values then
eventually life will work and bringing
all the right things to you but you have
to figure out what it is you want first
the next one is something that I learned
from business school at USC it's to take
your biggest risk while you're young
because when you're young you have
absolutely nothing to lose or you have
very little to lose when you're older
you have you know a mortgage or
kids and you just have more priorities
and responsibilities that can hold you
back from taking really big and scary
risk when you take risks when you're
young then you have your entire life to
build yourself back up if you ever do
fall flat on your back and hit rock
bottom when you start with nothing and
lose what you have it's not as bad as if
you took a big risk later in life and
lost even more so don't be afraid to do
something scary and don't be afraid to
go for those big dreams and those big
goals right now because now is literally
the best time to start the next one is
to find ways to live your ideal life now
make a list of the things that you want
to do figure out what your ideal day
looks like and what your ideal week
month and year will look like figure out
how much time you want to spend with
friends family reading working out
traveling realize that your life is in
your hands and you can live how you want
to live right now the next one is to be
aware of time you have to own time or
else it's gonna own you
once you're graduated it's very easy to
let time fly by because you don't have
your life set out and organized in
quarters or semesters basically don't
get too complacent and don't get too
comfortable because those are signs that
you're not growing as much as you should
be you should always be looking forward
and pushing yourself to grow or do new
things if you're not aware of that then
you're just gonna let time fly by and
you don't know how many months or how
many years are just going to be behind
you once you wake up and realize what
was I doing all along the next one is
don't worry about comparing yourself to
others I know at this moment it feels
like a race with your peers to see who
gets the best job or who is the most
successful but you can't be so
short sighted because everybody is on
their own path everybody grows at
different rates and the rates may change
over time so you don't quite know what
defines success just yet just focus on
your own life and your own path and you
can compete with yourself and make sure
you are better than you weren't
yesterday the next one is to read learn
how to learn on your own learning
doesn't end when you're done with school
learning is a lifelong journey if you're
not learning you're not growing so make
it a point to always be learning new
things make the effort to just read on
your own or take classes if you're
interested in anything so if you guys
have any additional tips for recent
grads comments below so those of you who
are graduating this year congratulations
I hope these tips did a little bit of
something for you
but in general just have fun enjoy life
and go do what you want to do you have
nothing to lose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
