to lab and Derek today is the last
episode in our back to basics series I
saved the most important thing for last
gratitude
so gratitude is a game changer it's
something that if you can bring more
gratitude into your life into your mind
and space then it will just make you
happier it will make you feel more
fulfilled it will help you truly
appreciate everything that you have in
your life right in front of you right
now so I know that if you're in that
stage where you're striving for the
future you're trying to accomplish these
goals and yes there's nothing wrong with
trying to like accomplish things for the
future but if you don't have gratitude
for everything you have right now then
you're never going to feel like you have
enough Tony Robbins has this quote he
says success without gratitude is the
biggest failure of all and I love that
quote because he's saying that even if
you accomplish all these things even if
you look successful on the outside if
you don't have gratitude with you every
day if you don't appreciate what you
have in front of you then you're never
going to be truly happy and you're
always going to be craving more you're
going to be craving something else
because you don't feel like you have
enough and that's a problem that I think
a lot of people have even though they
have a lot in their life you know we
have internet we have food we have
shelter we have clothes to wear we have
all these things and yet we feel like we
don't have enough or we're not good
enough we need more we need this or we
need that we need to do this when you do
that it's going to feel like a
never-ending cycle of like getting more
and more and more and you're never going
to truly feel fulfilled inside unless
you learn to cultivate gratitude in the
everyday gratitude is something that
will help shift your perspective from
blah to like amazing so with gratitude
you really change your world because you
open your eyes to see all the wonderful
things
you already have in your life that are
right in front of you you learn to
appreciate each and everything you have
in your life and it makes your life eel
more rich and more full and you're going
to feel that abundance in your life and
once you feel that abundance then you're
going to attract even more abundance
into your life once you start feeling
grateful for the things in your life
you're going to find that you have more
and more and more things to be grateful
for it really is an expansion of the
positivity the love and joy in your life
and gratitude is honestly all you need
because we really have enough in our
lives we have everything we need
especially if you're watching this video
and you have internet you're definitely
not lacking and you might feel like you
don't have enough you might feel like
you're not where you want to be yet and
I get it but trust me when I say that
once you start bringing more gratitude
into your life you're going to start
feeling more whole you're going to start
feeling just a lot better in general and
it's really going to shift your
perspective into a more positive one
it's going to change your life for the
better so I highly encourage you guys to
start cultivating more gratitude in your
thoughts you know and when you wake up
think about what you're grateful for
that day maybe keep a gratitude journal
where at the end of the day you write
down like five things you're grateful
for right now and it's helpful to be
more creative and be grateful for even
like a random details of your life try
to write a different thing
each time so that you don't just
constantly write like I'm grateful for
my friends my family my whatever instead
of writing the same things over and over
again start being more specific on the
things that you're grateful for and then
you're going to start being more
creative in finding things that you're
grateful for and then it you realize how
much abundance and the amazingness you
have in your life so this is what I've
been doing in my artist of life workbook
I've put a bunch of blank pages in here
just so I can write whatever I wanted
and I started turning it into a success
joy and gratitude journal where I will
just keep track of all those positive
things things I'm grateful for things
that bring me joy and little
achievements little
victories that I could celebrate with
myself so that's what I would encourage
you guys to start doing and why not
start now so if you're up for it I
challenge you to write in the comments
below five things that you're grateful
for and be creative and be specific on
five things that you're truly truly
grateful for and once you're done
writing those five things feel free to
write more if you want but just take the
time to really sit and feel that
gratitude with each and everything feel
the appreciation feel that abundance
that you have in your life the more
gratitude you practice the more you're
going to feel grateful every day and
your life is going to feel better you're
going to feel better you're going to be
happier so I hope you do this challenge
because gratitude is a simple thing but
it's something we forget to do sometimes
once you can do it more it's just really
easy it will just snowball into you like
a better and better better life for you
so I hope you liked today's video this
