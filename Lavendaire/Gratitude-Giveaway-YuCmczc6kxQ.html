today I just wanna make a video to say
thank you to all of you guys who are
hanging out here with me on my channel I
really appreciate you all being here
especially if you're leaving comments
and you're tweeting me or emailing me I
really really love you guys it really
makes my day to hear your sweet words
and I'm just so glad that we're all on
this journey together because honestly
when I started this channel I had no
idea that there would be so many young
people out there who were in the same
boat as me you know interested in
personal development lifestyle design
and all of these things you know before
I started this channel I literally
thought that the stuff I was interested
in we're for people who are going
through their midlife crisis I'm like
all the books that I love are for people
30 and above and I'm just realizing
through this channel how many of you
guys are out there and I can't tell you
how cool it is to just connect with so
many of you and know that so many of us
are interested in the same things and we
all just want to grow and learn and
become better and do awesome stuff in
the world so thank you guys for being
you thank you guys for being here and
sharing your attention and your life
with me today as a sign of my
appreciation and gratitude I am doing a
giveaway for you guys in partnership
with jord watches so Jord is a company
that makes luxury wood watches the
watches are very gorgeous they're very
natural and it's a perfect gifts since
the holiday season is coming up if
you're interested in these wood watches
then feel free to stick around to the
end of the video and I'll give more
details on how you can enter the
giveaway but first I just want to talk
about gratitude in general so yes I'm
super grateful for you guys thank you
for being here but also I want to talk
about just the simple gratitude that I
have in my life I just I caught myself
thinking this thought which is I'm just
grateful to have made it this far today
you know since I came back from Japan
and I'm settling into my new place and
everything I just find myself thinking
at random moments in the chaos like I'm
just grateful to have made
this far you know I'm grateful to have
woken up today and I'm grateful to be
relatively healthy right now and I can
walk and I can do all these things in my
life and I'm grateful for that you know
all these simple things that we take for
granted I guess we don't give ourselves
credit for a lot of the things that we
do even in our daily lives or just the
little things that we accomplish all the
time instead of being like pressured by
all the priorities and things that you
have to do just be grateful for the
little things that you have right now
you know take a moment breathe and just
be like wow I made it this far look
I'm I've made it 25 years of my life I'm
still standing I'm still alive I'm here
I'm still going and so I'm proud of that
and I'm just grateful to be here today
you know I'm grateful to have this
opportunity to film a video and talk to
you guys again I'm grateful for just
watching the sunset and seeing the stars
at night and just these simple little
things I think gratitude is just so
important to have in our lives
especially when you're in a negative
situation it's so easy to look at the
negative things it's so easy to look at
what you don't have or what could have
been better what you should have done
but instead it's really just all about
perspective so just if you find yourself
in a negative mood maybe just switch
that and think about it in another from
another angle you know what are you
grateful for in this negative situation
so I mean this really has been just
going on in my mind you know I was
frustrated at like my mom the other day
and then I had to lie switch my brain
and turn it into gratitude and so my
frustrations and negative thoughts just
like went away after I turned on that
gratitude switch so gratitude it's
life-changing it's really empowering
yeah be grateful for what you have be
grateful for your friends family all the
support you have every day be grateful
to have internet you know if you're
living in the first world oh my gosh
you're so lucky so all of these things
that we take for granted every day just
take a few moments in your day in your
morning or in the evening and say thank
you I'm happy to have made it this far
the world hasn't ended
we're still alive you are here I am here
right now if you're watching this video
you should be okay so just be thankful
for that be thankful for this moment and
all that you have so yeah those are just
the little thoughts that have been
flowing through my mind lately just
being grateful for the simple things the
little things and just be happy and
proud of being here today just have to
have made it this far into my life you
know pat on the back that's how I feel
lately because it really is that simple
I am just grateful to have made it this
far
