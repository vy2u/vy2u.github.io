something during one of my performances
that I thought was pretty cool so I
wanted to share with you guys so when I
was singing my first song I noticed a
lot of faces in the audience were just
kind of like blank it's like so I wasn't
sure people were enjoying it or not so
after the song I decided to ask everyone
to do me a favor and I said well
everyone please raise both of your hands
and just smile and just feel good in
that position so a lot of people held
that in for a few seconds and then I
said now do a fake laugh and just go
everyone was like and like you know the
fake laugh turns into a real laugh and
I'm pretty sure that 99% of the people
who did that with me felt better than
they did before this is like the
feel-good pose like when you're at a
concert and you're having a great time
and you're like yes and it's also the
suppose when you are running a marathon
and you're about to cross the finish
line and you're like yeah and you just
feel like a boss like my point is that
there's a connection between our body
posture body language and our brain how
we really feel
I learned this a long time ago from a
TED talk by Amy Cuddy on power poses
what she says is that doing these power
poses like this winning pose or the
superwoman pose make you feel more
confident and happy and just better in
general just because there's a
connection between what your body does
and what your brain thinks about
yourself the same thing happens when you
smile when you fake a smile or a laugh
eventually it becomes real because just
the physical motion of
releases chemicals in your brain that
make you feel happier I mean just try it
if you're ever nervous feeling down
angry or whatever in a blah mood try
doing these power poses and just smile
better yeah just like look into a mirror
and smile and laugh at yourself because
you'll heal slowly at first but it
really works you feel a lot better
afterwards and it doesn't hurt I mean
when you smile and everyone around you
feels more welcome and you you feel
better everyone else feels better
everyone's happier so yeah just try it
out let me know how it goes if you feel
better great if you don't I'm sorry
maybe you're doing it wrong but so if
you like this video then please share it
with your friends if you have any
suggestions on other videos you want to
see me do leave those in the comments I
will see you guys soon the reality is
when you're too afraid to ask then
you're already determining the outcome
it's gonna be a no but I have to bring
when I go sing or perform simple water
and this is a secret stuff this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
