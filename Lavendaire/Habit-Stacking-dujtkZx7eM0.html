talk about the concept of habit
stacking so I got to give a shout out to
James who emailed me an article about
habit stacking thanks James I love the
concept basically habit stacking is a
way to take advantage of your current
habits to build new ones and it's so
easy to implement and it's so simple and
I want to share with all of you guys so
you can start building new habits the
idea is that we already have current
habits that are solidified into our
lifestyle and our daily routine so the
easiest way to build a new habit is to
simply stack it on top of our current
habits for example I want to start
flossing every day normally I'm not a
good flosser I will just forget about it
or be too lazy but I've made it a point
to stack flossing after I brush my teeth
at night so obviously I brush my teeth
every night so now after I brush my
teeth it's a trigger for me to floss and
in the beginning you have to make
yourself do it but it makes it a lot
easier to build that you have it because
you already have that current habit as a
trigger so what the writer recommends in
the article is that you make a list of
your current habits and then you make
another list of new habits that you want
to build and then you can go and match
up you know where would be appropriate
to stack a new habit before or after a
current habit the idea in building
habits is to start small so start with
something very simple like drinking an
extra cup of water a day or flossing or
whatever and you start building from
there because you just don't want to
overwhelm yourself with trying to do too
many things at once but personally I've
been trying to have it stack for the
past couple weeks and it's been working
really well for me I really love it
because I have developed this kind of
morning and then evening routine what
I'm trying to do is every morning when I
wake up I meditate for 10 to 20 minutes
and then I write morning pages and then
if I have time that I will green juice
eat and get on
with my day so the trigger is wake up
meditate like that's the first thing I
have to do and then in the evening the
trigger is when I brush my teeth at
night I have to floss after that and
after I floss I'm trying to read an hour
before I go to sleep so so far so good I
really like developing this morning and
evening routine and I feel like it's
giving me a lot of me time to work on
myself to build myself and incorporate
these new habits into my new lifestyle
that I'm trying to build so that's it
for today I hope you guys get to try out
have it stacking and I hope that you
enjoy it as much as I enjoy it make sure
you start small and build slowly
everything takes time but you got to
stay committed again the article is in
the description box if you want to check
it out below please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and I will see
you guys soon but actually I will be
traveling all of November I'm going to
Taipei and Seoul and I'm very excited so
I'll be making some travel vlogs and I
hope I will post throughout but I can't
promise anything because I don't know
how the Wi-Fi situation is but
definitely follow me on Instagram and
snapchat because I will be capturing and
documenting all of my travels through
that my Instagram is at lavender and my
snapchat is my name Eileen sue so say hi
and I will be back with a new video soon
