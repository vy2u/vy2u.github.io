all about hair taking care of bleached
and/or pastel hair so first I'm going to
go over some haircare 101 for bleached
hair something that everybody who is
thinking about getting the hair bleached
or has bleached hair should know and
then secondly I'm going to go over my
favourite products that I use to keep up
with this
so haircare 101 number one wash your
hair less I wash my hair average once or
twice a week and that's because you want
to keep the natural oils in your hair as
much as you can because when you bleach
your hair your hair is very dry and
damaged and so you just don't want to
mess with it that much when you get your
hair wet it's also a weaker and easier
to break so you just want to deal with
that less wash your hair less number two
use purple shampoo purple shampoos
purpose is to get rid of the yellow
brassy tones from bleached hair and it's
because purple contrasts from yellow if
you know your color wheel basically the
purple tones out the yellow so that your
hair is more neutral or cool toned
number 3 invest in deep conditioning and
protein treatments because your hair
needs it so I'll go into my favorite
products later on number four if you can
take it wash your hair in cold water hot
water opens up the hair follicles and it
makes it easier for the color and dye to
strip out so if you use cold water then
you can keep your color fresher for
longer and also it keeps your hair less
frizzy personally I use lukewarm water
to wash my hair because I can't stand
the cold but I sometimes will blast my
hair with cold water at the end of a
shower just to seal the follicles up and
make it less frizzy when I get out
number-5 only use wide tooth combs to
tame your hair I stopped using brushes
because brushes are too much and they
will pull on your hair and break it if
it's too damaged and so you just want to
be as gentle with your hair as possible
so it's best not to even touch it but if
you have to tame it
and you know use a wide tooth comb
number six no heat your hair is already
damaged and fragile so it's best to not
use heat like blow drying your hair with
hot air or using curling irons or
straighteners I stay away from heat as
much as I can if I need to blow-dry my
hair I will use the warm and the cold
setting I've only had to curl my hair
once or twice since it's been bleached
and it breaks my heart when I use it but
I had to in those situations but just
try to stay away from heat also if I
want curls then I will sleep in a
twisted braid or I'll use foam curlers
so just any method that does not require
heat number 7 is get your hair trimmed
regularly if you have bleach damaged
hair then you need to make sure you are
taming those split ends and make sure
your hair is always fresh as can be next
I'm going to go into my favorite
products to use to take care of my hair
first of all I love to use a coconut oil
mask and I use this before I wash my
hair coconut oil is awesome for your
hair because it's most similar to the
oils that your scalp naturally produces
so you just apply the oil into your hair
let it soak in there and get it all oily
leave it on for at least one hour the
longer you leave it on the better so
sometimes I'll leave it on overnight so
after I wash my hair with purple shampoo
I'll usually put on a deep conditioning
and our protein treatment and I've been
alternating between these three products
so I will use something once or twice a
week because you don't want to deep
conditioned too often so my favorite
hair mask is this one by macadamia oil
and it's the deep repair mask you leave
it on for up to seven minutes in the
shower and then you rinse it out and I
love this because it makes my hair feel
the softest out of everything that I use
and I just love that soft feeling so if
I'm in a rush and I don't quite have
time for a hair mask then I will use
this keratin two-minute Reconstructor by
Apogee this is more about putting
protein back into your hair so it makes
your hair stronger and you just leave it
on for two minutes wash out and then
condition and lastly I will use this
more
an oil restorative hair mask and this
one I used to use quite often but not as
much anymore because I love the
macadamia oil mask more although this
brand Moroccan oil is highly reviewed
and very trusted and loves on the
internet so after I get out of the
shower I will towel dry my hair very
gently and I will use this leave-in
conditioner by it's a 10
this one's called miracle leave-in plus
keratin and it is awesome you spray it
all over your damp hair and you know I
just massage it in there sometimes you
can comb it through but what it does is
it just makes your hair softer and it
feels less tangley when you get out of
the shower so love this and throughout
the week if your hair feels dry still
then I recommend putting argan oil in
your hair it doesn't really matter what
brand of argan oil but just put some
kind of argan oil into your hair a
popular one is this one by Moroccan oil
it's the Moroccan oil treatment it's
basically argan oil that smells really
good and this brand is very trusted so I
would recommend this I've used up this
bottle so what's inside is actually
coconut oil so disregard that I just
like to use the pump instead of scooping
out coconut oil it just feels cleaner
and lastly if you have super duper
damaged or recently bleached hair then I
may recommend this effigy two-step
protein treatment it's for intensely
damaged hair though so I use this after
I did an all-over bleach and my hair
felt super weak I just really needed to
save it so what this does is it adds
protein back into your hair it's this
product that dries and makes your hair
feel hard and then you wash out the
protein out of your hair and you use
this balancing moisturizer to just
condition it
it's pretty intense you're only allowed
to use this once every 6 weeks I've used
it once or twice I believe but I stopped
using it because my hair is a lot better
now after you know time to rest and
using all of these other treat
and so that's if you seriously need it
and if you do I get it
bleached hair is a lot to take care of
and so I hope after this video you kind
of get a feel for how high-maintenance
it is but if you love it then you love
it and you're gonna do what it takes to
get it so that's how I feel I love my
hair I love playing around I love trying
products and so I don't mind but you
have to consider whether it is fitting
for your lifestyle or not so to each
their own
I hope this video was helpful thanks for
watching if you like the video then
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any hair care tips or products you want
to share then leave them in the comments
I will see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
