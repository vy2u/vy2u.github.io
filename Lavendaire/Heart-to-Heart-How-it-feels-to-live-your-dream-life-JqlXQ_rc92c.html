today I just wanted to talk to you and
do a video where I could just be super
casual I'd share what's going on in my
life and just an update on my journey so
originally the premise for this channel
is just to document my journey in
creating the life of my dreams so that's
what lavender is all about and you know
in my description I say that lavenders a
blog about personal development and
lifestyle design I've had it someone
asked me what exactly does that mean so
just to clarify in case you guys don't
know personal development means to
improve and develop yourself whether
you're improving your skills in a
certain way or you're expanding your
knowledge your learning continually
growing so that is what personal
development is I'm all into like reading
books and just learning new things
constantly the other side of this blog
is lifestyle design which means that you
and I we all have the power to create
and design our lives the way that we
want to so that's my whole idea that I
strongly believe and I believe we're all
artists of life you know my tagline is
life isn't art make it your masterpiece
so from the moment you wake up to the
moment you go to bed
all of that life that you live during
your day you can design that you can
choose what kind of morning routines you
want to do what evening routines you
want to do what do you want to fill your
day up with you know what kind of work
do you want to do how much times you
want to spend with your friends family
health career hobbies whatever so that
is all lifestyle design I believe you
can see your life as an art and you can
paint whatever you want in there so
basically this channel was kind of an
experiment and it was kind of going to
be a live journal so that you guys could
see how I'm creating my life in real
time you know the things that I'm
learning and the things that I'm doing
to make it happen and now like we're
almost two years from when I started
this channel and I feel like my dreams
are happening little by little like I'm
really building my dream life here and
it's it really works and so it's really
exciting to just be here right now like
I'm just so grateful for everything that
I have because right now in my life I
feel like I have everything that I could
ever want and need I'm so blessed in so
many different aspects I have like a
strong support system I have people that
I love around me and I have you know I
can express my creativity and I can grow
constantly I'm learning everyday and I'm
working on things that I truly care
about I'm working on my own brand and
business that I want to you know create
into an empire in the future which is
just a blessing to be able to do in the
first place I'm just very grateful right
now for everything that I have and I
just can't believe that these things are
coming true so what I mean by that is in
the beginning in the first few years
after being lost for many years once I
kind of had an idea what I wanted to do
the first few years are still like pure
effort like I had to push myself to work
with no reward and I had to push myself
to like make videos and go out and find
opportunities and this and that and now
I feel like once I've continued to push
myself and I've stayed consistent like
two years later the momentum itself is
pushing me and this is a part of the
journey I guess where people are coming
to me rather than me going to them so
it's an interesting twist we're in the
beginning like you have to put in all
the effort even if you don't see any
results at the moment you have to be
patient persevere for
a long period of time and then things
will start to come back to you so a lot
of you guys know that this past weekend
I gave my first TEDx talk which I'm so
happy about like I think I did pretty
well I did practice a lot for it and I
worked really hard on writing the speech
and then I worked really hard on just
practicing with my entire body giving
the speech which is why I think I
delivered it well and I just felt so
powerful to be up there on that stage
especially because one of my dreams ever
since I was in college was to give a TED
talk it's just crazy that I did it you
know
I felt like that dream came true and I
checked something off of my life goals
which is so awesome and I have to point
out that I didn't seek out that
opportunity myself that opportunity
found me which is the weird part you
know I got connected to the TEDx
organizer because I had a friend who's a
motivational speaker he was going to
speak at that event he couldn't make
that event so he referred to me and it
was just like the world happened the
universe brought that to me like I
absolutely did nothing to try to speak
at Ted because in my mind
Ted was something that I wanted to do
when I was older you know I kind of
saved that for a later in life when I'm
more established then I'll try to start
to do a TED talk I was probably going to
wait till I was like 28 29 30 until I
started to try to speak at Ted but
instead now I'm 25 and that opportunity
came to me that's just kind of how weird
the universe is I think once you put in
the effort and you truly know what you
want and that what you want is true to
yourself then things around you will
just start happening that support what
you want to do so another thing that
this momentum brought to me in the past
month is that I started to work on my
first podcast so I've been recording a
podcast each week and it's in
partnership with this agency that I
recently signed with so they're working
with me to develop certain like my
products so they're working with me to
develop a podcast first and then maybe
in the future there's a book that we're
talking about and it's crazy and I don't
want to say too much right now because
it could all just like you know go up in
flames and nothing could happen so it's
way too early to say anything's gonna
happen but I'm just going to say that
I'm working on things outside of YouTube
and that's super exciting because it's
always been my dream to write a book
like honestly one of my dreams is to
become an author travel and do book
tours and I feel that it's coming sooner
than I imagined in my head
like I said I imagined that I would
start to write my book after I was 30
years old you know and now that I'm 25
it's already happening like things are
opportunities are coming to me where I
can't say no I can't be like wait no I'm
not gonna do that right now I'm gonna
wait because I don't know you just have
when it comes to you have to take it
especially if it's your dream that you
care about and I don't know I might make
mistakes I might just fail in the
beginning but to me that doesn't matter
it's the fact that I get to do it now
and if I fail that's great because then
I get to do it again and do it better
because of all the things that I learned
from the first failure and if the second
time fails then that's great because I
get to do it better and better better
and I guess I'm lucky that I get to
start earlier to fulfill my dreams than
I had imagined in my head so it's just
really weird how the universe is working
right now in my life and I honestly just
wanted to share that experience because
it feels like I'm living my dream out in
real time after so many years of just
forcing and pushing and pushing on my
own I felt like I was just putting all
the work now I feel like things are in
momentum and things are happening and I
think that's just the path to creating
your dream life the beginning
envisioning your life that is like one
part in its own you know finding
yourself finding your purpose
discovering what you really want out of
life that's step one so after step one
you figure out what you want step two
was like putting in the work sacrificing
and doing it when nobody understands why
you're doing all of this work for
nothing for no results no no nothing if
that part is that investing in yourself
so I would say step two is investing in
yourself in whatever way that looks
and once you invest in yourself for long
enough and you're doing it right then I
think things start to support you and
you know things get moving so I'm just
sharing right now in my life I'm going
through that momentum stage and I don't
know how long it's going to last
I don't know what happens after this
maybe it'll go up and down up and down I
have no idea but I thought I should let
you know on this part of the journey
it's new to me so yeah if you guys have
a dream and you have goals that you want
to achieve it's possible just put it in
your head
know what your dreams are and tell them
to yourself constantly and then just
work day by day put in the work to make
it happen each and every day it sounds
so cliche but I don't know a better way
to say it right now I just put in the
work and you have to believe in yourself
you have to have the faith in yourself
because it's gonna be empty for a really
long time and you're not going to get
any reward or any return for a really
long time but if you continue at it and
you persevere and you're super patient
and you stay consistent then things will
start happening so yeah this is exciting
because I think when I started this
channel I wasn't sure that this would
ever happen but anyway I don't want to
ramble too long I'm just grateful for
life I'm happy for all that I have I
really have everything that I need I'm
not lacking in any category and what I
am grateful for is that I feel like I'm
living my dream
and honestly I I told I wrote this in my
morning page journal I could die
tomorrow and I would be okay with that I
know it sounds weird but I could die
tomorrow and I would be okay I would be
at peace because I lived my life so much
up to this point in a way that I wanted
to live my life and I lived my life in a
way that I went for what I want the
crazy thing is that I get to wake up
another day a new day every day and keep
working at my dreams and keep building
more so I feel like I've already built
so much and it's enough for me but just
the crazy thing is I get to keep going
and life goes on and I get to keep
building more anyway I just want to say
thank you to you guys for sticking with
me on my journey and just being here
because it's just so fun to be able to
share my journey in real time with
guys and I mean now I just feel like I
have a lot of work ahead of me I have a
lot that I want to work on and
accomplish and just be patient just be
patient and stick around and you will
see how this is happening how you can be
an artist of life and create the life of
your dreams all right thank you so much
