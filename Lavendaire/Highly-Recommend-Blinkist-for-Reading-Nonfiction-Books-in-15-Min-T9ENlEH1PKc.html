quick video today to highly recommend
this app called blink Asst I just
discovered this yesterday and I'm
completely obsessed I've fallen in love
with it blink is is a website and an app
where you read condensed summaries and
key takeaways from a huge library of the
best non-fiction books and so if you
love to read and learn as much as I do
then you should be super excited about
this concept because for me you know I
have a huge reading list and there's a
lot of great books out there that I want
to read but you know it takes time to
get through a book well with plinkus you
can get through a book in 15 minutes and
they also have a audio option where you
can listen to somebody read you that
short book so I read through three books
last night and I feel super accomplished
because I you know feel like I have a
lot of knowledge I just think it's super
cool because you can read a book's key
takeaways in 15 minutes and if you
really like it and you want to learn
more then you can buy the book and read
more in depth but most of the time those
key takeaways are enough for me and you
know once I read it on blink is for 15
minutes I'm like okay great then I've
crossed that book off of my list so I
think that's amazing and I'm just so
excited about it I found this promo
where you can get blink is for free for
3 months and I'll put that link below
but that promo ends in less than a week
which is why I had to make this video
immediately but if I ever find like more
discounts or promos in the future then
I'll add it in the description below for
you guys to check out but yeah if you
like to read if you love to learn check
it out you can read on the website or on
your phone or tablet you know I'd rather
spend 15 minutes reading this book
summary than 15 minutes on Facebook or
Instagram and so yeah you know I'm all
about learning and growing and trying to
focus on what matters so yeah check it
out and I will see you guys soon in my
next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
