humidifier because it's compact modern
and makes your room smell amazing just
add water and a few drops of your
favorite essential oil and turn it on
the diffuser lights up in different
colors and also shuts off automatically
after the timer is up
skincare is always a great gift for
those who love to pamper themselves or
try new products ever since my trip to
Korea I've fallen in love with Korean
skin care products these are my favorite
Korean products and brands so I thought
why not share them with my loved ones
this year books can be a heartfelt gift
because you're sharing something that
you loved and hoping that someone you
love will enjoy it too these are three
of my favorites most impactful books and
I want to give them away in hopes that
they can inspire some of you as well
a quality journal is a great gift for
someone who enjoys writing and
reflecting or documenting their life if
you know me journals are my favorites
make your gifts more personal by leaving
a handwritten notes or your favorite
quotes in the journal
for your active or eco savvy friend a
water bottle is a great gift
I love the core water bottle for its
sleek design and convenient flip cap and
handle
souvenir cups or cute cups are a nice
gift for someone who appreciates quirky
things these sushi teacups are from my
trip to Japan they're so adorable and
have so much personality I'm totally in
love with them alright I hope you guys
