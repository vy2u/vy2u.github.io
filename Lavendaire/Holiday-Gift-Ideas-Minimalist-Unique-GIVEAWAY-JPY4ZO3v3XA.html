it's Eileen today I'm excited to bring
you my holiday gift guide so if you are
in need of some inspiration on what to
give your friends and family for the
holidays I got you I do have to say that
I hand-picked these gifts and so I feel
like I had a different type of person in
mind for each of these gifts and they
all revolve around my values you guys
know me like people who love self-care
minimalism and more I am gonna do a
giveaway at the end of this video
sponsored by Kingston I'm gonna give
away two of these data traveller bolts
it's basically a hundred and twenty
eight gigabytes of extra storage for
your iPhone it's super cool I'm gonna
talk more about it later but stick
around to the end to find out more about
that giveaway my first gift idea is for
the dreamers and the planners and if you
know me you know I'm a dreamer I'm a
planner I'm sure a lot of you out there
are as well and your friends are too so
if you're thinking about buying a gift
for that person I'm gonna be shamelessly
self-promoting my artist of life
workbook so this is a workbook with
pages of questions and exercises to help
you reflect on your past year and plan
for your next year clarify your vision
plan how to like break down your goals
and execute them and it's basically a
tool to help guide you through creating
your best year yet and it's my favorite
thing ever I'm super proud of it so
shamelessly self-promoting of course
there are other options out there if
you're looking for more of like a daily
weekly planner and organizer I can
recommend this one it's called the
desire map planner by Danielle Laporte
another one that's great is the passion
planner I don't have that but I've heard
great things about it I'll list
everything down below my next gift idea
is for the self-care aficionado or just
anyone in your life that you think needs
more self-care in their life skincare is
one of my favorite gifts to give to
people whether it's for women or men
because people always need to take care
of their skin and most people don't know
how to research what products are good
for their skin so if you're into
skincare then give the gift of skincare
you know it helps other people in your
life you can gift a pack of sheep mask
or something multi-purpose like this
beauty water which is a cleanser toner
and moisturizer all in one or you can
gift whatever your favorite skincare
is obviously I love gifting skincare
because it's like you're promoting
self-care I especially love when gifting
it to people who don't know how to use
skincare so that you teach them how to
take better care of their skin like I
gave my brother and my boyfriend their
own set of skincare products before and
it's because they don't know how to take
care of their skin they don't know what
products to buy and so I kind of do the
work for them and they enjoy that they
enjoy that I teach them how to make
their skin nicer and I don't know you
you'll be surprised at the people who
would really appreciate that
my next gift idea is for the friend who
always has no more storage space on
their phone and I'm sure we all know
that person and you might have been that
person once like I have before so this
tiny thing is called the data traveler
bolt and what it is is a flash drive
that you stick into your iPhone and then
he could directly download your photos
onto this drive and this one's 128
gigabytes which is a lot of storage
space so after you download the photos
onto the flash drive you can delete them
from your phone so that you can continue
taking photos as you like I actually
brought this with me to my trip to Japan
and I really had to use it because I was
running out of space on my phone so it
was really helpful to be able to offload
and then be able to put more photos onto
my phone the other end of this flash
drive is a USB so after you offload your
photos onto here you can plug it into
your computer to offload the photos onto
your computer or your hard drive so I
think it's just such a cool gift
especially for your friend or possibly
like an uncle or someone that always has
no more space on their phone my next
gift idea is for the curious and this is
like my favorite gift idea of this
season it is on the pricier side but if
you can afford it I think it's just an
awesome gift and it's totally worth it
it's this 23andme
ancestry kits so it's basically a DNA
test where you just like take a cotton
swab you send it to this company 23andme
and then they send you back data of your
genetic makeup and I am so like
interested in learning about that kind
of stuff I've got one for myself and
then I bought another one as a gift for
white elephants so I hope my friends are
not watching this video because then
they'll know what the gift is so I
personally bought this kit during their
Thanksgiving
where the kids were like 50% off so that
was a steal I know they're running a
different deal now for Christmas so I
think it's like up to $50 off their kits
so I would just check out their website
if it's in your budget and you think
someone in your life would really enjoy
this gift go for it because I think it's
such a cool idea
my next gift idea is for the minimalists
in your life so if you want to show your
love for your friends and family who are
minimalist do not get them physical
gifts just give them experiences so you
can check on Groupon for a bunch of
deals on experiences that you two can do
together or you can even go on Airbnb I
love their new discover tab where people
are hosting like events and experiences
on their own I honestly love the idea of
gifting experiences because it's
something that you can do together that
is memorable for example when it was my
boyfriend's birthday a couple months ago
I took him to take flying lessons and
that was like really fun because for an
hour we got to fly a small plane around
LA and Santa Monica see the beach and
the coast and everything it was
beautiful experiences like that are just
priceless and I feel like if you choose
something really interesting that your
loved one is probably going to enjoy
then you're not going to go wrong all
right my next gift idea is for the good
hearted and these are the people who
care about doing good in the world care
about being charitable so first you can
either donate to a charity under their
name or if you'd like to give some sort
of product as a gift then give them a
product that is connected to a
non-profit or a social cause in some way
so for example this is the Disney and
Kiehl's collaboration line so they have
like this body butter and these hand
creams and basically 100% of net profits
from this line will go towards feeding
America which is a nonprofit dedicated
towards like providing more food for the
hungry in America I know this is like a
limited edition line for the holiday so
if you can find this in the stores like
it's a great gift because Disney is cute
heels is a great product and 100% of
their profits are donated to a
non-profit another example are these
society socks so these are socks with a
cause with each pair that you buy I
think they
a pair of socks two homeless shelters or
they support homeless shelters in some
way and there are a ton of products out
there that have connections to social
causes so depending on what your friend
likes you can probably find something
that will suit them my next gift idea is
for the bookworms in your life because
if you have a friend who enjoys reading
and loves learning new things then more
books is like more fun you know so I
personally love gifting my favorite
books books that have changed my life
and give them to friends because I don't
know I feel like there's so much value
in gifting a book and this is just a
good gift if you know this person loves
to read because if this person doesn't
read then it's gonna be useless to give
them a book but anyway my friend
recently gifted me this it's called the
life-changing manga of tidying up and I
think this is super cute because it's
basically the like manga version of the
life-changing magic of tidying up it's
like an actual story in comic book form
I obviously I love cone Mari and I went
through that whole process and I don't
know if you know but I love reading like
webtoons so it's kind of like reading
anime or manga so naturally I thought
this was like the cutest gift ever so
thank you Katie for giving this to me my
last gift idea can apply to anyone but
it's for people who you know have a
specific interest and it's for people
who you really care about because it's
like a gift that keeps on giving
so you can actually get a digital
membership or subscription to any
certain program for your friend or your
loved one for example if they love
listening to books you can gift them
audible for audiobooks and you can gift
like three months of audible six months
or even a year and you can also gift
like Spotify for someone who loves music
you can also gift movie pass for someone
who loves movies so this is like a
bigger gift cuz you're paying like a
monthly subscription even though you
don't have to give them a year some of
these programs you can gift like three
months and that's still like a pretty
cool gift because you know that this
person is going to use it basically
there are a ton of subscription
businesses out there whether they're
selling something digital or product
based so you just have to know your
friend really well know what they like
know what they need in their life and
find something
related to that all right now it's time
for the giveaway so we're gonna give out
two of these data traveller bolts to two
lucky winners click below to read the
description on exact details on how to
enter alright have a beautiful day happy
holidays I love you all so much and I'll
see you soon bye
