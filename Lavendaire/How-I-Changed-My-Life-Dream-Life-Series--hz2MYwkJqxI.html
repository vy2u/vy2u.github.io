Welcome back to Lavendaire.
It's Aileen.
Today I'm so excited to kick off our Dream Life Series 
on this channel.
What it is, is a series of chronological videos
that will guide you through creating your dream life,
from clarifying what you want, 
to making a plan, to executing it,
and watching out for obstacles that come along
the way.
It's going to be a fun month and a half, I would say.
It's about ten videos in the series.
The reason why I wanted to do this series was 
because it's basically graduation season right now
and I know a lot of you out there might be
struggling with what to do with your life
or how to achieve those big dreams that you have.
I personally went through a big struggle not
knowing what to do with my life.
I was very lost and frustrated about that for a while.
And Lavendaire really came out of that struggle
and that pain of not knowing
how to create that dream life that I wanted,
and figuring out how to make that happen.
And I feel like now I am absolutely living my dream life.
And I know it sounds cheesy to say,
but really I've accomplished so many things that
I wanted to five years ago
that I just thought that I should share whatever
I could share with you guys
to help you along your journey as well.
If you don't know about my story yet, 
I'll post the video here
and some links below for you to check out
and learn more about me.
But basically, if you looked at me back then vs. now, literally everything has changed.
I mean, back then I was a shy person, very insecure, 
had very little self confidence.
I was also a big people pleaser.
I felt like I lived my life for other people.
I would listen to other people's opinions
and I would do things to impress other people.
And I felt like my definition of success was what society defined for me or my parents defined for me.
And didn't really feel like I thought for myself.
I really felt like I was living life on autopilot.
And then I had this turning point towards
the end of college
when I started to think about what I should
do with my life,
and because I didn't have the answers,
I just got really frustrated and lost 
during that period of my life,
learning how to make my own decisions for myself
and learning how to shape the life 
that I wanted for myself,
rather than what other people wanted for me.
So that was my whole journey, and the past
five or six years has been
me trying to figure out how to create that
dream life that I've always wanted.
And I can proudly say now that I am really
living almost everything that I wanted back then.
Basically, I feel so aligned with my path right now.
I feel like I'm on the right track,
and so many of my goals and dreams of the past 
have really come true now,
especially with my career, with my apartment.
With everything that I have now, I just feel
so much more confident and loving my life.
I really do believe that you can change your life,
you can create that dream that you always wanted.
It might take time.
It probably will take time, 
but it starts with the right mindset.
And I will take you through all of the different parts of the journey
that you need to pay attention to in this series.
So I'm just really excited to get to that.
Alright, so here are the topics that you can
expect to see in our dream life series coming up.
It's going to be ten videos, plus a Q&amp;amp;A.
So we're gonna talk about 
1) starting with the right mindset,
and then go deep into 
2) rediscovering yourself and who you are.
Then we're going to 3) clarify what you want.
Then we're going to 
4) release what's holding you back.
Then we're going to talk about how to 5) take action.
Then we're going to talk about 6) manifesting &amp;amp; trust.
After that, we're talking about 
7) the journey &amp;amp; its obstacles.
Finally, we're gonna talk about 
8) finding balance, building positive habits
so that you don't have to put in the effort.
The habits just make the efforts for you.
Then we're going to take a break with a little 9) Q&amp;amp;A
collected from questions you guys ask along the series.
Lastly, there's a final video 
10) wrapping up some final lessons
and last words and reminders 
about creating your dream life.
So I hope you're excited for this series as
much as I am.
If you want to join in, there's a link you
can click down below to join this series.
This series is going to be a video + email series.
I'll be posting videos on my YouTube every
Wednesday and Friday,
but I'll also send out emails that go with each video.
So the video will talk about the content,
but the emails will have extra homework, 
worksheet downloads, and journal prompts
that might help you do some extra work and
extra digging after the video is over.

I'm super excited about it.
I mean, the main goal behind this whole series
is so that we can all learn to be better artists of life.
And by the end of the series, you should have
more clarity, direction, and motivation
to go out there and start creating everything
that you ever wanted.
Alright I'm super excited about this series!
