lavender today I want to share how I
edit my photos for Instagram and how I
plan and organize my feed so if you're
not following me already you can follow
me at laughs and dare I'll have the link
down below so first things first I open
up picked up go which is my favorite
photo filtering app so these are just
some photos from my recent trip to
Europe let's just pick one right here
okay
so my favorite thing about picked up go
is there are a ton of filters available
and I've used it for long enough that
now I know which ones are my favorite
and what's cool is that you can stack
filters on top of each other and create
your own recipes so today I'm gonna just
edit off my recipes which is what I
normally do so usually I just look at my
recipes and I try to find a good base
for this photo and there's no like
formula I really just eyeball because
each photo is different by the way I've
named these recipes based on where I
took these photos so I have like Hotel
Paris Holub hipsters Coachella just like
really fun names I have a lot of fun
naming these recipes so I picked this
one and you can see that you can set the
degree of intensity of the filter so I
just play around with it I don't try to
do too much exposure because I always
want to stack more filters on top so
once I feel like it looks good enough
then I'll go into my most used settings
because I don't want to stack another
recipe because my recipes are already
like 20 filters stacked on top of each
other I don't want to like overload my
phone so once I add on the first recipe
I'll usually go to the most-used
section and just pick like whatever
filter I feel like I want more of in
this photo
like most apps you can hold down the
photo to see that before and after so
before and after I really like that I
really love just comparing what it looks
like so you can see here there's an
option to save this recipe I'm not gonna
save this one because this one's pretty
simple but that's what I would normally
do if I find a recipe that I really love
next I'll open unum this is my favorite
app for planning my feed as you can see
it shows all of your Instagram photos
and then some so I've already added like
nine photos here and you can see how you
can like move the photos around just
switch it up to see what feed you like
the best and if you notice there's like
the orange Instagram icon that means
that I've already posted those to
Instagram and what I love is you can do
this swappi thing so you can see what
your photos look like in every possible
form all right I'm gonna go back and
find more photos to filter just so I can
give you a better example of how I use
unum so just very quickly let me filter
a couple more
so with this photo of Paris I don't know
if you can see but there are two black
dots there and that's from my dirty
camera lens and it just really bugs me
so I use this app to take those things
out it's called touch retouch and this
is kind of like Photoshop it really you
can take out anything in a photo you can
even remove people from the background
sometimes it just depends on the photo
so what I would do is I would just like
paint over those black marks and then
you'll see tah-dah those black marks are
gone and I can show you real quick like
I don't know if you can see this but
there are those black dirty bits and
then after I touch retouched they're
gone so I really like that I'm kind of
like perfectionist about like making my
photos look as clean and nice as
possible if there's something you can do
to make your photo better why not do it
some other apps worth mentioning are
visco which is super popular I sometimes
use that too as well as facetune and
Snapseed so I would say that my most
frequently used apps are those of five
right there
now I'm gonna upload my newly filtered
photos into Unum there they are and then
I'll just play around to see what looks
the most balanced something I like to do
is I like to checkered my photos so I'll
put photos of me checkered with photos
of scenery so I don't like to put too
much of me too much of scenery and I
just like to keep it balanced that way I
feel like it's like you don't want to
put two selfies right next to each other
another thing is I try to post in
chronological order so those are my
budapest photos and then I went to
Croatia and it looked completely
different so I kept those photos
together and then I tried to do this it
doesn't work all the time you see right
there I have the castle but sometimes it
just looks better when you mix it up so
there's no real rules just do whatever
makes you happy with your feed honestly
all right that's it if you have any
questions for me anything specific you
can leave a comment down below and I'll
get back to you but yeah at the end of
the day remember that Instagram is just
a creative outlet to use it however you
and Instagram is not reality okay it's
just for fun so don't take it so
seriously you just enjoy it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
