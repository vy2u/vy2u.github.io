to love and air today I have a very fun
video for you guys it's how I edit my
Instagram photos so a lot of you guys
request this on Instagram even though I
don't consider myself an Instagram
expert I don't even think my Instagram
game is that high but I do have some
tips that I could share on how I
visualize my feed and how I filter my
photos so today I'm going to show you
how I edit a photo from this to this and
this to this before I go in to filtering
photos I want to talk about my feed so
something that I had to change my
mindset about Instagram what I wanted to
like up my Instagram game was to think
about my feed in the big picture because
if you think about it your feet is the
first thing that a lot of people see
when they check out your Instagram so
it's really important that it is like
diverse and I don't know it just shows
your best work so when I'm creating my
feed I think about infusing the lab and
their brand into it which is very dreamy
Airy
pastel colors like pastel pink purple
and blue and just very bright whites and
kind of that like faded Tingy dreamy
feel that's the feeling that I want my
brand to its sued and for you you might
have other feelings that you want to
create with your brand I've seen
Instagram accounts that are so like bold
and colorful and saturated and they look
awesome and so I guess it just depends
on what you want to do with your feed
something else that I learned about
creating your feed is to make it diverse
so now I make sure to not post too
similar photos in a row and also try to
not post too similar photos that are
directly on top of each other you kind
of want to like checkerboard
your photos so that it kind of looks
very kind of widespread
and even if that makes sense for example
don't post two selfies in a row don't
post like two of the same kind of photos
in a row I guess so if you have like two
selfies that you really like I would
post one and then wait like three or
four photos later to post the other one
so basically for your feet just think
about the big picture of your theme your
color palette your brand and make sure
that your photos are spread out in a
diverse pattern now let's filter some
photos all right so let me show you what
apps I like to use to edit photos I
mostly use the first two visco and pick
tap go sometimes I'll play with facetune
and the other ones I don't really touch
often so I used to edit exclusively on
visco because they're like really great
filters but since I've discovered pic
tap go it's just changed my life I'll
show you later how picked up go works
because it's really fun how you can just
layer filters and save your filter
recipes so let's edit something in pick
tap go I've been really liking this
chandelier shot that I took in Santa
Barbara at our Airbnb so usually under
my style I used to have like a lot of
recipes but I deleted the app on
accident and I lost all my recipes so
now I have to start from scratch which
is fine because I do like I do like to
play with the filters and stack them and
create my own so how it works is you
just browse through all these different
filters I have some favorites already
like I really like air so you can set
the intensity of that filter I'll go
like here and then you stack them so you
add like another filter on top so let's
see Mason looks kind of cool with the
peachy tones just want to bring out that
peach genus I want a little bit of this
tinge here maybe like that much
bright side just to brighten it a little
bit more now looks a little bit flat so
I want to make I want to add some
contrast and let's see crispity this one
kind of brings out the shadows and the
details so let's do that honestly you
can go really crazy with picked up go
filters like sometimes I just spend too
much time filtering just because it's so
fun to like layer and see what happens
to the colors yeah I could definitely go
overboard with this let's go back to
auto color color it up a little bit you
see how like these changes are so subtle
but I have a lot of fun filtering this
way do I like this one you can't even
tell actually I can tell a little bit
undo so if you don't like a filter you
can always undo it I'm just drawn to
like make it look super white this is
overboard but can't help it I know
okay let's do it like that um I think
I'm done I think at this point I'm just
like making little adjustments that
don't really matter so what you could do
is you can save that recipe so those are
all the filters that we stacked and what
should I name it I'm going to name it
like pink chandelier all right so I've
saved that recipe and now I just saved a
camera roll there you go
then what I would do is I would bring it
into Instagram I like it like that I'm
gonna have to adjust this because it
looks crooked to me okay and in
Instagram I usually really just play
with these filters because I get crazy
with this stuff I just really like to
filter things so this one I definitely
need more like structure back in there
because a pic tap go it's a great
filtering out but it makes things look
really flat so if you want to add more
contrast and structure I would probably
use vsco for more like contrasting
photos but I just love pick tap goes
like dreamy filters and my Instagram
where my aesthetic is very dreamy and
pastel and so that's why I love using
that so here I'm going to bump up the
saturation alright warmth
usually I like my photos cool but I'm
gonna leave this in the middle alright
fade
I don't know if I need this I'm going to
put a little bit and then I usually like
to sharpen it a little bit okay and top
um
you see how I just like mess with
everything alright I think it's ready
and then I would just type my caption
and post it alright now I'm going to
edit like a close-up selfie and the one
that I have is already pretty good
lighting so I'm just going to take it
straight into visco so this is the one
that I have imported and let's get to
editing so like I said HP 1 or HP two
are my favorites
sometimes I'll play it with the other
ones though I'll check which ones I like
sometimes I like to use a 6 that makes
my hair look gray and this is more like
purple and blue so I will probably do
hp1 for this one alright I would go
halfway like 6 yeah and I feel like it's
bright enough all I want for this photo
is to add some contrast and maybe a
little texture before after so this
photo is pretty white already so I don't
need to color correct it and I guess
I'll just add some fade because viscose
fade is my favorite fade I don't think
the fade on Instagram is as good as
visco for some reason it's just
different so alright at this point I
feel like this photo is pretty good
already maybe I would I would probably
bump up the brightness and Instagram but
here I think my work is done so that was
pretty simple save to camera roll and
there you have it that's how I edit my
photos on picked-up go and visco alright
that's how I edit my Instagram photos I
guys like this video and just remember
Instagram is just fun don't take it too
seriously don't get stressed out about
it for me I see it as like a creative
outlet to share my personality in
different ways to share my life and to
also kind of color my world in the way
that I see it in the way that is my
ideal so Instagram is definitely not
reality it's kind of like my vision of
what I want my world to be and I feel
like other people's Instagram accounts
are also their vision for what they like
their world to be so I think it's just a
beautiful thing to be able to peek into
other people's worlds and get inspired I
find so much inspiration on Instagram
alright so enough rambling thank you so
much for watching this video make sure
to subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
