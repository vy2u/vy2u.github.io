Welcome back to Lavendaire.
Today I thought I'd give you
a tour of my to do list on my app.
I love, love, love, love this app called Wunderlist.
I use it to store all of my to dos, and I'll
show you how I organize it
into all these lists of my big list and then
just a list for today.
You'll see.
Basically, my system was inspired by the book
Getting Things Done by David Allen.
I read that book, I think, two years ago so
I revamped my to do list system
after reading the book.
But since then, I've kind of tailored it to
what I want
and what works for me.
So it's a little bit different.
It's not super by-the-book.
Let me just give you a tour of how it works.
When you open up Wunderlist,
you see that there are all these lists and
you can actually create folders of lists,
which I love.
On the top, I have Projects, and these are
just the current projects
that are going on in my life that I want to
focus on.
So it's kind of a place
where you can see an overview of what to focus
on in your life.
For most things, when it comes to my mind
and I'm like, &amp;quot;Oh, I have to do this thing,&amp;quot;
I put it down into my TO DO list.
Pretty simple, right?
The TO DO is the list
where I put all my tasks that are pretty general,
that don't fit into a specific category.
And then, every day, I will refresh this list,
this TODAY list.
The night before,
I'll move everything that needs to be done
tomorrow into that TODAY list.
TODAY is what I focus on daily and, as I cross
things off,
I just checkmark it and I love that.
I love checking boxes, okay?
Moving on, I have a whole folder for Lavendaire.
The CREATE list are all the things
I have to create, whether they're videos,
graphics, and blog posts.
Things like that, I'll throw into the CREATE
list.
And then when the time comes
to create them, I throw them into the TODAY
list.
After that I have a list for START A BUSINESS.
These are all the legal,
tax-related things that I have to do.
Not so fun, but definitely necessary.
And then I have a list for REBRAND.
This is a project that I'm focusing on:
redesigning my website, rebranding my art,
so that's another one.
The next list is the Workbook + Mastermind,
so things that I have to do related to that
project.
After that, I have a list for OUTREACH.
These are just tasks related to
reaching out to people and things like that.
And then I have a LEARN list where I keep
links of classes that I want to take
and things related to classes that I've taken
in the past, things that I want to remember.
Moving on, I have a list for HOME and a folder
for Going Out.
A big part
of the Getting Things Done method is to separate
your tasks by location.
If you have things that you need to do at
home, create a separate list for home.
And when you have things to do when you're
out, like errands or shopping,
whatever it is, then create those in separate
lists as well so that
when you're in one place, you batch all the
to dos you need to do in that one spot.
So you see I have the HOME list, and then
under Going Out, I have Calls
that I have to make, Errands that I have to
make, and also my Shopping List.
Another thing that I've recently started doing
in my Shop List is subcategorize
by location again.
I have a makeup subcategory, I have groceries.
And then everything that I don't put in any
subcategory are just things
that I could buy on Amazon.
So it's very general.
But mostly makeup
and groceries are very specific, like when
I'm at the supermarket
VS. when I'm at Sephora or something.
And Agendas is the place where I keep things
that I need to talk to people about.
Things I need to bring up to this person or
I want to catch up with this friend,
so I should hit them up soon.
Or I want to give this friend a gift
because they recently gave me a gift, so I
have to remember things like that.
Under that, I have a folder for my Bucket
Lists.
This is where I keep
a list of the Books I've Read, my Reading
List of books that I want to read,
my Watch List (things that I want to watch
on TV, Netflix, or movies),
and my Adventure Places (places that I want
to go).
And I've separated them
by categories like LA, OC, ROAD TRIPS, JAPAN,
and even animal-related places to go.
The last two lists are things that I don't
look at often.
I just wanted a place
to keep these things.
Foods that I want to try cooking and songs
that I love to sing,
just in case, you know, I go karaoke and I
forget what songs I can sing.
The last folder I'm gonna go over is called
Later.
These are just the tasks
that I want to do later, pretty obvious.
Normally, it's just when I have an idea
or I have this thing that I want to do but
it's not urgent.
It's something that
I don't have time for right now.
I'll just dump it into my Later folder.
I have Write My Book.
That's something that I cannot focus on right
now.
I decided that I'm going to shift that for
later while I spend this time
to work on rebranding and the workbook and
stuff.
So that's in my later folder.
I have this whole list of thing to do later.
And also just: LIST OF THINGS,
just because these didn't fit into any sort
of category, and I just like
keeping lists because I'm very forgetful.
So everything that I want to remember,
I have to write down, and Wunderlist is my
best friend.
It's on the cloud so even if I delete the
app on my phone, I still have a copy
on my computer.
And I think there's a website where all of
the stuff is stored, anyway.
And the folders below, I don't really use
them or look at them often at all.
But like I said, I just like to keep things
in here, just as a memory storage, I guess.
Last thing I want to mention is: I love Wunderlist
for its ability to create
tasks on tasks on tasks.
You have a folder, you have lists within the
folder.
And then within each task, you can open that
up and make subtasks
and you can have notes, you can add files.
So sometimes I attach photos.
I use the notes a lot the time, just to put
my words somewhere.
So I just feel like
there's always a place for me to put my ideas
and whatever I want to get down.
Alright, I hope you liked this tour of my
Wunderlist to do list.
Let me know
if you have other video suggestions, things
that you want to see related to organization
or what's on my phone.
Comment below with your thoughts.
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see
you next time.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
