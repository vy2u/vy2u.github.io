for a couple weeks with just a carry-on
luggage so today I thought it'd be fun
to show you how I pack for Europe let's
start with the clothes so I'm packing
three dresses two long sleeve shirts one
light jackets three pairs of shorts
three tank tops and some pajamas so I
like to fold my clothes vertically the
cone Mario way obviously so that I could
see every piece from the top it makes it
really easy to pick out what to wear I
also like to put my underwear and socks
in this pouch that I got from Japan it's
so convenient makes organizing really
fun and I store my bras and swimsuit in
my cap because I think that round shape
helps keep them in place and those are
my mirrors and my combs this is my
toiletry bag I put everything in here
and I love it
so deodorants face wash face oil for
moisturizer body lotion sunblock
leave-in hair conditioner my
conditioning hair mask toothbrush and
toothpaste my ferio for washing my face
razor makeup remover wipes and nail
stuff that's my makeup
and I decided to put my compact in my
toiletries bag packing some shoes
packing my jewelry in little pouches and
chargers and converters I actually
decided to switch the pouch so there
they are
and I believe that's it okay I'm ready
to go to Europe oh yeah this is what I
keep in my backpack
which I carry as my purse and now I am
ready to go bye guys see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
