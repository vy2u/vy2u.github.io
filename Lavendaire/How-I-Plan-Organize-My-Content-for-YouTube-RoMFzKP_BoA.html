to lavend dare so if you've seen my 20
18 goals video you may know that one of
my goals this year is to get better at
planning ahead for my content so getting
more organized with my channel so today
I've partnered up with Trello to show
you how I plan and organize my content
for my videos so first off the biggest
question that I always get is where do I
get my ideas for my content how do I
come up with new ideas so generally most
of my ideas come from whatever I'm going
through at the moment whatever I'm
currently learning or whatever I'm
currently inspired by so sometimes it's
like life lessons like things that have
happened to me that I want to share
about or it could be like books that I'm
reading that are really inspiring me at
the moment and whatever lessons I'm
learning from the book I'm usually like
dying to share about it
other times ideas might come from
writing mourning pages or meditating so
you guys know about mourning pages it's
where I stream-of-consciousness journal
in the mornings and usually I just like
word vomit whatever's in my mind and
it's funny because like lessons and
insights will just flow onto the page
and when I read back I'm like wow that's
really good I should share that so I get
a lot of ideas from like journaling and
what I'm meditating like when I'm
sitting in silence I'll have like
thoughts pop up I mean usually they're
like random thoughts but sometimes
they're actually good ideas so I feel
like I get a lot of inspiration when I
do those two things because it's where
I'm more in tune with my spirituality
lastly I get a lot of ideas from you
guys so I love collecting feedback on
topics you want me to talk about so
usually like from comments on my videos
Instagram even like emails or dm's like
I'll read what you guys suggest and I'll
collect them on my Trello which I'll
show you in a bit Trello is the app that
I used to organize my content ideas and
bigger projects like my artist of life
workbook and also to organize my tasks
to do with my assistants Alice Trello is
a Productivity app that helps you manage
your work so whenever you need to manage
big projects and lists
your life you can create boards for each
project and lists within that board and
also cards to help you organize tasks or
any information you want to collect
basically I love that you can move lists
around you could rearrange them rename
them and you can do the same thing with
cards as well and also you can put so
much information onto cards which I love
I love that you could put due dates
attach files put comments tag people so
it's really really flexible and so
helpful there's also so many other ways
you can use Trello you can use it to
organize your recipes plan out a home
project plan out your job hunt your
creative process and just any other
projects or lists that you can think of
in your life the best part is the core
features of Trello are completely free
so if you're interested in trying it out
you can click the link in the
description below alright so here is my
Trello board for content ideas and this
is where I'll generally input my random
ideas so when I have an idea I think I
would usually put it into either ideas
or great ideas great ideas are just
ideas that I like more or ideas that I
think will do better and then these are
more general ideas that maybe I just
haven't felt the spark for and then up
next are my upcoming videos that I plan
to do I don't always stick to it I'm
definitely like always moving things
around or moving great ideas onto up
next and just playing around with it
which is why I love Trello because I
love the flexibility of using cards
because my mind's always changing you
know this year I'm trying to create more
series and organize my content so I
generally like I did some research here
on like what were the top videos that
people liked on my channel and then I
basically wrote the ideas for series
here and then I decided to make a
separate list for series so within each
of these are ideas so these are personal
growth ideas these are self-care video
ideas habit videos ideas journaling
video ideas organizing ideas and
inspiration dream life series you get
the picture just I'm trying to just get
better at organizing ideas moving over
to this side of the board
I have suggestions at first I started in
putting your suggestions into
cards but it took a long time so now I
just input it into like a Google sheet
so here is my 2018 feedback this XI I
just started this is the Google sheet
for feedback and video ideas I have
Alice help me input this so whenever you
guys comment on Instagram or YouTube
like we'll put some ideas onto here and
I love how we have it organized and then
this is just my system that I used last
year for 2017 same thing I had it like a
category put in all your suggestions
category all your suggestions which I
copy and pasted and the blue highlighted
ones are ones I think it's ones that i
liked or ones that I was planning on
doing so skincare routine I did travel
packing I did yeah and then this doc is
just one that I created long ago maybe
2015 and I keep it around just in case I
want to pull any ideas from this one as
well the rest of these are just other
ideas like vlog ideas podcast topic
ideas but I don't really spend that much
time back here this last list are just
reminders things that I want to remember
Q&amp;amp;A folder just random things so
sometimes I will put notes in each card
of what I want to include in the videos
like this but for the most part I just
write like the title here and then I
flesh out the video ideas onto a Google
Doc so this is my just write 2018 Google
Doc where I flesh out my video ideas if
you see here I basically have a doc for
every single year since I started lab
and there so we have 2014 15 16 17 and
18 so usually like this is 2017 s
version the top is what I put like
reminders for myself as I'm shooting my
content what I want to focus on and
stuff and then if you scroll down you
have the month that we're currently in
and then the video title and then I
flesh out the video ideas usually I just
do an outline I don't write exact
scripts so here are some future ideas
for videos that I'm flushing out and
then after that I have like February and
later and then these are just like other
ideas that I've flushed out from the
Trello and then at the bottom of the doc
I have
dun pile so these are just ideas that
I've finished and so I just want to put
them at the end of the dock because I
don't want to really look at them again
and yet I don't want to delete them
completely as you can see this was my
previous video the how to make a plan
for your life this is basically what I'm
looking at when I'm making this video I
just have an outline and then I just
talk from there by the way I also try to
plan out my thumbnails for each video
because thumbnails are increasingly
important so I always just kind of
brainstorm what kind of photo would be
good to match this video and then lastly
I also pay attention to different ways
that I can title this video so ways that
I do title research are I use the
YouTube search bar which is really great
for kind of giving you an idea of what
other people are searching for what's
popular make sure you open an incognito
window in chrome so that you don't use
your youtube search history so go to
youtube.com you see how this is like a
fresh version of YouTube so I would type
out like how to plan your so I see that
plan your day plan your life plan your
week these are popular and more searched
so my other options were like how to
plan out your life which is still there
so if you're trying to compare between 2
or 3 video titles then another tool that
I love using is Google Trends so in
Google Trends you can search the
popularity of different search terms so
I would be like was my other option make
a life plan okay so for example with
these search terms plan your life plan
out your life verses make a life plan
you see like the differences in the
popularity and this is what I factor in
when choosing my video titles lastly I
use a tool called to buddy tag Explorer
it's an extension for YouTube so I would
type in like my video title how to plan
your life and then I'll get like most
used tags related to this title and it
can also help you craft a better title
or it could just give you ideas for tags
alright I hope you like this overview of
hi plan and organize my content as
always if you guys have video
suggestions podcast ideas for me leave
them down below
I love to like read and collect all your
feedback and especially you know I'm
trying to plan ahead with my content
this year so I need new ideas all right
have a beautiful day love you all so
much and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
