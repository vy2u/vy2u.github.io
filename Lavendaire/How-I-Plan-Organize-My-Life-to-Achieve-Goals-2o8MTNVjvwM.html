today I want to show you how I plan and
organize my life to achieve my goals and
get things done so I'll show you all the
different tools that I use from my
calendar to my actual planner to like my
to-do list app on my phone before I go
into the tools I just want to share how
I block out my week to create content so
generally I have Mondays and Tuesdays
are my shooting and editing days where I
only mainly focus on shooting and
editing I don't try to take any meetings
I don't answer too many emails during
those days I don't do a lot of the admin
behind the scenes worked in Mondays and
Tuesdays because those days I am just me
my camera or at my editing program so
Wednesdays is when I usually post and on
Wednesdays I have my like posting and
social media and email writing days I
guess it's a lot of like replying to
comment and writing the social media
captions and emails and things like that
and Thursdays and Fridays
I generally block out for meetings with
other people so Thursday is mostly a
podcast day and Friday I try to keep
open to kind of finish off anything that
needs to get done especially this year
since I'm doing two videos a week I kind
of need a shoot and edit a little bit on
Thursdays and Fridays as well so today
is a Friday I'm shooting it see my
schedule is changing but that's
generally how I like to do things I like
to block things out you know set days or
set times for just focusing on one task
and then other days for like meeting
with other people because I don't like
to switch on and off between those two
and then weekends I try to make space to
just relax and give time to myself go
out to eat things like that but I do
work on weekends as well sometimes I'll
find myself like emailing and organizing
and planning and prepping for shoots
which is not too intense
alright now on to the tools that I use
to plan and organize my life so first
off I have my iCal calendar on my laptop
and on my phone I just love that it
syncs together I keep mine open at the
monthly view because I like to see what
I have to do in that month you know I
like to kind of look in the two weeks
that I'm in
looking in advance I like to use this as
a visual content calendar to see what
videos I have planned for the next month
or two so I always try to plan out my
content at least like a month in advance
I also use this to see what events
meetings and podcast interviews I have
coming up so everything that's like a
set appointment I put it in my iCal so I
can always see what what I have that day
like on my phone I also use this
calendar to see what meetings events and
podcast interviews I have coming up so
everything that's like a hard
appointment I use this calendar for and
I like that because I can just open my
phone to the day and see what exact
appointments I have that day
I don't usually add to-do list stuff in
my calendar I just use it for
appointments and my content calendar and
real quickly I want to share a tool that
changed my scheduling life is called
calendly and this is what it looks like
basically it's just a tool where you
could send a link to people and they
could schedule a time to meet with you
so it's made my life a lot easier I
don't have to go back and forth
scheduling and supposing times to like
meet and talk on the phone I just send
people this link and then they could
schedule like a podcast interview time
with me and once they confirm that
schedule it'll automatically show up in
my iCal which is really nice because I
don't have to do much on my end next up
I want to share a tool that helps me
plan out the details of my goals it's
called the goal book and I actually have
this in my 2017 artist of life workbook
if you have it then you know if you
don't have it feel free to check it out
the link is below basically the goal
book is just a tool to kind of plan out
big goals goals that need several steps
to reach so for example one of my goals
this year is to redesign the Lavender
website so that kind of goal is
something that requires a lot of baby
steps to get there so in order to plan
out something like that I use the goal
book and how it works is you write out
your goal on top and then you write out
why you want to achieve that goal and I
think it's always important to know why
you want to achieve something so that it
motivates and fuels you to get there and
then I set a deadline for myself when do
I want to achieve this goal by and
setting a deadline always helps me get
things done because I realize if I don't
set a deadline I will just be lazy and
relaxed and not work on it until I have
to
after that I brainstorm all the little
action steps that I would need to reach
this goal and they don't have to be in
specific order so for example if I want
to redesign the lavender website I would
have to either search for a theme that I
like to use for my blog if I can't find
a theme that I like I might have to find
a web designer and a web developer and
before I even go into that I probably
should decide a color palette or gather
some photos for inspiration so there are
all these baby steps that I need to take
to reach that goal but they're not
necessarily like I have to get them all
done now there's a sequence and there's
a priority so after I kind of like word
vomits all of the to do with items that
I know I would have to do eventually I
list them out and then I started items
on that list the three highest priority
or the three immediate next actions that
I would have to take in order to achieve
that goal and then I would take those
three immediate next step items and put
them into my wonder list to-do app so
that I can do them as soon as I can and
wunderlist is my abra is basically like
my huge to-do list bucket I've organized
it into several different categories and
also I love that you can star your
important tasks so that for example if I
have something I really need to do that
day I would star it and just work off
that starred list but yeah after I knock
out those tasks in wonder list I check
them out I'll go back to the gold book
again and then star the next three
important items and then transfer them
to wonder list again to be honest I'm
not always that organized I don't always
use the gold book sometimes I have an
idea and I just put it straight to
wonder list whenever I'm like oh I
should get this done I put it into
Wonderland's and I just try to organize
it as best as possible so I've shared
about my calendar my goal book and my
wonder list to-do app
next up is my Muji planner and I use
this to see my life at a week and I plan
my to do's and my focuses on a weekly
basis so basically I would look at my
wonder list and transfer whatever I need
to sometimes there are things that I
just know off the top of my head and I
write it into my Muji planner what I
love is the right side is empty so I can
use that space to take notes and I use
it to kind of write down what is my
focus this week what kind of videos do I
need to shoot and edit I'm also using my
Muji planner to track my habits so this
year one of my main goals is I want to
meditate daily and I want to exercise
three times a week so I've drawn in
these boxes for meditating and working
out and I also have boxes on Thursdays
and Fridays to write my book and work on
that so to be honest I've been really
good at meditating daily since the new
year but not so great at working out
three times a week so far and not so
great at working on my book every
Thursday and Friday because with this
new schedule I find myself working on
videos and I haven't kind of gotten into
the flow of this new schedule that I'm
doing but the the habit tracker is there
and I'm going to keep trying to mess it
throughout the end of the year because I
do like to physically cross off like if
I do a habit or if I work out today I
love to cross it off physically so that
helps with motivation sometimes so on a
day to day basis I'm either working off
of my Muji planner what I've written in
those day leakage views or I'm working
off my wonder list starred list because
sometimes I don't have my planner with
me and I just want to look at my phone
and other times when I really want to
like focus down and simplify and not
feel so overwhelmed when I look at these
huge lists is I take this notepad this
physical notepad and literally just
write out the three or four most
important things I have to get done that
day sometimes it feels good for me to
just have a simple one notepad for what
I need to do that day and I know you
guys out there and I think all of this
is redundant like I write down my two
dudes in every way a4 impossible but
this is the way that works for me
because I
day-to-day basis I like to have it
simple I like to have just like three or
four things I need a knock out but I
also like the has a feeling of knowing
that I have everything all my tattoos
all my goals written down somewhere you
know so that I won't ever lose it it's
off my mind on the paper and that's what
helps and it's just like maybe the night
before I'll look through my wonder list
or my weekly planner and then I'll
decide like what to put on my daily
to-do list so that's how I organize my
life from the monthly view to my goals
to my weekly planner to my to-do list my
huge bucket to-do list and then my small
daily to-do list I hope this helped you
guys I hope to show you a little insight
on my life at the end of the day my way
is my way and you might find another way
that works for you
for example bullet journaling is a
popular method that probably it might
work for you I haven't tried it I don't
have an interest in trying it so I'm
happy with my style but do what works
for you and try to find your best way to
focus and prioritize and keep it simple
don't overwhelm yourself and just have
fun thank you so much for watching let
me know if you have any life
organization tips in the comments I'll
be sure to check them out and get
inspired from you so love you all see
you next time
