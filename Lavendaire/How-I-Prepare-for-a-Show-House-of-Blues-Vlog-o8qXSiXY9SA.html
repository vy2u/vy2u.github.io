House of Blues in West Hollywood I'm
playing the foundation room and it's
kind of a spontaneous show that I booked
last minute but I thought it would be
cool to show you guys what I do to
prepare for a show and the little tips
and tricks that I have for singers and
performers so my shows at 9:00 and it's
about 4 p.m. right now and I just
showered I got ready I just ate an early
dinner because I don't like to be on a
full stomach before I perform I rather
be on an empty stomach you just sing
better like you don't want to throw up
or something on stage and right now I'm
just in my living room
I'm about to do my setup and test
everything out and run through my set a
couple times then I'm actually playing
some new songs tonight so I have to
practice those Oh and before I go let me
talk about the essentials of the stuff
that I have to bring when I go sing or
perform simple water and this is a
secret stuff this is it's an Asian
loquat syrup supplements thing it's kind
of like a type of honey it's really good
for your throat and it's these packets
of syrup you're supposed to dump them
and tea but what I do is I just like
drink the syrup I know it's kind of
weird but they really like it makes your
throat so smooth and buttery and you
could sing a lot better with those so
I'm always on this before I perform I'm
always on these two before I perform and
that's about it everything else is chill
so bye
yeah
so this is the gear that I pack I have
my laptop charger the syrup my CDs my
loupe machine petal water and my
keyboard so when I'm driving you can
find me doing warm-ups or just singing
bah
don't never subs you're safe pom pom
never comes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
