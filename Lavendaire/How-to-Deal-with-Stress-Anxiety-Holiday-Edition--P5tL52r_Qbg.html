so good to see you again and to be back
in my usual setup did you notice I
decorated this for the holidays
yeah I'm lazy but I think it counts
right all right so it's holiday season
Thanksgiving is right around the corner
and Christmas is coming up right after
that so this is like one of the busiest
most stressful times of the year do you
agree with me yeah so today I thought
it'd be nice to drop some tips on how to
have a stress-free holiday season
because ultimately this time is supposed
to be fun it's supposed to be about
spending time with the people you love
and just enjoying the winter as best you
can I personally don't like winter but
the holidays make it bearable by the way
if you're new here make sure you
subscribe click that bell right there
and also I don't know if you guys know
this but I have a vlog channel where I
post more vlogs so I'll link that right
there so you guys can catch up with me
and more of my personal life and stuff
like that my first tip on how to have a
stress-free holiday season is so simple
it's just stop for a second and breathe
okay breathe take a minute to just stop
and be present be mindful of the moment
in front of you usually when we're
stressed out during this time it's
because we're thinking about the holiday
party we have to prepare for or just all
these responsibilities gift shopping etc
so instead of like putting your mind on
the things you have to do or the things
that are coming up just take this moment
to ignore the future stop worrying and
enjoy the present moment that's right in
front of you and know that you can
always handle what's ever in front of
you you can always handle the present I
find that when you're stressed or
overwhelmed the thing that will benefit
you the most is just to take like a deep
breath ten deep breaths and just sit and
notice the moment that's right in front
of you also take the present moment to
be thankful for what you have
bring gratitude into your moments I know
it's Thanksgiving soon but honestly
gratitude is something you should be
practicing like every single day of the
year not just around Thanksgiving so
it's
importance - just remember to stop
breathe take time to be present and be
thankful for what you have my second tip
is start early with your holiday
shopping so ideally you should start now
start planning on what gifts you need to
get for your loved ones and even better
like maybe you can work out a thing
where you don't have to get as many
gifts so less gifts to buy equals less
stress for example with my friends and
family now we only do like white
elephant gift exchange which means we
each bring one gift to the party and
then we play this game where it's like a
I'm sure you guys have heard of it if
you don't know about it I'll post a link
on instructions on how to play white
elephant but it really just reduces the
stress from like having to find gifts
for every single person versus like
bringing one gift and having this game
where you can spend some more fun
bonding time together you can also
consider not getting physical gifts at
all instead like take your loved ones
out to a nice dinner or buy tickets to a
certain experience anything goes I'll
actually be coming out with a holiday
gift guide video soon so stick around
for that number three remember that it's
okay to say no it's okay to decline
invitations to parties it's okay to not
help someone do something when your
plate is already full like just know
that you don't have to be a people
pleaser during this time and because the
holidays is a time where everyone is
super busy if you say no people will
understand why because you know
everyone's busy generally we respect
each other's busyness and if you don't
have time to come to the party or if you
don't have time to help them out with
something it sucks but at the same time
most likely people will understand that
you can't do that because ultimately
guys our well-being is our number-one
priority if you're gonna go crazy
pulling yourself in all these directions
it's not worth it so just remember it's
okay to say no my fourth tip on how to
have a stress-free holiday season is to
declutter your to-do list so you might
have a ton of things to do during this
time so it's important to start to
declutter and cross out the things that
aren't really necessary so with each
task ask yourself if I don't do this
it's gonna happen if the world's gonna
end if it's really important then okay
do that thing but you might realize that
some things are not super important it's
just like a nice-to-have so this is your
time to kind of cut things out simplify
and prioritize I actually have this
exercise that I shared in this previous
video I'll link it right here it's an
interactive exercise you can follow to
declutter your to-do lists and this
leads me to my next tip which is done is
better than perfect I've mentioned this
line before it's kind of a motto I have
when things get crazy and the inner
perfectionist and you just wants to make
everything perfect wants to get all the
details right but in reality you don't
have that much time and you only have so
much sanity left that it's okay if
things are just good enough and you just
leave it at that for example if you're
hosting a holiday party and you want all
the food and decorations to be super
pinterest and aesthetic like that could
be a lot of pressure so I know we want
to strive for perfection but just learn
to be okay with good enough learn to be
okay with you know what done is better
than perfect
number six save time for self-care I
always talk about how self-care is the
most important thing because you've got
to take care of yourself first before
you give and take care of others so
during the holiday season even I am
guilty of this I kind of like put my
self care on the back burner and just
like you know you're so busy doing
everything else that you kind of give
away you kind of like forge your
self-care time my tip today is to
preserve your self-care routine continue
doing the things that feed your soul
that make you feel good for example your
morning routine whether you like to
meditate or journal or exercise do those
things still during the holiday season
because it's important to stay
consistent with your self-care so that
you don't get too like overwhelmed and
crazy even if you're just carving out
like 10 to 15 minutes of me time in the
mornings that will make so much of a
difference in the rest of your day my
next tip is to use aromatherapy to
create a calming space for yourself so
you can de-stress and relax scents are
actually really powerful in changing our
mood
and our mindset so having calming scents
like lavender or eucalyptus in your
environment will really shape the way
that you feel in your day so I love
using this little aroma diffuser I put
like a couple of drops of essential oils
and I have like an essential oil pack
where I just mix and match different
scents depending on what I feel like so
it's fun because you choose what scent
you want to put into your space and you
choose how you want to feel and it
really does change your day and it adds
that little like specialness to your
space I think it just really makes you
feel more luxurious it makes me feel
like I'm like in a yoga studio or
something number eight
moving your body will always always help
you de-stress so make sure you get
enough exercise do yoga regularly just
do things where you can move your body
stretch and break out a sweat because
when you're stressed out your muscles
get so tense and you really need to
physically move your body in order to
release that tension and you know
stretch it out shake it out work it out
you know do whatever you got to do to
get your body in shape so that things
are flowing I'm sure we all know that
exercise has so many benefits like more
than I can name in this video but just
know that when you're stressed you got
to take yourself out of that stress zone
and move your body break out a sweat
release some endorphins because exercise
does make you happier tip number nine
focus on what's important so like I
mentioned in the beginning the holiday
season is supposed to be fun it's
supposed to be about spending time with
your loved ones making memories laughing
enjoying the winter and winter
activities and stuff like that so just
remember to ask yourself when you're
stressed out about something
is this going to matter in five years in
ten years because if it's like a small
miniscule detail it's probably not going
to matter but if it's something like
spending more time with your family
during this time like that's probably
gonna matter so don't let your mind get
carried away with all these worries and
anxieties just ask yourself is this
gonna matter in five years or in ten
years if it's not gonna matter then
don't worry about it just chill my last
tip is to have fun
something that I'm trying to do as I get
older is learning to take life less
seriously and just have more fun because
like I mentioned in the previous tip
like is this really gonna matter in five
years or ten years if it's not like the
details won't really matter so
ultimately just enjoy the moment in
front of you enjoy your time with your
loved ones enjoy being young enjoy being
the age that you are right now because
you will never be this age in the future
again you know we're constantly getting
older every day so just you know enjoy
being the youngest you will ever be
right now at this very hour very minute
very second I always like to think about
life that way because you forget that
time is constantly moving time is
constantly pulling us forward that if
you're just stressing out about
everything all the time
you're literally losing time to have fun
so let go a little bit go easier on
yourself take everything in life a
little less seriously and you'll realize
that it will make that big of a deal
with that mindset you can be more
light-hearted about things and just have
more fun in life thank you so much for
watching I love you all so so much and I
hope you have a beautiful wonderful and
fabulous and fun and stress-free
stress-free holiday season bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
