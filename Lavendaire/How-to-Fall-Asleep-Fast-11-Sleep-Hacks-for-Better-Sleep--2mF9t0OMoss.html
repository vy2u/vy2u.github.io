not the only one who has trouble falling
asleep at night so today I wanted to
share some tips and sleep hacks that can
help you fall asleep faster and sleep
better throughout the night because
sleep is so important and I definitely
want all of us to be getting enough
sleep first off it's so important to
exercise as regularly because when you
do you give your body a chance to use up
all of its energy so that you're super
tired at night only four hours before
bed make sure you cut out caffeine food
and exercise because all of those are
very stimulating and can keep you from
falling asleep at least an hour before
bed stop working and start winding down
so turn off all your electronics and
stop looking at screens so that blue
light that comes from your screens can
stimulate your brain and keep you awake
but if you must use your phone or tablet
turn on night mode where it filters out
that we like so you can browse before
bed all right this next one is a major
one that I encourage you all to try this
is called the police cocktail by Tim
Ferriss
so what you do is you take one to two
tablespoons of apple cider vinegar one
tablespoon of honey I personally like to
add more honey sometimes because I know
honey
and mix those two with hot water and
have this drink before bed apple cider
vinegar and honey are both natural
remedies for insomnia and the strength
will just knock you out to trust me
another of my favorite way to fall
asleep is to listen to Deepak Chopra
meditations on YouTube so just look up
Deepak Chopra and you'll see the first
meditation that comes up it's called the
secret of healing that one is my
all-time favorite one to listen to I've
listened to this over like 40 times it's
just very calming and soothing and I
also feel like I'm in graining some
wisdom in my brain as I'm falling asleep
so I'll listen to this one but another
one that I will listen to when
like more desperate to fall asleep is
Deepak Chopra's sleep meditation so that
meditation is the one you want to listen
to if you truly want to knock out and
knock out fast because once you do that
meditation with him you will notice your
body just drifting and I've never made
it through this whole meditation like
without falling asleep first if you
can't sleep because of jetlag then
melatonin can help you reset your body
clock the melatonin is a natural hormone
that your body creates more of in the
evening when it's ready to go to sleep
I'd be mindful of the dosage though
because most doctors say that point
three milligrams is enough even though
stores sell pills of like much higher
doses so I personally would just pick
like a quarter of a pill if so this is
something that you don't want to really
overdo you can also try some easy yoga
poses and stretch out your body before
bed this is a great way to just relax
unwind and de-stress so you can get a
good night's sleep meditation can also
calm your body and de-stress and get
yourself ready for bed lavender is known
for its sleep-inducing properties so try
using a couple drops of lavender
essential oil to just soothe your senses
before bed you can even rub some
essential oil onto your pillow to help
you sleep better weighted blankets act
as deep touch therapy and are popular
for treating insomnia and anxiety I
don't exactly have a weighted blanket
but I always sleep with two blankets
because that extra weight is really
comforting like a warm hug so the
pressure from weighted blankets help
relax your nervous system and help you
feel more grounded and safe alright I
hope you like these tips to help you
sleep better please let me know if you
have tips of your own in the comments
below thank you for watching and good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
