today I want to talk about how to figure
out what to do with your life especially
if you're in the early stages of being
lost
maybe you're young you don't know where
to take your life or maybe you've been
going down your path in one direction
and then you're like wait I don't know
if I want to keep doing this for the
rest of my life and so you're trying to
see what to do next so before I go into
it I do have to note that there's not
like one thing that you're supposed to
do with your life there are an array of
options that you can take your life so
it's entirely up to you and also there
is a possibility that you might feel
like you want to do this thing for this
number of years and then maybe you'll
change and then you'll want to do
something else I don't think that like
life is one set path there are loops and
turns and maybe you'll go back to
something else and I don't know there's
no way to predict it but there are ways
to hone in on some clues on what you
could be doing with your life that will
make you feel fulfilled as well as
giving you a way to make a living the
way I see it is you're born with a set
of gifts strengths and talents and
you're meant to use those and as you go
through life you're going to pick up
skills here and there and I believe
you're meant to use all of those skills
as well so you're equipped with this set
of resources and you're meant to use
those to do something that you love
something that contributes to the world
and helps others in some way and also
something that can help you make money
make a living because that's going to
enable you to keep doing more of what
you love so there's definitely a sweet
spot where all of these things overlap
and that's the area where you should be
looking towards when deciding what to do
with your life so if you've seen am i
how to find your purpose in life video
I'll link it right here it's very
similar to finding your purpose but
today I want to focus more in terms of
career like what you can do with your
life career-wise so in that purpose
video a subscriber actually
and I check out the Japanese concept of
iki guy and so I checked it out and I
was like whoa this is basically what I'm
getting it's so similar so I thought I'd
share that as well so inky guy basically
means a reason for living
it's your reason for getting up in the
morning so they break it down into four
parts and then the area where it
overlaps in the middle is called your
iki guy or I call it your sweet spot you
can also call it your purpose or your
mission in life whatever label you want
to put on it is essentially the same
thing is what to do with your life so
the first area is what you're good at
these are your gifts your talents and
your skills whatever you have in your
arsenal the second part is what you love
to do so these are your passions your
interest your curiosities things that
sparks something in you that get you
excited the next section is what the
world needs so these are ways you can
contribute to the world ways you can
help others or help Society in some way
the last section is what you can be paid
for so these are things you can do that
people would pay you for so just
brainstorm your skills things you can
offer to the world and then once you can
like list out all the things in each of
these four sections figure out what can
overlap what is in that middle what
isn't that sweet spot and that is your
ego or your purpose or your reason for
living what you should do with your life
for those of you who want to work
through this exercise on paper I've made
a free worksheet you can download if you
click here or in the description below
if you also want to just save this
graphic maybe pin it on Pinterest I put
it up on my blog links are down below so
I'll just share what I wrote down on my
worksheet so that maybe can spark some
inspiration for you when you're working
through yours so what I'm good at I feel
like I'm good at making videos I'm good
at writing marketing anything to do with
visuals whether it's graphic design
photography and good at music I can sing
I can play piano by
you're I'm good at organizing and
planning and I'm pretty good at
directions like remembering where I came
from and not getting lost things like
that things that I love I love arts
visuals photography music I love
performing I love learning I love
reading I love improving myself I love
growing I love sharing things I'm
excited about I love dancing traveling
exploring new things and I love getting
inspired in what the world needs I wrote
Millennials on YouTube teaching and
talking about self health and living
your dreams because before I started
this channel I couldn't really find
people my age talking about this I just
learned it from like old people in books
I truly believe the world needs more
people who are confident loving
supportive and proactive people who are
actively going for their dreams and
giving their best to the world instead
of just settling for what society told
them to do and lastly things I could be
paid for copywriting photography or
videography social media marketing a job
that requires organizing or planning
content creating video editing even
things like teaching piano teaching
English uber driving because I'm great
at driving and I'm great at directions
but yeah you guys get the point
so after filling out the four areas I
would see if there were anything that I
wrote in all four categories that could
overlap and become part of that epi
so you have to use some creativity here
because it might not always be so
obvious obviously for me I know what I
am doing now is something that I love
and I want to keep doing for the rest of
my life so I feel like I found like a
key guy at least for now and so it's
pretty clear for me that I can put all
my gifts and talents into you know the
content creating business that I have
right now but if you want to know how
there are things in certain bubbles but
not all for bubbles for example I love
music I love singing and I was pursuing
music for some time but I realized that
it wasn't contributing to the world
in the way that I wanted to contribute
to the world for example I felt like
with songs you can only do so much yeah
you can inspire people but it's not
really like a direct impact where I will
actively change people's lives and I was
deeply seeking that direct influence and
be able to help people live their dreams
so with music it wasn't exactly helping
the world in the way that I wanted to
help and it wasn't exactly giving me as
much of an income as I wanted to live my
dream life and if we look at the last
bubble I could totally be making a
living teaching piano or teaching
English in another country or even uber
driving but how much of a waste would it
be to just teach piano if I had all
these other gifts of like writing and
designing taking photos so you have to
find a way where all of these four
things overlap because if you just do
something that's in one circle or in two
circles or even three you're missing
like one other area that's pretty
crucial so now I hope you guys got a
better sense of how you can start to
discover what your sweet spot is what
your iki guy is so let me know how it
goes
all right last resource that I want to
point you guys to is this video that I
made called
find those moments where you shine
because I realized that even after you
do this exercise and this worksheet it
might not be clear what you should do it
might help you figure out the direction
but you still have to live life and
explore a little bit so in that video
basically what I talked about is start
paying attention to moments where you're
shining where you're glowing moments
where you're at your best and you feel
like things just are so fun things are
happening easily because just keep an
eye on those moments be aware because
those are clues that you're doing what
you should be doing with your life for
example I've been taking a lot of dance
classes and each class there's a
different teacher but I noticed that
some teachers have more of a glow to
them than others and it's because those
teachers maybe they're glowing because
that's
exactly what they're meant to be doing
they're meant to be teaching they're
meant to like empower other people
through dance and in those classes it's
like especially empowering and inspiring
even if it's just like a hip-hop dance
class versus other teachers I don't get
the same feeling maybe those teachers
are just good dancers but they're not
meant to be teaching not to say that
they can't teach at all but maybe that's
not where they're supposed to thrive so
find those moments where you come alive
and you're thriving and you feel amazing
for me I feel alive and I feel like I'm
shining when I'm performing or when I'm
like in the flow of creating like a
visual document like the worksheet that
I created for you guys I have a lot of
fun doing that
even when I was in business school the
class I excelled at was called business
communications where we had to write
business memos so I have to like format
all of this visual information and like
bullet points and make boxes and I had a
lot of fun with that and I got like an
a-plus-plus in that class because I was
so good at making things that are
similar to the worksheets that I create
now is so funny right so download that
work shade do this exercise but also
start paying attention to moments where
you shine moments where you're thriving
and you're at your best because these
are all the clues that can help you
figure out what to do with your life
good luck I really hope you find it
because when you find a thing that
you're meant to do you're going to feel
so happy your life is going to feel so
full and you're going to bring your best
to the world which means that we get the
benefits of having your best you
contribute to society and you make a
living doing what you love doing what
you're good at that's the best of
everything thank you so much for
watching please comment below if you
plan on doing the exercise because I'm
really curious to hear your thoughts and
your results alright see you next time
