is going to be an exercise on how to
find your purpose in life I believe that
everybody has a purpose each person is
blessed with a unique set of talents
skills personality and life experience
for a reason and they were meant to use
that to contribute to the world in their
own unique way your purpose is
essentially your life's mission finding
your purpose is not about finding your
career although that could be a big part
of it one purpose can spawn multiple
careers meaning there isn't one thing
that you are supposed to do there are
various ways that you can fulfill your
purpose for example through hobbies or
your relationships so your purpose is
bigger than your career your purpose is
the backbone of your entire life and
what you live and stand for your purpose
is why you exist on this world once you
discover your own personal why your life
will become more meaningful and
fulfilled because you understand your
reason for being and the reason behind
everything that you do now finding your
purpose is a personal journey you may
not discover it immediately and it could
take a lot of time so I just want to say
be patient and be open-minded throughout
this process so today I compiled a set
of questions that may help you start
your journey in finding your purpose
I highly encourage you to click the link
in the description to my blog post I
have the full set of questions there so
you can copy and paste it onto a Word
document and answer the questions at
your own pace also I've included a bunch
of sub questions that are very similar
so feel free to answer just the ones
that speak to you alright so number one
what brings you joy what are the things
that you love to do and what activities
make you happy what's something that you
found yourself doing for hours on end
and not get tired from these are your
passions your passions are things that
you are drawn to naturally and that you
have an innate love for your passions
are your compass and you should pay
attention to them because they lead you
to where you are meant to go number two
what makes you unique what are the
things that you're naturally good at
what are some things that your friends
and family tell you that you're good at
and what do most people admire about you
realizing your natural talents and
strengths is essential to finding your
purpose these are your tools you're
given this set of talents and strengths
for a reason you need to use them to
contribute to the world help others and
through your thing
number three what does your perfect life
look like what would you do with your
life if you knew you could not fail what
would you do if money didn't matter with
these questions don't limit yourself
dare to give your boldest biggest and
most honest answers because you need to
acknowledge what you truly want do not
compromise and don't settle this is your
vision your vision shows you who you
want to be
number four how can you give back to the
world who do you want to help how do you
want to help them is there a legacy that
you want to leave behind true happiness
and fulfillment comes from giving back
and helping others your purpose includes
making a meaningful contribution to the
world this is your impact so now that
you've answered the four big questions
and the sub questions it's time to look
for patterns and see if there's a common
thread between all of your answers see
if there's something that connects your
passions your talents skills strengths
with your vision of your life and the
impact that you want to make whatever
connects all of those things is close to
what your purpose is finally it's time
to write your purpose statement take the
time for yourself sit down get a piece
of paper or open up a word document and
at the top right what is my true purpose
in life and then just let it flow out of
you just keep writing versions of your
purpose statement and try to come up
with a set of words that you deeply feel
connected to the words don't need to be
pretty or poetic what's important is
that the words are inspiring to you
because this is your life this is your
purpose and it should be something that
you want to uphold and live by every
single day and it should be the reason
the why behind everything that you do
and your purpose statement isn't written
stone feel free to re-edit it and
redefine your purpose in the future as
you feel it's needed so I really hope
this helps you guys with finding your
purpose and being more clear with the
why behind everything that you do again
I highly encourage you to open up that
blog post and go through each question
and just have some time to yourself to
talk to yourself and be honest with who
you are and what you really want out of
life please feel free to share this
video or the blogpost with anyone you
think needs it if you are brave enough I
love to hear your purpose statement that
you came up with I'd love to hear your
feedback on this exercise this is my
first exercise that I've created so let
me know if you'd like to see more of
this anyway I just want to wish you good
luck with finding your purpose and your
path in becoming the best you that you
can be so that we can all be awesome
people in this world and lift each other
