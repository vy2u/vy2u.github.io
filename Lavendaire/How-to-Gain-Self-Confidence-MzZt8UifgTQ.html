today's video is on how to gain
self-confidence self-confidence is
something that comes from deep within
and it really comes from learning to
embrace yourself and love yourself for
everything that you are so learning to
be confident is a journey for everybody
it's not always easy and it takes time
but today I'm going to share three
things that you can change right now
that will help you boost your
self-confidence number one change your
body movement
aka your posture think about what a
confident body looks like so immediately
you'll think about putting your
shoulders back chest up chin up and
looking the world straight in the eye
because you're not afraid and you are
confident so if you make your body look
more confident then your body is going
to send signal to your brain that makes
you think and feel more confident it's a
science
there's a famous TED talk about power
poses and how it really works it changes
what you think about yourself I also
made a video about power poses myself so
I'll post those links in the description
below but it's honestly as simple as
that change your body posture and you
will feel a little bit more confident so
the next time you're at a social event
and you notice yourself slumping or
crossing your arms doing things to make
your body feel smaller just change your
body change it to a position that looks
confident and you will eventually feel
confident number two change what you
focus on so if you want to gain
self-confidence you have to learn to
focus on the positives focus on your
strengths and focus on things you love
about yourself rather than the negatives
you'll notice that people who are more
insecure are focusing more on the things
that they don't like about themselves
and they're focusing on the negative
qualities so what you want to do is make
a list of all the things that you love
about yourself list your favorite
qualities about yourself and if you're
brave enough you can even ask your
closest friends and family what they
think your best qualities are because
knowing that will give you
a little bit of confidence booster as
well so compile all of these things onto
a list and put it somewhere where you'll
read it regularly at least once a week
just focus on the positives focus on
your strengths focus on the things that
you love about yourself and you'll feel
your confidence growing number three
change what you say to yourself you may
not realize it but you're constantly
talking to yourself throughout the day
and the things that you say to yourself
really reflect and affect your
self-confidence so for example if you're
browsing the internet or you're on
Instagram
you might hear yourself saying things
like I wish I looked like her or I wish
I had her life why does my face look so
awkward there or why can I be prettier
essentially when you're saying those
things to yourself you're telling
yourself that you're not worthy or
you're not good enough and obviously if
you have that kind of self-talk you're
not going to be very confident so what
you have to do is pay attention to
yourself talk make sure your self-talk
is positive start speaking to yourself
with love and respect because that's
what you deserve a way that you can do
this is to write positive affirmations
that make you feel good and say those
things to yourself every morning and
every night
so when affirmation is an empowering
statement that you can repeat to
yourself every day to get it into your
subconscious until it becomes who you
are so you can write whatever you want
whatever makes you feel confident and
powerful and strong it could be anything
like I love myself I am worthy I am
smart talented and capable of anything I
put my mind to whatever makes you feel
like a boss just create your own
statement unique to you and say that to
yourself every morning every night and
you'll start to believe it and once you
believe that then you will be so much
more confident in yourself all right so
those are my three tips on how to gain
self-confidence if you guys try these
out please let me know how it goes
do it for yourself do it because you
deserve it so be confident go out love
yourself and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
