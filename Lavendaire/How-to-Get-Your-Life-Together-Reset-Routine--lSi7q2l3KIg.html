to New York where I was part of
YouTube's first global creator camp it
was such an amazing experience I got to
meet creators from all over the world
learn from everyone there and get
inspired with new ideas for my channel
right before this trip I had launched my
2018 artist of life workbook so with my
packed schedule I left so many things
undone and unorganized at home when it
was time to come home
I knew I had to do a major reset to get
my life back together here are the
things I've done to get my life back on
track
first make space in your schedule to get
your life back together it will take
time so be patient and do what you can
with whatever time you have I did this
over the course of three days my first
task was to unpack completely usually
I'm pretty lazy to finish unpacking I'll
just take out whatever I need to use and
leave my suitcase open on the floor for
like a few days this time around I made
sure to immediately put everything away
in its place so I can start resetting my
space and therefore resetting my life
yes I'm giving my suitcase a wipe down
because I like to take care of my things
and give them some love after a long and
harsh trip
my method is to empty out all of my bags
and then sort through the things
individually from there
I really like this Polaroid picture that
our group took at the Mets I thought it
fit perfectly on the wall map that I
have in my room especially since I
didn't have something for New York and
now I do so hey next clear out any old
energy to make room for the new tackle
the oldest items on your to-do list the
ones that you've put off the longest for
me it was errands that I've put off for
way too long so I set aside time to
tackle all of them at once like shipping
a return making a doctor's and dentist
appointment taking a passport photo and
just other boring things that I don't
really like to do but I have to do now
it's time to go back and reset your
space this one is major I definitely
believe that your space reflects and
affects your mind and your life so a
clear space equals a clear mind and also
makes your life feel more put together
my first step is to tidy declutter and
clean whatever you can so this might
take a while I guess the first step for
me was to do laundry and fold all of my
clothes put them all away I usually am
really lazy at putting away clothes so I
just leave them in a pile somewhere but
every now and then I take the time to
put everything back in its place so that
I could reset everything and start from
zero
after going through my clothes I decided
to go through my makeup and my vanity so
I took this time to declutter any old
makeup that I don't use anymore makeup
that is probably expired because I've
had it for too long and just use this
time to reorganize everything so that it
feels a little more clean a little more
fresh I also took this time to wash my
makeup brushes which is something that I
should do more often than I actually do
but yeah ever since I got this egg brush
cleaner it's made washing brushes a lot
easier and more fun for me even if you
don't have time to go through all of
your things and do a major declutter I
highly recommend just taking time to
wipe down your surfaces because you'll
realize that a lot of dust builds up
everywhere over time and it just makes
you feel more refreshed once you
clean your space as you're resetting
your space don't forget to also do a
digital reset so take time to recharge
all of your electronics I don't know
about you but I feel so full and
satisfied when all of my electronics are
fully charged and ready to go
you could also clear the air in your
space using essential oils so I am
loving aromatherapy at the moment I love
using this diffuser to play around with
different blends of oils it really
boosts my mood and elevates my space and
along with that you can play soothing
music to relax your space music can
really put you at ease and make you feel
more centered I personally love piano
music in the background
so after you've reset your space or at
least made it more manageable take time
to reset and recharge your mind and your
body I personally love to start with
journaling whenever I feel like my life
is in a mess I like to journal all of it
out in stream-of-consciousness style
which means I kind of just word of amun
the thoughts that I have in my head onto
paper and I do this until I feel like I
have nothing left in me to say and
usually at the end of a journaling
session I feel really clear and really
amazing and refreshed to move forward in
life you could also try meditating for
at least 5 minutes this will make you
feel more calm grounded centered and
balanced having your life together is
mostly a feeling and meditation takes
you closer to that feeling because it
gives you a new perspective on life I
also felt amazing after my first yoga
session back so I'd highly recommend
doing yoga as well now it's time to
reflect and re-strategize your direction
in life or your career or whatever
you're trying to get back together here
I'm just catching up with my monthly
review in my artists of life workbook
it's a place where I reflect on my
highlights from the past month how I did
and how I can improve for the next month
by the way for the journaling junkies
this is my all-time favorite app for
just keeping track of my life this is
day one and I have an
treat every day where I post a little
bit about what I did and a few photos of
my day as well I took a lot of notes at
the YouTube creator camp so here I'm
just transferring my notes onto Google
Docs going through my notes organizing
them and seeing if there are any action
items that I can add to my to-do list
next it's time to reprioritize your
goals and your to-do list so depending
on what you found during your reflection
this is the time to decide what should
you be focusing on for the next month
the next three months
refresh your goals and then reprioritize
all you're to do is to align to those
goals now I want to share some bonus
steps around taking care of your future
so created to-do lists the night before
that way you start off your day with
your priorities already in place also
set out your clothes the night before
this is a huge time-saver and saves you
from draining your mental energy
deciding what to wear in the mornings
lastly try meal prepping batch prepare
your meals to save you time and mental
energy deciding what to eat for each
meal you cook once and have food ready
for the next few days trust me your
future self will thank you for it
after doing all of this my life does
feel more centered and organized again
of course take what works for you and
leave what doesn't
thanks so much for watching please
subscribe and click that bell I love you
all so much bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
