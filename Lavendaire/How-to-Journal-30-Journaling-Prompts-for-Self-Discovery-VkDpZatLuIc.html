so a couple weeks ago I made a video
sharing my journal collection and I got
a lot of questions asking like how do I
journal or what's my journal about so
today I wanted to share just different
ideas on different ways you can journal
and also I created this PDF listing you
can download and print out with 30
questions for self discovery so these
are essentially 30 journaling prompts
that you can use to guide yourself along
in your journaling to help you find
yourself and discover yourself a little
more and I think a lot of journaling is
really asking the right questions asking
quality questions so then you can like
respond and flow out what is really
inside you before I begin I have to say
that there are no rules to journaling
you can really do it however you want
it's so open to any creative possibility
it's really just a relationship between
you a pen and paper so for me journaling
is a way for me to like spill my
thoughts kind of capture my thoughts and
see what it is on paper and also a way
to organize my thoughts so I'll start
with morning pages morning pages is
something that I've shared so many times
on my channel before but what it is is
it's three pages of stream of
consciousness writing in the morning so
I use a composition notebook I'll do
three pages like one two three and I
don't always write three pages I don't
always write every morning either but
it's just a system that helps you brain
dump in the morning stream of
consciousness just means that you flow
just from your thoughts on paper you
don't analyze what you're writing you
just flow you doesn't have to make sense
doesn't have to be complete sentences
you just literally
don't filter yourself and let it go and
that's my favorite way to write it's
just a flow and that's what I've gotten
used to just like flowing flowing
flowing not really making it look
perfect or trying to make sense morning
pages comes from a book called the
artists way and if your interest is
definitely read that book but for me I
don't necessarily write every morning
anymore and I don't always use three
ages sometimes I do one or two sometimes
I do even more it really just depends on
how I feel but I like to consistently
write stream-of-consciousness whether
it's morning evening or night just all
the time like at least like a few times
a week I have to just brain them so
outside of morning pages I also love to
journal like in the evenings before I go
to bed and this is because I always have
a lot on my mind and I like to get the
thoughts out before I go to sleep
otherwise I might not be able to fall
asleep if I'm feeling like emotionally
stirred up inside whether it's in a good
way or in a bad way or whatever I like
to just put that down on paper so that I
can like get it out of my system in a
sense and also if I'm like confused or
if I feel stuck or lost that's when I
like to journal as well because I feel
like I work through my problems through
journaling usually I start with asking
myself how do I feel at the moment or
just something will be on my mind that
will come out so a lot of this
journaling is assessing my mind
assessing my life evaluating what I'm
going through and even like spending
time dreaming and visioning what I want
in the future also journal things that
I'm grateful for things that I
appreciate in my life right now what's
going right in my life my goal when I
journal is to just be as honest and
authentic as possible I try not to
filter anything but at the same time I
always do try to see a positive side to
things so if I ever start off the
journaling like in a bad mood if I'm sad
about something or mad whatever I'll go
through it I'll face it I'll be honest
about myself about it and then in the
end I will be like you know what's on
the brighter side what's the positive
where am i grateful for out of the
situation so I always try to shine that
positivity on whatever I'm going through
because I realized that yes I want to be
honest and authentic 1 journaling but I
don't know if you've ever heard but like
thoughts become things so your thoughts
become your words and your words become
your actions I realize the power that
thoughts and words have on shaping your
reality and shaping your perception so I
always keep that in mind I never
myself spiral into negativity because
that is also possible as well so always
you know understand that your thoughts
are powerful be honest with yourself
write down what you feel but also always
try to keep love and light at the center
of everything
another way to journal that's been
really effective for me in the past is
to write a letter to someone and this is
a letter that you don't expect them to
read you're not going to send this
letter this letter is for yourself so if
you've ever had a grudge against someone
if you've ever felt mad at someone or if
someone's ever hurt you really badly
it's so so effective to write a letter
of forgiveness to that person so I know
some of you might be like like I don't
want to forgive them like why do I have
to be nice but honestly forgiveness is
so key to being happy because when
you've been hurt or if you're angry at
someone whatever like that that's some
negative fit what's that word negative
baggage and burdens that you're holding
in your heart so if you can be able to
let that go and forgive that person even
if they don't deserve to be forgiven
like forgive them anyway because it
makes you feel better try writing a
letter to that person a letter of
forgiveness so that's something I've
done maybe a couple times in the past
and it's really emotional trust me try
it and hopefully that can help you work
through that pain and be able to heal
and learn to forgive another way I love
to journal is to just organize my
thoughts on paper because in here my
thoughts are so messy I can't really
tell what's in there so putting it out
on paper organizing like planning my
career plotting my goals planning songs
to write planning my branding for my
youtube and my website everything that I
want to plan everything that I want to
do I have to like physically write it
down and organize it visually in some
way so there are so many different ways
you can visualize maybe with graphs
bullet points diagrams for example this
is a notebook that I forgot to show in
my journaling collection video but in
here I just have a lot of like business
idea
as designs for an app that I wanted to
build this is like a mind map of
everything I wanted to include in lab
and they are just Kyle's all the moving
parts of an online business so it's
really helpful for me to put all these
ideas and organize them on paper
otherwise like I just don't recognize
them in my head another fun way is to
scrapbook as you journal so just
journaling your life and then adding
kind of mementos from whatever is going
on whether you go to a concert you keep
the ticket stub and you tape it into
your journal or someone wrote you a
letter that you really like and you keep
that in your journal I think that's a
really great way to capture your
memories especially if you're maybe
traveling or you're going through a very
interesting time in your life who knows
this is a journal that I kept while I
was studying abroad in Italy but
nowadays I don't really journal like
this anymore I think it takes a little
bit more effort so the way that I
capture and record my memories is I do
it digitally through my phone I use an
app called day one where every day I'll
write a post just summarizing key things
that I did that day because I have such
bad memory I will forget what I did
yesterday if I don't write it down
so with those daily entries I also
upload a few photos I took that day so
it's a really nice way to visually look
back on my life and see a photo a day so
that's how I recorded my memories now
and with my journals that's just kind of
how I like access my mind my sister's
going on up there so if you ever feel
lost or stuck or you don't know what to
journal about maybe you're uninspired
I've created a list of 30 questions you
can ask yourself three questions to help
you dig deeper and get to know yourself
on a deeper level and these are
essentially just like journaling prompts
that when you don't know what to write
about you can look at a question and be
like okay let me answer this question
because like I said it's all about the
quality of your questions the quality of
what you ask yourself and then you'll
get quality answers so I made two
versions of this so depending on what
you prefer there's a PDF that you can
download and print out and then there's
a graphic that's on my blog that you can
just save and pin on Pinterest so
everything is
downbelow by the way I'm trying to like
level up my Pinterest so it'd mean a lot
to me if you just like follow my
Pinterest or check out this graphic if
you like it then just pin it so you can
share the love so yeah I hope this PDF
find these journaling prompts can help
you in your journey to get clearer about
yourself what you want where you're
going and all that good stuff let me
know what you think let me know if you
have other questions or other resources
or ideas that you are interested in I'd
love to just help you in whatever way
that I can alright thank you so much for
watching it love you all and I'll see
you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
