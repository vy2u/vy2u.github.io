and dare today I'm so excited to have a
special guest this is Lauren Berger of
intern Queen and she's made it her goal
to give students grades career and
internship advice hi everybody I'm very
excited to be here on your channel we
are such fans over at intern I know
thank you
okay so let's jump in tell me I'm so
interested like how did you decide to
start intern Queen so I had 15
internships in college which is crazy
you know when you have 15 internships
but with every internship I learned so
much about myself both personally and
professionally and I would go to the
bookstore and I would look online and I
was trying to find like a resource or a
person or you know the Rachael Ray of
the career space to help me and I always
came up short so when I was graduating
college I said wait a second I've had 15
internships you know what if I could be
the person that helps to other students
out my friends at the time land
internships and learn how to make the
most of them I was certainly not an
expert but I had made every mistake in
the book yeah and I had learned so much
from all of my mistakes so I really
wanted to kind of tell the world what I
had learned that's awesome
first of all how do you handle 15
internships how does that even fit into
4 years of college
you know I look back and I'm like it
just doesn't make me like double love on
internship why I would like double and
triple them up one year between my
junior and senior year of college I came
out to LA I went to school in Florida so
coming here to LA was a big deal and I
interned at MTV at NBC and at Fox all in
the same summer I'm not sure all the
companies knew that I was interning yeah
so it was a little bit crazy but you
know one of those people that kind of
thrives on having a lot of things going
on and I loved it and the internships
were just priceless and really helped me
get to where I am today
so is there a reason why you didn't go
into a career in one of those like
internships that you did so I did my
first career was an entertainment I was
an assistant at a really big talent
agency and my internship contacts helped
me land that dream jobs go fast I always
say getting a job for me was like
ordering a
burger at McDonalds only only because of
my internships my internships totally
set me up for success but you know it's
funny growing up my and I talked about
this my first book all work no pay my
grandma always told me I would be a
writer and my mom always told me I'd be
a speaker we got so they talking love it
strong New York accents um
and sure enough like I kind of do a
little bit of all of it today and
there's a lot of different tasks that I
did as an intern that are incorporated
in intern Queen today so intern Queens a
little bit of media a little bit of PR
you know a little bit of writing so I
kind of do a little bit of all those
things I was I was doing back as an
intern as a career today I mean to me it
sounds like your drive came before all
those 15 internships so do you want to
talk a little bit about her upbringing
and what created this like go go yeah
yeah you know it's funny I before
internships like when I when I meet high
school students and they tell me that
they're interning I'm like I was not
like you I was on the dance team I was
the co-captain of the dance team I was
worried about what cute boy was throwing
a cool party on Friday night and I was
worried about my friends and I really
you know maybe I was ambitious deep down
but I had no direction and I really
wasn't thinking about the future at all
when I was in high school I think what I
did have and I definitely recognize it
now as I mean I definitely have parents
that are like you need to be your best
at all times and they really didn't
accept anything below that so and of
course when I was like a bad child they
were like no you are bad you must be
better but I mean they really I think
set me up for success and they didn't
want to accept that I you know wasn't
going to be successful so I think that
my parents definitely kind of set me up
with that foundation and then my mom is
definitely the mom that is still calling
me today and she's like I watched this
on The Today Show when you should cold
call this person so I think I'd really
help you along yeah I think I get a lot
of my go get earnest if that's a word
it's definitely not yeah parents I see
do you feel like I mean there are pros
and cons yeah
think so yes it helps you have that dry
book do you feel like you're hard on
yourself sometimes I get that
personality oh yeah gently definitely
this morning struggle with that yeah
this morning embarrassing story I was
late for our shoot today not to meet you
earlier in the day I would not be late
for you um but I was late today and I
was freaking out and I was like oh I'm
running late and this and this and the
whole team is waiting for me and what
did I do I didn't back out of my garage
correctly and boom ha oh no I really I
feel like that good example of like just
being hard on myself for no reason being
like leave Leave what are you doing
really oh you know what we're all hard
on ourselves sometimes okay so I want to
ask like do you take time for yourself
do you have like a self-care routine
it's all carotene high as you're saying
that I'm like I wish I had a self-care
routine um I would say that I try but
like maybe 11 p.m. every night to be
like okay stop like okay stop like go
take a shower go organize your clothes
go do something like mindless you know
and end your night the way you want to
end it not the way your inbox wants you
to end it yeah so I tried it and my
nights I would say on my terms like I
need to have like I go to bed late but I
do have that relaxed period at the end
of the night which is important to me I
try to do that on the road as well like
after a certain time no matter what the
computer just has to close or else
you're going to bed thinking of emails
yeah
so I do try to make sure there is an end
time even if it's late like an end time
and that there's an activity after that
even if it's just usually it's just
sitting in bed watching TV just so I can
kind of relax and again wind down on my
terms and not like our clients terms
yeah no I totally love that I do believe
you have to like that it's time to like
stop working especially when you're like
doing something like you're your own
boss
no one's telling you when to start and
stop works right and you have to tie
yourself in when you're your own boss
and really in almost every industry in
every position today we're all too busy
we're all too connected we all have too
many things to do so at the end of the
day like
to-do list is almost becoming unhelpful
because the to-do list just goes on and
on and on so it's really up to all of us
to prioritize and kind of draw that line
and say okay and now the work is done
yeah because I'm saying it's done yeah
exactly for me I always like I have a
huge to-do list but every day I'm just
like okay I'm just gonna try to finish
three things and if I get those done
like I think that's great because you
sort of have to define your own success
and if you don't do that then you're
like oh my god I didn't finish my thirty
things that my to do though I didn't
have a good day right so if I think
that's great advice for everybody that
if you finish three things that is
success
yeah that's great okay so let's talk
about you as you've been building your
empire since yeah the nine right so what
has been the biggest struggle over the I
mean it's a big question so many
struggles I got that in running your own
business there's a new struggle every
year there's like a new theme right um
before when I was when I was running my
own business for the first two or three
years it was just me in my apartment
with my computer so a lot of my
struggles were like self contained in a
way now my struggles include other
people because I have employees now I
have a team now so it's not just about
me I was telling my employee the other
day I was like you don't know how much I
think about you that's really appreciate
that
she's my yeah I know you know boy but
you know you think about your team now
like if we don't succeed it's not just
my it's not just me and I right how the
business does affects a lot of other
people so we have our team we have
freelancers that we work with there's
all these other people so I think a lot
of that is just I wouldn't say it's a
struggle but it's definitely a challenge
and an obstacle and the biggest
challenge is that I still have not taken
on any investment money and I've been
running my business for and we're going
into year eight which you know run
valestra
yeah but I mean it's a big math problem
like my mom is a math teacher and I
never thought I would have to use math I
hate math
I have to use math every single day and
it's always a matter of saying like okay
this is what we want to do but can we
afford to do that you know and if we do
that can we still afford to pay
everybody on our team and hey we have an
office now you know pay the rent for
office and do all these things so it's
always a balancing act and it's always a
big math problem so I think that's maybe
been the biggest struggle or challenge I
like the word challenge yeah right
that's Alex gonna everybody go say it
and I have that like when you're in that
situation you have to be more creative
right whenever there's like a limit to
like finances you have to gather ways
can you give an example of like how yeah
I gave you an example of a way that
we've been creative is by hiring people
that are flexible so I talk about
Marisol a lot um she's like behind the
scenes I know they're enough but uh
Marisol is Marisol is our executive
assistant and when we hired her
I couldn't we couldn't afford to hire an
executive assistant full-time so you
know she was very flexible she had
another part-time job at the time and
she came on 15 hours a week and then as
you know we kind of got into a rhythm
and we were able to rationalize kind of
the expensive of Marisa oh you know all
the time and as we really saw the value
in her work continued to grow we were
able to say okay now we can do 30 hours
a week and you know now she is full-time
salary and you know that'll keep
increasing so it's nice to hire flexible
people I think that's I mean a piece of
advice that I have for other
entrepreneurs out there is like you
don't need to hire the could the crazy
Harvard grad as your first employee like
you and you know what I don't think that
I really ever need that I have found you
know very very valuable people that have
started as flexible and has come up that
have come on and been a great big part
of our as long as they have the passion
and they want yeah and I think like
people being a culture fit is really
important too so what intern Queen it's
not just getting people that like want a
job right but it's people that are
passionate about the message and want to
work with young people on a daily basis
not everyone wants to call college
students all day and talk about
internships so it's important if I ask
you
that are passionate about whatever it is
you're doing and this is like a great
transition into those who are looking to
get their dream internship or job like
firstly you need the passion but I'm
sure there's so much behind that so can
you give some like practical tips for
people practical tips for people looking
for an internship or a job or both I
mean let's pick one internship sure yeah
yeah so when you're looking for a dream
internship I think focus is the most
important thing I meet a lot of students
who say well I wanted to get an
internship last summer and I applied for
two things and it didn't work out so I
didn't get anything no no no no you
gotta have like the I'm gonna get an
internship or and I'm gonna get a job
mentality and if you believe it other
people are going to believe it and
applying to two places just isn't going
to cut it so I suggest starting with ten
you apply for ten internships and then
you kind of go every two weeks you kind
of add more to your roster so you start
by applying for ten internships you put
those applications out two weeks later
crickets then okay you apply for another
ten and you keep going and it sounds
excessive but internships especially
summer internships they're so
competitive and you know a big company
like a Michael Kors for example they
could be looking for one intern you know
one intern they might get two thousand
resumes you never know so it's really
important to make sure you're applying
for enough opportunities so that you
actually walk away with an internship at
hand so I think focus and determination
is really important and then just
blocking out your time because
everyone's busy then the next part
busier than the next person right we all
have so much going on these days you
have to block out time to actually sit
down do the research and put together
your applications yeah do you have any
more tips for jobs is it different
compared to internship I think the
mindset is very similar I always say
when you don't have a job your job is to
get a job you should be going somewhere
you know 10:00 to 4:00 p.m. every day
and doing different things to look for a
job so not just going to the regular job
sites but I just we did on the Twitter
chat the other night and I said seniors
in college are like farmers they should
just be planting see
right like as a senior in college about
to graduate your job is to plant seeds
with as many people as possible and let
them know that you're coming into the
world like you are about to graduate so
that when you do call them when you have
graduated and you're looking for that
job they already knew they already know
they have you in the back of your mind
so I think when you're looking for a job
or looking for an internship part of
that process is just letting people know
what you're up to and what you're
looking for and doing that in advance
you know I would say three months before
it's crunch time to find that internship
start planning those seeds circle back
to any professional and there it will be
ahead of everyone else because everyone
procrastinate so the right no one else
is doing it waiting till the last minute
so just really think ahead of time okay
so plan your life ahead of time and just
like be super determined yeah I'm gonna
go no matter what absolutely and then
also just make sure that you're catering
all of your materials for the position
that you want um we had this situation
come up yesterday in our office when we
were hiring we're trying to find an
intern for a huge fashion company huge
I mean opportunity of a lifetime we had
12 resumes that we were looking at and
we were like we don't want to send them
any of these candidates and I said to
Marisol who I talked about a lot it was
like her so what's the deal like there's
12 people how come we don't want to send
any of the resumes and it was because no
one popped off the page no one put it's
a fashion internship so on that resume
you need to have something fashion
oriented and if you don't have anything
like any other internship experience you
know start to go fishing like what do
you have are you involved in anything on
campus that you can talk about any clubs
any groups any class projects just put
something relevant on there and
something that makes us say wow this
person has the right experience we want
to send this resume to the client so I
think again that's where the middleman
were the ones that are passing along the
resumes from student to employer give
those middlemen a reason to pass it
forward right give those employers a
reason to want to read your resume
instead of the other eleven mm-hmm so
you sound like you've always been very
confident and
know that some people out there aren't
don't have that confidence when they're
trying to find that internship or job
and confidence is a big thing when you
go into an interview yeah so do you have
any tips on people who aren't as
confident yeah I think practice makes
perfect so I think the more
well-informed you are on the company
that you're interviewing with on
interview skills in general the more
practice and mock interviews that you've
done the more prepared and more
confident you're gonna feel because
you're going to be like been there done
that like I know how to do that so I
think a couple things one is if you do a
lot of interviews that's okay
don't let that get you down going to an
interview even if you don't land the
position just going through the
experience of interviewing is a positive
thing and then also again you if you're
in college utilize that Career Center if
you're in high school utilize your
guidance counselor they'll often do
practice interviews for you in my first
book all work no pay we have a list of
practice interview questions at career
centers there's lists of practice
interview questions read those and then
just do your homework on not only the
company but the person that you're
interviewing with stop them on like
tonight I think that's great
do you have any last pieces of advice
for people out there trying to build
their dream career yeah I think that you
know internships change lives I mean not
everyone is going to go on to be the
intern Queen obviously right is only
room for one guys we don't need to make
internships your job like I have but
every successful person I know they say
one thing and that is it all started
with an internship so that is my food
for thought that'll leave everyone with
today me too I did like seven
internships in college and they all
taught me something different
yeah and they all and they helped you
get to where you want to be so I think
it's a very powerful thing all right
thank you so much for this you're like
so helpful yeah everybody follow Lauren
Berger at the intern Queen I'll put all
the links right here on the screen
