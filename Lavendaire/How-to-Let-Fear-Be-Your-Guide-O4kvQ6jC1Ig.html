the things that we truly want to do it
happens to everybody and it's totally
natural I'm scared all the time
I'm scared of so many things I'm scared
every time I come up to vlog I'm scared
every time I release music I'm scared
every time I step on stage to perform or
to speak and it it just happens and
there's no getting around fear it's
going to happen fear is your body's Way
of telling you that you're outside of
your comfort zone and it's there to
protect you but this being is fear can
only see the danger it can't see how
much you have to gain from a situation
so that part is our job and our job is
to see fear as a part of the process a
part of the journey to growing and
becoming a better person and using fear
to kind of guide us in the right
direction so the first step in letting
fear be your guide is to acknowledge
your fear don't deny it
and don't try to hide from your fear
it's there and what's important is that
you look into it and ask yourself why
why are you so scared of doing whatever
it is there are different kinds of fears
there are fears that are instinctual
real and valid you know the kind of fear
that you get when you're afraid of
getting eaten by a tiger and those fears
are meant to protect us they're like
survival mode but generally in this
modern day most of our fears are not
deadly and they're the type that are
self created and these are the fears
that are rooted in our own insecurities
and self-doubt so if you find that your
fear is the latter type the type that is
rooted in your insecurities then those
are the type of fears that we have to
listen to because
they're important and they mean
something to us I've started thinking
about those types of fears as a gift
because they are a guy those types of
fears let you know what you have to do
and where you need to go in order to
grow the general rule of thumb is the
more something scares you the more you
have to make sure that you have to do it
the things that scare us the most are
the things that mean the most to us and
are the most important to us those
things are the ones that enable us to
grow the most and to get closer to the
people that we have the potential of
becoming we have our comfort zone and
the area outside of it and fear is what
keeps us within the borders of our
comfort zone so basically we have to
overcome those fears and get to the
magic that's happening outside of that
comfort zone because that's where you
really grow so what I've been trying to
do is to feel the fear but just do it
anyway understand that fear is not going
anywhere you're always going to be
scared of things because you're always
going to have certain boundaries of
what's comfortable and what's
uncomfortable for you but just
acknowledging that fear and then going
for it anyway and facing those fears and
overcoming them that's what's going to
help us grow into becoming the people
that we've always wanted to become it's
supposed to be scary it's supposed to
feel super uncomfortable and awkward but
if you don't go towards those fears then
you're never going to see how far you
can go you're never going to realize
your full potential you're just going to
stay in the bubble of what you know and
what's comfortable for you and
that's not fun you want to live an
interesting life and you want to see how
far you can really go you want to push
those boundaries and just explore so
yeah I just want to encourage everyone
to understand fear for what it is to
feel it acknowledge it but just do it
anyway do whatever it is you want to do
anyway and don't let the fear hold you
back it's okay to be scared it's okay to
be nervous it's okay to feel a lot of
things but what's important is that you
take the action and actually go through
with it because that's what separates
the people who are really great from the
people who just want to be great so let
fear be your guide let it take you to
those places that you've always wanted
to go but we're too scared to let fear
take you to do those things that you
thought were impossible because once you
do then you're just going to be so
empowered and you're going to want to
keep doing that again and again and
continue to grow and be the best person
that you can be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
