how to look better and it's not what you
think it's actually a tag video talking
about five ways to look better as in
your perspective and looking at what's
important in life
so the tag was started by Shannon says
and I got tagged by life by jazz so
thank you jazz now I'm going to teach
you all how to look better in 2015
number one look at what you're consuming
as in what you're feeding your mind what
you're reading what you're watching on
social media log articles YouTube TV
shows etc etc take a look at the media
that you're absorbing throughout the day
and evaluate whether it's valuable
information or is it just noise and
gossip and wasteful useless information
this year I especially want to be more
aware of the information that I'm
feeding myself and making sure that
everything that I kind of read and
absorb is helping me and not just
wasting my time or even hurting me
number two look at what you're eating as
in what you're putting into your body
this year I'm definitely trying to be a
lot more healthier in my diet and my
lifestyle trying to make more green
juice and smoothies in the morning and
just eat more fruits and veggies
throughout the day I recently watched a
documentary called Forks Over knives and
it's so good I highly recommend you guys
watch it it's on Netflix but basically
that documentary opened my eyes to the
endless benefits of having a Whole Foods
plant-based diet and so although I'm not
one to kind of label myself or my diet
definitely trying to incorporate more of
those elements into what I eat so I'm
eating less meats and fats and sugars
and putting more fruits and veggies and
complex carbs into my diet at the end of
the day it's up to you what you want to
eat and put into your body and it's
totally fine to enjoy and indulge
sometimes but I'm just trying to be more
aware of what I eat and making sure that
it's nourishing my body in a positive
and healthy way and that it gives me the
right kind of energy to thrive in life
number three look at your habits habits
are the building blocks to your
lifestyle so choose wisely if you
haven't seen my last video on habits you
can watch it right here this year I'm
definitely trying to incorporate more
positive habits into my lifestyle and
release the negative ones habits are the
kind of things that multiply and get
stronger each day so if you have a
negative habit then it's really going to
bring you down but if you have a
positive habit that over time it's going
to just bring you up for me my key
habits that I have to hit every day from
morning to night are in the morning I
have to do my morning pages and right
then I have to meditate and exercise and
at the end of the day I have to read at
least 10 pages of a good book before I
sleep and so those are my four
non-negotiable habits for now and I
guess once I master those habits then
I'm going to keep adding more positive
ones in the future so yeah look at your
habits release the negative ones and
start building those positive small
habits that will eventually create the
person that you want to be number four
look at your words your words are so
powerful and can affect more than you
can ever imagine your words meaning the
words that you think to yourself and the
words that you say to others ask
yourself are they helping or are
they hurting it's just so important that
you take responsibility over the words
that you use to yourself and to others a
book that goes really deep into this is
called before agreements it's one of my
favorite books ever but the first
agreement is always be impeccable with
your word you don't realize that your
words can change your life and it can
change other people's lives as well so
put out positive words and positive
thoughts because anything negative is
only going to hurt yourself and hurt
others and you can't just throw your
words out there carelessly because your
words have power they can affect others
and they can affect the world in some
sort of way that you can't imagine at
the moment so yeah always be impeccable
with your word number five look at how
you look at other people do you find
yourself always comparing yourself to
others whether it's on Instagram and you
see someone else's life and you wish you
were them or you see somebody else then
you tell yourself okay I'm glad I'm not
them that's not right remember that you
are no better or worse than anybody in
this world we are all unique and we are
all awesome in our own way so you can't
ever judge somebody you can't compare
yourself to anybody else ever because
we're just different we all have our own
unique lives and our unique paths
it's just incomparable and also you
shouldn't ever judge anybody because you
can never know how their life is who
they are 100% everything that you see is
just perspective and it's just
what you speculate so look at how you
look at other people try to not compare
try to not judge and the most important
thing is to just learn to respect and
appreciate everybody for who they are
alright those are my five ways to look
better in 2015 now I want to know how do
