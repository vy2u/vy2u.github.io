February is going to be all about self
love and self care learning to love
ourselves and take care of ourselves
better from the inside and out so today
we're going to talk about self love and
why it's so important how you can love
yourself better so first of all it's so
important to love yourself
because you have to love yourself first
before you can love your life also you
have to give to yourself before you can
even give back to others so Lucille Ball
has this quote she says love yourself
and everything else will fall into line
you really have to love yourself to get
anything done in this world
today's video is a collab with my friend
Cosmo Pandey she is a life coach and
self-love warrior she's amazing and she
has a video on her channel about the key
to loving yourself so you can check that
out also we have a podcast episode
together that we recorded last year on
self-love that is still really good it's
like one of my favorite episodes to date
so I'll post the link below so you can
listen to that as well but the goal
today is to get to a point where we can
fully love ourselves embrace all that we
are and just feel amazing about
ourselves and I want to read this quote
from my artist of life workbook on
self-love designing a beautiful life
begins with self love self love breeds
self-confidence self-worth self-respect
and self forgiveness do not
underestimate its power so my first tip
to loving yourself better is to write a
list of things you love about yourself
list out all your strengths and your
personality quirks all the things that
you genuinely love and enjoy about
yourself and I know this might be tough
for some people because they never
thought of it that way
but a little tip is if you really don't
know what to write you can ask your
closest friends or family what they love
about you because it might surprise you
what good traits they love about you so
do that and just find the things that
make you you find the things that you
really like about yourself
next
right a list of your flaws and I know
this might seem counterintuitive but the
point of learning to love yourself is
learning to embrace everything that you
are your good traits and your weaknesses
and your flaws as well because we really
have to realize that we aren't perfect
we're all human and that's okay I'm sure
you love many people in your life like
your family members they're not perfect
people they have flaws too but you still
love them so the point is to get to that
place where you can love yourself flaws
and all so write down a list of your
flaws and I know when you're doing this
you might have the tendency to judge
yourself and have less negative emotions
come up just let it go let go of all
that judgements all negativity and when
you're done writing that list at the
bottom declare to yourself it's okay
that I have these flaws I'm human I'm
imperfect and that's beautiful
I still love myself flaws and all so
really see what this exercise can do for
you in helping you embrace everything
that you are your strengths and your
weaknesses and just learning to love
yourself regardless the next tip is to
level up your self-care and by that I
mean do whatever it takes you feel
amazing every day feel your best every
day for example for me part of that is
waking up to really good music that
makes me feel great and guess my day off
to a good start
and another part is I want to put more
effort into dressing better because I
noticed if I dress lazy
I don't feel too confident about myself
I feel lazy as well so take that extra
10 minutes to pick out a really nice
outfit that you really love and feel
confident in if makeup makes you feel
confident and take some extra time to do
makeup for yourself or maybe you feel
more confident and amazing when you have
a bare face sometimes I feel great just
having no makeup on because it feels
fresh so do whatever it is that makes
you feel amazing just take that little
extra time to take better care of
yourself
the point of this is to enhance your
confidence in your everyday life
starting from the outside in which does
work you can also build confidence from
the inside
I have another video that I've made in
the past called how to gain
self-confidence from the inside out and
I'll link that below because I don't
want to go into it here but self-care
from the outside in you can really like
fake it til you make it you know you
look great on the outside it will make
you feel great on the inside as well my
next tip is to stop comparing yourself
to others do not fall into the
comparison trap girls I know this one
even I am very very guilty of this
sometimes sometimes I could be looking
at someone else's YouTube channel thing
like wow this girl has got it she's
gorgeous she's growing fast and I just
compare myself when when I really
shouldn't because we're all on our own
path and it's because we are living in
the social media era where everyone's
Instagram is perfect everyone's life
looks gorgeous
online and you know that's not real you
know behind the scenes
everyone's going through their own
struggle everyone is a human being you
know no one's perfect nobody is better
than you and you're not better than
anyone else we're all just on different
paths were all unique and I took me many
years to realize that it's not a
competition because I remember in
college I used to be you know comparing
myself with other girls and it would
make me feel really insecure about
myself but now I've gotten to a place
where I realized it's not a competition
it's a community we're all here to bring
our own unique value to the world and
there's room for everybody you know it's
not a competition it's a community my
next tip is to utilize a positive
affirmation or power mantra to enhance
your daily life so this is some sort of
phrase that declares how amazing and
beautiful and powerful you are so I will
read one from my workbook that I wrote I
am radiance I am powerful
I am passion I am worthy I am love I am
light I am magical I am incredible and I
am wildly beautiful you can write
whatever you want just write something
that makes you feel powerful and amazing
like you're on top of the world and
resets yourself everyday I have a girl
named Madeline in our workbook group and
what she does is she recorded herself
reading all these positive affirmations
and then she plays that recording back
to herself while she's like doing dishes
or chores and it just brings her to
another level I think that's such a
great idea
so either keep it on your phone so you
could read it every day keep it on your
wall at your desk and try recording
yourself saying these things so you're
like your own motivational speaker every
day my last tip today is to keep a
gratitude or self love journal so keep a
journal where you write down the things
you're grateful for every day write down
the things you love about yourself and
your life everyday and you'll find that
because you have to do it every day
you'll come up with new ideas new things
to be grateful for new things to really
love about yourself and your life
keeping this kind of journal every day
pushes you to be more creative and open
your mind to being like okay what else
am i grateful for what else do I love
about myself and my life so a challenge
of you in a good way to make you
appreciate even the little things like
I'm grateful that I have an arm and a
hand like things like that that you take
for granted every day learn to love all
of those things the more you find in
your life to be grateful for the more
fulfilling your life will feel and it's
just a really nice way to keep track of
everything that's amazing in your life
the more you focus on the positive and
the good the happier you'll feel there's
no way that you can keep a self love and
gratitude journal every day and not feel
good about your life I don't think it's
possible if you want to prove me wrong
try doing it for 30 days straight write
a love letter to yourself every day
write down your gratitude list every day
and tell me you do not feel better about
your life basically learning to love
yourself takes time effort and energy
because you're actually building a
relationship and this is the most
important relationship you'll ever have
in your life your relationship with
yourself it's so important like I said
love yourself first and then everything
else will fall into line you have to
love yourself first in order to love
your life in order to give back
take care of other people in your life
all right I hope you liked today's tips
