Welcome back to Lavendaire.
It's Aileen.
Today I'm going to talk about time management
and organization:
how to make time for everything you want to
do.
And I know that sounds pretty daunting
because I'm sure a lot of us want to do a
lot of things.
If you're anything like me,
you probably have a huge list of to-dos, but
also list of things
you wish you could do if you had the time
for it.
Today I'm going to share some tips and also
an exercise you can do
to help you organize your schedule to make
time for everything that you want to do.
By the way: I'm doing another giveaway with
Skillshare.
You guys loved
the previous Skillshare giveaway, so I knew
that I wanted to do it again.
Stick around to the end of the video for more
giveaway details.
My first tip on how to make time for everything
you want to do is to cut down distraction
time.
I think that, most of us, we feel that our
schedules are so full, we have no time for
anything,
when in reality there are so many parts of
our day where we lose track on social media,
whether you're on Facebook, Instagram, wherever.
You don't notice it
but sometimes you just trail off, and there
goes fifteen minutes
and another fifteen minutes there.
You actually waste a lot of time getting distracted.
So the best thing is to learn how to focus
and make the most of your time
with what you're doing, right now.
Some techniques are: You can use a Pomodoro
timer,
which is a 25-minute timer to set, and then
you focus down for 25 minutes.
You can't really do anything else for 25 minutes.
Start to take note of where your attention
goes throughout your day,
whether you're actually being productive or
not.
If you're getting distracted,
if you find yourself trailing off, opening
new tabs, and just looking at random things,
then I highly recommend you either go on a
social media detox
or download those apps that block certain
websites.
Or find some way, Pomodoro technique or something
else,
that will help you use your time more wisely
and focus down.
Also: Studies have proven that you're more
effective when you focus on one thing at a
time.
Multitasking is a myth.
It's actually not more effective or productive.
It's so much better to focus on one thing
at a time,
instead of constantly switching between different
tasks.
Next thing I'm going to share is this exercise
that I use for myself
to plan out my ideal day and my ideal week,
filled with all the things that I would want
to do.
This is just an exercise that will help create
a guideline for your schedule,
because it actually helps to see how physically
things can fit into your schedule
and how you can actually make it work.
Even though it might seem rigid to some of
you,
just remember that this exercise is just to
be used as a guideline,
not like a strict schedule that you're supposed
to follow every day.
First step is to decide on your non-negotiables.
These are the things that you have to do
or the things that you absolutely want to
do, you need to do.
Decide on all of those.
Most likely, it's school, it's work, and then
maybe you have
some other things that you're like, &quot;No, this
is non-negotiable.
I have to do this thing
in my life in my schedule.&quot;
Make a list of all of those non-negotiable
things.
Next, bring out the dreamer in you and write
down a list of all the things that you want
to do
in your ideal life, in your ideal week.
While you're making that list,
estimate the amount of time that you want
to spend on each item on that list,
per day or per week.
For example: I love to do morning pages.
That's something that I want to do every day
for twenty minutes.
I also want to meditate, but I would say I
would meditate at least five to ten minutes,
minimum.
I'd also want to spend an hour or two a week
doing yoga.
And an hour or two a week learning, taking
online classes, like on Skillshare.
Now it's time to design your ideal week.
We're going to map out
all of your waking hours in a week, from the
moment you wake up
to the moment you go to bed, Sunday through
Saturday–or Monday through Sunday,
however you want to count it.
What you're going to do is:
First, you're going to put in your non-negotiables.
Schedule them,
whether it's your school schedule, your work
schedule, whatever you can put in there.
I know some things are very flexible, but
just do the best that you can.
Next, we're going to look at your list of
things that you'd ideally want to do.
And then we're going to see if we can incorporate
them into either your morning routine
or your evening routine.
The reason I think it's best to incorporate
these things
into your morning or evening routine is because,
in the middle of the day,
some many things could come in and out.
You might have errands you need to run.
There's just life responsibilities.
Usually, you can carve out time for yourself
in the morning and in the evening, whether
you want to wake up earlier
to write morning pages and have your coffee
or whatever.
Or in the evening,
when you're winding down, that's when you
have a lot of me time.
That's the method that works easier for me.
Sometimes it works out
to put something in the middle of your day.
For example: exercising.
If you're taking yoga at a studio and your
favorite class is at this time, then that's
your time.
You know?
You know what's best for your schedule.
But my recommendation is:
If you can fit it into morning and evening
routines, do that.
But if it makes more sense to put it in the
middle of your day, then do that as well.
But just do your best to build out your ideal
week.
Also, for those activities that you decide
you want to do once a week or twice a week,
assign those activities to specific days.
Carve out a space in your schedule to do that
thing,
and make that time non-negotiable as well.
For example: If a friend calls you
and asks you if you're free during that time,
you're like, &quot;No, that's my online class-taking
time.&quot;
You have to set aside that time and act as
if it's a part of your real schedule.
By the way, you can download this weekly worksheet
that I created for this exercise.
Just click right here in the upper right corner.
Or down below, you'll find the link, as well.
As you're creating this ideal week, make sure
to leave some time for rest, okay?
It's always important to have space between
these events.
Don't pack it super tight, because you know,
in reality, things don't always go according
to plan.
So just keep that in mind, schedule time for
self care, social events,
and just space, in case anything happens.
Another thing I want to bring up I learned
from Tony Robbins, called &quot;N.E.T. time&quot;.
&quot;N.E.T.&quot; stands for &quot;no extra time&quot;.
We all have to do things that are pretty mundane,
like driving, doing chores, showering, going
to the gym, running errands.
That's time that you can actually use to do
something else at the same time.
I know earlier, I said no multitasking, but
this is like the one exception.
It's when you're doing something that's kind
of mindless.
Like when you're driving,
you can use that time to listen to audiobooks,
listen to a podcast,
or listen to language learning tapes, which
is what I've been doing lately,
and I've been loving it.
And I also play podcasts when I'm showering.
And when you're at the gym, you can save that
time for watching your favorite TV show.
Think about ways that you can incorporate
N.E.T. time, where you're taking advantage
of
your time, doing something that's enhancing
your life, while you have to do those
mundane things like cleaning and washing the
dishes, because life is life.
You have to do those things, but you can also
listen to something else, while you're doing
that.
Alright, now that you've scheduled your ideal
week, most likely,
you'll be able to see that it is possible
to fit all these things that you want to do
in your week,
if you just manage your time better.
That's how I felt after doing this exercise.
But I know that some people out there might
be a little real ambitious,
so maybe your schedule is looking a little
packed.
So be real with yourself here.
Does this schedule look doable?
Did you leave enough space for yourself?
If not, then it's time to go back and cut
out more tasks.
Decide what is something
that you can let go of, decide what's something
that you can save for later,
because remember: It doesn't mean that this
is the schedule you have to do
for the rest of your life.
You can do this now, focus on these items
now.
And then maybe in two months, you can switch
it up and learn something else in two months.
You can try out a new hobby in two months,
but maybe you don't have that time
to fit everything in your schedule now.
You can also do this exercise not on a weekly
basis, but on a yearly basis.
Maybe you want to plan out your months, and
maybe you want to have themes
for your month where you want to focus on
learning Japanese this month,
and next month is learning watercolor.
Who knows?
But I know that we can make time
for the things that we want to do.
It all comes down to time management
and actually scheduling that time in your
planner to make it happen.
Because so many times, we're like, &quot;Oh, I
really want to do this,&quot; but that day never
comes.
You know, if we don't schedule it in, it most
likely will not happen.
This whole exercise is just about actually
taking time to sit down and schedule in
all the things you want to fit into your schedule.
Do your best to make it work.
Obviously, it's a guideline.
It's not a strict schedule to follow.
Just do your best.
Alright, I hope you liked today's exercise.
And I hope that, with better time management,
you can make the time to do all the things
that you wanted to do.
I want to give a special thanks to Skillshare
