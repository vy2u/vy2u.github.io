to my channel lavender
today we're going to be doing something
really fun I'm going to show you how to
make a vision board so if you don't know
what it is a vision board is basically a
board of visual inspiration for your
dream life it's basically like images
quotes that inspire you and just
everything that you want to invite into
your life you put it on your vision
board so I'm going to share like
different ways you can create a vision
board and then I'm going to show you a
bonus exercise that you can do called
current me versus future me and that was
a little vision exercise that I created
myself that I think would be really fun
for you guys to do as well also make
sure you stick to the end of the video
because I'm going to be doing a giveaway
and all the instructions are at the end
so it's up to you how you want to make
your vision board you could do it
digitally or traditionally so I created
my first vision board in 2014 this was
done digitally so what I did was I went
on Pinterest and I collected all of the
images that I really liked all the
images and quotes that inspired me and
basically I arranged it all on Photoshop
had it printed and then framed it that
actually took a lot of work to just do
it digitally so today I wanted to try to
do it the old-fashioned way with
magazine cutouts and paper both ways are
great as long as you have some sort of
visual board like a physical visual
board that you can look at every day I
think that's what matters so let's get
started
you
you
you
another exercise that I really wanted to
share with you guys is something that
I'm calling current me versus future me
so I started doing this in 2012 you can
see my notebooks and basically I've done
this vision exercise every year since
then so I have this one and then the
next year I had another one and the next
year I had another one and then 2015 I
had another one and I haven't made one
for 2016 so I think it'd be cool to do
it today
the way that it works is you draw your
current self on one end and I literally
drew myself as how I looked that day
like what I wore and then basically you
paint the picture of your thoughts
emotions and whatever you're going
through at that time so I was going
through like really tough times in 2012
so I was like lost my thinking was messy
I basically was like going through my
last semester of college I was so like
depressed I had so much pressure to like
get a job and I don't know I was just
not in a good state I had insomnia I was
really really flaky with friends because
I had like trouble waking up every day I
just couldn't wake up and I would have
like lunch meetings and I would sleep
through them and so I felt bad that I
would scan my friends up but basically
that was a picture of what I looked like
March 2012 and then I drew myself as
what I wanted to look like I drew my
ideal me the me that I aspire to be so
basically I'm like I'm happy healthy
balanced successful I'm confident I
understand me and my purpose and here
finally in my life I am punctual and
responsible basically envisioning how I
want to be in my ideal future so I did
this exercise each year since 2012
and it's been really encouraging and
motive
to see how I've changed and how my life
and my thoughts and emotions have really
shifted towards a more positive
direction and it's just really cool to
see how the current me in the more
recent years really resembles the ideal
future me that I originally drew in 2012
like literally now when I look back on
those old drawings I feel like my life
is almost basically like this like I'm
on my way to being that happy positive
self that I've always wanted to be
you
all right I hope you guys liked those
exercises today how to make a vision
board and how to do the current me
versus future me vision exercise tell me

are going to try it out please like take
a photo of it and tag me on instagram at
