practicing for the past two years it's
so simple yet can be so difficult at the
same time but I keep on trying because I
strongly believe in the power of
meditation to enhance our quality of
life the purpose of meditation is to
clear your mind and practice being aware
of the present moment there are so many
benefits to meditation whether it's
physical mental emotional or spiritual I
don't think I can name them all but to
start meditation can help you calm your
mind de-stress and find inner peace and
balance it can help improve your focus
your metabolism and your sleep it can
also increase your productivity
creativity intuition and happiness and
reduce aging boost your immune system
and add incredible value to your overall
well-being first find a quiet space
where you'll be undisturbed for a period
of time then sit cross-legged on a
cushion or in a chair with your feet
flat on the floor whatever your sitting
position make sure your back is straight
but not too tense imagine a string from
your tailbone pulling all the way up
your spine to the highest point of your
head softly close your eyes and begin to
breathe slowly and deeply
your mind should follow the path of the
breath going in and out of your nose if
you notice yourself drifting off into
your thoughts simply bring your focus
back to your breath be the observer of
your thoughts but don't engage in them
the goal here is to enter the gap the
space where you're aware of yourself and
what's around you but your mind is
actually not thinking anything this
awareness is your consciousness it's
your soul so start small try meditating
for five minutes a day and you can build
from there I recommend using a
meditation timer my favorite one is Zen
friend find a time that works for you
that you can incorporate into your daily
routine I like to meditate for 20
minutes in the morning after I journal
creating a daily meditation routine
won't always be an easy journey so keep
in mind patience perseverance and non
judgments be patient with yourself for
the time will pass anyway persevere even
at times you want to give up and don't
judge yourself when your mind wanders
just do your best you can try putting on
some relaxing music or sounds of nature
while you meditate or try following a
guided meditation I highly recommend the
app headspace I think it's so
beautifully designed and so user
friendly if you want to get more
advanced you can incorporate a mudra or
hand pose for your meditation here are
just a few examples palms up to receive
palms down for grounding this mudra
provides calming energy for deep
contemplation and reflection it's useful
for increasing self-awareness this mudra
generates knowledge wisdom creativity
and calmness you can either face your
palms up to receive or down to feel more
grounded
this mudra symbolizes patience and
discipline and it helps generate a
feeling of stability this mudra
represents energy and health and
provides a feeling of self-confidence
and balance and this mudra symbolizes
communication and openness it can help
strengthen your intuition and feeling if

makes you feel thanks so much for
