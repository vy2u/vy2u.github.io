in this video I'm going to share some
tips on organizing your closet the con
Mari way so the con my way is a method
of decluttering and organizing by Mari a
condo she wrote this book called
the life-changing magic of tidying up
and you can check out this video where I
go into detail on her method of how to
tidy but in this video I'm going to
share just the tips on the clothes
specifically how to organize your
clothes the way that Mari acondo teaches
it so the first tip is a very
significant part of the con modern
method and it's to fold your clothes
vertically and to store them vertically
in your drawers so that you can see
everything at one glance you should fold
whatever clothes can be folded because
folded clothes take up less space and
just gives you more room if you guys are
interested you can check out my videos
on how I fold my clothes the con Mari
way so the second tip is to hang up the
clothes that look happier when hung up
so these are probably your very airy
pieces that look better when it's on a
hanger as well as your structured or
heavy pieces like your coats and jackets
alright the next tip is one that I found
the most interesting and it's to
organize your closet so that it rises to
the right it will make you happier when
you look at it because it's going in a
positive direction so whether or not you
believe that's true I just thought it
was a very fun thing to try out so what
you do is you put your long and heavy
items to the left and your lightweight
and shorter items to the right so it
would be like jackets coats dresses then
maybe pants blouses skirts and whatever
crop tops or something similarly you
should organize your drawers so that the
darker shades are in the back and the
lighter shades are in the Front's the
next tip is to make sure you've removed
all your labels tags hangy thingies from
your clothes because you want to make
sure your clothes look comfortable and
broken into your closet when you keep
the clothes in the packaging from when
you bought it
you kind of leave them in the States as
if they were still in the store and they
don't quite belong to you yet do you
notice that once you cut off the tag or
like take off the sticker the piece of
clothing feels like it's yours
so Mori Kondo tells you to do this to
all of your clothing and not to leave
any tags or things around because those
are distracting and they just don't make
your closet feel like you the next tip
is to utilize old shoe boxes so use shoe
boxes and put them in your drawer to
further organize and separate your
little things this is especially useful
for socks or underwear x' and little
accessories and things like that
Mario Kondo also recommends to save the
shoebox lids to use as trays in the
kitchen to hold like salt and pepper and
stuff in the cabinets the next tip is to
store your bags in your bags so instead
of stuffing tissue or old t-shirts to
keep a bag shape you can put smaller
bags into a big bag and just fit your
bags into bags as long as you don't
overflow it it's a great way to save
space and also keep your bags in shape
and lastly remember to keep it super
simple it's so much better to keep
everything in one place instead of
scattered in different rooms and spots
throughout the house just so you can
keep track of your stuff at all times
alright that's it I hope these tips
helped you guys a little bit on your
journey to organizing your closets if
you haven't watched my original how to
tidy video you should watch it right now
so that you can learn how to properly
tidy the con Mari way and how to you
know go in the right order of the
different categories I will be coming
out with a closet tour video soon
showing how I organize my closet the con
Mari way so this is a big journey and it
takes a long time to kind of sort
through all your stuff but once you can
discard your unwanted things and keep
only without that you love and organize
it beautifully in your closet space

so happy tidying keep going good luck
