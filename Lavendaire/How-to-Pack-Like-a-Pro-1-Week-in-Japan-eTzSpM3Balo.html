a way to show you how I pack for my
one-week trip to Japan I'm packing in
this medium-sized luggage because I want
to leave some extra space to shop I
usually start with clothes so I'll pick
out my outfits and then I'll start
folding each piece into a little
rectangle that can stack vertically in
my suitcase you'll see later what it
looks like so here I have two pairs of
pants and I also have two pairs of
leggings and then I have this pair of
shorts that I'm gonna bring as well then
I pack two dresses one that's casual and
another one that's a little more dressy
just in case we ever need to go
somewhere a little nicer then I'm
packing two oversized t-shirts I feel
like these are just super easy comfy and
I can wear them with leggings since I
don't like wearing pants that often then
I have more tops so I have this long
sleeve sweater that's very fall looking
have this red blouse and another t-shirt
so totally fall vibes
alright then I'm packing this hoodie I
actually got this last time I was in
Tokyo and this bomber jackets and this
cardigan which I'm actually gonna wear
on the plane with me and this coat so
this coat is gonna go into my luggage
since I have a lot of extra space then
I'm packing one workout outfits just in
case I decide to work out this pouch is
for my underwear this pouch is for bras
and socks
and here is my toiletries pouch that has
everything toiletry related I actually
got this pouch from a t-shirt packaging
so it's not something I bought it's just
reused here's the makeup I'm bringing I
just have a pouch of all the essentials
I have an eyeshadow palette and then my
beauty blenders a couple beanies because
it'll get pulled out there and two
scarves one thick and one thing I have
hotel slippers for my boyfriend and
myself then here are the shoes I'm
packing I have flip-flops just in case I
need to wear them if the shower is dirty
and then I have some nicer pair of shoes
and I wear sneakers always on the plane
a bag of random accessories and then my
electronics pouch so I put my phone
charger camera chargers in here I
actually decided to put my accessories
in that pouch as well and now it's time
to pack so I start with the heavier
items like the hoodies my pants and then
putting my tops in there as you can see
I'm always like rearranging because it's
like a game of Tetris there's no right
way to do it you just put in whatever
works so I've put in all my clothes
basically I like to put all my clothes
on one side of the luggage and the other
side I leave for like accessories and
miscellaneous stuff so this vertical
packing method is my favorite that way I
can kind of look at my luggage and see
everything at a glance it's like looking
into your closet so on the other side
I'm packing my coats because I know I
have a lot of extra space here so I'm
also putting in the shoes and all the
miscellaneous items like electronics
toiletries and makeup so there's a lot
of extra space in here because I know
I'm gonna do some shopping
now I'll quickly show you what I pack in
my backpack that I bring onto the plane
first and most importantly is my
passport and then I have wallets in the
back and then I'll pack some earphones
in a pouch and have chapstick and a pen
for filling out forms my laptop my
laptop charger iPad and my workbook for
journaling have a pouch with like
batteries tamo charger phone chargers a
first-aid pouch hand cream and X
jackets not shown here is my camera
because obviously I'm using my camera to
film this video but that's basically it
that's what I'm packing for my one-week
trip to Japan I hope you guys enjoy that
video love you so much and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
