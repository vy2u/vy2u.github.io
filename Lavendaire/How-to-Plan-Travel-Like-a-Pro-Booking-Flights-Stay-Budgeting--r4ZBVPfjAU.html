you may or may not know that I recently
went on a trip to Japan so I thought
it'd be a good idea to show you how I
plan for my trips so it's gonna be a lot
of information I think I'm gonna break
this down into two videos so this first
video is in partnership with hello talk
and I'm gonna show you my best tips on
booking flights accommodations budgeting
and just other important things to do
before you go on your trip the second
video is gonna be more about like
researching where to go planning out
your itinerary figuring out
transportation your phone your internet
and just other fun stuff fYI these tips
are based on my personal experience I
can't claim that I'm like a travel
expert or anything but I can say that I
do travel more than the average person I
would say I've been to 27 countries so
far and I travel multiple times a year
and I've been doing this for like eight
or nine years or so so let's get to it
my favorite website to check for flight
prices is called Skyscanner and the
reason why I love Skyscanner so much is
because they have this monthly view of
flight prices so I'm gonna put LAX to
Japan or not let's to Tokyo here which
is the trip that I took click on this
button right here that says show whole
month and this is crucial I personally
like non-stop flights only so I'm going
to check that you can leave it unchecked
and you see the prices are cheaper so
what I love about this is that say you
want a book for December it might get
pretty pricey oh it's not that pricey
and so here it says 196 if you leave on
this Sunday and then it's 196 to return
on this date so the total would be 392
and then I mean you can play around with
other dates as you can see just look at
whatever is the cheapest option if that
matters to you which I think it does Oh
nope
it went up so this is 190 and now this
is 246 so you just play around with the
prices here and figure out what's the
best option for you one thing I do have
to say
this is not usually the final price for
some reason when you click show flights
you're gonna see prices that are more
expensive but looking at the monthly
view just gives you a good idea on when
the price range is cheaper for yourself
but you always have to check the final
price as well so here you can see like
the best option they recommend is this
one because it's a nonstop flights and
this is the cheapest but it has like a
huge layover I mean 26 hours to travel I
don't think anybody wants to do that so
just I mean if you do then great but
mostly like I like to travel a non-stop
one stop at the minimum so you can you
know adjust your options here so usually
I feel free to book directly through
Skyscanner as you can see it takes you
to this other website where the total is
what it's set on the sky scanner if you
don't feel comfortable booking through
these random budget websites then
another thing that I'll do sometimes is
I'll just use sky scanner to check
prices and then I will go to something
like Expedia where I'm more comfortable
booking tickets from there as you can
see this flight that's on sky scanner
AAA operated by United is seven hundred
twenty two dollars but if you go to
Expedia this same flight this is
basically that same flight the United
one operated by A&amp;amp;E is 775 so you can
see that sometimes other websites are
more expensive so that's why I like to
check sky scanner it basically scans the
entire web for the cheapest price
another thing that's really important to
note is whenever you're looking up
flight prices use an incognito window
that way your browser doesn't track what
you're researching because these
websites they put cookies I don't know
how cookies work but basically they
track your searches and they can tell
when you're searching for this specific
flight they're like oh this person wants
to go on this flight so they will raise
the price just for you because they know
that you want it so badly like there
have been times where like I've noticed
that my price on my computer is a lot
higher than like the price on my
friend's computer because my browser was
being tracked
another app that's helpful is called
hopper and hopper is an app that helps
predict future and airfare prices and
basically you can input that whatever
flights you're interested in and then it
will send you a notification when the
price drops to its lowest point so
that's something to check out if you're
interested and if you're super flexible
you don't really care where you're going
you just want to get a cheap flight to
get to anywhere something fun you can do
on Skyscanner is you can click here and
then can't decide where so basically you
search everywhere and you can search
like for the whole month of say January
and what it will do is it will give you
the lowest prices ever like from your
airport so as you can see there are a
lot of cheap flights in the United
States Mexico is cheap Canada Puerto
Rico Guatemala Cuba Iceland three
hundred dollars for a flight to Iceland
from La that's pretty cheap non-stop
whoa so then you click into it and then
you kind of just like play around with
this and this and you see how this says
341 Wow
it's actually operated by wow Airlines
I've taken that airline before it's a
budget airline let me just say that
another website worth looking into is
this cots cheap flights com and
basically you enter your email and then
they will send you flight deals to your
email and that's just something if you
guys are interested in that sort of
thing
my next tip is to familiarize yourself
with the language at least learn the
basics because that can get you pretty
far so depending on where you're going
like maybe it's a place that speaks
another language that you do not
understand it's important to remember
that you know even though English is
spoken by a lot of people around the
world you shouldn't expect everyone to
know English when you travel I feel like
a lot of Americans they travel and they
expect everyone to be able to understand
or speak English where it's like why
would you expect people of that one
you don't speak their language so anyway
I think it's important to always be
culturally sensitive and to do your best
how to say the basics like hello thank
you excuse me where's the bathroom or
where can I get food these are really
important questions that will get you
far and it's like people like you better
for trying to speak their language so
think of all the phrases that might come
in handy when you're traveling maybe
when you're lost or you need to find a
bathroom or water whatever it may be
like write down a list of phrases that
you will translate and here I'm using
the hello Tok app to translate phrases
because what that app does is it can
read back those phrases to you so you
can practice like just copying and
following along with that language it
also saves those phrases for you in the
app and you can favorite those phrases
so that you can just always have them on
your phone when you're on the go I know
a lot of you are interested in learning
new languages so this is actually a
really cool app that can do so much more
than just translating so hello Tok is
actually a language and cultural app
that has over seven million users where
you can basically practice a language by
chatting with a native speaker who wants
to learn your language so it's kind of
like a language swap where you are
practicing this language with a native
speaker but they also want to learn your
native language so you correct them and
they correct you so first you set your
native language and then you set the
language that you want to learn and then
the app will suggest a bunch of language
partners that you can practice with and
you can also browse moments which is
kind of like a social newsfeed of other
people's posts on the app so that's a
really easy way to get your feet wet in
this app without having to directly chat
with people what you can do is you just
browse peoples moments and you can like
correct people's English and you can
post things in your language or another
language and people can correct you and
as you're reading other people's moments
if you don't understand what they're
saying there are options to translate it
and also do transliteration which is
kind of like pronunciation for these
words in your language and the app can
also like read out the post for you so
you can practice like speaking out this
language by the way if the thought of
connecting to random strangers is kind
of nerve-racking there are options to
filter out people who can find you so I
personally set the filter like same
gender only
and then I reduce the age range of
people who can reach out to me because I
feel more comfortable talking to people
who are around my age and people who are
females just because like when I first
opened the app I got like a lot of
messages from guys from China and it
kind of like overwhelmed me and made me
feel weird in some way so I just do
whatever makes you feel comfortable like
I feel comfortable just chatting with
girls because that's just how it is for
me so if you're interested in checking
out hollow talk and practicing a new
language chatting with the locals in
that area definitely click that link
down below you can also like ask them
for recommendations in the city that
you're going to that's another option
like just connecting with people who
actually live in the place that you're
traveling to next let's move on to
booking accommodations and for me it's
all about location it's all about
finding a place in the perfect location
that is very very convenient to
everything that you want to see during
your trip personally I've stayed in
hostels bed-and-breakfast Airbnb Zand
hotels and I don't know if there are
other types of options out there like
I've never tried couchsurfing that's a
thing if you want to like stay on
someone's couch but personally I think
Airbnb is my perfect medium I that's my
favorite way to travel now because I
like being able to stay in like an
apartment type setting and Airbnb --zz
are usually cheaper than hotels but
they're usually just as clean and
organized and you have just as much
privacy so before you decide where to
stay it's important to have an idea of
the spots that you want to see while
you're traveling so I would do a quick
research on like top things to do in the
city or just have a list of things that
you want to see and then map it all out
on Google Maps so you can see if it's in
any specific area of the city and you'll
see like where you're more likely be
hanging out so for example on my recent
trip to Tokyo I knew I wanted to stay on
the west side of Tokyo because I loved
the area's Shibuya Harajuku and Shinjuku
and basically there are like a lot of
things to do on the east side of Tokyo
but I knew that I was going to
frequently go back to the places on the
west side so that's where I wanted to
look around another important thing is
if you're planning on taking Metro and
public transportation is to find a place
that is close to a metro station by
close I mean walking distance less than
seven minutes I
it's longer than seven minutes like
you're exhausted at the end of the day
you don't want to walk 15 to 20 minutes
after your station to get to your place
like sometimes I've done that it's just
really annoying it's just so nice to
live right next to the station and the
protip on top of that is to stay near a
station that's on a major line that you
know you're gonna be using frequently so
this is gonna take some research you can
totally ask anyone who's a local in that
area if you can for example in Tokyo one
of the main metro lines that will
basically take you to all the most
important places is the JR Yamanote they
line and that's the Green Line that goes
in this circle another example is if you
go to Taipei the blue line is the line
that is most frequented if you're
planning to see those tourist
attractions so my friends recommended
that I stay near the blue line and it
really makes a huge difference because
if you're staying even close to a metro
station but it's on a line that is
further away from everything you're
gonna always be like transferring to
that major line so it just depends on
how much you care about being convenient
to the places that you want to see for
me I've learned to just find a place
near a metro station preferably on one
of the main lines that I know I'm gonna
be taking all the time so let's jump
into Airbnb where we're gonna find a
place to stay when and hopefully you
have the dates that you're going so it's
pretty straightforward to use Airbnb
let's put two guests amenities like
internet so this is my secret for
booking Airbnb 'z instead of like just
looking through the places like this
although you can do that because it's
cute to look at photos what i do is i
zoom into each metro station so I've
already done my research and I know that
I want to stay along this Yamanote a
line that's near Shibuya station so I
have a lot of options because here's
Shibuya and the line goes like all the
way up to here and then all the way down
here and then it makes like a circle
through there but I don't want to stay
on this side of the line I want to stay
this side of the line a few stops away
from Shibuya basically on Airbnb I'm
gonna start like going into each metro
station along that line and looking in
the immediate area of the apartments
there so normally I would click on like
the cheap options look through the
photos do I like this maybe and I'll
just open the ones that are interesting
on a new tab so for example if I don't
see anything that I like around the
Yoyogi area then I would just go down
this is Harajuku I know that it's really
busy here but I mean if it's worth a
look to like check out all these
different places so for my recent trip I
actually stayed down here by this
station maguro another thing I pay
attention to in the listings is they
usually tell you how long it takes to
walk to the nearest station sometimes if
they don't say how long it takes to walk
I have a feeling that the walk is pretty
long because to be honest Airbnb z--
these points are not exact
they don't expose the address of the
Airbnb until you book it so I don't know
if I would completely trust the location
of this point I mean it's probably like
a general area but it's always like just
more like safe to read the description
of the listing so this one says five
minutes by foot from the station and
this one looks super sleek and this one
says three minutes to Magaro station
another thing that I really care about
is reading the reviews so I love seeing
four and a half to five star reviews for
the place that I'm staying in there have
been times where I've stayed at a place
where there were no reviews because it
was a new home so it's been like a hit
or miss sometimes they're great but
sometimes like if there's no reviews it
could be like kind of dirty and the
place might not match the photos so just
keep in mind that it's always like a
risk you're always taking a gamble
sometimes places don't look exactly like
the
photos but if a listing has like really
good reviews and you actually read
through the comments and it sounds great
then I would trust that by the way if
you guys do want to book through Airbnb
I have a free $40 travel credits that
you can use just click the link down
below you'll find it so free money right
that's awesome moving on let's talk
about budgeting so how much money should
i budget for my trip how much cash do I
bring these are questions that I always
ask every time and it really depends on
the location you're going to because
some places are cheaper and some places
are more expensive that's just how it is
but what I would do is I would look up
the average price for meals in your city
that you're visiting so look up the
average price for breakfast lunch and
dinner and then you can calculate
yourself like okay if I'm gonna spend
$10 on breakfast 15 on lunch 15 on
dinner so that's like forty dollars a
day for food and I'm sure there's a lot
of wiggle room in there for other stuff
as well it really depends on you I'd
also look up prices for everything that
you want to do so museum ticket prices
just excursion prices things like that
so you can add that in your budget as
well so food activities and
transportation so whether you're
planning on taking Metro or taxi uber or
even renting a car that cost goes into
it as well lastly how much do you want
to shop so factor that into the budget
as well
the tricky part for me is deciding how
much cash to bring and how much I should
rely on credit card some places don't
accept credit card as widely as other
places so this really depends on your
own research on the city that you're
visiting are you going to be able to use
your credit card the best general tip I
can give is make sure you get a credit
card that has no foreign transaction fee
so I use the Chase Reserve card there
are a ton of other travel cards out
there but just make sure you get one
that has zero foreign transaction fee
because why pay for extra fees like that
another thing I always do is I order
foreign currency at my bank because the
rates are generally like the cheapest if
you get it from your bank at home I
don't recommend exchanging your money at
airports or any touristy places because
usually the rates like the
version rate they charge you is much
higher it's just better for you to order
foreign currency at your bank before
your trip and it usually takes your bank
like seven days or so so order it like
two weeks in advance my last money tip
is to have the currency conversion app
on your phone so you know exactly what
the conversion rate is and when you're
looking at the prices in this foreign
area like you know how to do the
conversion in your head or just do it on
your phone really quickly you know
because it's helpful my last tip is on
handling important documents and this is
just a personal tip that I think
everybody should do just to prepare
themselves and protect themselves so all
of your important documents have a
photocopy on your phone and online take
photos and screenshots of your passport
boarding pass ID visa the address of the
place you're staying directions to the
place you're staying and any other
important documents or health insurance
things like that because you never know
if you're gonna lose something you
always want to have a copy of all of
your important documents and you want to
have a copy on your phone hidden
somewhere and a copy like online on the
cloud whether it's in Dropbox Google
Drive or sent to yourself in your email
that way you can access it from anywhere
around the world you might also want to
consider keeping emergency phone numbers
on your phone and online in part of that
cloud storage because you never know
what's gonna happen and you want to have
those numbers with you and also keep
like a written copy of these important
numbers in your wallet or something in
case anything happens to you alright
that's it for this video but keep an eye
out for the next video which is going to
be on researching where to go planning
your itinerary transportation phone
internet and just other fun stuff like
planning your Instagram photos while you
travel by the way if you're actually
planning a trip I have a packing
checklist you can download right here it
basically is a checklist of all the
things that you should bring while
you're traveling
alright that's it for this video have a
beautiful day and safe travels I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
