hope you're having a beautiful day today
I want to share a journaling prompts
slash vision exercise that you can do to
help you envision your dream life more
clearly so it's called the vivid vision
and you can do it in two ways and I
actually recommend you do both so you
can do the vivid vision envisioning your
dream life in the next three years and
then the other one is using the vivid
vision to envision your ideal day so
let's start with the three years ahead
so what I'm saying is you have to look
into the future three years lean into
the future so if now you're watching
this is 2017 then three years later is
2020 wow that feels like really far off
into the future but three years later so
what you want to do is you want to
imagine exactly what your life looks
like in 2020 in your ideal situation
okay so you want to be as detailed as
possible and hits every area of your
life so think about how you wake up what
times you wake up where do you live what
you do during your day what people do
hang out with what are your hobbies what
are you feeling what are the things that
you smell bring your senses into it and
try to see if you can imagine in very
excruciating these details of like you
know what you see what you hear what you
smell taste touch everything so be as
detailed as possible and really paint
the picture for yourself what does your
life look like as a whole and in all the
different areas maybe peek into your
health personal growth career your
relationships your happiness your
creativity how much you travel and you
can really go on and on depending on
what's important to you so open up a
notebook or a words off on your computer
and just start writing just like I said
be as detailed as possible try to hit
all of the areas paint that picture of
what your life will look like in two
20 so this is your vivid vision once
you're done writing that whole thing put
that in your phone put that on your wall
put it somewhere where you can read it
every day and revisit it every day this
exercise is an amazing tool to help you
bring your ideal life into a reality
because the more details that you are
the more you can actually see the
different parts of your life and what
they look like the more you can be able
to take actions to make those a reality
because it's kind of like you've laid
out your goal you've laid out the
endpoint and all you have to do is put
you know take the steps or put together
the pieces to make it happen and the
more you read this vivid vision every
day the more you're going to feel like
you're already there the more you're
going to feel like how it feels to have
already accomplished it
so just bringing that emotion to it will
help you know use that law of attraction
to bring you closer to that reality if
you haven't watched my Law of Attraction
video I'll post the link here and below
but this is just one exercise that you
can use to utilize law of attraction but
also lay out like the practical
foundation on what you want in your life
and how to get there another way you can
use this vivid vision exercise is to use
it to visualize your ideal day so try to
envision what your a dream ideal day
looks like from the moment you wake up
to the moment you go to bed what fills
up your day so just have fun with it
honestly it's just a journaling prompts
to do for fun but once you have it put
it in your phone put it somewhere where
you'll read it every day
so that you can bring more of that into
your life whatever is in that ideal day
maybe you can start doing it tomorrow
maybe you can incorporate little pieces
of it into your life and the sooner you
realized what exactly it is you want in
your ideal day or your ideal life the
sooner you can start bringing that and
turning it into reality by the way if
you'd like to see an example of a vivid
vision then I share the one that I wrote
back in 2013 that would be low you can
download it at that link but yeah I
really hope this exercise can help you
clarify
what it is you want in your dream life
in your ideal day whatever it is knowing
it is the first step to getting it all
right have a beautiful day I love you
all see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
