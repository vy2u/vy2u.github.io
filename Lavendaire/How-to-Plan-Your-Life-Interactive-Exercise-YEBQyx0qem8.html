Dara
today we're gonna talk about how to plan
out your life from the big picture to
the little details so this video is
going to be a little different it's an
interactive exercise which means that
you're gonna work along with the video
before I get into it I'm gonna do a
giveaway at the end of this video I'm
gonna be giving out yes three artists of
life workbooks for you guys to help you
plan your best year if you don't know
what this is this is a workbook that I
created with a bunch of exercises inside
I mean oh this is my copy where there's
like I've actually filled it out but if
you want to learn more there are links
there and down below to learn more about
this workbook so when planning out your
life I personally like to start with the
big picture the ultimate life goals like
what is your grand vision for your life
what kind of legacy do you want to leave
on this earth these are really big
questions and it's very daunting to
answer I understand completely and I
understand that depending on where you
are in your life's journey you might not
have figured it out just yet because
when I was in college I have no idea
what that big picture looked like so
just it's up to you if you know what
your big picture idea is then take this
time to jot down everything that you
want to accomplish in your life what are
your big dreams for your life and if
you're scared and you feel like this
section is too difficult then just fast
forward the video continue on and then
later you can come back and do this big
picture section at the end it's also up
to you what timeline you want to use for
your big picture goals so big picture
can mean five years from now ten years
from now even fifty years from now so
it's up to you what you want to use
there's no right or wrong way whatever
inspires you whatever drives you and
motivates you so if you need help in
this section I'd recommend you check out
some other videos I have I have one
called how to figure out what to do with
your life which helps you find your ikki
guy
aka sweet spot on what to do with your
life and then another video called how
to plan your dream life which goes into
an exercise called vivid vision that
helps you like really illustrate and
paint out the picture of your ideal life
you
all right now that you've mapped out
your big-picture goals put them in your
phone on your computer on your wall put
them where you will read them daily
because you want to constantly be
reminded of where you're headed where
you're going so your big-picture goals
are essentially your compass in life
they help you steer yourself in the
right direction so that you don't veer
off your path for too long sometimes if
we don't have those big picture goals
and dreams in mind we end up just
settling in another direction or we get
lost and you know what I mean so you
want to focus on what you want out of
life and make sure you're taking small
steps in that direction it's okay to
change your big-picture goals because
you know nothing is set in stone so
along the way if you feel like these
goals don't suit you anymore feel free
to change them alright now it's time to
set your yearly goals and I'm sure a lot
of you have done this already but it's
good to kind of get a refresh now that
you've elaborated on your big-picture
goals how can you break that down and
how can you pick what is the next
important steps for me to take in order
to get closer to that dream life so just
I don't know look at your goals ask
yourself what is possible for me to
accomplish in one year to take me closer
to my dreams I know that the dreams
might seem really far off right now
don't worry about that just focus on
what's the next immediate step that can
take me one baby step closer so write
out your goals and don't forget to dig
deep into all the different areas of
life not just like career but also like
your health your relationships personal
growth creativity spirituality adventure
goals whether you have like travel goals
explore what your dream life looks like
in all of these different areas and then
decide what goals you want to focus on
for 2018
you
all right now that you have your yearly
goals written down look at your goals
and decide what you want to prioritize
to focus on for this first quarter of
2018 so the quarter is three months so
this first quarter is January through
March so a lot can be done in three
months you just have to plan to focus on
something for three months in order to
get it done so it's better to focus on
one thing instead of multiple things at
once so when you focus on one thing you
can like complete that one thing in the
set amount of time whether it's one
month two months or three months but if
you try to attack all your goals at once
then you're gonna take longer to
accomplish those goals and it might feel
like you won't pick up momentum because
you're like nothing's moving or
everything's moving so slowly so it's
better to like focus pick one two or
three things max to focus on for the
quarter
you
all right now that you've decided what
you want to focus on this quarter it's
time to break it down even further into
your next action items so for each goal
or focus you've created for this quarter
break down what are the next immediate
next steps action items that I need to
take in order to achieve this goal
so brainstorm as much as you can think
of and don't worry it doesn't have to be
an exact order all that matters is that
you're like putting all the steps onto
paper
you
all right now that you have your next
action items list going it's time to
prioritize yet again and star the top
three action items that you need to do
first
so prioritize what is the most important
action items that you could take towards
these goals star three of them right now
so the action items that you've starred
make sure you put them into your to-do
list your planner whatever your system
is make sure you put it somewhere so
that you remember to get it done ASAP so
personally I like to use an app like
Wonder list or Trello to decide what to
do is to do next but it's totally up to
you you can use whatever system you want
by the way if you find that some of your
goals are more ongoing and lifestyle
based you can't really break them down
into like to-do lists and stuff then
those goals should go on to your ideal
habits list so for example if you want
to exercise more eat healthier meditate
every day those are more ongoing goals
and lifestyle goals so those you would
put onto your habits list and for your
ideal habits list I would break it down
into daily habits and weekly habits for
me I like to break down my daily habits
into like morning and evening routines
so morning habits would be like
meditating and writing morning pages
evening habits would be reading and
doing skincare and then weekly habits
would be doing yoga and exercising two
or three times a week make sure you also
keep this habits list on your phone or
write it down somewhere so that you see
what you're working towards and it's
helpful if you create like a tracking
system to track how often you're doing
these habits so that you're accountable
for yourself for example in the workbook
we have a habit tracker where I've been
ticking off all the times I've been
doing these habits so you actually get
like a visual for how you're doing
towards your goals
lastly I'll leave you guys with this
quote most people overestimate what they
can do in one year and underestimate
what they can do in 10 years this means
that we have a kind of warped perception
of time we think that we could
accomplish so much in one year and so we
set all of these goals and then we feel
down when we don't meet all of our goals
every year but on the flip side if you
look at the past 10 years how much
you've accomplished in 10 years is quite
amazing so if you look forward the next
10 years you can actually accomplish so
much more than you think
so give yourself a little more
time to reach those big picture goals I
know that naturally we want to get
everything done ASAP we want to meet all
these goals we want to be successful
like yesterday basically but great
things take time so be patient persevere
keep going maybe don't set so many crazy
goals in one year just really prioritize
and handpick what's the most important
to you and take it slow slow and steady
you know what I mean so now it's time to
move on to our giveaway so if you want a
