today is the second video in our travel
planning series so if you missed the
first video it's right here the first
video was about booking flights
accommodations budgeting language tips
and more and today I'm gonna show you
how I plan my itinerary how to plan
transportation and how to deal with like
phone and Internet stuff like that so
let me show you on the computer screen
here my Google Doc for my Japan trip so
I make a Google Doc for every trip that
I take this one's for my Tokyo trip that
I took recently as you can see the first
page I put important information like my
flight information
Airbnb information I've just kind of
removed some important stuff just for
privacy reasons by the way I always save
this as an offline file on my phone so
that I have access to this document at
all times on the second page I have the
weather for the time that I'm there and
also like a tentative schedule on what
I'm gonna do each day this is not exact
but it's just a good way to look at it
at one glance what my week in Tokyo will
look like by the way this is my friends
Google Doc because we were meeting up in
Tokyo so that's just a quick link to go
see her schedule and stuff after that is
the itinerary but let me take you back
to the beginning on the research process
so first things first how do you
research where to go and what to do on
your trip you got to know that at the
beginning of planning this Google Doc
does not look organized it's just a
bunch of links copy and pasted
paragraphs of things that I've
researched so just to briefly take you
through the research process what I
would start doing is just simply
googling things to do in Tokyo or
wherever you're going and then I'll
start with the very generic websites go
through TripAdvisor Japan travel all the
main websites that come out first I'll
basically get most of my sightseeing
information there then as I continue to
research deeper I'm most likely gonna
find some blogs whether it's travel
blogs food blogs just regular people
talking about what they did in their
travels and what's cool to do after
you've done your general research on
these generic like
things everyone must see or do in this
place then it's time to go deeper with
your personal interests so if you are a
foodie and you care about the foods that
you eat when you travel then I would
like scour food blogs and type in
specific things like best foods to eat
in Tokyo or best place to get curry best
place to get sushi best place to get
like you could also type in like top
foods to try in blink and that doesn't
have to be the country or even the city
you can get really specific like top
foods to try in Shibuya and when I went
to Disney see like I heard that the food
was one of the main things that you
should check out so I looked up like top
foods to eat at Disney see and then I
found a blogger who listed out all the
cool foods that you should try at Disney
see and the specific area where you
should get them because it was that
detailed like you couldn't get
everything everywhere you really had to
search for it like a treasure hunt so
that was really fun for me so ask
yourself what are you personally
interested in and then just do a
research for that in it the city you're
traveling in so maybe you're interested
in art or maybe you're interested in
like plants and trees and you want to
see certain things while you travel so
cater your research towards things that
you're interested in for example I
really really love that Japanese reality
show Terra's house and so when I was
planning my Tokyo trip I did a little
research on like terrace house related
things I could see when I was there so I
actually found the location of the house
where these people stayed for this TV
show and I went there when I was in
Tokyo and I also stopped by the coffee
shop where one of the members used to
work I think she actually currently
works there but I didn't get to catch
her when she was there but things like
that like if you have a very specific
passion or interest look up things you
can do related to that wherever you're
traveling another fun place to do your
travel research is actually Instagram
and this is especially useful for people
who want to take gorgeous IG photos
because I know you I get you so on
Instagram you might be following some
travel bloggers who have gone to the
place that you want to go to if so then
I would go and save their photos that
you like and save the locations the
places that they've gone to in case you
want to go to those place
as well so I really love the collections
feature in Instagram where you can just
save photos so for example you can have
a collection for Japan and save all your
favorite types of photos and places
taken in Japan so for example I saw this
gorgeous photo on Instagram it was taken
in Harajuku and so I saved it to my
collections I actually saved it to my
pretty photos collection and also my
Japan collection and basically I just
looked up the location tagged and when I
went to Harajuku I kept an eye out for
this mirror structure thing I didn't
really know exactly where to find it
but I already saw this photo beforehand
so that I knew there was something where
I could take a similar photo so if you
go to my Instagram you'll notice that I
went to that place in Harajuku and I
took a photo of my own because I got
inspired by somebody else that I found
on IG lastly if you know of anyone who
has traveled to that place that you're
going to or it lives in that place then
ask them for suggestions because there's
no better suggestions than people who
have experienced it firsthand and what's
so awesome is we have a lavender
lifestyle Facebook group where we are
basically global we have people from all
over the world and I've seen people ask
for travel suggestions on going to
different countries and stuff so that's
definitely a resource that's out there
for you alright now that you've done
your research and everything is dumped
into your Google Doc it's time to
organize by location so this is the part
where Google Maps is your best friend
what you're gonna do is you're going to
look up every single place that you've
researched look it up on Google Maps and
start like pinning everything seeing
where things are and what I would do now
is kind of group these places by a
general location of this city or place
that you're going to so what I do with
Tokyo is I organized it into like
general areas north west east south and
I specified what neighborhood this place
was in so you can see over here on my
dock I have West Tokyo and then I have
Shinjuku Shibuya and all the stuff to do
in there I have East Tokyo all these
different places
northern Tokyo all those different
places South Tokyo and outside of Tokyo
the places and things to do the reason
why I do this is I like to be efficient
when I'm travelling I kind of like to
generalize areas and see things that are
close to each other instead of like
bouncing across town wasting a lot of
time traveling so everything that I do
in my itinerary is on the way to the
next thing that I'm gonna do it's kind
of like you start here and then you want
to go boom boom boom boom boom boom or
like maybe go in a circle you just want
to be efficient with your time
so after you've organized everything by
location it's time to decide what goes
on what day of your travel so then
you're gonna go to your weekly schedule
and in the beginning this is like all
empty and what you're gonna do is you're
also gonna look at the weather for each
day for example like I noticed on
Thursday and Friday is said that there
was a chance of rain so ask yourself are
you doing outdoor activities and if so
you should probably plan them on days
that are not raining for me what was
really important was Disneyland and I
want to go to Disneyland on a weekday
and on a day where it wasn't raining and
since I arrived Tuesday then I
technically only had two days where I
could choose to go to Disneyland so
because I didn't want to go the day we
landed I decided to go to Disneyland
Wednesday so that was locked in from the
beginning and I knew that on the first
day I wanted to eat sushi as my first
stop so knowing that I go down to here
the fish market is in like East Tokyo I
would say so I basically decided that
this was going to be my day one
itinerary I was gonna explore East Tokyo
and it turns out that going to East
Tokyo was on the way to going to
northern Tokyo so we hit some of these
spots on our first day as well so this
is what our first day looked like we
started here in the morning and then I
knew that the first thing I wanted to do
in Japan was to eat sushi so Stevie
Market was the first stop so going back
to my dock these are the places that are
in the same general location as the fish
market so I just
to make a stop where I could so I went
to Mooji and then I went to this fruit
cafe right here since we were here it
just made sense to like keep seeing what
was in the area so from here we stopped
by Akihabara and then after that we went
to the Sensoji temple and then we ended
our day at Sky Tree and then we took the
ride back home so as you can see
everything is like on the way to the
next thing and it just made sense to see
it all in one day instead of like seeing
this much and then jumping around to
this side going home and then coming all
the way here another day I also knew
that I was gonna meet up friends when I
was in Japan and we were only crossing
paths two days of the trip which was
Thursdays and Fridays so I actually kind
of reserved these two days for hanging
out with friends and I wanted to take a
day trip away from Tokyo so it made
sense to do it Saturday because I knew
that I wanted to spend Sunday shopping I
hope that gave you a better idea of how
to plan your itinerary so organize
things by location check the weather and
see if there are any conflicts maybe
when it's raining choose to do the
things that are more indoor also if you
want to go shopping then probably plan
to do that towards the end of your trip
so that you're not always carrying so
much stuff with you and of course be
efficient with you travel strategy and
make sure that you're not wasting too
much time on extra travel next I'll
briefly talk about transportation so
this can vary depending on your
lifestyle so you can take Metro uber
taxi even rent a car depending on where
you're going for me if I'm going to like
a major city like Tokyo
I'm obviously going to take a lot of
metros and buses so for me at the only
thing that I really plan beforehand in
terms of transportation is getting from
the airport to the Airbnb because when
you're lugging that much stuff you don't
want to be like lost figuring out where
to go so I really like to research
heavily beforehand so first do your
research on the best methods to get from
the airport to your place of stay
whether it's taking a train or a taxi or
airport shuttle for example like usually
I would take Metro if I'm traveling like
with me and some friends or just
small group of people but when I went to
Europe this past summer with my family
we had 14 people and we had children
like three kids with us so my aunt
really didn't want to take public
transportation so what we do is we
rented airport shuttles to pick us up at
the airport to take us and our luggages
to our air B&amp;amp;B so it's really up to you
what you're comfortable with and what
you consider safe for yourself aside
from that initial trip from the airport
to your place of stay after that guy is
all I use is Google Maps and Google Maps
is amazing it basically gets you
everywhere I use it for walking and
metro and what's cool is you can save
like offline maps so if you don't have
internet then you can like look at the
offline map but I probably recommend
having data that's just me like I am a
girl that needs data not just because
it's my job but because I just feel
safer with getting lost like if I have
internet I feel like I won't get lost
sorry that was my computer alright let's
move on to phone data and Internet how
do you have internet when you're on the
go so there are a few options my
personal favorite option now is just to
get a SIM card when I'm traveling so
what I do is at the airport I usually
find like a cell phone station where
they sell a SIM card with data only
plans like a prepaid card that I could
just put into my phone the thing is you
have to have an unlocked phone to be
able to do that so my iPhone is unlocked
and wherever I go I just buy a SIM card
and the price is vary depending on what
country you're visiting the reason I
like this method is because your
internet is the fastest it's the fastest
compared to whether you use pocket Wi-Fi
or your own like cell phone provider
from your home so I used to have
t-mobile in the States t-mobile has like
free international data so I used to
just travel with my t-mobile data and
the thing is it does work but it's like
very very very slow Internet but if
you're on a budget and you don't really
care about having fast internet then you
can check if your cell phone provider
has like international like free data
another option is getting a pop
get Wi-Fi I wish I had one to show you
but it's basically like a little thing
that is portable Wi-Fi that you carry
with you in your bag and it gives you
it's kind of like a personal hotspot so
I've used this in Europe and in Asia and
in my personal experience the Europe one
really sucked it was called pocket Wi-Fi
and it used it in like London France and
Germany and it just was not good but the
ones that I've used in Asia were pretty
fast and decent so two ways you can get
pocket Wi-Fi you can actually rent one
at an airport or train station you
should do your research beforehand on
where where you can rent it specifically
and another option is if you look on
Airbnb you can check listings at like
provide a pocket Wi-Fi so my Tokyo
Airbnb actually gave us a free pocket
Wi-Fi it's funny because I didn't even
like look at the listing details to see
that that was an amenity but I think
yeah mostly if you travel to Asia with
Airbnb a lot of them like provide a
pocket Wi-Fi now so you might not even
have to like get a SIM card or rent your
own Wi-Fi like they might provide it for
you so make sure you check that on your
Airbnb lastly depending on where you
travel you might not even need like a
portable Wi-Fi option at all because
Wi-Fi is widely available everywhere so
this is like rare but I mean for
somewhere like Japan there's literally
Wi-Fi in almost every cafe and every
public space there's free Wi-Fi so you
can actually get around pretty easily
without having a SIM card or pocket
Wi-Fi you can just use Wi-Fi wherever
your ads maybe look up the directions to
the next spots save it and then work
like that as you go in the end it just
depends on your priorities what is
important to you what you need what do
you not need what your budget is and
decide what's the best option for you
all right I hope this video was helpful
and I hope you learned something new
today let me know if you have other
questions related to travel down below
and I'll do my best to answer them and
if you have any tips on how I can
improve my travel game like maybe you
know something that I don't definitely
let me know in the comments below I'm
always learning new things from you guys
like in the last video I learned about
Google flights I never really use Google
flights but maybe I should start using
that now I feel like the comments
section is like a crowdsourcing
information and honestly there's power
in numbers like we are smarter as a
group one person can only know so much
but as a group we know so much more all
right love you all so much have a great
day and have safe travels bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
