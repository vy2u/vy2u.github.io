restore your body's natural healing
power this is actually based on the
solar body by ill chili I'm going to be
doing a giveaway for this book so if
you're interested you can stick around
to the end of the video so what does
natural healing power mean well Nature
has a way of keeping balance and
promoting health naturally animals
plants trees don't have to go to the
doctor but they can still heal
themselves our bodies are actually very
amazing at keeping us alive it's doing a
billion things at once and we're not
even thinking about it so when our
bodies are in perfect balance
it has a natural healing power and this
has to do with a part of your nervous
system called the autonomic nervous
system there's two parts to it think of
it as two friends who are very different
but they work together in a balance so
what is the sympathetic nervous system
and the other is the parasympathetic
nervous system your sympathetic nervous
system protects your body from danger
and it helps you survive so this is
known as your fight-or-flight side and
the parasympathetic nervous system is
known as the rest and digest side of
your body where you're calm and your
body could protect yourself from disease
our body's needs both of these parts to
work in balance in order to survive so
one is for short bursts of energy to
protect you from danger so you can fight
an animal or run away or something like
that and the other is to protect
yourself from disease so it's more of
the slower size that promotes the health
in your digestive system and everything
else the problem with people today is
that we are living in a world of
constant stress and stress is the
activator for the sympathetic nervous
system so when we're stressed our body
thinks it's in danger and so it does all
of these things our heart rate increases
and blood pumps out of our digestive
system and into our muscles so we're
ready to fight
and we're basically creating these
symptoms that are great for temporary
bursts of you know running or fighting
to escape danger but if you're stressed
over the long term then you're creating
conditions for heart disease diabetes
and plenty of other illnesses basically
if you're stressed all the time you're
creating these crazy things that are
happening in your body and you're not
giving your body the chance to turn on
its healing mode and heal itself
naturally so you're healing mode is
turned on when you are calm and relaxed
and your parasympathetic nervous system
is in dominance because when that side
is turned on that's when your body's
like oh I'm not in danger I can chill I
can regulate this function and that
function I could promote balance and
healing in this body so according to the
solar body there are three steps that
you can do to restore your body's
natural healing power the first step is
to feel your body heat so the author
talks about the optimal balance of body
heat is to keep your head cool and your
lower abdomen warm heat is energy and
energy is good for the body so you want
to make sure your body is warm enough
inside because with that energy your
body has the power to restore itself and
heal itself the author also says that
you should raise your body temperature
at least once a day to make sure you
have enough heat and energy in you so
you can do this by going out and getting
some sunlight for five minutes a day in
the book you present some sunlight
meditations but really you can just go
out and get some Sun but don't go out
when the Sun is too strong between 11
a.m. and 1 p.m. so when you're out in
the Sun just feel your body get warmed
up by the energy from the Sun and you'll
be good to go another way to raise your
body temperature is to exercise because
when you exercise your body temperature
goes up and all of that is generating
energy and it's all healthy and great
for your body
number 2 control your breathing so
practice breathing deep and slow and
breathe into your diaphragm so that your
belly expands and not your chest when
you're breathing into your chest
your breath is more shallow and you're
not getting enough air into your body so
you really want to breathe into your
diaphragm and push your belly out when
you breathe and hopefully you could
train yourself so that that is the
natural way that you breathe
so you can practice this by laying down
and breathing slowly putting your hands
on your belly and feeling it go up and
down so when you're breathing deep and
slow you're indirectly affecting your
pulse your blood pressure and your body
temperature so breathing is a way to
indirectly affect all of these other
functions in our body that restore our
healing power
you also notice that when you control
your breathing your thoughts and
emotions just fade away and it's
probably impossible to stay angry when
you're breathing very very slowly just
because the breath regulates your body
and a restores balance the final step is
to observe with your mind this basically
means to practice meditating and also to
practice observing your thoughts and
emotions so that you don't let them
control and overwhelm you the author
talks about how powerful your mind is in
generating energy so when you're
observing your body temperature your
body heat will actually go up and when
you're observing your breathing your
breathing will automatically seep in and
slow down so all of these three things
work together and when you're doing all
of them then your body will naturally
restore its healing power and be in
balance again a fun exercise you can do
is to sit meditate and focus your mind
on one of your palms so focus on it for
a few minutes and then after that you
can feel your palm and you'll notice
that that palm is warmer than the other
palm and this is because when your mind
is focused on an area you're driving
energy and blood to that area and it's
just really interesting how powerful
your mind is you can control your body
with your mind if you really focus and
observe
I hope these three steps help you guys

restore your natural healing power if
