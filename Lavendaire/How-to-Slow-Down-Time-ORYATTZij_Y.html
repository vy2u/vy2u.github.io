today I'm going to talk about how to
smooth down well I hear a lot of people
say things like time flies and where did
all the time go and I'm guilty of saying
things like that too because it happens
to all of us we let time slip away too
easily sometimes and we are just like
where is it all that time go every time
I catch myself talking about time with
my friends I always like to slip in this
scientific fact that I read about
a couple years ago so I thought I might
as well share it with all of you guys so
that more people know this basically
time is something that we perceive with
our brains and our brains are constantly
processing this information around us
it's processing the things that we see
things we hear smell touch and the
general idea is that our brain takes
longer to process new things so when
you're constantly doing the same things
every day and your brain is very
familiar with what is around you then
your brain processes that information
more quickly because it's like okay I
know this I got this and it's kind of
like your brain is on autopilot and
you're not aware of the moment when your
brain processes things faster it kind of
skims over the details because you've
seen the same things over and over or
you've experienced the same things in
the past but when your brain is
experiencing something new then it's
like whoa and it takes longer to process
this new information and it also
processes more detail in that new
experience just because it
kind of confused and it kind of wants to
understand what's happening so in
hindsight those new experiences feel
like more memorable and it feels like
the time spent in that moment was longer
just because your brain was processing
it's slower and in more detail this is
definitely why time feels like it's
going faster as you get older because
when you're younger everything around
you is a new experience and you
encounter a lot of new things quite
often so your brain is like whoa and it
has so many new things to process and
time just felt like it was slower when
you were younger and as you grow older
you become more familiar with the things
that surround us and and it kind of
makes it feel like time goes faster so
knowing this if you want to savor your
time and make it feel like it's going
slower then all you have to do is
surprise your brain with new information
constantly you can do this by learning
new things going to new places just
trying new activities meeting new people
or just being spontaneous there are lots
of ways to just step out of our comfort
zone and do something new or introduce
new things to our brain I think it's
very important to know that because we
want to savor our time and we don't want
to take time for granted we don't want
to waste it we are the youngest we will
ever be at this very moment and knowing
that you know it's kind of you don't
want to take it for granted and you want
to enjoy your life so I hope this has
inspired you to go out and throw more
curveballs at your brain through that
your days will feel longer and your life
will be more interesting and more
memorable if you have any comments leave
them down below I'd love to hear them
also let me know if you have any topics
you'd like me to cover or any questions
you want me to answer and I will see you
guys soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
