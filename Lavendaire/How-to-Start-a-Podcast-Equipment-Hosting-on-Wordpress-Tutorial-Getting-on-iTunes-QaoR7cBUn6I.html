going to talk about how to start a
podcast going from the beginning to the
end
from like recording its editing it and
then getting it hosted online where it
could be picked up by iTunes and Google
Play as well as posted on soundcloud so
if you don't know already I have a
podcast called the lavender lifestyle
that's out now on itunes google play
SoundCloud and if you haven't heard it
go out and listen to it right now
alright so this video is part of my Q&amp;amp;A
series for content creators so if you
haven't watched it already I have a
video on advice that I have for creators
starting out whether you're in YouTube
blogging or podcasting and another video
on a more technical side of like my
filming setup for YouTube so I'll post
links to those videos below so I'm going
to break this video down into two parts
the first part is creating your podcast
recording and editing the podcast the
content itself and the second part is
hosting your podcast online so it could
be on iTunes Google Play SoundCloud etc
the things you'll need to create your
podcast are a mic headphones a quiet
space to record and most times a da W
which is a digital audio workstation
where you edit your audio and if you
want to do interviews online then
probably a software like Google Hangouts
Skype or Zen caster first let's start
with the mic so I'm going to show you
what I use to record my podcast but then
I'll give you a ton of other suggestions
for mics that you can use as well so a
little background information I used to
I mean I still do I still record music
so my background is in like recording
singing and producing music so I already
knew like the technical skills for audio
and the mic that I use for my podcast is
the same mic that I use for my singing
so that's why the Mike that I have is
not necessary for someone who just wants
to do podcasts so I have
rode nt1 condenser mic and i have a
scarlet solo interface so my mic is an
XLR mic so that it has to go through an
interface in order to plug into my
laptop so if you aren't in music it
really isn't necessary to get that kind
of mic there are so many great condenser
USB mics out there which means mics that
you could just plug in directly to your
laptop through USB so if I were starting
out as a podcast on mics I would
recommend that our USB condenser mics
are the blue snowball the blue Yeti as
well as some audio technical ones or
depending on what kind of podcast you're
doing I would consider getting a
portable recorder so if you're thinking
of doing a podcast where you're going to
go out and interview people or get like
environment sounds or that kind of thing
then definitely get a portable recorder
I would probably get like a zoom h1 or
zoom h4n those are really popular and
honestly if you're starting out and you
have no budget you could totally just
use your phone
if you have an iPhone there's like a
voice memos app that you can use to
record yourself or other people just get
started with any mic that you can get
some practice just doing the podcast and
maybe you can upgrade later on next
you're going to need some headphones
while you're recording your podcast so
honestly any headphones or earphones
will do because all you need to do is
like separate the audio that's coming
out of the computer you don't want that
feedback coming out from your speaker
back into the mic so to prevent that
feedback just like either put it on mute
or have some earphones on as you're like
recording your podcast and of course
it's so important to have clear audio so
you want to make sure that you're
recording in a very quiet space usually
closets are really popular because
they're small and there are clothes to
kind of muffle the sound so you have to
use your ear and test the sound of that
room you can hear like an echo like even
in this room right now I know there's an
echo so this would not be a good room to
record a podcast in but if you walk into
like a big room you'll notice there's
more echo if you walk into a smaller
room like a closet you'll notice that
the sound is more muffled and also like
the more furniture you have or whether
if you have carpets or a rug then the
sound will be more muffled it's all like
you know that you're trying to stop the
sound waves from bouncing around so that
your audio into the mic is as clear as
possible so if you want to reduce the
echo in a room you could do things like
hang blankets on the walls or put up
pillows or you could get some like
acoustic panels that's what
professionals use so like put all over
the walls in those recording booths so
that sound doesn't bounce around so I
guess now I can take you into my studio
so you can see how I like put up things
to muffle the room alright so this is
like my little walk-in closet that I've
transformed into my studio here is my
mic and behind my mic I have this big
pillow to block the wall and I've hung
some clothes up here just to muffle the
sound a little bit and in that corner I
just have like guitar cases and here's
the carpet this all like muffles the
sound so this is where I record my
podcast that's my interface I run it in
logic and before I had to set up I
really just put my mic in front of my
clothes in my closet so always have like
soft stuff in the back all right next up
you need a da W which stands for digital
audio workstation and that's just a
fancy word for a program on your
computer where you can record and edit
your audio I use Logic Pro because
that's what I use to record my singing
and it's easy for me but you can use any
DW out there so if you have a Mac you
can use GarageBand which is free and if
you have Windows I heard audacity is a
free software that you can use to record
audio so what you do is just plug in
your mic to your computer open the da W
software make sure that it's reading
your mic sometimes you have to change it
in the Preferences or the settings and
then you hit record record your podcast
hit stop and once you're done you can
edit in that software so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys how
to do that
and GarageBand alright so now I'm going
to open GarageBand so what I would do is
you could do voice let's do voice so
here GarageBand gives you a ton of like
vocal settings that are pre eq'd EQ just
means like what they want to enhance or
lessen in your voice just feel free to
play with these I would just go with
narration vocal so I would just delete
these other ones and make sure that your
mic is plugged in you go to a file
preferences audio so input an output
right now it's under system so mine is
called the Scarlett solo USB so I would
do scarlett solo so so now I've set
these to my condenser mic make sure you
just set it to whatever USB mic that
you're using then you close it and you
press record so as you see I recorded my
audio and to stop the recording you just
press stop
and from there you can edit this to your
liking so after you are done recording
your podcast you can export it to an mp3
file so you can do that in many ways
here you can share your song to iTunes
airdrop mail song to SoundCloud even
let's put export song to disk so here
you can choose what type of audio file I
would probably just choose mp3 and name
it podcast one save it on to wherever
you want I will put it in my desktop or
my podcast folder export an exception to
recording straight into your DW software
is if you want to do an interview with
someone online through Google Hangouts
or Skype you can actually just record
your Google Hangouts from there I'm sure
you guys can figure that out with Skype
I heard you have to like download
external plugins to record that call and
there
also a new website that I just
discovered like this week called Zen
caster and that looks like a really
simple interface where you can invite
your guests to go on that page with you
together and through that website you
can hit record and once you're done
doing the podcast it will like send that
mp3 file to your Dropbox so there are
ways to record your audio online without
using a DA W so it just depends what
kind of podcast you're doing what you're
going for and whether you really want to
edit your podcast a lot or have it raw
alright now that you're done recording
and editing your podcast
it's time to get it online now I'm
pretty sure there are other ways that
you can do this but I'm going to share
you the way that I know how which is
through a wordpress blog so if you don't
have a wordpress blog I know that you
can host your podcast on podcast hosting
sites
I think the popular ones are libsyn and
blueberry and feel free to do your
research on other ways you can post your
podcast but if you have a wordpress blog
then great news I know how to teach you
how to do that so if you have a
wordpress blog all you need to do is
download a plug-in called blueberry
power press and now I'm just going to
take you on a laptop cuz easier to show
you there alright Here I am in my
WordPress dashboard
so if you're in your WordPress what you
do is you go to plugins add new then
search blueberry power press and this is
the plug-in right here I already have it
installed so make sure you install it
once you have it installed on your left
side you should have this power press so
once you're in power press here you can
fill out all your settings for your
podcast is fill in your descriptions
everything according to what your
podcast is going to be about so under
Advanced Options make sure you click
category podcasting and then Save
Changes and to add your first podcast
what you do is you go to new host and
it's kind of like you are adding
a blogpost what you do is you just write
your podcast title here and then you do
your podcast description here and here
this is where you put your URL to the
mp3 audio of your podcast so depending
on where you host it I like to host my
directly in WordPress so what I do is I
host my audio on WordPress and this link
is right here I would copy that link and
then post it here but if you host your
podcast audio on Dropbox Amazon whatever
just grab that link from wherever you're
hosting it and put it right here click
verify URL to make sure that the link
works if it's verified successful leave
and great all you have to do next is
under categories make sure you check
podcast and do whatever else you need to
do add your tags add your descriptions
your blog post but basically that's all
you need to do you click publish and
then your first podcast is posted on
your blog but then you have to submit it
to iTunes and Google Play
so once you've posted your first podcast
and it's up on your blog to submit it to
iTunes you go back into power press and
then you click this link that says
publish a podcast on iTunes so you click
that and you have to copy this feed link
this is my feed link but yours will
probably be your website comm slash feed
slash podcast so here on this page it
will show you what your feed link is and
you have to meet these requirements
before you submit it to iTunes and
basically everything else is just follow
the instructions to submit it once you
have it submitted you'll have to wait a
couple days before they email you back
to let you know whether your podcast is
accepted and if it is that
congratulations your podcast will be on
iTunes also if you want to submit your
podcast to Google Play what you do is in
power press settings you switch to
Advanced Mode and then here you'll see
more options
you'll click google play and then you
click this link publish a podcast and
you basically follow the same rules to
submit to Google Play podcasts it's
really important to note that you have
to post your first podcast blog post
before you submit to iTunes and Google
Play you have to have one podcast audio
up and then you can like fill out the
submission forms and stuff and then the
submission process takes a few days
once your podcast is accepted they'll
send you an email and then from then on
you just have to post your podcast as
usual check that catagory podcast and it
will feed automatically into iTunes and
Google Play and there's not much else
you have to do on your part another
platform that's really easy to post on
is SoundCloud so with SoundCloud all you
have to do is create an account and then
upload your audio one by one you could
sort your podcast audios into a playlist
which is what I did and yeah it's really
convenient alright that's it for my
video on how to start a podcast if you
have any questions feel free to leave
them in the comments below make sure to
check out my podcast the lavender
lifestyle on itunes google play and
soundcloud and if you like it

lot in terms of like ranking and how
well it does so I really appreciate that
alright thank you guys so much for
