to talk about how to stop caring about
what others think of you so this is an
issue that holds a lot of us back it's
only natural as human beings that we
care about what other people think about
us
because we're worried about whether
people will judge us where the people
will like us or not we seek approval
from others and we like to please people
and in general we just don't want to be
the weird one out we kind of want to fit
in and be cool or be normal but the
reality is when you let that anxiety and
that worrying about what other people
think of you when you let that affect
you then it really holds you back from
being yourself and doing what you want
to do so how do you stop caring about
what other people think of you well
number one learn not to take anything
personally I learned this from the book
The Four Agreements
the point is that if you don't take
anything personally then you are immune
and nothing and nobody can hurt you
the reasoning behind that is the idea
that people are mirrors everything that
people say or do our reflection of
themselves and it really has nothing to
do with you
basically you are just a canvas for
people to project their beliefs their
perspectives and their thoughts on and
whether you internalize that or not it
really doesn't matter to those people
it's just what people do the awesome
thing is that you have the power to
choose whether you want to accept that
projection or not you have to realize
that you are in control of your own
opinions beliefs perspectives and you
don't have to let other people affect
you in that way if you love yourself and
you're confident enough then eventually
you will learn to become more immune to
what other people say or think about you
because in the end it really doesn't
matter all that matters is what you
think of yourself
which brings me to number two love
yourself you have to first and foremost
love embrace who you are and be super
confident in that because you don't need
other people to tell you what you're
worth you should already know how
wonderful and awesome you are it should
come from within and that inner
confidence is what shines and it's what
kind of makes a statement once you get
that confidence then whatever people say
it really doesn't matter because you
love yourself enough to not let yourself
be hurt or affected by what other people
say okay number three is to stop being
paranoid stop being paranoid we think
that we're so important that people are
always thinking about us and talking
about us when in reality most of the
times other people are too busy worrying
about themselves and their own life to
even let you cross their mind and
sometimes they're even worried about
what you're thinking about them you're
worried about what they're saying about
you and there's this whole unnecessary
anxiety and worrying that just is dumb
so stop being paranoid number four don't
waste your time and energy trying to
explain yourself to others people
already have an idea of what they want
to believe and so they only hear what
they want to hear and everything else is
subconsciously filtered out so it's a
waste of time and energy to try to
convert one person one person's thought
about you when you already have a set of
people who love and accept you for who
you are just be yourself have confidence
and you'll realize that the people who
care about you they don't need an
explanation it's like that quote be who
you are and say what you feel because
those who mind don't matter and those
who matter don't
mind so just do you be confident stop
caring about what other people think or
just try to care less and go on with
your day be yourself and fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
