it's Eileen today's video is on how to
beat procrastination and get your work
done so before I begin make sure you're
subscribed and you click that bell to
get notified of all my new videos so
first off if you want to learn how to
beat procrastination you have to see it
for what it is resistance so resistance
is something that Steven Pressfield
talks about in the book the war of art
and it basically is a word that means
the thing that keeps you from doing your
work there's always this resistance that
you want to get this work done but for
some reason you avoid it at all costs
for some reason you find yourself
deciding to do something else checking
Instagram checking Facebook eating
something out of your fridge and that is
because that work is so important that
you're scared to do it so whether it's
like an important school project or a
personal project that means a lot to you
you're probably gonna feel some
resistance there that causes you to
procrastinate for example I feel
resistance when I have to tackle like a
big long-term project like my artist of
life workbook so my workbook is like
something that I've been thinking about
the entire year I've known that I had to
redesign it but it just took me so long
to like sit down and be able to focus so
many times I tried to sit down and then
I'd get distracted or I would
procrastinate but these couple weeks I
really had to like lock myself down and
finish it because I set this due date
for myself and I was like no I must get
it done by this time so there are some
pretty good techniques that helped me
buckle down and get my work done and I'm
gonna share them today the short and
easy answer to beating procrastination
is to take action and I know that's like
super simple and you're like duh but
it's incredibly difficult to take action
so how do we do it my best advice on how
to get yourself started on taking action
is to look at what you have to do and
ask yourself what is the smallest
easiest
next step that I can take towards this
goal so make it like so easy so simple
that it takes one second to do it break
it down as small as you can so for
example if your big project is to write
like a huge research paper then maybe
that easy small step is to open up your
word document or type the date type your
name type that first word like really
break it down into like the easiest
easiest task ever and start there once
you've like opened the tab once you've
written your word ask yourself that same
question again okay now what is the next
easiest step that I could take towards
this goal so you'll find that once
you've taken like a baby step you can
take the next baby step in the next one
and the next one and if you keep doing
that you'll build momentum and then
you're gonna find yourself in flow and
you're gonna be working on the thing
that you've been procrastinating on so I
do realize that it can be pretty painful
and difficult to take action even if
it's just baby steps so another strategy
that's helped me is to set like a time
deadline for myself meaning like I'll
tell myself I'll only work on this
project for the next 30 minutes or the
next hour and I'll just look at the time
if it's like 8 o'clock ok I'll be like 9
o'clock I'm done just do my best take
the baby steps and work on this but you
know do it for an hour and by the time
it's nine like I can let myself go so
setting that time gives me like a space
to work in and usually what happens is
when I get to the end of my time I have
built the momentum by taking those baby
steps and I'm like in flow so I usually
want to keep working and that's
something that is really really useful
so if you don't feel like working on
your project just give yourself like a
baby amount of time like I'm only gonna
work on this for 15 minutes or 30
minutes and if that's all you can do
then then that's it you know that's
great but usually most likely you're
probably gonna want to continue working
longer so the goal here is to be able to
reach your flow States your flow state
is that states where you are super
focused super in the zone
and you are like working at your yeah
optimal capacity I don't know if you've
ever had that feeling where you're just
like so 100% in your work you have
momentum you're on a roll and things are
going great so that is the goal it's
what some people call deep work and that
is like a state of intense focus that is
really really productive so that's the
goal of where you want to be when you're
trying to beat procrastination is I know
you're feeling the resistance first be
aware that it is procrastination and it
is resistance and then you can take like
the next small baby steps and set that
time deadlines for yourself so that
eventually you're gonna feel the
momentum and you're gonna put yourself
in flow State so some other strategies
to help yourself get into flow and get
work done is using music to set the mood
so my favorite favorite playlist to work
to are on Spotify one of them is called
deep focus the other one is called piano
in the background so I really like deep
focus that's like intense atmospheric
not necessarily intense sometimes it's
like calming but it just really puts me
in the zone and then piano in the
background is because I love piano
that's more softer so I'll listen to
that when I'm like designing or doing
something more like free-flowing but
when I want to like get work done like
writing and stuff then I'll play deep
focus feel free to set the mood in your
space with whatever works for you maybe
you want to light a candle maybe you
want to clean up your desk so you have
like a clear working space ask yourself
like what is your ideal space to work
and create that so that you have
everything that you need in order to get
stuff done an app that I love to help me
get to work and focus is called forest
so forest is an app that is based on the
idea of planting like a digital tree so
when you set the timer for say like 25
minutes to work you start planting that
tree and basically if you leave the app
to check anything else on your phone
your tree starts to die and so you don't
want to kill your tree so it kind of
like motivates you to not check
Instagram not check
so that for those 25 minutes you are
working and what's really cool about
forests is that I think after you
collect some coins it actually plants
real trees in real life so I really like
that environmental aspect of it the last
strategies you can try is to journal
and/or meditate before you get to work
so sometimes we can't focus on our work
because our mind is so distracted we're
thinking about a million things at once
so sometimes it's helped me to like sit
down and journal for like two or three
pages before I get to work usually in my
journal I write down all the things that
are on my mind get them out of my mind
and onto paper and then I usually like
start giving myself a pep talk to
prepare myself to get in the mindset to
work so I will literally like visualize
like okay Eileen you're gonna do this
and you're gonna work and you're gonna
finish this today and you're gonna do
this so I'm like my own motivator in my
journal and doing that really helps set
the intention for getting to work and
being productive another thing is you
can meditate before you get to work it
has a similar effect where you clear
your mind you calm yourself and you can
also set your intentions during
meditation to focus on whatever you want
to focus on so either journaling and/or
meditation you could do both or you
could choose one or the other but I
think both are really great to like
prime yourself to start being productive
and get to work alright those are my
tips on how to beat procrastination I
hope it helped you let me know if you
have any tips of your own that I missed
post them in the comments below so I can
learn from you as well because I always
need help on how to beat resistance
because I think it's always gonna be
there whenever there's an important
project that means a lot to you like
there's always gonna be resistance
that's natural we're human so we are all
a work in progress alright make sure to
