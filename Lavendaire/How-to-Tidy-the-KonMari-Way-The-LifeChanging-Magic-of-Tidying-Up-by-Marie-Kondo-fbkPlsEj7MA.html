called the life-changing magic of
tidying up by Mari a condo and this book
changed my life I loved it so much I
read through it in three days and today
I just knew I had to share the method of
tidying of your life by mari a condo so
Mari a condo is a professional
organizing consultants from Japan and
she's written this book that has become
wildly popular in Asia and recently this
past fall she released the English
version to the US and since then I've
seen it blow up on countless blogs and
magazines and just everybody is talking
about the con Mari method as you guys
know I'm a big fan of minimalism I
believe that a clear space equals a
clear mind and so once I heard about
this book I knew I absolutely had to
check it out what I love about Kondos
method is that she says that you only
have to tidy your house once and then
you never have to do it again which is a
huge difference from the common belief
that you had to declutter a little bit
every day but actually Mario Kondo
believes that you should tidy and
declutter in one dramatic shot so that
it creates a dramatic change in your
environment which will create a dramatic
change in your life with the con Mari
method you can seriously reset your life
and start fresh and on top of that Mario
Kondo claims that none of her clients
have regressed into being messy people
which is very very impressive so without
further ado here is how to tidy with the
Convery method first things first start
by discarding we have a lot of stuff
that we don't need and so the first step
is to just recognize the things that we
have that aren't serving us anymore so
Kondo says this should be a fun event
and you should dress up for the occasion
as if you're sending your things off
with a goodbye party
so I treated it as a celebration and I
wore a dress to clean up
rather than being sloppy in PJs the main
idea is that you have to hold each item
in your hand and ask yourself does this
spark joy if it makes you happy keep it
if it doesn't spark any joy then put it
in the discard pile make sure that you
hold the item in your hand because she
says that your body will react to an
item when you touch it rather than when
you just look at it also she recommends
that you not listen to music while
you're deciding what sparks joy to you
or not because music can interfere with
that intuition and you really want to
listen to your heart your body and what
you are telling yourself about this
lastly don't even think about organizing
or putting your things away until you
have completely finished discarding
everything from a specific category so
don't just start organizing as you're
discarding make sure you have everything
at once discard and then deal with the
rest later tidy by category not location
and lay it all out gather everything you
own from a single category and lay it
all out on the floor for example if
you're tidying books you have to remove
all of the books off of the bookshelf
and onto the floor it's very tedious but
it's a must and Kondo says you have to
do that because when you take things off
of the shelf or the closet and put it
onto the floor you are waking an item up
because it's been dormant for so long
and you've probably grown accustomed to
ignoring it while it's on the shelf so
it looks like nothing to you but once
you take it off and you put it on the
floor
you kind of reactivate it so when the
item is awake you can decide then
whether it still sparks joy or not so
Kondo has a very specific order of
categories that you're supposed to tidy
in and it goes like this
first close then books papers
miscellaneous and then mementos so
within clothes and miscellaneous there's
an order of subcategories that you
should tidy by Bay
Stickley there's a purpose for this
order and it's because clothes are the
easiest to say goodbye to wear as you go
down the line mementos are the hardest
to let go of so Kondo says you have to
start with clothes so that you kind of
train your intuition and by the time you
hit all the categories and you get to
mementos it's easier for you to realize
what sparks joy in you and what doesn't
I've compiled all of these categories
into a tidying checklist that you guys
can download and follow as you go you
can find that on my blog the link is in
the description below as you discard
your things thank them and bid them
farewell konso really talks about things
as if they are alive and she says that
each thing that you have has helped you
supported you or served a purpose in
your life in some way
so whether address used to make you feel
beautiful or a pair of pants taught you
what did it look good on you you should
appreciate your things thank them for
what they've done for you in your life
and then let them go finally once you
finish discarding your things you can
start organizing and putting things away
Kondo says that each item needs a home
so it can rest after a long day so when
you designate a space for each item all
you have to do at the end of the day is
to return it to its rightful home and
let it rest while you rest this really
keeps your home from being cluttered
after you do your big tidy when I read
to this point I realized that I had
never designated a space for my purse I
would just come home and throw it on the
table or a chair until I needed it the
next time so now I've designated a spot
for my purse in my closet and I realized
that my house is more clear because I
don't throw things everywhere I really
put them back in their rightful home
that's it I hope you guys like this
video and that it inspired you to tidy
up your life as I mentioned I made a
downloadable cheat sheet and checklist
that you guys can find in the
description below so far in my
journey I tidied clothes and it took me
two weeks to tidy all the sub categories
from tops to pants to every accessories
and shoes and everything and that was
already a journey I'm still going to
keep going and move on to books and
miscellaneous and the rest but in the
meantime I'm going to be making more
videos on specific tips on how to tidy
your closet and how to fold clothes so
be on the lookout for those videos next
make sure you subscribe I post videos
every Wednesday good luck with your
journey and becoming more minimal with
your life happy tidying bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
