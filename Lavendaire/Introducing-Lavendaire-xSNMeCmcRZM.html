lavender lavender is going to be my
special space on the Internet where I
get to share my journey everything I
learn and just everything that has to do
with growing as a person and as an
artist the premise of lavender is the
idea that we can all be artists of life
meaning we can create shape and design
ourselves and our lives in the way that
we've always imagined I strongly believe
that no matter who you are or what you
start with that you can always become
the person that you want to be and live
the life that you've always wanted for
yourself it's just a matter of finding
yourself embracing yourself your talents
and your skills and then deciding where
you want to go and everything in between
is the journey in learning growing
experiencing and just living life and
the journey is where I'm most interested
in because you could be so creative with
your life and take it wherever you want
and I think that's super exciting so
this vlog will follow my life my journey
and honing this craft of being an artist
of life and I'd also love to hear about
what you guys are going through and what
your thoughts and what your revelations
are and just learn and grow together in
a supportive encouraging community the
more people who are passionate inspired
fearless and just ready to get what they
want out of life those are the people
that I want to surround myself with and
hopefully you guys can connect with that
and we can build something together and
just be awesome people in the world so
if this is something that it's getting
you really excited and you're very
interested in then please do stick
around subscribe to my channel leave a
comment below or even feel free to email
me because
I love to connect with people also feel
free to check out my new website
