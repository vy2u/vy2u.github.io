already time for January favorites I
hope you guys have had a wonderful first
month of your 2016 I hope it was
productive and that you got yourself off
to a great start so this month I have a
mix of products and resources that I'm
gonna share from my favorites and I'm
just gonna jump into it my first
favorite is a crystal glass nail file
that I got off Amazon I don't know why I
waited this long to invest in a good
glass nail file since I feel like now
after using it it should be a staple and
everyone's beauty kit it's just so much
better it's higher quality the glass
doesn't get dull so you can use it
forever basically and it's more
economical and more it's more
environmentally friendly I think since
you don't have to keep throwing away
those disposable nail files I especially
like the color and quality of this glass
file and also that it comes in a very
cute case so you could take it to go my
next favorite is the gel nail beginners
kit by madam glam so this comes with a
lamp base coats top coat and the color
of your choice for gel nails previously
I've done gel nails at the salon and I
love having gel nails because they just
last so long and I'm a lazy person I
don't have time to do my nails every
week or I don't want to make the time to
do my nails every week so I like to do
it once and not think about it for
another three to four weeks even though
they're not as good for your nail and
the process to take them off is just
more difficult than normal nail polish I
think it's worth it for me so now with
this kits I'm learning to do gel nails
by myself at home without having to go
to the salon each time my next favorite
are actually two videos on Lauren
singers zero-waste lifestyle one is on
MSNBC and the other one is her TED talk
so if you guys haven't heard of Lauren
singer she's someone who lives a
zero-waste lifestyle where she does not
produce any trash the trash that she
produced in the past two years could fit
in a single mason jar this big so the
first MSNBC video really introduces you
to her lifestyle how she goes about her
day and how she kind of makes these
changes to her lifestyle to produce no
trash at all and her
cat talk is more of her personal take on
why she does this and how she's you know
trying to help the environment and our
world through zero waste I just thought
it was so interesting to see her
lifestyle and to see that it's so
possible to live with less trash less
plastic waste and it really inspired me
to kind of look at how much trash I
produce in my lifestyle and now that I'm
more aware of this kind of lifestyle and
this concept it makes me like a little
bit uncomfortable to see how much you
know disposable utensils we use or just
you know all of this plastic that is
around us that is not great for our
environment so I'm not saying that I'm
trying to go completely zero waste or
that you should do that but I just think
it's really interesting to know that
some people can do that in the lifestyle
and it's possible so everybody can do a
little bit of something you can always
improve and this is just you know
another concept that I think it's really
important to open your eyes to earlier
this month I told you guys how I'm
trying to be more consistent this year
and one of the things I want to get
consistent on is exercising every day so
I found that it is hard to make myself
go to the gym every day and get a full
workout but I've started to kind of find
really short workouts or easy little
things that I could do every day you
know just to say that I try to exercise
at least a little bit a day so one is
I've really enjoyed watching workout
videos online my favorite one is Rachel
Aust ABS circuits so I will do that ab
circuit at home and there are tons of
workout videos on YouTube that you can
do at home you know Blogilates is really
great as well
another website that I found was seven
minutes so that is a website where you
just click seven minutes calm and then
it will like time you and give you like
workouts to do each minute that are
really easy like jumping jacks and
push-ups and this and that everybody has
an extra seven minutes in their day
to put in a workout so I feel like
there's no excuse to not work out so you
just have to give it as much as you got
or even as little as you got my next
favourites are in music so one song that
I have been playing over and over again
and singing over and over again is Sara
Bareilles she used to be mine if you
guys are Sara Bareilles fan then you
guys should definitely listen to this
song she actually has been off the radar
for a while and now I know why it's
because she was writing these songs for
a musical called waitress so this song
is off her Broadway musical waitress and
it's just a beautiful song it's a
beautiful song to listen to the lyrics
are great and they really tell a story
and it's just fun to sing so that's just
something that I've been loving this
month another artist that I've been
enjoying this past month is nao I don't
know if you pronounce that now or nao
but she is just very funky she reminds
me of a Janet Jackson but like a new
version of Janet Jackson very fun very
funky very dancey and I've just been
really digging that this month alright
that's it for my favorites for this
month I do have an announcement to make
I'm going to be speaking at a TEDx event
at the end of February and that is super
scary but very exciting and I've just
I'm kind of nervous right now because I
haven't finalized my speech and I just
need to work on it but I've been
procrastinating so much because this is
so important to me so yeah I'll post the
link below if you guys want to check it
out if you guys live in the area I do
know that it's gonna be a small event
they're capping it at a hundred people
but they will be posting it online so
maybe you guys can watch it there
afterwards if it's good if I don't mess
up or fall on my face I don't know this
is just something that I'm really
excited about because speaking at a TED
event has been a dream since I was in
college and although this is a smaller
TEDx event I think it's basically a TED
talk so I'm excited for that
so wish me luck all right thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
