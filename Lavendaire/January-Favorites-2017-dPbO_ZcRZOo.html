dare today I want to share some of my
favorites from January and as you all
know my favorites are not always
physical things it's a mix of tangible
and intangible things that have brought
me joy so this past month was
interesting because I set all these new
goals for 2017 like I wanted to post two
videos a week
post daily photos on Instagram and start
recording my podcasts early in advance
through all the stuff but at the same
time I wanted to have more space to
breathe in my life and hang out with
friends so it was like a challenge
really trying to balance this new
schedule with still finding time for
myself but there were some cool things
that happen this month for example my
artists of life workbook the print ones
came in super super excited about them I
just want to bring it up so I can show
you how great it looks and how proud I
am about it so those are being shipped
out to everyone who purchased it and if
you'd like to get one yourself the link
is down below alright let's talk about
my favorites so my first favorite of the
month is by far the movie la-la-land if
you follow me on Instagram or anywhere
in social media you've probably heard me
post about in rave about it I just love
this movie so much because first of all
I love musicals I passed favorite movie
with Moulin Rouge so obviously I would
love lala land so I see lala land as
like a mix of like grease the musical
with like fun songs and also like the
notebook with a really great romantic
story but also it has that artists
creative elements on it talking about
the artists struggle and the artists
journey that really hit me in here and
honestly it's just it's a movie for
dreamers and if you haven't seen it I
highly recommend you watch it it's just
so magical
honestly I went to watch it by myself in
the movie theaters is the first movie I
went to see by myself and it was because
it was like a Saturday night my
boyfriend was out of town and I was at
home working on something and I was like
you know what everyone's been talking
about this movie I want to watch it so I
do something I'm going to do it so I
just bought a ticket and I went and I
had so much fun I do not regret going by
myself at all because I got to slowly
like appreciate everything that the
goofy had to offer and just seeing all
the details and the cinematography was
amazing a lot of the shots look like
they were one shot takes and just the
colors it just made LA look more magical
but not entirely fantasy like it just it
was the perfect balance between reality
and fantasy and it's just magical I love
that movie so much and I've been
obsessed with a soundtrack so the
soundtrack is also my favorite of the
month I've just been listening to that
like on repeat my favorite songs are
probably city of stars and another day
of Sun also I really loved Emma Stone
solo song it's called audition all the
songs is so fun and just the opening
scene of Mulholland is like people
driving in LA traffic and they sing this
like a big fun song and you know since
I've been driving in traffic a few times
this month I play that song it just
makes me so happy to be driving in
traffic in LA because that is something
that is unique and wonderful I know
right like it puts me in such a good
mood that even I will enjoy driving in
traffic my next favorite is a song
called low by trace and trace is like my
current favorite artist right now she's
also from LA I just discovered her on
Spotify so do listen to that song and do
you listen to her I feel like that song
makes me feel like I'm in an indie film
driving and it's kind of like
bittersweet and you're like nostalgic it
just gives you some sort of feeling and
I especially love listening to it when
I'm driving it's just the electric
guitar and the chords it just gives you
that mood and it's so soft and nice I
really love it
I feel like listening to trace and her
music it's almost as if like that's kind
of the music I wish I were to sound like
if I continue to make music you know
like it's totally my style chill driving
music that's that's my style
I also used one of her songs in an
Instagram video that I made about the
storm in LA there was a storm this past
weekend which brings me to my next
favorite which are my new Instagram
videos I think this Instagram in general
is getting more fun because I'm putting
more energy into posting daily and so
many times I've like struggled like oh
my god I have nothing to post and I
think that challenge is a good challenge
it pushes me to figure out how to create
content like if I'm at home what can I
take photos of or what kind of videos
can I create with the footage that I
have and I mean with the videos that I'm
trying to post on Instagram it's what I
call it my life as art series by that I
mean there are so many little moments of
life that are so beautiful and I really
love to capture them I just love to
capture beautiful things and to showcase
that beauty kind of see the beauty and
everything so I think as I'm going about
my life
I always have my camera with me and all
like take photos and video footage as I
go and edit little stories of like
pockets of time pockets of like beauty
here Beauty there I'm just having a lot
of fun being creative with videos on
Instagram just because there's like no
pressure and I'm not doing it for any
purpose you know like I don't have to
think about whether people want to see
this
whether people care because I don't care
I'll make what I want also the thing I
probably love most is the fact that I
can use whatever music I want for
Instagram video so using traces music
just using anything that I'm actually
listening to because the music that I
use on YouTube I always have to
pre-screen make sure it's not licensed
and get artist permission or get it from
like free no copyright music and it's
kind of headache like I really don't
enjoyed that part of finding unlicensed
music for YouTube so just having the
freedom the creative freedom to use
whatever music I want in Instagram
videos and just really to do whatever I
want like just have fun with it I don't
know if you saw like my smoothie party
morning party video on Instagram is so
stupid like I have so much fun editing
that video I've never
laughs so hard to myself while editing a
video I just had an idea and I ran with
it and I just put a lot of stupid stuff
in it and I just it was so much fun
so I'm just really grateful that I have
a new creative outlet where I could just
really be free and just be myself
because I feel like you have to practice
being an artist you can't just stick to
one media and just practice
experimenting and other ways other ways
to express yourself and just see what
else is there you know there's always
more to explore my next favorite is
something that you've probably seen in a
recent video of mine it's this dry brush
dry brushing is something that I started
to try this past month and it's in my
natural detoxing video if you want to
see that but dry brushing if you haven't
heard it's where you like brush your dry
skin before you shower you do it while
you're naked you start from your feet
you work all the way up your body you
always like brush towards your heart but
it's something that like stimulates your
skin so it feels really refreshed it
exfoliates your skin but it also kind of
improves circulation of your lymphatic
system because your lymphatic system is
right you need your skin so getting in
those like cards like literally under
your armpits those are the parts where
you have a lot of lymph nodes and it's
just good to kind of like circulate
things through and feel free to do more
research on dry brushing I'll have some
links in the description but like I just
loved it right now it just makes me feel
so refreshed and feel great my next
favorite is this dry body oil that is a
spray and it's in like a rosy scent it's
marula and argan oil that is very
lightweight so I just spray this all
over my body after a shower and rub it
in it's just so much easier to have oil
in a spray form so you don't have to
like pour it out and be all clean with
it you just spritz and rub and it makes
things really convenient
I found this as I was browsing thrive
market because I was seeing what was
like the most popular Beauty skincare
stuff on that website
my last favorite this month is this
Travel Magazine called Musa trees and
honestly I would not know about this
magazine if it weren't for my friends
Sam
so my friends found gave me a copy and
it's because
he has a company called the judge and
they're in this magazine so yeah but
apart from that it's basically a
magazine based in Malaysia I believe and
it just looks so gorgeous honestly I
think last time I shared in my favorites
something called cereal magazine and I
feel like they have a similar vibe like
a very hip very fresh vibe and the
articles are all about travel so they
feature like Croatia Prague Morocco in
this issue and photos I just really look
at it for eye candy and travel
inspiration because just it's just
gorgeous to look at and it's really nice
to have something like in your hands
physically in your hands instead of
always browsing your computer or your
iPad alright that's it for my favorites
so before I go if you want to announce
that I've decided to create a lavender
Facebook group for all of you guys to
join and encourage and support each
other and just communicate I want to
just create more of a community like
feel so last time I did a monthly
favorites I talked about my artist of
life mastermind which is a Facebook
group for the work Booker's and I have
to make that a secret group because so
many of you guys wanted to join but you
didn't buy a workbook but I wanted to
make that group specifically for work
Booker's so my solution is I'm going to
make a separate Facebook group for
everyone all of my followers to join so
that you can just connect and ask you to
the questions and I'll be interacting in
there as well you know you can give me
video ideas and such another reason I
created this new group is because I have
a podcast where there's not really a
social element to the podcast I feel bad
that when I put up an episode I can't
really see what people think about it
there's no way to really make comments
on iTunes so I'd like to have some sort
of community made for everyone who
follows my youtube and my podcast and
just a way for you guys to connect with
each other because I'm sure you're all
very similar you have similar goals and
ideals and it'd be really fun to get
together in that sense if you'd like to
join the lavender Facebook groups and
definitely click the link in the
description
I will be so excited to see you there
and we can chat more in that group I
also want to give a heads up that
Febuary beam of videos will be self love
and self care so if you have any
questions or any video suggestions you'd
like me to do around those two topics
leave them down below so I do kind of
have broad themes for my content per
month so January was like New Year
refresh theme and I said here a will be
self-love self-care theme March I'm
thinking will be more like organizing
productivity theme and I'm not sure
about the rest of the year we'll play it
by ear
so I don't always have to stick to the
theme but it's good to kind of have a
thing just just to get content ideas so
just so you know that's how I'm going to
go about this year and see how it goes
so yeah send your suggestions down below
I'd love to hear them thank you so much
for watching I love you all so much and
have a beautiful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
