Eileen so this year I'm gonna switch
things up I'm gonna try to do instead of
monthly favorites I want to share like
my monthly highlights lessons and
favorites so let me know your feedback
on this if you liked it don't like it or
if you'd want to like switch things
around let me know but we'll get into it
so January for me was a month of
transformation and change and a lot of
it in my mind I wrote in my journal was
to lay the foundations for a successful
year so obviously the first big news of
this month is I just moved into a new
apartment last week so we haven't
finished decorating this is like a
temporary background I'll figure things
out as we go it's just been a time of
change and I'm looking forward to new
things happening in my life because I
feel like once you've moved your space
your life transforms in general but
going back some other highlights from
January I went to Big Bear with my
family which was a really really nice
weekend to reset to be in nature and
just get closer with my cousins and I
really needed that because I don't know
if you guys know or if I've mentioned it
on this channel but I was super like
stressed and I don't know just in a
frustrated state throughout the entire
workbook selling process so like
December all the way to like mid January
was like really chaotic for me just like
dealing with workbook shipping delays
customer complains a lot of people were
angry I feel like whatever could go
wrong did go wrong like there were
delays from like the manufacturer coming
here during the holidays and then there
was like a really big technical issue
with my website we couldn't hook it up
to the shipping software also the demand
of the workbooks is like way way more
than we expected I basically set like a
goal for the number of workbooks I want
to sell
and we've surpassed that goal by like
double triple maybe and it's just crazy
basically we did our best but it was
pretty overwhelming and I made some
mistakes and I learned from them and I
feel like starting a business is all
about just like doing it messing up and
then figuring out what you did wrong
learning and improving from that and
what I learned this month is like you
can't let negativity you can't let
failure make you want to quit at one
point I just felt so bad getting these
like angry customer emails and I don't
know people putting us down and I just
felt like I just wanted to give up I'm
like why am I even doing this do I have
to and I don't know I think emotionally
I was ready to like shut down but
logically I was like no like I can't
stop now I people want this I'm proud of
what I've created and so I'm gonna
continue delivering it continue working
on it like it just can't make me want to
quit you know basically a lot has gone
on behind the scenes in the past two
months and I feel like I have
transformed and I have grown a lot I
feel like I'm a different person now
than I was in November the last cool
thing that happened this month was I got
the opportunity to host a live workshop
on how to figure out what to do with
your life it was a workshop on the topic
iki guy which I've shared the video is
linked down below if you want to watch
it but it was my first time like doing a
live events like that it was held at
Arcadia Public Library and I got to meet
some of you amazing
what did you guys think I loved it there
was just so much wisdom in this room
like I was pretty surprised at that it's
gonna be like more like a young
demographic but there's just a lot of
like I was surprised too this age was
like a huge range there was like retired
people yeah they were all engaged thank
you so much for those of you who came
out it really meant a lot to me
especially like Brittany who came all
the way from Arizona honestly I was
pretty nervous going into that workshop
but I was listening to an audiobook
which I'll meant to talk about more
later but the audiobook light is the new
black and in the audiobook she was
talking about how like she was nervous
going into like a speaking engagement
and instead what she told herself was
it's not about you it doesn't matter
what you feel like all you have to do is
be the medium of light to share and give
value to these people so just let go and
just do your best and don't worry too
much about what other people think of
you just just trust that you are the
medium and trust that things will unfold
the way that they're meant to unfold and
so that's what I did I went in I didn't
feel completely prepared to do the
workshop but I just did my best and I
just let the words flow out of me it's
kind of weird I just I don't know it
just happened and I think it went well
people seemed like they liked it liked
it and it was really sweet because a lot
of you like stayed after two chats and
we stayed until we had to get a kicked
out so yeah it was pretty fun alright
moving on to my favorites of the month I
have been really really into the books
that I'm reading and listening to this
month so I mentioned light is the new
black I loved that book it's been a
while since I found an audiobook that I
really loved and really connected to and
that was it I really love Rebecca
Campbell it's all about just being the
light and you know my theme this year is
lead with light so I feel like that book
really helped get me in the right state
of mind getting ready for this year it's
just it's really good another book that
I started reading and love is sapiens
mentioned this in my books to read video
but I started reading sapiens I'm about
like I don't know halfway through almost
and it's really good it's really
eye-opening it's fascinating I'm
learning so much about the history of
humankind I'm learning just things that
I wish everyone knew I wish we all knew
about why we do the things we do and the
history of our evolution and just the
way that our modern society is not
natural in terms of what's natural and
healthy for humans and I don't know it's
it's a whole other topic that it would
take too long to get into but I'll just
leave it at that if you're interested in
human beings evolution psychology all of
that just read sapiens next is the audio
book that I am currently listening to
which I also love love love and I think
it's worthy of sharing is the untethered
soul by Michael singer this book is
perfect for those of you who tend to
over think overanalyze those of you who
have a hard time meditating you know
those of you who feel like your thoughts
are always running non-stop and you
can't separate yourself from your
thoughts or if you're very emotional and
it's really hard to separate yourself
from your emotions this is the book to
read or listen to the untethered soul
it's helping me see things from a new
perspective feel more soulful feel more
connected be able to detach from my
emotions from my thoughts and I don't
know I recommended this to my friends
who like tend to overthink and
overanalyze things because I think this
is really really helpful so if you feel
like you have that kind of issue
definitely give this book a try next up
is my favorite song of the moment it's
called she loves control by Camila
Cabello
and honestly this whole album is really
good and this song especially just makes
me want to dance it makes me want to
salsa it makes me feel good it makes me
feel powerful and I feel like it's just
one of those songs that I love to play
in the morning when I'm showering just
when I'm jamming out by myself at home I
don't know sometimes I just want some
feel-good music music that makes me want
to dance and it makes me feel uplifted
and inspired so yeah give it a listen
see if you
my last favorite is a hair product and
it's this one L'Oreal elle vivre I'm not
exactly sure how to pronounce it but
it's amazing it's just a hair mask deep
conditioner to put on your hair and
leave it in while you're in the shower
then rinse it out and honestly my hair
feel so healthy
I just bleached my hair as you can tell
I did it like last week and you know
after you bleach it it feels so like
stringy it feels damaged it's hard to
wash and then after using this hair mask
even once like it felt silky smooth and
I mean this probably has a lot of
chemicals so it's not not like a natural
hair care type of thing but it works I'm
just really impressed at how my hair
feels after using this so I feel like
it's worth sharing for those of you
looking for a really good hair masque on
the flip side another hair masque that I
absolutely love is the IVA NYC hair
masque so I'll link both of those down
below so you can check them out
alright that's my January review for you
guys sharing my highlights lessons and
favorites from the past month let me
know if you liked this video this format
let me know if you'd rather me like
switch things around like do you want to
see favorites first or do you like
seeing my highlights do you even need my
lessons like I don't know let me know
what you want to see I just wanted to
create like a monthly wrap-up type video
where I could sit down and share any
updates on my life with you guys because
I feel like with this channel every
video like I don't really get to share
that much about my life so I just wanted
an opportunity to sit down and chat

all so much and I'll see you next time
bye
