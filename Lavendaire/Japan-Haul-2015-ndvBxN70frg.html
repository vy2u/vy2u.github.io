been online for the past couple of weeks
I'm sorry if you guys have been waiting
for a video but this past month I went
to Japan I was traveling for two and a
half weeks with family which was super
fun and amazing so today I thought I'd
do a Japan haul showing you the things
that I bought in Japan this is not
everything that I bought in Japan
because I had some gifts that I already
gave away I bought a lot of snacks that
I already ate and I'll just show you
what I have so in the souvenir category
my favorite purchase has got to be these
adorable sushi teacups we got these at
this restaurant at Tsukiji fish market
eega fish market is the most famous fish
market in tokyo and it's where you can
get the freshest sushi i love sushi so
much this was one of my favorite meals
in Japan they were selling these teacups
at the sushi restaurants so I just
thought they were so cute and they're
the perfect souvenir so I bought a few
of these for myself and also to give
away as gifts next up are these Pokemon
nano block characters my cousin Donna
went crazy over these I've bought a
bunch and so I bought a few for myself
and also as gifts I already gave out two
but what I have left here is squirtle
for myself because I love squirtle I
love water and Charmander is for my
brother
next up clothes my favorite places to
shop in Tokyo were definitely Shibuya
and Harajuku they're both very trendy
and very fun in their own ways I got
these two hats in Harajuku so a cap and
a beanie getting ready for fall I bought
these socks in Shibuya I love these mesh
socks I already had a white mesh pair
that I wore and another pair of white
grid socks that are in the wash so I'm
really digging the sock fashion in Japan
I also bought this long hooded sweater
that has Tokyo on the front I thought
this was a very cute souvenir actually
my mom like the sweater more than I did
and she really wanted it but it fit me
better than if it her
so she made me buy it she wouldn't let
me leave the store without buying the
sweater so another sweater I bought is
this one it's a high-neck knitted
striped sweater hi neck is so in in
Japan and I feel like it's getting in in
fall in general sooo fun fun stuff
another fashion trend that I noticed was
huge in Japan were these wide leg
cropped pants every girl was wearing
like wide leg pants in every fabric and
cut so I really thought I had to try it
out for myself so I bought this olive
pair I just knew I had to leave Japan
with one pair I really wanted to find a
black one but I didn't get to so this
will do next up I have these chopsticks
that I bought I love chopsticks so
everywhere I go I have to kind of try
out some new flavors my favorite out of
these three is this honey cubed one I
just like the taste of honey so this is
really fun and new my favorite store for
stationery is Muji I am obsessed with
Mooji I use exclusively Muji pens I
don't use anything else because I love
them so much so obviously I was so
excited to find out that there was a
Muji building in Shibuya it's I think
like eight stories of this stuff so
every time I go to Muji I buy some pen
refills because I already have pens that
are running out I just need the ink this
time I picked up some new thin pens
these are 0.25 I think that's
centimeters I'm not sure I also bought
this planner for 2016 for next year I
already have a Muji planner for 2015 so
every time I get a chance to go to a
Muji which is usually when I travel I
buy the planner for next year and by
every time I mean this is just my second
planner this is my second time doing so
but I've decided it's a tradition now
next up I got these pouches at the 100
yen store which is their equivalent of a
dollar store but it's less than a dollar
after you convert it I bought these
larger pouches for
Ling so I could put like underwear and
socks and organize my luggage a little
bit better and these smaller pouches are
great for organizing your bag the
polkadot bag I used to put some spare
contacts hand lotion etc random things
and then this card pouch is really
convenient for carrying any cards you
need on the go so in Tokyo when you're
using the Metro you get to swipe your
card it's called a Suika card previously
I was swiping my wallet which is like a
big thing but buying this was really
helpful because I do is take this out to
swipe and I was good alright lastly I
have a lot of snacks and this is
honestly just a little preview this is a
taste because we bought so many snacks
really my luggage was 1/4 filled with
snacks as you can see I stocked up on
chocolate because I love chocolate
I bought some milk chocolate from Meiji
this chocolate this green tea chocolate
cookie was a winner like we kept buying
this throughout our trip and snacking on
this the taste of the matcha green tea
is just so strong it's so delicious and
addictive here are some ice cream cone
snacks it's kind of like a foamy moosie
cookie that feels a little bit like ice
cream but it's not ice cream
obviously my cousin loved these so she
really influenced everybody to buy a
whole bunch obviously I had to buy a lot
of gummy candies and I also bought a lot
of hide shoes in every flavor but um I
already finish eating all of them so
this is what's left right now but I'm so
happy that I have one of these left this
is the cow pickle gummy and this is my
favorite candy of my Japan trip I tried
it when I got home and I really wish I
bought more because it tastes so good it
tastes just like that cow Peco drink
which is a yogurt thing I don't I can't
explain it but it's it's such a Japanese
flavor I am in love
this one
all right that's it for my Japan haul I
hope you guys liked what you saw as of
now I'm trying to get back into the
groove of making good videos again so it
might take me a little bit of time
especially now I just moved to a new
place and it's a lot of work moving
unpacking redecorating like buying new
furniture for everything so I have a lot
of just life obligations and stuff going
on right now so basically these next few
months are kind of a transition period
for me but I will definitely do my best
and try to get back into the flow of
creating awesome videos for you guys
alright thank you for watching and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
