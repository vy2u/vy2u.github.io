good to see you guys today's video is
about journaling specifically how to
write stream-of-consciousness style so
stream-of-consciousness is a style of
writing where you just literally flow
like from your brain to the paper so you
try not to think too much you literally
write what you're thinking think of it
as transcribing what's going on in your
brain transcribing your thoughts so it's
really organic it's very authentic you
just let it flow you let the words flow
out you stay very non-judgmental about
your work because I think a lot of
people they write with a purpose or they
want it to sound pretty or poetic or
meaningful whatever it is like stream of
consciousness is like the opposite of
that kind of writing stream of
consciousness is like just
non-judgmental flow it's supposed to be
messy it's supposed to be ugly it's not
supposed to be grammatically correct you
don't even have to have the right
punctuation or spelling there are no
rules absolutely the only thing is just
flow so stream of consciousness is my
favorite ways of writes I feel like that
is the way that I communicate with
myself with myself within like my soul
and my heart that's how I figure out
what I want if you're going through a
tough time or your mind feels really
cluttered really messy or you're just
confused about something stream of
consciousness writing is a great way for
you to just let it out try to organize
whatever is in your mind
and when I say organize I don't mean
like organized as you write I mean like
let it flow out let it be messy but
you'll realize that once you see all the
thoughts out on paper then you'll like
have some revelations as you're writing
and it will become much more clear in
the process so to me stream of
consciousness writing is like magic it
can really heal a lot of what you have
within and it can uncover a lot that you
have within so if you're new to the
style of writing in
I see hard for you to immediately flow
out the words onto paper in the
beginning because you might just not be
used to it so in the beginning if you
don't know what to write in your mind is
blank you can literally write like I
don't know what to write my mind is so
blank bla bla bla
words words words I still don't know
what to write like you can literally
write your thoughts as they come but
that's the whole point you'll notice
that once you do that
more will come out so it really is about
not giving up not stopping just let it
flow let it flow and you'll love it it's
like so much fun
so just to spark your ideas on what you
can write when you're trying to do
stream of consciousness writing you can
write about what you're feeling at the
moment you can write about what you did
that day or what you plan to do later
and if there's something that's
bothering you something that's really
helpful for me is to continually ask
myself why so basically you make a
statement and then you ask why and then
you answer that statement and then you
ask why again and you just ask why like
five or more times and it's really
interesting to just get to the core of
what it is so this is something I can't
really explain but if you can do it with
like pick one thing that is on your mind
maybe one issue that you have be like
why do I feel this way and just keep
asking why why why why why and you'll
get to someplace really interesting
another thing that I like to do is write
as if I am my future self as if I've
already accomplished like the goals that
I wanted to achieve and just write in
the present tense like oh my god I'm so
grateful that this just happened and
this just happened and my life is going
wonderfully and bla bla bla this is part
of the law of attraction so if you
haven't seen my law of attraction video
I'll link it here and here but basically
just feeling how it feels to have
reached your goals or to be living your
dream life will bring that closer to
your reality so sometimes I utilize my
morning pages time to just die of myself
into that place where I want to be and
right in the present tense of that you
can also write about things that you're
grateful for things that you're
excited about things that you want to be
working on you can write like letters to
people who are in your life write your
feelings out to different people how
they made you feel you can also write in
bullet points and make diagrams and do
tools like whatever your heart feels
like there are no rules it doesn't have
to be like paragraphs but most of the
time for me at least I think in terms in
words I'm less of a visual person more
of a words person so I have like pages
and pages of pages of just like words
and sometimes I think a lot of times I
get video ideas from a stream of
consciousness writing if I have like a
good idea or a good quote that I want to
use I'll just like put a star next to
wherever that is and come back to it
later so it's a really great tool for
anyone in general but especially if
you're like a writer or your creator
like you get a lot of ideas from writing
this way to me it's like my form of
meditation it's like how I connect to
the spiritual side of me all right I
hope this gives you a better idea of how
to write stream-of-consciousness style
and how it can really positively impact
your life and make you feel more
connected to yourself and bring you
closer to your dreams all that good
stuff so what are you waiting for get
out a journal and write write write
write write write write write okay love
you all and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
