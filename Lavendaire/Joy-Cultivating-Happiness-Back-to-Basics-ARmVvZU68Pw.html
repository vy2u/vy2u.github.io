there so today is another episode in our
back to basics series and today we're
talking about joy so joy is like a key
part of a good life everyone always
talks about wanting to find happiness
and joy in our lives because honestly I
think a huge part of life is having fun
is enjoying this experience of living in
this human body on this earth living the
lifestyle that you live whatever it is
there's joy to be found everywhere and
there's beauty in the way that life is
today I actually want to share an
exercise that I did over a year ago that
revolves around joy and then I want to
share what I discovered from that
exercise and you can totally do that
exercise as well so this one is just
exercise it's really easy as one journal
profits list all your recent moments of
pure joy so think back it doesn't have
to be so recent it could be like within
the past year two years or in your
lifetime but look back and remember all
the moments where you felt pure joy like
if you know what I mean
pure joy is where you're like laughing
till your stomach hurts or when you're
riding on a roller coaster for those who
like roller coasters and you're like
having a ball you feel like you're
flying and pure joy to me is when your
mind is not clouded by anything else
there's zero worries zero stress zero
thoughts actually you're just living in
the moment you're enjoying the moment
a hundred percent to me that's what pure
joy is it's when you're fully present
and fully alive so what I did was I
looked back and I remembered the moments
of my pure joy laughing with my brother
going to the theme park eating amazing
food exercising doing yoga dancing
singing just all of these little moments
where I felt pure joy where I felt 100%
alive
and I wrote all of these down and after
I wrote my whole huge list down what I
did was I started categorizing where joy
came from so for me I found that joy
came from these five areas their human
connection you know joy came from
moments where I was laughing with my
friends or with my family having a good
time
or having a really good talk with
someone that's where I felt pure joy
that human connection number two joy
came from when I was engaging in my
passions so when I was singing dancing
creating whatever it was that was
something that I was really interested
in really curious about I felt pure joy
in that - number three it was when I
fully engaged my five senses now you
know I'm not talking about engaging them
all at once at the same time but just if
you think about like taste your sense of
taste like eating really good food can
make you feel really joyful or listening
to really good music and make you really
happy or even touching like a soft
plushy pillow or like petting a dog you
know that is like touch that sense can
make you feel really happy as well and
what else is there smell smell if you
smell like a really nice candle or just
any like nice essential oils that can
bring joy to your life - so just
engaging any of the five senses can
really bring joy number four was
physical movement so I noticed that when
I was running doing yoga dancing just
moving my body I felt more joyful it's
probably because of the endorphins
I mean exercise is just good for your
body our bodies are meant to move and
obviously the more you move like the
more happy you will feel it's actually a
scientific fact and lastly is humor so I
wasn't sure if this could fit into any
other categories so I just made it its
own to me comedy humor like jokes
having fun laughing that brings joy
naturally so I don't know about you but
like humor and laughing is contagious
like when someone is laughing and having
a good time it's like you want to laugh
with them as well so humor
can bring joy and I feel like that's a
very human thing just when something's
funny I feel like when you live life in
a very light-hearted way you can find
funny things everywhere everything is
fun everything can make you laugh so
that's what's beautiful also the last
thing I want to say is joy is contagious
so if someone is experiencing joy
through any of these forms whether it's
through passions human connection
engaging the senses whatever it is
naturally contagious and will spread joy
to everyone around them
so I don't know if you've ever seen
anyone who's like eating a really good
meal and they're really enjoying it like
really enjoying it it makes you feel
good and like be happy too if you're
watching someone's dance their heart out
on stage or seeing their heart out it
gives me the feels I don't know about
you but like there's that contagious
mists of joy where you feel their
passion so I don't know just when
someone's laughing or when you see a
happy baby like it's just so contagious
that just joy is contagious and the more
joyful you are the more joy you're going
to bring to everyone around you so I
want to end it on this focus on the joy
that you have in your life in the
everyday little moments little pockets
of joy here and there the more you focus
and be aware of the joy that you have in
your life the more you realize like oh
my god there's so much joy so much
beauty around and your life will be
enhanced because joy like I said is a
huge part of life everyone's searching
for happiness everyone just wants to be
happy so happiness is not something that
you find it's something you create it's
something that's actually here right in
front of you you just have to see it you
just have to feel it for yourself
so start seeing the joy that's in your
life in all these little corners of your
life and remember the five areas where
it can come from human connections
passion engaging the senses physical
movements and humor and like I said you
can also do that exercise on your own
listing out all your previous moments of
pure joy and you can find out where joy
comes from in your
and once you realize where joy comes
from in your life then you can actively
recreate that joy you can do that same
thing again it's that easy it's that
simple joy is cheap so that's it for
today I hope that this lifted your
spirits a little bit especially if
you're going through a downtime just
know that joy is right around the corner
and it's attainable for everyone alright
thank you so much I'll see you next time
make sure you watch the other videos in
our back to basics series right here and
have a beautiful day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
