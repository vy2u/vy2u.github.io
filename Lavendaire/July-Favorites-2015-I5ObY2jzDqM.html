favorites video
I felt like July really flew by like I
didn't even realize that the month was
over it went by so quick and it makes me
sad because I love summer and once July
is over I feel like we're at the dead
end of summer where it's super hot
blazing in LA and it's not as fresh as
June is so I love May and June and July
and August it's more of a it's getting
really hot here alright so the first
favorites that I have this July are my
laptop decals so I have this marble
decal for the top cover of my macbook
and I love it except for the fact that
it was my first time putting on a decal
so it was not perfect and there are
bubbles that annoy me but regardless I
still really liked that marble look it
looks so clean and when the MacBooks off
it looks like a plate of stone on my
table and when you have your laptop on I
love how the Apple is glowing through
the marble so that's a really cool
detail to get and it also protects your
laptop from getting scratched which I
love I actually consider getting a
marble decal for my keyboard as well to
match the top but I found this one on
Etsy and I just fell in love with the
design I just love it I love the ocean I
love this wave this painting and I like
how I feel when I look at it I also
wanted to get a keyboard decal because I
don't like when the keyboard gets oily
and shiny and it looks worn so my ideas
if you put a decal on top it'll protect
the keyboard and decals are really easy
to take off as well so your keyboard
will be good as new
once you've worn out your decal my
second favorite is this resource called
unroll me and this one's for all my
tidying minimal lovers because it's a
way for you to clean up your email inbox
so when you sign up on unroll me
basically you connect it to your email
account and it'll show you that you are
subscribed to 200 or so
ping newsletters which I was most of
them you didn't even sign up for but you
someone just got your email and signed
you up for their newsletter so it's
really annoying to unsubscribe from
things individually so what unroll me is
is you can just like check off the boxes
of the things you want to unsubscribe to
all in one place so it makes it really
easy to unsubscribe from newsletters
also for the newsletters that you want
to keep you can collect them into this
daily digest called the daily roll-up I
think so instead of getting all your
emails when they're sent to you what
unroll me does is it a grits all of your
newsletters and puts it into one email
that you open up and it's like a digest
where you see all the different
newsletters in one email so it is so
clean it cleans up your inbox a lot so
that you don't have to be checking each
newsletter as it comes you can just pick
a time of day that it sends your whole
digest to so I choose to receive my
digest every morning it's just so easy
to use and it really makes a big
difference in your email inbox my next
favorite is a book I'm currently reading
it's what I know for sure by Oprah
Winfrey this book is so simple but it's
so good Oprah is just so great at
telling stories and I think she is such
a wise woman because one you know she's
read a lot of books and two she's met a
lot of people she's met so many
successful influential wise people and
she is just the sponge of it all so
reading her book is just so simple yet
refreshing and inspiring I feel like
it's a book that everyone will enjoy and
be inspired by my next favorite is the
song water bed by the chainsmokers the
song is so fun I love the chainsmokers
new style and I also love the song so
much that I looked into who water bed
was and I fell in love with another song
by water bed called sweet and sour so
I've put both of the songs on my summer
playlist and my those sound waste
playlists which I'll link below my last
favorite is not a thing but it was just
the experience of going to the Special
Olympics Opening Ceremony in LA so it
was kind of
random and spontaneous that our family
decided to go to this because my uncle
is very pro at badminton and he was
volunteering as a judge in the Special
Olympics so we got tickets to go see the
show so we got to see a lot of
celebrities and a lot of artists
performed who was there Stevie Wonder
Avril Lavigne cassadee Pope Nicole
Scherzinger and a lot of like
celebrities and athletes came out to
present so I think Michael Phelps was
there Michelle Kwan was there Michelle
Obama was there and everyone loved her
but the event was just so inspiring the
theme was all about acceptance and
inclusion that we're all human beings
we're all people everybody deserves a
chance everybody deserves their best
chance and so honestly I just wanted to
cry so many times during that event
because the speeches were so good I just
had a great time and before and after
the ceremony I'd be like high-fiving all
the Olympians and it's so cool it's so
cool to be in that energy and it gives
me hope for the world it really does so
there you go those are my favorite
things from the month of July it wasn't
exactly the most exciting month but it
was a good month this month August is
gonna be super busy for me just because
throughout the entire month I'm running
a Kickstarter campaign on the film that
I shot in Taiwan it's called picture
Taipei if you want to know more please

film's teaser and just look at what I'm
doing outside of lab and dare check out
