this is my July favorites video and this
is actually my second time filming this
video today because I accidentally
deleted the last one yeah anyways so
July was a month of really rediscovering
inspiration and emotion for me you guys
might have seen my last video do what
makes you come alive I feel like I've
spent a lot of time this month just to
do things that make me happy just to do
things for fun and just take a time to
kind of breathe a little more and so
it's been a good month for me I feel
like I've found a lot of new things that
inspire me and I'm so excited to share
them with you today in my favorites so
first favorites of the month is actually
a person rupee cour I have no idea how
to pronounce her name but she is a poet
and an artist and you have to follow her
Instagram I feel like this is my
favorite Instagram of the month
literally she writes such beautiful
poetry as she talks about like such pain
like she makes you feel she goes places
where most people are afraid to go and
she's not afraid to use her voice to be
bold and just tell it like it is she's
very empowering as a woman and I just
love love love her work so check out her
Instagram she has poetry and then she
usually puts like a doodle art next to
her poetry to go with it and I just
really like that experience it's
something fresh and something very soft
yet powerful and I've never quite found
something like it so I bought her book
milk and honey and I've been reading
through that yeah I just love it I love
her I think it's so beautiful my next
favorite is the Tony Robbins I am NOT
your guru documentary on Netflix if you
guys have Netflix you have to watch it
honestly it's so good it made me feel
human again
and what I mean by that is like it just
made me feel so many emotions I was
crying throughout all of it and I felt
like I just got so much from it so if
you guys don't know who Tony Robbins is
he's a famous motivational speaker he's
like one of the best of the best he's
you know been around for a really long
time for decades and this documentary is
not like a documentary about him it's
more about taking you through the
experience of going to one of his events
so he holds this huge annual week-long
event called date with destiny and this
documentary takes you through each day
what happens each day the kind of people
that are there how he does interventions
and then you see like these people who
have gone through these traumatic
experiences it's like so heartbreaking
and then you see how they transform and
they go from being suicidal to being
like I don't know like having hope in
life and then you see the supportive
community it's so beautiful it's I think
it will give you something it will
definitely give you a lot of something
after you watch it it might be different
for everyone but for me it made me feel
human it gave me emotions and also you
guys know I'm a personal growth junkie
like I'm always taking notes when I'm
reading thing or watching or reading
things like this so I had my notebook
with so I had my notebook with me and I
was just taking notes through hook
there's a whole documentary and if he
had some like activities that he was
doing with his audience in the event I
would like try to do the activities with
them and I have a lot of fun doing that
kind of thing so yeah I loved it so much
definitely definitely recommend it my
next favorite is this comic called
Helios Femina and if you guys know
michelle phan and you're a big fan of
her you know about this because she
created it so for those of you who don't
know michelle phan is this like huge
beauty youtuber guru businesswoman
person but she's also an artist and she
created this comic and it's so beautiful
I read it all in one night all the
chapters that are out so far and I
stayed up to like 5 a.m.
like going through all the chapters
because one the art is so pretty and the
makeup on the characters are like on
point for this Michelle and I just
really like the story I feel like I
haven't read something like this in a
long time and I just like this digital
webcomic experience so you know how like
people used to read manga it's like you
know comic-book paper and I don't know
if that's like the old-school way and
like I'm just so wowed by this new
school way of reading comics because
you're on your iPad and you scroll
vertically it's very seamless and
sometimes there's like music to the
chapters and the art is just on another
level I really enjoy it so I'm having a
lot of fun reading that so entertaining
and I don't know if you guys like that
sort of thing definitely check it out
for me it's also fun to read like the
comments that people say after each
chapter because people are just so funny
so there's like a hot guy and we're like
shipping him and the main character and
it's just really really fun another
favorite of mine from this month is
something called cereal magazine so
cereal magazine is a Travel &amp;amp; Style
magazine that just has gorgeous gorgeous
photos I learned about this from my
photographer friend Karen Karen Rosalee
I we did like a special project earlier
this month that I don't want to talk
about but you guys can check her out on
Karen Rosalie underscore on Instagram
she's an amazing photographer
anyway she introduced me to cereal and
cereals photos are just so beautiful you
guys know I love that dreamy pastel soft
white look and their photos are very
minimal they're very clean very very
well done and it's just inspired me a
lot I look at it and I'm like wow I want
to create visual work that looks like
that I want to be able to do that how
can I learn to be better in videos and
photos so right now I'm just trying to
step up my visual aesthetic game and
stuff like cereal magazine is really
helping me
my next favorites are my own
products of the month and they're the
Loreal pure clay masks and these were
sent to me courtesy of L'Oreal they were
super awesome sent me a big box of
skincare the only thing is like I know
myself I don't use masks very often like
if I buy a mask I'll use it like once
every three months or something just cuz
I don't remember to use them so I knew
that I had them and my cousins aunts and
uncles were coming over to swim so I was
like you know what let's just have a
face mask party and so it was really fun
just like having everyone - face mask it
was like a spa day at my house and then
I had my cousin from France come over he
brought his French girlfriend to America
for the first time and it was just fun
watching them like put face mess on each
other and for me like that's why this
was a favorite because it brought me
this moment of pure joy and fun and yes
the masks do work really well I think I
used both it red algae exfoliating one
and then the green one and yeah everyone
was like oh my god my skin feels so good
thank you Eileen
and it was just so fun because a lot of
those cousins like all the guys were
doing it too and they've never done
anything like that before so it was a
great experience just really really fun
a favorite moment of this month thanks -
loriell face mask moving on to my
favorites in music for the month so this
is like my favorite thing of today I
know today is not technically July but I
just have to share it so today I found a
video online someone posted Porter
Robinson's full sets at hard summer
festival and oh my goodness if you guys
don't know me like I am a huge huge fan
of Porter Robinson because not only is
he so creative with his music he has
such a unique voice but also he just
like he creates this full immersive
experience with his art yes it's art so
like visually he has this like storyline
he has a visual like palettes and it's
you know it's very colorful it's
animated Japanese inspired and it just
takes you to this new place like you're
literally in another
world and I just love it so much like I
got goosebumps I was listening to it all
day it just makes me so happy so if you
guys even listen to like the first 10
minutes of that set so good it's so fun
my favorite part is like around the nine
to ten minute mark where it's like this
girl character talking about how she was
like she felt like she was in a dream
and the lines are blurred and she just
she talks about like oh I did I just
wake up how long was I gone and then
she's like and reality will never be the
same and then it just like goes boom
into divinity one of his songs that's my
favorite song on his album worlds and I
love what he's done to music he's really
created this audio-visual experience and
he takes you on a journey and that's
what I think good art does it just yeah
aside from that my other song that I've
been playing over and over and over
again is actually a Chinese song so I
don't know if it's very relevant or
relatable but it's by this artist named
Coco Lee and the songs English title I
think is longing to see you and in
Chinese the title is sinh shank you got
me so it's just like a really cute puppy
love song and I like it because it's
just like a Chinese Mandy Moore
Christina Aguilera 90s puppy girly song
and I love that so I found out about the
song because I heard someone else sing
it at karaoke karaoke is where I find
out most Chinese songs so I don't know I
just been listening to more Chinese
songs lately just because I have more
fun learning lyrics to Chinese songs or
just to other languages so when I'm
sitting in traffic all like look up
lyrics and listen to songs over and over
and over again just to learn it and I
learn things phonetically because I'm
not super fluent in Chinese it's funny
how like I could sing a whole trainee
song but I don't understand what the
song is saying I just know how to say
the words and sing it and to me that's
really fun I don't know if you guys
remember
I had this whole phase where I was
learning Italian songs like time to say
goodbye and a cutie pen so I just have
fun because if I know how to kind of
speak this language basically it's fun
to learn a song in that language and to
me it really helps challenge my brain
enough so that I'm not bored while I'm
driving
next up the book that I've been reading
this past month are actually listening
to it's called you are a badass by
Jensen chair oh so I just signed up for
audible this past month and this is the
first book that I'm listening to and I
would say that it's a book for people
who are just getting into personal
development self-help because for me I
think I didn't really enjoy the first
few chapters because she spoke to the
audience as if like oh like if you don't
like your life right now
you can do this to change it and
basically I felt like I wasn't her
demographic because I think these kind
of books target people who are not in a
good place and who are completely like
on the other side and they're trying to
transform their life to being like
happier and positive and whatever and I
feel like I am at a place where I really
enjoy my life I love what I'm doing and
so I'm kind of further down the road so
that's why the middle towards the end of
the book I liked that more than the
beginning but I feel like this book is a
really good reminder of all of the
different areas you have to work on in
terms of like growing yourself and
living a life that you want so for me
it's a really good refresher of all
these different topics so like I said I
just joined audible and this is my first
book that I'm listening to so if you
guys have any recommendations for any
good audiobooks definitely let me know
in the comments below also if you guys
are not on audible yet and you're

day free trial and a free audiobook so
the link is audible trial calm and dare
and you guys go on that link and sign up
for your free trial you can cancel at
any time it's really easy to cancel so
just try it out and lastly I feel like
this goes without saying but one of my
favorite things
this past month is Pokemon go and I feel
like I've been playing it for so long
but really it just started in July and I
don't know I just have so much fun with
it I don't care if some people don't
like it they think it's nerdy like I
love it and I just wish I could play
more because I don't know all my cousins
playing and they're all leveling up
really fast and I feel like when I'm at
home during the weekdays like I have to
work and there's no Pokemon by my house
so it's like I can't level up I can only
play on the weekends when I go out so
yeah anyway this past month I did have
some like Pokemon go dates where we went
to like parks to catch certain Pokemon
and we went to Santa Monica Pier
literally walked around for three hours
non-stop catching pokémon it's like
it's a Pokemon fest
inside about a cup here right now it's
crazy and it's a lot of fun and I mean
I've loved Pokemon my entire life I grew
up with it I used to record it on VHS
from the TV and I played all the games
you know from the Game Boys to all the
n64 games I pokemon stadium pokémon
puzzle pokemon snap all those like
random games like me and my brother were
all on it we collected the cards and
even on my car right now I have this
little squirtle bobblehead and I got
that in elementary school and I told
myself like when I get a car I'm gonna
put this on my dashboard on my car and
so when I got a car I put it there and
now like 10 years later it's still there
and I'm playing Pokemon again so it's
just fun I love it and it brings me joy
alright that's it for my favorites now I
just want to share some quick updates so
a picture Taipei that film that I shot
in Taiwan last year is finally done I
know I I told you guys I would let you
know when it's done so it's done and

the film it's like a 20 minute short
film and then we're gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A with
the crew after so I'm definitely nervous
about it but there's nothing
do at this point the film is done and it
is what it is it's not my baby I'm just
gonna let it go
