it's Aileen so today I want to share
some favorites from July and it's
basically like my travel edition
favorites because I was traveling for
most of the month so if you don't follow
me on Instagram and you don't know
what's been going on I basically went on
a huge road trip through Europe with my
family so we were there for almost three
weeks we started in Paris for a few days
and then we drove all the way like
across ten different countries and then
we made a loop and went back to Paris
for another few days but it was a huge
trip 14 family members in a big Asian
tour bus and it was quite like a trip
for the memories so yeah so my first
favorite is going to be my gel nails
that I got done right before the trip so
let me tell you the story about these
nails so I was or I ordered foreign
currency to pick up at the bank so when
I went to pick it up at the bank the
teller had these like bomb nails she
just looks so magical they were so
sparkly and I had to compliment her on
it so after I like complimented her we
just made conversation and eventually
she told me where she got it done and
right after that like meeting I booked
an appointment to get nails done at the
place that she got it done and I wanted
the same exact veils because I just
loved them so much that I was like why
not so I went to that place to get my
nails done and I'll post a link and
address down below but basically I got
it done by this really sweet woman named
Stacy and it's so cute because she only
speaks a little bit of English and she
speaks mostly Chinese so it was a good
opportunity for me to like practice my
Chinese so we were only speaking Chinese
she's doing my nails and after I got
them done I was like staring at them for
days literally I kept doing this and I
knew I had like every few minutes just
because they were so pretty I loved them
so much they're just so sparkly and
simple but unique if
you know what I mean so I don't normally
do gel nails I haven't done gels in over
a year I'd say because I normally just
wear natural nails or press-on nails but
going on a trip that's like three weeks
long I knew that I wanted to get gel
nails because gels are really sturdy
like even now after my trip it's been
four weeks and my nails are still intact
even though I have like nail growth so
yeah I think when you're traveling my
best option for nails is to get gel
nails because if I'm wearing natural
nails like you know carrying the
luggages and just doing all the stuff
you do when you travel most likely like
your nails are going to break
something's going to go wrong or even
like at the very least that your nail
polish is going to chip and who has time
to like do nails when you're traveling
so next I'm moving on to some travel
favorites in skincare
so whenever I travel I try to keep my
skincare products to a minimum I don't
want to bring too many products so I
usually stick to like one cleanser one
makeup remover and one moisturizer
sometimes I'll throw in an eye cream or
something so for this trip my main
moisturizer the only moisturizers I have
brought was this one it's the Pacifica
coconut probiotic cream I got this at
Target I think it's pretty inexpensive
if I do remember correctly and it's
vegan cruelty free all that good stuff
and it's just like a simple basic cream
that you can wear day night it's really
just like simple and I like it because
it feels hydrating like the hydration
stays longer than other creams because
this one's like a little on the thicker
side and it's really like good enough
it's all I need when I'm traveling I
don't want to bring like all my products
like a toner serum essence whatever like
at home I pack on the layers but when
I'm traveling I definitely try to keep
it as simple as possible this is all
that you need anything to just make your
skin not feel so dry so the cleanser
that I brought for this trip was this
skin esque enzyme washing powder and I
loved it and I wanted to mention it
because it's a powder so you don't have
to think about like you know being under
the liquid
I earn mints for TSA so because it's a
powder it passes so I definitely like it
because it's a brightening cleanser your
face definitely feels like a brighter
the next day after you wash it with this
and it cleanses your face without
stripping it too much like you don't
feel super dry you don't feel like
there's too many chemicals involved it
really feels like okay I do want to note
that this is a cleanser and not a makeup
remover so I wouldn't recommend you use
this to try to take off like eyeliner
and mascara so I brought like a makeup
remover and then after I took off my
makeup I would use this to do the second
cleanse and that was like good enough
for me my next favorite is this backpack
that I got right before my trip so my
qualifications for a travel bag is just
any bag that can fit my DSLR camera so I
bring hold on let me get this I bring my
Soni with me while I travel and as you
can tell it has like a really big lens
this is the 24 to 70 because it's a zoom
lens I like to be able to zoom when I'm
taking travel photos and videos so it's
very versatile but it's also very big
and it's hard for me to find like a cute
bag that fits this camera so for the
longest time I didn't have a bag that
can actually fit this camera and a few
days before my trip I came across this
backpack I got it at the most random
place it was a stand in a Chinese
supermarket right in front of like the
Chinese food court so there's a food
court that I go to to get high Nemzek in
like amazing Hyde I'm chicken and if you
guys are ever in San Gabriel I'll post
the name and the address down below but
there's like this stand where this lady
is selling all these bags and that's
where I spotted the backpack it was only
23 dollars which i think is pretty cheap
for a bag so once I thought I saw that
it was big enough for my camera and I
like the color and it just felt right so
yeah I'm just like really happy that I
found a bag because I just wanted
something cheap because I don't want to
wear anything too expensive when I'm
traveling because it could get lost or
stolen or whatever but also just like a
bag that kid not only fit my camera but
it could also go with every single
outfit that
I could possibly wear on my trip so
something very versatile that would look
good on Instagram all that criteria like
this bag fits it all so that's why it
was my favorite alright that's it for my
favorites for the month of July thanks
so much for watching let me know if you
have questions about anything in the
comments and also let me know your music
suggestions I love it when you guys

any cool new songs to my summer Spotify
playlist so I'll link that playlist down
below because yeah it's still summer so
