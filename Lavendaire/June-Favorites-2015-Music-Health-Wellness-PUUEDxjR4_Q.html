favorites video so June was a month of
music and health for me so I discovered
a lot of good new music just because
it's summer and I think the music or my
taste is becoming more poppy and happy
and I just found a lot of fun stuff and
in health
I'm just trying to eat healthier
exercise more and learn more about
wellness so most of the favorites this
month are not actually things that I
thought but they're just intangible
resources that I found all right so I'm
gonna start off with music because the
music that I found this month is just I
don't know I'm so excited about it and I
just love it so so much so I found
various artists and I their albums were
my favorite but I'm just gonna tell you
guys the artist and maybe my top two
favorite songs from them so the first
artist is Halsey and she is just so cool
I think she's the next big thing if you
look her up she's gorgeous her music is
so cool my favorite songs from her are
ghosts and is there somewhere so you can
check her out on Spotify the second
artist is gsella day I love her new
album I've previously mentioned her
music in my those sound waves videos in
the past and I liked a lot of her songs
before but I just discovered her new
album and I love so many new songs off
of her albums so I really like Ace of
Hearts and shadow creatures I think she
does a great job with coming up with
melodies that are catchy and really fun
to sing and she is just like I said
before she's like a younger Lana Del Rey
mixed with Florence in the machine and
she's just cuter but still very very
cool
the third artist is Tori Kelly her new
album unbreakable smile I hope you guys
have heard of her because she's amazing
she's a great singer I love her and I
support her 100% as an artist I think
partially it's because she came from
YouTube and to me she's just like the
realest artist out there because she is
collaborating with like Ed Sheeran and
LL Cool J and just like big people she
performed at Beauty Awards but she her
roots are so real and they're close to
me because she's a cal
a girl and she has a really good heart
you can tell just by her music if you
don't listen to her entire album just
listen to unbreakable smile the song
those lyrics are so good I also enjoy
expensive that song has so fun and the
song funny that's another song with real
lyrics and I'm so proud that an artist
like hers who can write real songs is
actually making it up there like I'm
just it makes me so happy to see her and
the final artist is Hilary Duff if you
guys are from my generations and you
know Lizzie McGuire Hilary Duff like I
loved her music in the past she kind of
wants to sleep for a while but she came
out with a new album this month and it's
really fun I mean it's very poppy but
what do you want more do you expect from
Hilary Duff I just I love my kind and
it's my summer jam and lastly one song
that I fell in love with at first sound
is roses by the chainsmokers that song
is probably gonna blow up and become
even more popular so I probably don't
have to tell you guys about it so as you
guys can see I'm very excited about
music this summer just because I love
the sound of summer summer is so fun and
so bright and sunny and beautiful
especially here in LA and the music I
just geared towards you know that puppy
happy carefree sound I'm just having so
much fun with new music if you guys are
discovering more music please send it my
way I love to hear new stuff next up are
some resources related to health and
well-being so one thing that really
really changed my mood and lifted my
happiness up to another level is
listening to Tony Robbins the edge and
this is a CD set that is available for
free on Spotify I just found it on
Spotify one day when I was looking for
you know self-help audiobooks and stuff
like that so it's really cool that this
stuff is available for free for us so
what I've been doing is listening to
Tony Robbins tapes while I'm running on
the treadmill and it's just really
energizing and if you guys listen to the
edge he talks about something he does
called the Power Hour in the morning I
did that for a week and it seriously
took me to another level like I felt so
happy so energized and so alive it feels
silly to
at first but once you just kind of like
own it then it really can take you to
that other level so if you guys want to
kind of like take it up there listen to
the edge and do Tony Robbins power our
another resource that I got into this
month is called chronometer and this is
a website where you can just input what
you eat during the day and it tracks
your calories but what I like is it also
tracks all the percentages of like
vitamins and minerals and it breaks down
the nutrition levels of everything that
you eat and I mostly started using this
because I started eating more of a high
carb low fat diet which is pretty much
almost vegan I'm not vegan completely
but my diet is probably 80% fruits and
vegetables right now essentially I've
been using chronometer to make sure that
I'm eating enough calories in a day
because when you're eating a lot of
fruits and vegetables they're very low
in calories so you can actually feel
full but your body's not getting enough
calories that it needs in a day so it's
kind of an opposite effect it's not like
I'm trying to diet and eat less I'm
trying to actually make sure that I'm
eating enough of all of these healthy
foods next up on my favorites is
lavender essential oil I got this one
from Amazon and I mean lavender oil is
just very multi-purpose it has so many
different uses if you do the research
but I just I had a friend who introduced
this lavender oil to me and it smelled
so good and I don't remember what
prompted me to buy it this month but I
did and recently I've been using it just
before I go to sleep just to smell the
lavender and it's very calming and I
don't know I think it's just great for
aromatherapy it helps me relax before I
go to bed and I just love it it makes me
happy
lastly a book that I've been reading
this month is this one it's called the
solar body the secret to natural healing
by ill Chile this book was actually sent
to me by the publisher and I was
interested in it because of the natural
holistic healing methods
it presented I think I'll be doing
another video specifically on this book
where I'll be doing a giveaway as well
so if you guys are interested in that
you can stick around but I really
appreciate that this book is not just
conceptual it's very practical it's
filled with a bunch of different
exercises and techniques that you can do
to kind of flush out negative energy
from your body and kind of get your body
moving so that it's healthier in a way
that your body can kind of take care of
itself naturally so there's a lot that I
can explain in this video right now but
you have to dive deeper yourself so I'll
just post the website in the description
below also if you guys are interested in
participating in the book giveaway you
can email me so that I make sure you see
the video when it comes out that's it
those are my June favorites June was a
very good month for me I feel like I'm a
lot happier just because of the good
vibes of summer the good music and being
healthier moving my body more eating
better and also I took a week to visit
my friend in Vegas where it was kind of
a really nice getaway so I'm just very
happy right now and I'm wishing you guys
all the best I hope that you guys feel
the good vibes as much as I do and just
enjoy your summer enjoy your life and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
