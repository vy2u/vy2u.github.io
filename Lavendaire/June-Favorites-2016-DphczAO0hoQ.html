June favorites video so I literally just
got back from traveling last night and
if you guys don't know if you haven't
followed me on Instagram and snapchat
I've been traveling around Europe for
the past two weeks I went to Iceland
London nice Rome Milan and Berlin so I
hit up a few cities I had a ton of fun I
basically just like took a break from
life and work I didn't even bring my
laptop and just enjoyed exploring with
my friends so now that I'm back I'm like
a few shades darker I my hair colors all
gone and I have bug bites all over my
legs and my arm so I'm just like gonna
reset myself and get back into the game
of creating again and I think it's
always good to like take a break and a
refresh because I have a lot of new
stories and lessons to share aside from
traveling some other cool things I did
this month was host my first live
webinar I hope you guys were there for
that if you were then it was so much fun
to do that and I definitely want to do
more live stuff again in the future and
also I hosted at the OC night market
ready guys one day
just to be back on stage was really
energizing for me and I just realized
how much I love to just be out there and
be a performer no matter what format it
is all right let's jump into the
favorites
so the first favorite of the month is
this contraption called the foreo luna
mini - and this is basically a silicone
face cleanser you turn it on by pushing
this button it's vibrates and you can
set like different speeds and basically
you like wash your face with it using a
cleanser and I really like using this
because it definitely cleans your face
more than if you were just to use your
hands and previously I use something
called the Clarisonic you guys have
probably heard of it but the Clarisonic
I mean it was great for like cleansing
and exfoliating the only thing is my
Clarisonic kind of broke since my
Clarisonic died I decided to try this
thing out because you don't have to keep
buying a replacement brushes for this
it's silicone I think it lasts longer
and also like with one charge the foreo
can last like months without having to
recharge so I think that really sold me
on it the fact that I don't I didn't
have to keep charging this over and over
again and the fact that I don't have to
buy new brushes for it and that is
silicone its antibacterial I've just
grown to really like this thing I don't
know if it's necessary but it just
brings me such satisfaction to use this
to clean my face I think if I'm not
using this I feel like my cleansing
routine is not complete so definitely
like it makes a difference my next
favorite is this elta sunblock honestly
I don't really know this brand and I got
it because it was popular on Amazon I
just needed like a really good face SPF
for the summer and for traveling so it's
so important to wear SPF on your face I
think in the past like a couple months
I've gotten really like adamant about
using SPF everyday on my face before I
put on makeup before I put on anything
because SPF is so important for you and
it's after I talked to this dermatology
that I met she was basically telling me
everything about how like the Sun
damages your skin and you can't reverse
the kind of damage that the Sun does to
your skin so it's just so important to
use SPF especially if you're young now
it's better to start earlier protect
yourself protect your skin and just wear
a sunscreen every day don't miss a day
really my next favorite product of the
month is this moon brightening youth
serum and I know I know I watch my
videos I already mentioned this as my
favorite a few months ago but honestly
it's my favorite again because when I
was traveling these past two weeks this
is all I brought for my face I literally
brought just face wash and this youth
serum and that was all that I needed
honestly if I were to choose one
skincare product to use for the rest of
my life it would be this one and it's
because it's just an oil that is so
versatile you can use it as your
moisturizer you use it in your eye area
on your lips you can it's basically just
natural oil it's made of like prickly
pear seed oil argan oil and rose
essential oil and it does wonders
literally this is all that I needed and
I was really trying to travel light for
Europe and so when you travel light you
only want to bring like one or two
skincare products you don't want to
bring your whole collection so yeah this
thing is all unique moving on my
favorite book that I've been reading for
like the past two months is called
anatomy of the spirit by Carolyn Mis so
I saw Carolyn misspeak at Oprah super
soul Sunday and so it really intrigued
me to check out her book basically the
book is about holistic healing holistic
medicine and the concept is that all of
our physical illnesses come from mental
spiritual emotional traumas or kind of
like a lack of something in a certain
area it all has to do with energy in
your body if you're neglecting a certain
area of your life or if you're hurt in
one area it just emotional mental
spiritual pain leads to real physical
and this book teaches you to like read
through all your chakra energy levels to
kind of evaluate yourself and your own
health so in the book
Carolyn miss tells her story of how she
became a medical intuitive how she's
like grown and she talks about all the
cases of different people that she's met
which is the most interesting part for
me just to hear the stories of people
who had medical issues that stems from
some kind of like emotional issue or
something else and how they healed
themselves based on healing their
energies after reading anatomy of the
Spirit I feel like this concept is
something that more and more people
should at least be aware about I know a
lot of people might not be open enough
to kind of accept these ideas about like
how energy is related to physical
illnesses but I think it really makes
sense if you read into it and look into
all the details what's really cool about
the book is that after seeing so many
different patients the author has been
able to connect and find patterns and
how like one emotional issue connects to
one organ of the body and she has this
whole chart of like different issues and
what parts of the bodies that those
issues can affect so it's really crazy
after like reading all the stories and
seeing her charts and how she explains
why this affects this and this affects
that and also like seeing in people like
my friends and family seeing what
physical issues they have and how it
relates to the kind of problems that
they have in their life so if any of
this intrigues you a check outs anatomy
of the Spirit by Carolyn Mis and once
you read it let me know what you think
I'd really love to know alright that's
it for my June favorites this month also
