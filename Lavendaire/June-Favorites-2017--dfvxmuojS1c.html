today I'm going to share some favorites
from the month of June by the way I will
be traveling for like 3 weeks in July
almost three weeks so it's a pretty long
time I'll be posting less on YouTube but
I'll be more active on Instagram so
follow me on Instagram I'll post like a
ton of photos from my travels and I'll
chat with you guys there alright so the
first favorite of the month are actually
2 playlist on Spotify one is called deep
focus and the other one is called
background piano music so what is called
piano in the background so those are
like my go-to playlists in these past
couple weeks to be productive and focus
on work I feel like I've been pretty
distracted just like anyone else like
I'll hop on Instagram and like ends up
on there for longer than expected and I
just feel like you know I need to get my
head straight and honestly those
playlists have been helping me so much
because once I pop on like the deep
focused playlist I'm like zoned in like
it feels like a meditation it feels like
I'm in like a yoga studio and I don't
know I just feel very inflow listening
to that playlist same thing with the
piano in the background playlist like I
grew up playing piano so I love the
sound of piano like solo piano I don't
like anything too crazy so it's just
simple and then the piano music playlist
that one makes me feel like I'm in a spa
so I'll play that as I'm getting ready
for bed like I play it when I'm like
brushing my teeth washing my face and
just like re what's it called unwinding
myself so I'll share the links to both
those playlists down below I'll also
share all the other stuff I mentioned in
this video next up I have another duo of
favorites these are the liquid eyeliners
by M cosmetics if you guys don't know em
Cosmetics is the makeup brand by
Michelle Phan the youtuber and
businesswoman I look up to Michelle so
so much I've looked up to her since I
was like younger in college like since
she started on YouTube and I am like an
avid supporter of her I will support
everything she does but I'm not being
biased when
like these liquid eyeliners are the
like they are so good and I am a liquid
eyeliner girl I wear it all the time
everyday almost and my staples are the
Stila liquid eyeliner and also Kat Von D
liquid eyeliner and I still love both of
them but I'm saying that these liquid
eyeliners are comparable so the reason I
have two is they have different brushes
one of them is a felt tip brush one of
them is brush if you know what I mean
basically the brush one is for fine
lines and I love using it to draw the
wing of the eye and the felt tip is
darker there's more color payoff so it's
like bolder but it's harder to use this
to draw like a very like nice cat eye so
I will use I think I like the brush one
a little bit more but sometimes when I
want to do it fast I'll use the felt tip
1 because the felt tip 1 is pretty fast
the brush one you have to like take more
time to color it in and stuff sometimes
I'll use both but yeah I really really
really like these two next I want to
share this app that I just downloaded
it's called TV time TV time is this app
that helps you track the TV shows that
you're watching so it like helps you
organize your shows mark which episodes
you've watched and also it reminds you
or notifies you when new episodes come
out so this is a great app to like keep
track of what number episodes you are in
each show that's like a problem for me I
always forget where I left off and
honestly I just love that it gives you
like a nice visual overview of all the
shows that you're watching and all the
shows that you've already watched and I
like that organization the most fun part
though is that you get to see what other
people comments on the shows so you can
also like add your own comments I
haven't really gotten into that yet but
I wish I had this app when I was
watching Paris house boys and girls in
the city because after I watch every
episode I kind of like look online and
see what other people are saying about
that episode because I'm totally like
wanting to talk about it but I haven't
know what to talk about it with so yeah
I have not started watching Tara's house
Aloha States
I heard the beginnings kind of boring
but the second half is good
so I'm going to start watching that from
the middle and if you guys are watching
too then follow me my username is also
lagging there I'll probably be like
commenting after every show and just
like sharing my thoughts and I'd also
love to see what you guys are going to
say about that show too
yes and I also thought this part was
really cute so you get to choose what
character you are from what TV shows oh
I put if I were a TV show character I
would be mizuki from terrace house
because she's like the one who's kind of
lost in her life she wants to start a
coffee shop or something and she's super
cute she's nice but she doesn't end up
getting with a guy because she's too
nice like if she likes a guy and another
girl likes the same guy she'll like back
off and let her happen so I'm like that
type of girl I've also just started
watching girlboss on Netflix the show
that's based off of girl boss the book
by Sophia Amoruso
from Nasty Gal so I've read the book
I've made a video about this book by the
way and so far I finished like three
episodes I don't know if I'm feeling it
yet maybe because it's just so
unrealistic it's very loosely based from
the book and from reality but I mean
that's TV right so let me know if you
guys watch that to let me know what you
think about it anyway I'll post the
links down below if you want to download
the app and follow me at lab and dare
that's that my next favorite of the
month is this hope bracelet that I'm
currently wearing I got sent this from
the mindful company they were so sweet
they put lavender engraved in this
little gold thing I don't even know if I
can catch it on camera because it's so
small but this is like super cute super
casual I found myself wearing this like
every day it goes with everything and
initially like they sent two bracelets
I'll show you the other one that they
sent but I thought you know on the
computer I thought I would like the gold
band but in reality I actually like this
one the roped one better because it fits
snugly around my wrist I feel like I
have a pretty small wrist the other
bracelet just like falls off sometimes
so I like this design I like this size
it's super cute and they have a really
good message
if they have like inspirational words on
all of their pieces of jewelry so if
you're interested in that sort of thing
check them out at the mindful company
my next favorite of the month is
actually an Instagram accounts called
peek your mind you might recognize peek
your mind because he also has a YouTube
channel
so his name is Martin I know him just as
an Internet friend but he also makes
like personal growth content online but
more recently he started posting videos
on Instagram of clips of celebrities
saying motivational or inspirational
things so what I found is like I just go
to his Instagram page in the morning and
I'll just like play the videos like I'll
go on the feed and play the videos one
after the other as I'm waking up because
it's really inspirational it's just like
a perfect way to start my day just like
a really nice kick in the butt so while
I'm brushing my teeth I'm changing and
everything I'm listening to these high
profile high achieving people share
their words of wisdom for my last
favorite I'm going to go back to music I
realize I haven't shared like my
favorite songs with you guys lately so
I'm just going to plug it in here I have
seasonal Spotify playlist so my most
recent playlist is summer 2017 so I have
constantly favorite songs but I guess I
forget to talk about them in my
favorites video so if you follow my
playlist like basically you'll get what
I'm listening to
but out of a summer playlist I was
saying my top two favorite songs of the
moments are uh-huh bye Julia Michaels I
think she is a genius she's the girl who
wrote the song issues and she she also
took an organic style she does not fit
to the tempo of the song and you think
that's so like revolutionary because
it's been so long I haven't heard a pop
song or any song for that matter that
doesn't fit exactly to the time
signature does that make sense to you
guys just listen to the song uh-huh and
listen to her when she says the line
going in for the kill
like I just love how she just like I
feel like she's just like dropping
anyway I think she's a great songwriter
she's a true artist and look forward to
her making more moves in the future
second favorite song is cut to the
ceiling by Carly Rae Jepsen
my goodness when it's summertime and the
Sun is out and things are fun I've
turned to Kyrie Rae Jepson me and my
friend Allen we both agree that she is
the savior of pop music like literally I
just I love pop music I am all about
that and her music is fun it's true and
it just makes you feel good so listen to
that song if you're into that kind of
thing so yeah links to everything are
