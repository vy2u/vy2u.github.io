wonderful week
lately I found this new motivation to
focus more on doing rather than spending
too much time thinking planning or
talking about whatever it is that I need
to do so when I say doing I mean
actually creating or taking an important
necessary action to get to your goal so
today I thought I'd share three quotes
that have driven me to focus more on
doing and I hope these quotes inspire
you guys as well the first quote is do
the thing and you shall have the power
this quote comes from the slight edge by
Jeff Olson which is one of my favorite
books it basically means that you need
to do what you need to do in order to
get what you want to get and it sounds
so obvious and it's common sense but
really if you think about it the power
is in the doing so everything outside of
doing which is writing planning thinking
talking or whatever is just not as
powerful not as important I went back to
this quote because I caught myself
writing the same thing day after day in
my morning pages which kind of showed me
that I wasn't really moving forward so I
felt like I was spending too much time
writing and talking about the things
that I want to do rather than actually
going out in the world and doing it so
do the thing and you shall have the
power don't think too much don't plan
too much don't write too much just go
out and do it the second quote is the
reward is in the doing so this idea
comes from a book I'm currently reading
called turning pro by Steven Pressfield
and it basically means that you have to
enjoy the act of doing whatever it is
that you're doing do it for its own sake
do it because you love the work do it
because you're having fun and not
because you think you're going to get
some result or reward at the end and
another reason to focus on the doing is
because you can't control the result at
the end you can't control the outcome
all you have control over is what you're
doing in the present so focus on the
doing enjoy the active
and you'll be more motivated than if
you're doing something for something at
the end the third quote is do a lot of
work this is a quote by Ira Glass and
his famous interview about closing the
creative gap it's most relevant for
artists and creatives but I'm pretty
sure it can apply to everybody so the
idea is if you want to grow you have to
do a lot of work you have to keep doing
keep creating keep practicing
do-do-do-do-do continuously because
that's the way that you grow and that's
how you get better
just keep doing a lot of work creative
work is about quantity that turns into
quality over time so if you just keep
doing a lot of work and you go through
many iterations and many cycles of
creating doing and practicing you're
going to get to where you want to be and
that's all there is to it all right
those are my three lessons on doing I
really hope you guys found some wisdom
in there because those quotes are really
inspiring to me so focus on doing keep
creating just work get to work thank you
for watching guys and I'll see you in
the next one bye
