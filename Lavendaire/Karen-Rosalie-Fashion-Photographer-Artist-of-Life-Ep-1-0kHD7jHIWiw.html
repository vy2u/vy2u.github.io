my name is Eileen and today I'm so
excited to kick start a new series that
I've been working on called artist of
life so in the series I'm going to be
interviewing amazing people who are
actively creating their dream life
they're actively creating a life that
they love and they're honing their craft
as an artist of life so today we're so
lucky to have the beautiful very
talented
Karen Rosalee Karen is a fashion and
product photographer based in LA she's
known for her work as the photographer
behind the Christelle factor chriselle
lim is one of the world's biggest
fashion and beauty influencers and karen
is the photographer behind all her
gorgeous photos she is a true artist and
honestly she's one of the most inspiring
people I know so I'm so excited to have
her here thank you for having me
yeah I know I'm so stoked right now okay
so let's talk about your journey because
I want everyone to understand who you
are when and how did you decide you
wanted to be a photographer actually
it's so funny because throughout my
whole college experience like I had no
idea that I was going to be a
photographer so like I have friends who
are like in the med school program and
already like what are you gonna do and I
was like uh but I I thought I was gonna
be a painter actually until I was I went
to UCLA to do with our program and in my
sophomore year I think I did a
photography class and that was when I
liked everything made sense because once
I picked up the camera our shooting I
was like wow like I really want to do
this as a career like and that was back
when like a lot of photographers are
putting their work up on blogs and I was
constantly looking at like amazing
beautiful work and I was like
I want to do this really yeah so what
kind of photography got you interested
with it fashion first or was it
something else
if like I've always loved like the
fashion photography imagery but I don't
think I've ever been bold enough to say
like I wanted to do it so I did
everything else but more that before I
was sliding like fashion like what I
wanted to do I did like weddings
um ecommerce and I even tried like
school photography yeah until until like
I am XSL like three years ago and we're
shooting editorials and that was not
like why I really actually do love this
so can we go back to that journey and
talk about like the hardest part of
becoming a photographer did you meet any
big challenges I mean looks like all of
it was really hard okay but I think the
hardest part was getting over the fear
of like failure I mean that's like so
cheesy but like but just like fear in
general I had a lot of fears going into
it like number one can it be a
sustainable career number two how do I
get started number three like is my work
even good like you know it just as an
artist it was like right yeah there's
just so much fear in it like I'm not
just about failure but like even like
talking to like models and clients like
I would be scared so I was I was very
shy so I would be really scared to like
even reach out to people to shoot so how
did you overcome that fear you just it's
one of those things that you just kind
of have to do like for me I remember it
was a decisive moment where I was like I
just need to get over it I need a I need
to push myself so I can get to this next
level so what I ended up doing was I
used the measurement of if that was
uncomfortable then that was like a
measure of like I should do this right
like it's good because I was gonna push
me to grow like I remember like this was
also appreciate but like I canceled a
shoot once because I just couldn't like
the idea like talking to a model like
really freaked me out here yeah
yeah I was like I was like I just came
out of college and I wanted to do
fashion and you know I had this shoot
set up I would actually do that that was
not the first time that was like
multiple times so I did that and
eventually I was just like I'm gonna I
have to go like you have to face your
fears and yeah anyway like yeah more you
doing the easier again yeah no I totally
get it cuz this shoot I was so scared
that I was afraid to ask you for the one
time I was here because it's such a I
think it's because when you care about
it yeah I don't know if something keeps
you from life right yeah all prepared
and you want to run away a knife but you
just have to get over that fear and yeah
yeah okay so I want to ask you how did
you find your identity as an artist I
feel like you have such a strong sense
of self I feel like you have a strong
sense of confidence in yourself now so
tell me how did that develop exactly I'm
so glad to hear that kind of because
sometimes it doesn't feel like it but um
to be honest it's pretty recent I think
I started experimenting and I'm putting
my work out there as like artistry like
maybe a year ago and I think it was just
finally like I've always been interested
in my more like abstract imagery and
just different modes of like art making
right like and like challenging myself
to think outside of the box and creating
work that I find like I love but like I
was not for a lot of it was just
identifying that this is what I like and
then just going for it
and then not being afraid again like to
just say like hey this was me as an
artist or this is me as whatever but
this is my work and I hope you guys like
it
well yeah it's just a lot of it looks
just like Tron or and a lot of practice
and then like them now do you feel like
you're really confident in yourself as
an artist I think it's still a process
like I'm definitely like still learning
like what it means to be an artist right
at the same time like I think confidence
comes from like first believing in
yourself and life and then not worrying
about what other people were thinking
yeah I want to talk about that so like
where was the breaking point between
like you not believing in yourself and
not being confident so you like now
being like I know what I'm doing the
biggest point I would say that I can
remember so far is a New York Fashion
Week because I was literally like thrown
into the fire of like the craziness of
New York Fashion Week and at that point
like it was like as I was working with
her song and Lara from their team and
there's such great role models in terms
of like they really supported me and let
me kind of be creative so I think it was
just like a matter of being at the shows
and then doing my artsy shots at the
shows and
and then looking at the final products
and being like wow I can actually like I
should believe in my psyche yeah yeah
exactly yeah that's so awesome and then
I think I've heard you talk about being
at fashion shows before how you're like
the only girl of the photographers and
you're like the shortest and right talk
about that experience right well I think
a lot of like my confidence now comes
from also just being different right um
as a fashion show but you're I would
literally like the only trick the only
why why I think a lot of these fog
refers are also just like guys they're
like older guys and especially in that
industry I don't know why they may
because I have a lot of gear and they
have to carry it with them let's talk
about the Karyn Rosalie aesthetic so can
you describe that to our audience for
people who've never seen your Instagram
or blog what what is it and where did it
come from I want to know it basically
describes a girl and a girl who is both
feminine and also a little moody and but
totally confident in just being like
ibadah and like I think it comes from at
full of course like I feel like for
photography work in itself like it's
always going to come from within right
so that's an aesthetic that's an ideal
of like the kind of girl that I want to
be I'm realizing now that I'm
translating it and all the work that I
do especially being like a female
photographer and shooting fashion and
shooting these girls like how can I tell
their story right and how can I tell my
story to I love it that really makes it
really see because noir most people
think photography is just like you boom
take a picture and that's it but you
actually infuse so much of yourself
right yeah yeah totally because this
work is like I mean as an artist to like
it's definitely an extension of myself
right so so for me I feel like every
portrait that I take every photo that I
make like it's always going to be in
part like partially a self-portrait
because like so much of myself goes into
it
so beautiful I love that yeah so the
study kits like I mean I'm just in spot
colors for a while it's um it's very
desaturated and but it's like the colors
are poppy like it's mochi and it's like
pretty bold but like a lot of the color
scheme is just like black and white
neutrals a lot of blue tones and that's
just because like like I came from a
very feminine aesthetic but it's it's
evolved of course you know and so the
colors on my confident I really yeah the
high contrast is because I've gotten a
lot bolder to it comes from I was gonna
ask why do you always put shadows and
lighting the way you play with it what
drew you to it first
well a lot of it was just like practice
right I shot every single day when I was
with crystal and so a lot of it was just
like you do so much one thing and then
you realize like I really like this one
thing like for me because living in LA
it's so sunny and the shadows are
already like naturally very harsh like
when I started using that type of light
more I realized that like this is my
light like I love it like it's just add
so much more dimension and especially
since like I I tend to gravitate towards
more like things with more dimension and
depth to it like a which tells butter on
the story great so that kind of light I
think is more dimensional versus like
just flat lighting and it shows
everything like I like leaving a little
bit like in the dark
yeah yeah so there's more mystery
Matthew yeah I like that because I think
as an artist you have to keep doing
things and then you figure out what you
like and then you hone in hone in hone
in on your style I create a signature
it's like this like this rabbit path of
like yeah cuz everyone starts off kind
of like broad even Picasso he painted
everything but then he like yeah total
and it's just like an evolution of like
things that you like and I realized like
all these motifs of like flowers girls
like like moodiness like that these are
elements I've been working with like for
the my entire like photo
but like just it's just more apparent
I'm able to express it a lot better now
I love it yeah okay so I noticed that
you've been like refreshing your blog
and you have a YouTube channel now which
is amazing you guys have to check it out
so talk about this new direction that
you're headed as a photographer I've
been shooting and working in the
industry for quite a few years now and a
lot of people follow me on snapchat and
they're always asking and I share a lot
of tips on how to edit and how to
achieve the lighting that I do on my
snapchat and a lot of people have just
been like can you do a blog post me do a
YouTube so it doesn't disappear after 24
hours and now that I've recently gone
freelance I've decided that you know
it's time actually really it's been long
overdue for me to create a space or like
photographers like me who was first
starting out that didn't have like the
resources to really learn it's like I
want to create a space where like we
people can go and feel like they're not
alone in terms of like how do I get
started as a photographer yeah so can
you talk about like what does a day in
your life look like now that you're a
freelance photographer you have all this
freedom what goes in that day or maybe a
week a typical week yeah I was just
thinking every day is so different that
is really hard to answer that some days
I would I booked out my shoots like
maybe two weeks in advance so then on
the day of I meet with the client and I
shoot the models or the products or
whatever and then maybe the next day
it'll look like I'm editing on a coffee
shop the entire day or the next day I'm
meeting with clients and actually
talking about like pre-planning for the
shoot or another day lighting last week
I ended up meeting a client and sourcing
like props for our shoots yeah it just
seems really fun it's like shopping oh
my god you're amazing
we went to this tile store where I had
like all these different textures and
I'm like huge on texture so like it was
like going to a candy store
so do you yourself you collect props to
use for photos you have your own
collection yeah no I am like a hoarder
in that it's like I just have like no I
can't go the way I'm like I need this
for something but like I collect a lot
of dried flowers I have a lot of like
text um textiles and also like textures
and books and like prints like jewelry
and empty bottles of like product that I
just keep like you never know when it's
like everything look really yeah I think
that's what normal people have a hard
time with they don't have those random
accessories and feather not a water like
a photo yeah Holly and also it's just
like keeping things that are within your
aesthetic too you know so you seem like
you're always inspired can you talk
about where you find your inspiration
and your motivation to work I think
habitually I'm just a thinker I think a
lot so I just find inspiration from like
everything that I observe but
sometimes I don't feel inspired you know
and a lot of it also has to do with like
then that's why I keep a lot of books
around because that way like I'm very
inspired by word and like imagery so
like words like i create an image in my
head like based on the story that i'm
reading or whatever i just believe in
like constantly learning and constantly
looking at things so that way like you
learn something and then it ties it
reminds you something else so yeah I
believe in that too that totally you can
learn like all these random things and
they add to your work yeah because
inspiration doesn't just have to come
from like it can't come from only you
you know like you could have draw it
from everywhere else so you never run
out and then what about like self
motivation do you motivate yourself or
do you have other people in your life
that you always look to yeah a lot of it
is like I'm super determined to get what
I want I'm super determined like to to
not give up right but I also I have a
great community of friends around me my
parents are super supportive like I
always call my dad to ask or to ask him
for advice in career like he calls me in
the morning to like wish me a good day
and stuff in a hungry like yeah and all
my best friends are always checking up
on me to make sure like you know I'm
handling everything well and stuff and
okay and like everybody like really
cares you know and that's like that's
everything how many places have you
travel to in the past year maybe past
two years big towns I think I try to and
then I lost track I know that in May I
was in three different cities in the
span of like one month okay but
definitely the heaviest traveling months
for me was last year in September I
think I was gone for like three months
entirely just because I was in New York
Paris Greece
Kariya go crazy yeah I have a lot of
miles oh yeah what is the biggest lesson
that you've learned in the past year
always be kind that was one thing that I
learned in Fashion Week and traveling to
all these different countries like
kindness is the universal language like
it doesn't really matter like who you
are like if you're not a nice person you
know how are you going to like connect
with another human being you know so
like I that's one thing that I like
learns and really want to like really
try to incorporate into my life like
that's why I'm super responsive when
people ask me questions on snapchat like
how did you get this what filter using
I'm like always trying to be very
helpful you know if it wasn't for the
people who are kind to me like in my
journey I wouldn't be where I am today
you know so it's just like I'm just kind
of responding back to the language I
love it I think that's beautiful
okay do you know what your dream life
looks like I feel like you do you have a
vision yeah obviously so can you talk
about that paint the picture for us okay
a dream life would be I'm like in five
years or whatever like I would be
traveling but I would also be creating
work that I'm super proud of and you
know I wouldn't be working for anybody
like 9:00 to 5:00 like autonomy is super
important to me right freedom and like
being able to like wake up on my own
schedules so like and I love traveling
and seeing the world so like those are
two things that I like really wanted to
to embody as like you know my dream life
and so every decision that I've been
making like like I'm always like I
always keep that in mind like is that
bringing me closer to where I want to be
yeah yeah I love I feel like you're
already living that travel and now yes
real and I'm getting closer yeah because
at one point like when I was traveling
like I was like this is like totally
like where I wanted to be like five
years ago yeah but now you want to take
control of your own time that's the only
part right right yeah so it was yeah I'm
not exactly sure what that looks like
right well you're very close oh good I'm
getting close very good yeah you have a
favorite quote yeah actually this is
something that has been that I've
carried with me ever since when I first
started in photography he was a mentor
of my friend and so I was very close to
that friends and so one of the things
that mentor said was that in life it's
not about talent it's about having
tenacity and you know it's just going
for it like and so that's something I
carry around with me it's just it's
really not about a talent it's about
it's more about hard work and having the
balls to like go for it
ya know I love it I feel like your
journey really is like a flower that's
blossoming into this bowl too fast shape
just like Rosa Lee mutters oh I love it
do you have any last words for any
aspiring artists and photographers yeah
I would say just really going for it
like don't be scared right like I'm not
spinning fabulous here I'm great I have
to do it exactly like at the end of day
is just about just constantly working
constantly being proactive and you never
know like what doing one thing will lead
you to so it's just like never giving up
never being stagnant just keep pushing
like yourself and think people around
you keep me yeah exactly keep moving
keep the momentum momentum going yeah
