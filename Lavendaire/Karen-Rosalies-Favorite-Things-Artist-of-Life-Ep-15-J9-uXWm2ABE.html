these are some of the essentials that I
always have with me to keep me inspired
I always carry them around with me I
always try to carry a book around with
me this book that I'm reading right now
is by Stephen King it's called on
writing and I picked it up because I
wanted to learn how to be a better
writer and so I always try to read a
book once a week once a month maybe
depending on how much time I have but I
just like carrying books with me so
whether I'm when I have downtime when
I'm waiting for my friends when I'm at a
cafe I'm constantly learning I love
books because I just love stories and I
love novels but I also love beautiful
picture books I picked up this book in
Paris at the store called Colette and
it's just a book filled with flowers
this photographer went to a bunch of
different forms and did research on all
these different flowers and basically
it's almost like a documentary on the
different types of flowers and forms and
I'm so inspired by it and I think it's
so beautiful I take a lot of notes
whether it's writing down my to-do list
or just writing down my goals or writing
down my Chinese name a lot of doodles is
just kind of where I can explore my
ideas and remind myself of
what my goals are and what my plans are
for the upcoming weeks I just I have
this notebook with me everywhere and I'm
constantly taking notes and I always
like to look back on it and just remind
myself of like oh this is kind of what I
would where I was at last week in terms
of like where I wanted my website to go
and then like this is the realization
that I had like this week I pick my
flowers based off of the color sometimes
but I actually really love roses
obviously Karen Rizzoli so I feel like I
always like to pick out different color
roses to just kind of mix things up a
little bit
versus the traditional like white roses
or red this is the camera that I have
that I've had for the past three years
and a lot of people always ask me what
what lenses they should get and what
like what's the best year but to be
honest like this is the only lens and
body that I own and this is more than
enough I really believe that it's not
about the gear that you own but the how
you use it and the photography and like
the photography skills that you own in
terms of editing so for me it's the
Canon 6d I like it because it's
full-frame and it's very light and also
the 24 to 105 because it has such a good
range oh yeah
