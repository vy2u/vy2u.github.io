beautiful in LA right now it's literally
my favorite time of the year so I'm
outside it's beautiful welcome to my
garden today I just want to share a
little bit of my experience last month
shooting a short film in Taipei so if
you guys didn't watch this thank you
video I announced that I was shooting a
short film in Taiwan and I actually made
that video a couple hours before my
flight so a lot has happened from the
beginning of March till now I feel like
the experience of Taipei was just super
surreal it was amazing and throughout
the entire trip the entire month of
March I just felt so grateful to be
there like so many moments made it feel
like it was just a dream because it just
didn't feel like real life there
basically I went there with a team of
five people we had two producers a
director a cinematographer and me I was
the lead actress in the short film the
first two weeks there we were doing
pre-production so location scouting for
the film just working doing a lot of
prep work I was just so nervous and
scared throughout the whole first half
or the majority of the trip literally
because this is my first time starring
in a film I've done a little bit of
acting before but I can't say that I've
been the star of an on-screen thing so
personally I was super nervous and
scared about this project just because I
wanted to do it but I just didn't want
to let anyone down because I wasn't sure
if I was good enough I think the biggest
thing for me is I knew I would do my
best and if I did my best I could not
regret anything because I gave it my all
but still I was scared that my best was
not enough and I didn't want to let
anyone down because I cared about my
team so much I've seen the five of us
work so hard during like the nine months
we were preparing to get to Taiwan and
once we got there we met our Taiwanese
production team and our
and there were so many people working
really long hours and just working their
butts off for us and I felt like I had
that pressure that I couldn't let these
people down because wow they really like
put their all - so during the two weeks
where we were prepping in Taiwan I was
focused I was trying my best to just
work as hard as I could to prepare as
much as I could for the shoot and you
know I couldn't have as much fun as I
could have because I had a lot of free
time I could have went out to travel and
do all these fun things but I chose to
stay in my hotel room the entire day
just to prepare practice and just get in
the right state of mind and I'm glad I
did that because I had to absolutely
know that I gave it my all that I wasn't
playing around and I got serious um but
honestly I think the pressure didn't
leave until after the first day I was
just so nervous and scared even up to
the first day the first day was like
jitters all day but it was so thrilling
it was a kind of scared where you're
scared to do something and you don't
feel ready but you do it anyway because
who's ever ready you know I feel like
you just have to throw yourself into it
and prepare as much as you can but once
you're in you just give it your all and
you have to learn to let go so that's
what happened I got in there and I just
let go I stopped caring about what other
people thought I really didn't care
about what I looked like I didn't want
to worry about anything I just wanted to
do my part as best as I could and just
that was it I think once I got through
the first day each day after that got a
little bit easier and more and more
chill just because the pressure and the
weight started to lift and I was
actually able to have so much fun
throughout our whole week of shooting
just because I don't know I love to
perform and I was honestly having a
blast up there I think at the end I'm
just so happy that my team believed in
me from the beginning even before I
believed in myself
and I think that support is so important
so find people who believe in you no
matter what find people who love you and
will who will support you because you
have that but you also have to support
yourself and learn to be confident even
when you're scared you have to just do
it
by doing something that scared me I felt
like I definitely stretched my comfort
zone and I felt like I definitely grew a
lot because of it and it's just a
reminder you know well a lot of the
times I'm pretty comfortable a lot of
the times we're all very comfortable in
our daily lives but just keep finding
projects or things to do that scare you
a little bit that get you a little bit
nervous because you don't feel like
you're ready yet just you don't have to
feel like you're ready nobody's ever
ready nobody's really ready you just
have to do it anyway you jump in the
people who do big things are the people
that take action before feeling
comfortable with it because the
uncomfortable zone is where all the
magical stuff happens and literally this
whole experience shooting a short film
in Taipei really felt magical the whole
time felt like a dream it was surreal to
just have so much fun abroad work and
meet with creatives in Taipei and just
get to know each other on a level that
hey we are all creative people we're all
trying to do something good in the world
we're all trying to just make cool stuff
make something beautiful and just to
connect on that level was so cool and
just the experience of traveling and
living abroad away from your life at
home is just very refreshing I feel like
every time I travel I kind of reset my
lifestyle and I come back a little bit
different a little bit improved as a
person so
I'm just so grateful for the experience
I have so much love for my team and our
Taiwanese team and I can't wait to go
back but I can't wait for you guys to
see the film for now you can like our
Facebook page facebook.com slash LA to
Taipei movie but the movie is actually
tentatively called picture Taipei anyway
I just wanted to make this video for you
guys just to share my experience that
I'm very scared and nervous a lot of the
times even to shoot this vlog I haven't
vlogged in an entire month and I feel so
out of it and it's awkward to be on
camera again and it's uncomfortable but
you have to do uncomfortable things
because those are the things that push
you to grow and you never feel ready but
you just have to do it so keep doing
things that scare you because I promise
you it's always worth it in the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
