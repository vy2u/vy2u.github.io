stories about times where I thought I
lost what was most important to me and
the kind of the lessons that I learned
from it so the first story happened when
we just arrived in Taipei to film a
short film basically I took two luggages
to that trip one was a big one that had
all of my clothes and toiletries and
stuff and another was a small carry-on
that I put my laptop camera a hard drive
basically all the electronics and gear
that were valuable so we arrived at the
hotel and the bell boys usually take the
luggage and bring it into the hotel as
you go check in so we got inside the
hotel and we were double checking our
luggage and I realized that my small
carry-on was missing and I kind of
freaked out inside and I asked them to
double check if they had put it in
another pile or with someone else's
stuff and so the bell boys were kind of
scrambling to find where my lost luggage
had gone yeah keep in mind I had my
laptop my camera my harddrive with all
of my footage and stuff ever and also my
money was in there basically a lot of
valuable stuff that was not only
monetarily valuable but stuff that was
valuable to me like video footage music
that I created a lot of stuff that um if
I lost it I wouldn't be able to get back
so I remember being freaked out on the
inside of course I was scared and
nervous and restless but as the
situation was happening I remember I
went through kind of stages in my
mindset where I was freaked out and
scared and sad and then I started
thinking you know what if I really did
lose everything what would happen and so
eventually I came to the mindset that
everything in that carry-on luggage is
just material it's all material things
and even though you know my hard drive
was there and I had footage that was
really important to me stuff that I
created aside from that there's nothing
that I could
get back you know if I could I could buy
a laptop I could get a new camera I
could get a new hard drive and I could
start over from scratch basically the it
was not the end of the world my life was
not going to end even if I lost a lot of
the things that were important to me
even though I couldn't recreate some of
the stuff that I would lose off the hard
drive it's okay
life goes on and life moves forward and
I was okay with that I accepted that I
think getting to that mindset kept me
much more calm than I would have been
for example if this happened two years
ago I would probably be freaking out
crazy I'd be crying I'd be just in
another state of mind but because I was
able to detach and kind of look at it
from the bigger picture you know my life
is not gonna end if even if I lost all
these valuable things it's okay so it
helped me be more calm and it kind of
helped me see that you know all the
things you own no matter how valuable
they are no matter how important they
are to you they're not a part of you so
if you take who you are and you strip
everything that you have everything that
you think is yours your car your house
your clothes your laptop whatever
valuables that you have if you take it
all away from you you are still alive
you are still you and it's going to be
okay you're gonna figure a way out of it
no matter how tough it is usually it's
not as scary as it seems that's what I
think and just the lesson to not place
so much weight and don't get too
attached to material things because
things are things things are here for us
to use and enjoy but everything is
temporary everything is fleeting
nothing's gonna be yours forever in the
end they found my luggage basically the
taxi guy found it in this crevice the
luggage was so small that it was kind of
behind the seat the bellboy didn't see
it in the trunk when he took it out so
we got it back I got everything and
was okay but that false alarm kind of
taught me to definitely double-check
your stuff when you're traveling all the
time every time and also material things
are just things I think the next time
you go through a crisis or some state
where you feel like you lost it all just
sit in it accept it and then really
think about it
what's the worst that can happen and if
it happens what would happen after that
because I think it's because I thought
of the next steps you know what would
happen after this what would I do
logically well how would I rebuild it
how would I be okay you see that it's
possible to go on I think people in
crises feel like this is the end of the
world and they focus on the pain of the
moment where they can't see beyond it
but I think if you learn to step back
detach from the situation and just think
logically what's the next step that I
would do if the worst thing happened
you'll see that there are steps beyond
this and it's not the end of the world
and you can be okay again alright thank
you guys so much for watching this one
let me know if you had a similar story
or if you thought of this before or I
don't know let me know your thoughts and
I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
