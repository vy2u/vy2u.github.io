wonderful day
today I wanted to share something that I
learned from a book that I just finished
reading the book is called mindsets the
new psychology of success by Carol Dweck
so this is actually a book that my
brother recommended to me so it's not
something that I normally pick up on my
own but I read through it and I thought
it was pretty interesting I think it's
so important to understand the two
different mindsets that the author
outlines in this book I think this is
something that everybody in the world
should be aware about because it could
literally make or break your life
throughout the book the author outlines
the differences between having a fixed
mindset versus having a growth mindset
and before I go into what either of
those mean I want to do a quick quiz
that comes from the book just so you can
figure out whether you have a fixed or a
growth mindset so I'm going to read a
statement and you can answer to yourself
whether you mostly agree with it or if
you mostly disagree with it number one
your intelligence is something very
basic about you that you can't change
very much number two you can learn new
things but you can't really change how
intelligent you are number three no
matter how much intelligence you have
you can always change it quite a bit
number four you can always substantially
change how intelligent you are so if you
feel like you agreed with the first and
second statement then you probably have
more of a fixed mindset and if you felt
like you agreed with the third and
fourth statement then you have more of a
growth mindset so you can replace the
word intelligence with other words like
artistic talent or sports ability or
business skill or anything else if you
believe that any of these qualities or
skills are things that you are born with
and you can't change it very much then
you are in a fixed mindset and if you
feel like you can always change and grow
and develop your qualities then you have
a growth mindset now you don't have to
be completely one mindset we all
probably have a good blend of both the
fixed and the grow
mindset for example you may have a
growth mindset regarding your
intelligence and you believe that you
can grow your intelligence and at the
same time you might not believe that you
can grow your artistic ability you might
believe that you know since you've never
been able to draw that you can't really
improve that skill now I'm going to go
into the differences between a fixed
mindset and a growth mindset so starting
with a fixed mindset you believe that
your qualities are essentially carved in
stone you believe that once you're born
you're born with a level of intelligence
and a level of artistic ability
personality and whatever and you can't
really do too much to change what you're
born with people with a fixed mindset
usually value effortless talents and
effortless skills effortless
intelligence because it kind of proves
that you were born with that talent or
skill or intelligence and that is
innately within you with this mindset
you're usually raised with an idea of
either you're smart or you're not or
you're talented in a given area or
you're not and you kind of take that at
face value so what this mindset does is
it kind of creates an urgency to prove
yourself over and over because if you
were raised to believe you were smart
and it was a fixed thing then for
example if you failed at school that
might prove that you're not smart
anymore that's the scariest thing ever
so usually people with that fixed
mindset they want to prove themselves
over and over and they will do things
and also avoid doing things in order to
keep that image of their fixed traits
usually people with the fixed mindset
are terrified of failing and they try
their best to avoid challenges because
any challenge or any chance of failure
could prove that you're not as smart or
as talented as you believed you were and
also people with a fixed mindset don't
take criticism well because all it does
is it hurts their ego in what they
believe that they were and because this
mindset values that effortless
intelligence and effortless talent
effort is actually seen as a bad
thing with a fixed mindset because
trying too hard I'm putting too much
effort means that you're not smart
enough you're not naturally gifted
enough to just do it with ease on the
other hand people with the growth
mindsets believe that their qualities
can be cultivated through effort so
whether it's your intelligence your
sports skills your artistic ability your
personality these people believe that
they can always change and evolve those
things so with this mindset these people
usually are more open to challenges and
some even enjoy challenges because it's
a way for them to learn new things and
these people don't see failure as
serious as people with a fixed mindset
because to the growth mindset people
failure is just a way to continue
learning something new in addition
people with a growth mindset value
persistence and effort because they
understand that that's what it takes in
order to grow and cultivate these
qualities also people with a growth
mindset tend to do better with criticism
because they know that criticism is just
a way to learn how to improve themselves
so looking at these two different
mindsets you can see the differences
between them people with a fixed mindset
are more likely to judge themselves
based on how well or how poorly they do
in a given situation so if they do well
in a situation they will feel good about
themselves because it proves how great
they are
in the first place but if they do poorly
in a situation then they just end up
feeling horrible about themselves on the
other hand people with a growth mindset
don't judge themselves as harshly on how
well or how poorly they do they measure
their performance based on how much they
learn from a situation here's a graphic
that outlines the two different mindsets
and the consequences of having each
mindset I put the full graphic and
another great graphic in my blog post so
you can check that out in the
description below after reading this
book I noticed that I had elements of
the fixed mindset in my life growing up
as well and I
I let that mindset hold me back from
challenging myself fully so for example
when I was young I took classical piano
lessons and I remember always hearing my
teacher tell my mom how naturally
talented and gifted I was at piano and
to her I was so great so I believed that
I was naturally good and that was a
fixed thing that I was born with so
there came a point where the teacher
encouraged me to enter into these piano
competitions just you know just because
and I was too scared to enter those
competitions and I would shy away from
those competitions because in my head if
I failed at that competition if I didn't
win then that would prove me as not as
naturally gifted or talented as I
thought so I think I avoided those
challenges I avoided doing those
competitions because I was scared I let
that fixed mindset get to me so in the
end I didn't challenge myself as much as
I could have back then I'm so glad that
I got to read this book and understand
the differences between these two
mindsets and now I see that I've
developed more of a growth mindset in my
life you know I value things like effort
patience perseverance and persistence
and I truly believe that with effort you
can develop yourself in any way that you
want the bottom line is you can change
your mindset you can decide to cultivate
that growth mindset you can decide that
your qualities are not set in stone and
you have the power to grow and work on
them so you can grow yourself through
challenging yourself through failing
through putting effort and having
persistence in what you do and you don't
have to judge yourself based on how well
or how poorly you do but by how much you
learn from a situation all right I hope
this was helpful to you guys if you want
to dive deeper into the two mindsets
then you should definitely read the book
yourself
it's called mindset the new psychology
of success by Carol Dweck alright thank
