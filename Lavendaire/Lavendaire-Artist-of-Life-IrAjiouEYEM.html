create our dream life this is the path
of an artist of life hi my name is
Eileen and I am an artist of life this
is my journey to discovering how to
create a life I love one that's
beautiful and meaningful and filled with
creativity travel music and awesome
people lavender is my space to share
what I learn in personal growth and
lifestyle design it's a resource for
those who want to become their best self
and create their dream life this is my
story in college I was so lost and
struggled with what to do with my life I
wanted to do big things but had no idea
what that looked like or how to make it
happen
overwhelmed by society's pressure to get
a good job and be successful I became so
frustrated at myself for not being able
to figure life out I felt like a failure
after I graduated I decided to set out
to find a career and life that I'm super
passionate about rather than settling
for a job I knew I wouldn't love
so I took a chance I started following
my heart to whatever opportunities felt
right to me instead of trying to control
every detail I let my life flow and
unfold on its own that choice let me to
accomplish some things I never would
have imagined
today I love my life and each day I'm
working to be better looking back I feel
like I was asleep for most of my life
and I only just woke up and started
living now I realize how much I love the
process of creating my dream life
learning to embrace myself align with my
vision and build the habits and skills
to make that life a reality this is why
I created lab and there to help you
embrace your true potential and live
your best life
lavender is for the passionate the
fearless and the dreamers who believe
for those who are smart curious and
conscious with an open mind of love for
learning and a deep desire to live a
brilliant and vibrant life in short
lavender is for the artist of life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
