I'm Eileen for those of you just
dropping in today I want to talk about
the law of attraction and how you can
use this tool to manifest your dreams
your desires and get anything you want
so for those of you who haven't heard
the law of attraction is basically this
idea that our universe operates under
this law that like attracts like
meaning whatever energy or thoughts you
put out you're going to attract that in
return so you can think about this on a
surface level kind of like if you send
out good vibes and you're going to
receive good vibes if you're kind to
others and others will be kind to you or
on the flip side if you lie to others if
you hurt others then others will do that
same thing back to you basically
whatever you put out you're going to
attract that same thing in return so
it's pretty crazy just thinking about it
because it just means that you have so
much power so much control over how you
shape your reality so the general idea
here is all change begins with your
beliefs and your thoughts and so that's
like the origin the starting point for
sending out the message to the universe
of what you want and through a lot of
attraction you can actually attract all
the things that you want into your
reality now at this point if this is the
first time you're hearing about the law
of attraction you might be pretty
skeptical because you're like what the
heck how does that work if you just like
think something it becomes reality like
life is not that easy your dreams don't
come that easy and you're right it's
true it's not that easy it doesn't work
just like that it's not just wishful
thinking Law of Attraction doesn't mean
like you just think like oh I want to be
rich and when I have a big house and a
nice car and boom you get all of that
stuff that's not how it works there's
like all these steps that happen in
between but what the point I'm trying to
make is that everything all of reality
begins here it begins with your beliefs
it begins with your thoughts there's not
a dream that you've achieved that hasn't
happened here first meaning you have to
think about what you want before you
actually get
you have to imagine it envision it and
know what you want and then obviously
you have to like take action and do
those little steps to get you there so
if you're more of a pragmatic or
practical person this is how I would
explain how the law of attraction
actually works so everything begins with
your beliefs okay so your beliefs shape
your thoughts your thoughts shape your
words your words shape your actions and
your actions shape your reality so
everything begins with the belief when
you have a belief or a thought about
something that's like boom you sending
out a message into the world into the
universe and the universe will start to
attract those things back to you but as
you focus on those beliefs in those
thoughts you start to see those
transform into words whether you're
writing down your goal or you're writing
to yourself in your journal or just the
words that you used to talk to your
friends and family to describe yourself
how you're feeling so your words are
really powerful your words will become
your actions because you have to decide
what to do before you do it so once you
start taking action obviously we all
know that action makes things happen so
boom eventually your reality matches
what you originally believed or thought
up in your mind so that is like just a
quick way to explain how you can
transform your dreams into a reality and
obviously there's a practical part where
you're actually putting in the work but
the law of attraction also says that
while you're taking action towards your
goals while you're focusing on your
dreams and whatever you want to manifest
the universe will conspire to help you
achieve it so that's like the magical
spiritual part that you don't have to
believe in but I believe in it because
why not believe that the universe has
your back
you know the universe will support you
in whatever you want to do all you have
to do is put out that thought and really
focus on that thought and do the little
actions that it takes to take yourself
towards that goal whatever it is so
moving on here are my tips on how to use
the law of attraction to manifest
dreams and get what you want the first
tip is be aware of your beliefs so like
I said everything begins with your
beliefs so ask yourself maybe use this
as a journaling prompts what you believe
to be true about yourself and your life
so write down you know certain things
that you believe about yourself and then
go down your list and ask yourself are
these things that you actually want to
attract more of or are these negative
beliefs are these limiting beliefs
because sometimes we believe things that
don't really help us in our lives and we
believe in things that hold us back so
it's really important to uncover what
those beliefs are and start from there
examples of limiting beliefs might be
like it's so hard to make money or it's
so hard to finish school or it's so hard
to date you know if you have these
beliefs in your system in your mindset
then you're going to attract the same
reality to you so instead you have to
pinpoint that belief and then switch it
replace it with a more positive one it's
so easy to make money money comes easily
to me
it's so easy to find a soulmate you know
think of ways you can flip your negative
beliefs into positive ones and start
attracting more of what you want so a
huge huge thing that I have to note
about the law of attraction is that you
have to focus on exactly the thing that
you want more of exactly the thing you
want to attract so don't use sentences
that have a negative for example when
you're running late you can't be
thinking like oh I don't want to be late
I don't want to be late because that
sentence I don't want to be late late is
the subject you're still focusing on the
word late so the universe doesn't read
the I don't want to be part it just
reads as late so if you keep thinking I
don't want to be late I don't want to be
late
you're going to be late so instead you
have to slip it into a positive and
instead keep repeating a phrase kind of
like oh I'm an early bird I'm going to
be early I'm always early focus on the
subject so you notice the second
examples like I'm always early the
subject of that phrase is early that's
the word that you
focus on this is how important it is to
be detailed and very meticulous with
your words because your words have power
even if you're not trying to manifest
something if you even think of the word
or say the word you might be you know
attracting that to you another tool to
help you attract more of what you want
into your life is gratitude gratitude is
the key to bringing more abundance into
your life because the more that you're
grateful for what you have in your life
already the more things you're going to
find to be grateful for
so gratitude is like putting out
positive good vibes into the universe
and attracting even more of that back to
you so if you notice if you're generous
with other people you're going to
receive more abundance and generosity in
return so it's always always good to
utilize these tools to put out gratitude
and good vibes to attract the same thing
back to your life another tool to bring
more of what you want into your life is
utilizing affirmation so an affirmation
is a sentence that is like a power
statement something that you want to
embody something that you want to become
your life's and your reality so the most
powerful thing about affirmations is
that it is written and read in the
present tense so whatever it is that you
want in your life you can write it into
a statement but make that statement like
a present tense statement like I am
blank or I have blank for example I
personally like to read affirmations at
night before I go to bed I just repeat
them in my head last night I was
repeating I am powerful I am guided I am
protected the universe has my back so
something like that I'll repeat over and
over and over in my head just so I can
ingrain it into my beliefs so that that
can trickle into my actions and my
reality and also you know summer is
coming up lately I've been getting more
into fitness and health and one of my
affirmations is I am beautiful lean with
thin thighs and abs because I really
want to manifest a more healthy and fit
body so literally like I wrote that down
on my whiteboard and I've been saying
that phrase to myself on and on and on
just to remind myself to eat healthier
or
the gym and just let that statement
empower me to take the actions in my
life to get myself there another thing
you can do that's really helpful is to
start journaling your dreams and your
desires as if you already have them
so journal that in present tense
whatever your dreams and your goals are
write a journal entry in present tense
like oh my god I just reach this goal
and then explain how do you feel about
it how what's around you what's happened
in your life because of that just
journal as if it's real journal as if
it's happened because the more that you
feel this goal is real the more you feel
it into your reality the more you're
going to attract that reality to
actually come sooner this is really
powerful because when you're journaling
as if this thing is real you bring at
your emotions into it and then you
explore the detail if you kind of plan
out all the details of that reality and
once you know the details the more
you're going to be able to attract that
thing to you the faster it's going to
happen another tool you can use to
manifest your dreams is a vision board
now I've already made previous videos on
how to make a vision board which I'll
link here but a vision board is just a
way to envision the dream life that you
want the feelings and the visuals that
you want because visuals are very
powerful so the more that you can see it
as a reality the more you're going to
attract that thing to you the next step
that's also really important to
manifesting your dreams is to change
your behavior to act as if your dream is
already real so I already talked about
journaling writing that journaling
prompt as if you've already achieved
your dreams now I'm talking about acting
in your day-to-day life advocate dream
is a reality for example when I was just
starting out with my channel it was
really small I wasn't making any money
off of it I would go out and meet people
and they would ask me what do I do so in
the beginning I would be really hesitant
to tell them what I was working on I'd
be like oh I'm just dabbling in some
things but eventually I just started to
own it I started to be more confident in
it and just say I'm a youtuber I'm a
full
I'm content creator even when I wasn't
making that much money off of it I acted
as if that was my full-time job and
that's what I did and the more that I
stood firm and confident in that the
more it became a reality where now
that's where I am another thing I do is
I make decisions based on what my future
ideal self would make so my future ideal
self is a successful businesswoman and
so she would be willing to spend money
on resources or tools or things that
will help her she would be able to spend
money hiring people to help her run her
business
so even when now I'm in a very small
part of my business and if I were to
look at my current situation I'm like
okay I can't afford to spend money on
this course or I can't afford to hire
someone right now but I try to make
those bigger decisions to bring myself
to that next level because I know that's
where I want to be so I make it the
bigger decisions now if that makes sense
so change your behavior to match what
your ideal self would do and ask as if
you've already achieved the goal that
you want to achieve all right so the
last tip on how to manifest your dreams
is obviously take action action is such
a huge part of this equation and I truly
believe that once you take action the
universe will take its action and it
will conspire to help you achieve your
goals the universe works with you so
like I said life attracts like if you
take action the universe is going to
take action too so you want to work
together the universe is your
collaborator if you sit there and you
just wait for things to happen the
universe is also going to sit there and
wait for things to happen which means
nothing is going to happen so remember
to always take action because we do live
in a material real world where you have
to do things to move forward and make
things happen so I hope you like today's
tips on how to use the law of attraction
to manifest your dreams and get what you
want these tips are really just like the
tip of the iceberg because I feel like
the law of attraction is a huge topic
that you can really really dive deep
into so I might go into more videos in
the future for now I'll leave it at that
I do want to share my inspiration lately
on Law of Attraction it's this YouTube
channel called Leora Alexandra so I'll
link all of her videos below she has
really great videos so yeah I do have a
challenge for you today I want you to
think about one thing that you want to
manifest in your life whatever that one
thing is I want you to write a comment
as if that thing just happened it could
be one sentence it could be a whole
paragraph about your day and how great
you feel that it happened whatever I
just want to hear what it is that you're
manifesting okay thank you so much for
watching love you all and see you next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
