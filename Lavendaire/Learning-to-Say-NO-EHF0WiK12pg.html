I've been really working on the past few
months
is learning to say no it's so hard to
say no because naturally I just want to
be a nice person and I don't like
confrontation and I just want to say yes
because it's easier to say yes sure I'll
do it instead of no I can't no to me
just sounds mean it sounds like I'm
being a selfish person but at the end of
the day I realize it's because I'm such
a people pleaser that it's just hard for
me to like put myself first and I've
noticed this since I've been getting
busier lately more and more people just
like are reaching out to me asking me
questions people want to take me out to
coffee to lunch pick my brain and more
and more I realize that I have to really
learn to say no or else I'm just going
to be pulled into all directions and
there will be nothing left for myself
it's really hard for me to feel mean and
selfish but you do have to realize when
is the right time to say no and it's
okay to say no you have to give yourself
permission to say no I was kind of
inspired to talk about this topic after
I watched an episode of unbreakable
kimmy schmitt so in an episode of that
show Kimmy the main character is like so
nice and she's going above and beyond
helping out her friend and then she's
like driving an uber and Tina Fey comes
into the car a drunk
Tina Fey and she's just like you need to
stop putting other needs before your own
and after that I was like you're so
right
I feel like Kimmy sometimes where I can
be a little bit too nice sometimes and I
want to please everybody and I really
honestly do want to help as much as I
can but I only have 24 hours in a day I
only have so much energy and if I agree
to do something that I don't completely
want to do then it's not worth it
because I'm not giving my full passion
giving my 100% to that so more and more
I'm learning to say no I'm learning that
it's okay to say no and you can also say
no in a nice way where other people will
understand so for example I've been
practicing saying no a little bit more
lately um the easiest way to say no is
when brands email me to work with me
it's really easy for me to just say no
to those because there are so many
requests and honestly I really make sure
that I'll only say yes if I really want
to receive that product or whatever like
I say no to a lot of things because I
don't want a lot of junk sent to me but
on the other end what is hard for me to
say no to are two requests from my
friends and family because naturally I
want to say yes and I want to help in
any way that I can for example recently
a cousin of mine got married and I have
a lot of cousins I have like
20-something cousins and in the past
three years there this is like the
fourth wedding in the past three years
so I sang at every single one of my
cousin's wedding the first second and
third until this time and the first and
second time I'm like yeah sure I'll sing
like I was that was in 2013 2014 when I
was like doing music actively and I was
really happy to perform and then the
third one came and obviously I really
love my cousin so I'm like okay sure
I'll sing at your wedding that was a
time where I wasn't really excited
excited about performing and singing
anymore I kind of had gotten over it
because I performed so much in those
past two years and not to say that I
didn't want to sing at that wedding I
did want to sing I was happy to sing I
love my cousin and he chose a Celine
Dion song which I was really really
excited to sing cause I got to be a diva
but that was just the wedding where I
had these feelings where it may be like
I don't want to keep doing this anymore
so when you sing at a wedding it's not
just like casual you have to practice
and treat it like a real performance so
it takes a lot of time and effort on
your part and I remember when I was at
the day of the wedding I had to
check with the you know sing in the
venue before the actual performance and
during the soundcheck they took the
family picture like they took the whole
group family picture and I didn't know
that was going on and like I think my
boyfriend did come to get me to take the
photo but I was like no I'm like in the
middle of soundcheck and I treat it like
a real performance so I missed my family
picture and they turned that photo into
a magnet that everyone puts on their
fridge so I was kind of sad to have
missed that because I was a performer at
the wedding I want to sound like I'm
complaining but you get what I'm saying
like I'm honored to be asked to sing at
my cousin's wedding but at the same time
I've not gone to a wedding just for fun
I've always had like a job to do
as a performer in those past three years
so when this cousin another cousin came
around and was going to plan his wedding
this is the fourth wedding that happened
last weekend I knew I didn't want to
sing at it and I felt bad because I was
like I didn't want to seem like I was
playing favorites like I'll sing for
these three cousins but not you but I
was just at a point where I'm over it
I'm not really performing actively
anymore and I mean I'm just not feeling
it if I'm not feeling it I should be
able to say no so I kind of dreaded that
conversation because I wasn't sure this
cousin was gonna ask me and you know
during my grandma's 90th birthday a
couple months ago he asked me he's like
so I leave do you want to continue the
family tradition and sing at my wedding
and it was so hard for me to say
anything else I was like let me think
about it I don't know why I can't just
straight-up say no I'm sorry I don't
feel like I want to do that anymore but
I'm just like so nice I'm avoiding
confrontation this one so I kind of gave
a really wishy-washy answer but in the
end I reconfirmed and I said no I think
I'd rather just enjoy a wedding for the
first time as just a wedding guest
because I have
never done that before so the wedding
happened last week and it was so much
fun just to go relax and just like enjoy
as a normal person and I was happy that
I didn't have to sing I've learned that
if your body is telling you no you know
that you have to say no because
sometimes we want to be nice and say yes
but deep down like we already have that
feeling like no it's not I don't want to
do it or maybe you're unsure maybe
you're like 50/50 oh I can do it but I
kind of don't want to when you're unsure
it's like just say no learn to say no
and own your know marie forleo is always
talking about getting on the no train
and I'm so about that and I remember her
seeing a quote something like if it's
not a resounding yes from my entire body
the answer is no so this is just
something that I want to move forward
and make my life decisions based on that
feeling you know when you're 100 percent
excited and passionate you're like oh my
god yes I want to do it you know when
you have that feeling so only say yes
when you feel that 100 1000 % yes and
for everything else when you're like hmm
I don't know say no learn to say no I
know it's so hard but honestly give
yourself permission to say no so in
Oprah's book what I know for sure she
also has like a chapter on how she
started to learn to say no at the age of
40 so Oprah is a really giving person
and she talks about how everybody's
asking her to donate to their charities
and she always felt like she was kind of
obligated to write a check and donate to
their charity because she didn't want to
look like she was being selfish or
greedy or mean even when deep down she
didn't really want to 100% so she said
never again will I do anything for
anyone that I do not feel directly from
my heart I will not attend a meeting
make a phone call write a letter sponsor
or participate in any activity in which
every fiber of my being does not resound
yes I will
with the intent to be true to myself
when I accepted that I was a decent kind
and giving person whether I said yes or
no I no longer had anything to prove so
I think a lot of that people-pleasing
personality comes from the need to prove
that you are a good person to prove that
you are nice and kind and giving but you
have to realize that you are still that
person and you can still be that nice
kind giving person while saying no
because you can't say yes to everything
like literally if you say yes to every
request you will have no more time to do
anything for yourself you have to put
yourself first stop putting other needs
before your own another way that I'm
learning to say no which I feel like is
a transition point is to find a
compromise so for example when someone
asks me like hey Eileen I want to pick
your brain can I take you out to coffee
or lunch and I kind of don't want to
give them that full like one to two
hours sitting there at lunch talking I
feel like I can make a compromise so in
my head this is a real situation in my
head when I got that request I instantly
like froze up inside kind of like that
dreaded feeling like oh my god I don't
feel good about it I kind of don't want
to do it but I don't want it directly
saying no because that seems really mean
and harsh so I thought about it i sat
with myself and I was like you know what
what I'm okay with doing is just having
a quick phone call with this person like
a thirty minute call is much less of a
commitment than actually meeting for
lunch and having the whole shebang
so that is something like a transition
point in learning to say no so if
someone asks you to do something and you
don't entirely want to say yes but you
don't entirely want to say no see if you
could find some kind of compromise to
still be able to help that person out
but not to like dedicates too much like
time and energy to that request I know
I'm still figuring it out but I do know
that I have to listen to my intuition
and my body when it's telling me no I
don't want to do this and I
we'll only say yes when I feel that yes
1000 times % 1000 what I will only say
yes when I really really really really
really want to say yes no hard feelings
no offence don't mean to hurt anyone I
just need a look out for myself
