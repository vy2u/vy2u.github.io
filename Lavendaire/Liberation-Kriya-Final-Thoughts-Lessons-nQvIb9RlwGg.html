update video on how I feel after
completing this 40 day meditation that I
did called the liberation Korea a while
ago I did a video talking about the
lessons that I learned in the middle of
doing this meditation and I was talking
about learning about patience
perseverance and commitment and after I
made that video I completed the rest of
the meditation for 40 days and I want to
share some more lessons that I learned
in the latter half of doing this
meditation so when I started this
meditation it was very physically
difficult you know to hold my arms up in
that pose and I felt myself getting
stronger and stronger each day because I
was building these muscles and you know
it was getting easier and easier because
I was getting stronger and stronger and
that progress was really fun to watch
and I thought it would get to a point
where it became effortless that I could
just hold it up forever
well I learned that you know I could
hold it for longer towards the end but
it never really became effortless and
that's because you always have to be
trying you always have to be doing your
best and when you're doing your best
you're pushing yourself and that takes
effort you know it never gets too easy
because when it's too easy and too
effortless that means you're actually
not trying as far as you can you're not
pushing yourself to your fullest
potential and so I learned that to grow
you always got to be pushing yourself
you always have to be uncomfortable the
journey is never gonna get easy and so
that was a very you know powerful lesson
that I learned because you always got to
put in effort it's never gonna be a
breeze that journey is never gonna be
smooth sailing because if it is then
that means you're not putting out as
much your
trying as hard as you should be the
second thing is kind of a revelation
that I had around the 30 day mark I was
holding it up and I tried to actually do
better and push my arms out and really
use my muscles to push and be strong and
I realized that there is such a huge
difference between being active being
you know actively pushing your arms and
using your muscles versus being passive
and passive means just holding your arms
up but not like you know engaging so
when you're active you're actually using
these muscles and you're pushing
yourself you feel so much stronger that
way versus when you're passive you feel
like you're constantly battling gravity
being passive holding your arms up
actually hurts a lot more than using
your muscles and flexing and you know
pushing so there is a difference between
being active and being passive being
active you feel like you are in control
of your body and how you feel and you
feel so much stronger being active when
you're passive then you're literally
reacting to the environment you feel the
gravity pull you down and you're trying
to hold yourself up against gravity or
your environment and so I think that is
such a key difference that in life you
got to be active and when you're active
you are in control and you feel like you
own it and you're much stronger versus
when you're passive you let your
environment pull you in different
directions and you just don't feel as
powerful that way so be active push
alright so those are my two big lessons
from doing the latter half of this
meditation but I also learned a lot of
many lessons along the way you know like
if you're not getting stronger you're
getting weaker
and again commitment was a huge lesson
throughout this entire journey you know
around day 30 32 through 40 I was
seriously so committed that giving up
was not an option I was like I'm going
to do this every day I'm excited to do
it because I want to finish you've come
so far that it's such a waste if you
give up now so commit to the end and if
you have that strong commitment then you
will be able to conquer anything because
you won't take no for an answer and
you're just gonna keep going
so commit and just do it so I also
encourage you guys to commit to
something for 40 days you don't have to
do this liberation Korea like I did it
doesn't have to be meditation it could
be any simple habit for 40 days and keep
a diary of how you feel every day
because you're gonna be so excited to
see the growth to see how you're
building a new habit in 40 days that's
how many days they say it takes to start
a habit I think 90 days is how much it
takes to really solidify a habit and I
don't know just learning to commit to
something and seeing the results it's
very motivating and you're gonna be so
strong and you're gonna be able to
conquer anything because once you commit
to this little thing you're gonna learn
to commit to something bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger and then you can
literally do whatever you want so that's
all I have for you guys for today
I hope you like this video thanks for

you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
