dare today I want to share a simple idea
that could help make your world a lot
more beautiful I've been reading a
return to love by Marianne Williamson
and this book has just been so healing
and inspiring I picked it up because I
had this gut intuition that I kind of
needed it at the moment because
throughout January I had been so
scatterbrained and a little bit too
focused on chasing my goals and
ambitions I felt like a piece of the
puzzle was missing and this book
literally brought me back to love and it
just reminded me how important it is to
put love first because love should
always be our first priority over
everything that we want to do in life so
here's the idea that can make your world
more beautiful and it's really simple be
a living expression of love we are
already living expressions of love we
just don't always choose to express the
love that we have within us we usually
hide it or hold it back because we just
want to protect ourselves but what we
want to do is to choose love over fear
and tap into that power within ourselves
to bring love into the world through our
actions or through our words through us
all it is is a shift in perception to
put love first and to express love and
all that you think say and do when you
put love first you are choosing to see
the world through the eyes of love which
immediately makes your world much more
beautiful you see the positivity the
good and the hope that is all around
rather than focusing on the fear and
negativity and you see the good in
people and how perfect they already are
rather than focusing on their human
flaws and there's just a lot of
beautiful things that happen once you
start to see the world through the eyes
of love
and choose love over fear as you choose
to see the love in the world you start
to find it everywhere and you notice the
little miracles that are happening
everywhere every day as I'm shifting my
perception back to love I notice so many
little examples of love in places that I
normally would take for granted you know
moments like a really great conversation
at dinner or laughing with my cousins or
something nice that a person did for me
that shows that they care
simple things little things just there's
literally love everywhere if you choose
to see it also when you express love and
all that you think say and do you are
automatically contributing to the world
in the best way love can be expressed in
so many different forms it's compassion
kindness helping supporting or uplifting
others it's being genuine and authentic
giving serving it's being confident in
yourself and loving yourself and just
doing things that you love we're doing
these I make you happy like singing
dancing playing sports anything when you
think speak and act out of love you are
affecting the people and the environment
around you in a positive way
making the world around you more
beautiful the world genuinely needs more
love and I know that we all have a lot
of love to give so be a living
expression of love and you'll make your
world and the world around you a much
more beautiful place alright that's it
for today thank you so much for watching
before I go I want to share this
Kickstarter campaign by my friend life

that is super awesome so it's a candle
that has a powerful mantra on the
outside for you to meditate to and as it
burns you will find another surprise
mantra on the inside that you can then
give to somebody else or share with the
world jazz is an example of a living
of love she is so awesome and she's
always coming up with new ideas to help
others and to add value to people's
lives so check out her Kickstarter
