favorites video so this past month flew
by for me I feel like this month was the
month that I kind of had a lot of new
things come into my life and so I'm just
readjusting with everything that's going
on this month I have a few great
favorites in books music videos and
products so I'm gonna start with a book
because it's what I'm most excited about
this month the book that I'm currently
reading it's called the power of now by
Eckhart Tolle and this book has been on
my reading list for the longest time and
I even read a new earth which is Eckhart
Tolle his other book and I really
enjoyed that book so I knew that the
power of Matt was gonna be good I just
wanted to read it at a time when I was
like prepared to read it because Eckhart
Tolle his work is like so spiritual and
he cuts to the core that it really like
changes you from the inside out so I
kind of had it like just on my reading
list for the longest time and finally
decided to dive into it this month so I
am over halfway through the book and I
just enjoy it so much because I feel
like I'm learning and I'm growing and
I'm just becoming more conscious and
aware each time I picked that book up
and read it so when I read my ten pages
at night I really feel calm and peaceful
and just reading the book itself makes
me more aware of the present of this
current moment and it really helps me
enter the now as he calls it so if you
guys have not heard of Eckhart Tolle
definitely definitely check out his
books I think I would probably start
with reading the power of now I started
with a new earth because that was more
highly recommended by Oprah and it was
his newest book but I feel like the
power of now is more of his foundation
of his teachings so so good and it's
hard for me to explain it it's just
something that you have to read it for
yourself and really dig deep and take
the time to sit in it and understand it
for yourself my next favorite is this
mini three video series called tiny
feminists and it's directed by Yu Lin
Kwang the story follows these three
three schoolgirls who gather to form
this tiny feminist club to fight for
their rights as women so it's just
really adorable and really fun to watch
especially because of their little
references and I'm just so happy to see
more content like this being put out
there like it's just very refreshing to
watch and it's just I know that you guys
will enjoy it once you watch it you Linc
Wong is an amazing director she comes
out with such great content and I just
you know watch it don't just go right
now my next favorite is this crime ER
lab shadow off eye cream this was sent
to me by peach and Lily calm they are a
Korean online retailer they sell like
Korean beauty and skin care products so
if you guys know me I love Korean
skincare products like ever since my
trip to Seoul last November I have
discovered like a whole new world of
Korean skincare products because I just
feel like Koreans know how to treat
their skin really well like they pay a
lot of attention to skincare so they
have so many different products out
there that are so great so this eye
cream specifically is supposed to
brighten those dark eye circles and
reduce fine lines so I love using this
because it's so rich and I love putting
rich creamy things on my face because my
face is really dry also I was doing some
research on this brand and it turns out
that Michelle Phan also uses this eye
cream and she also really loves this
brand creme ur lab so that gives it some
credibility because I really look up to
her for my beauty and skincare knowledge
another one of my favorites this month
is this silver eye necklace by Maggiore
so I just love silver accessories right
now especially if they're like dainty
necklaces so I've just found myself
wearing this like every day pretty much
for this past month alright let's move
on to my favorites in music so at the
beginning of the month I for some reason
got really into learning the lyrics -
time to say goodbye bye Andrea Bocelli
I'm sure you guys know that song it's
like a classic but it just happened
really randomly I was hanging out with
my dog and I was just singing and I
- mumble the words to that song because
I've always just mumbled the words to
that song because it's in Italian and I
stopped myself and I was like wait I
know Italian like I know how to read
Italian I learned basic Italian when I
was studying in Italy so I was like how
did I not learn this song sooner so that
day I looked at the lyrics to that song
and I started learning them and it took
me like a day and I have to learn the
whole song and memorize it and I just
had so much fun listening to it and
singing it again and again it's just I
don't know I'd like to learn songs in
different languages sometimes because
sometimes I hear an English song if I
hear a song like two or three times I'll
already know the lyrics in my head I
just feel like I absorb music really
fast but when I hear a song in another
language that I like then it's more of a
challenge to learn that song so I'll do
that so I do that with a lot of Chinese
songs I'll if I like a song then I'll
look up the lyrics and I'll learn the
lyrics and I'll learn to sing it even
though I don't know what every word of
that song means so I guess I could do
that with Italian songs if I really like
them because I can technically read
Italian so I just had a lot of fun
learning that song and singing it that
song led me to listen to all of Andrea
Bocelli's song he has a new album where
he sings like old cinema songs and that
albums really great and he has one song
that's another one of my favorite songs
this month it's called a beauty pen so
with Ariana Grande
so listen to that song especially if
you're an area on a fan she is so good
she sounds so good her voice is so like
light and angelic but also she has such
a huge range paired with his voice
ondrea's voice it's like deep and rich
and beautiful it's so great that song is
so beautiful and they do this thing
where the the climax of the end of the
chorus they harmonize and that it's like
a tragic chord if you guys listen to the
song you'll know what I mean by tragic
chord it's so beautiful I also love when
the guy takes the higher part of the
harmony and the girl takes the lower
part I think that's always really pretty
so I just love
of that song I got really into that
Andrea Bocelli this past month I'm gonna
play it here so you guys know what chord
I'm talking about the tragic chord
listen to Ariana
so this is a major and then it goes to
the something else
it's so good is so pretty so that the
size was so good you just have to enjoy
and listen to it so beautiful
so aside from Andrea Bocelli this past
month I was getting ready for Coachella
which is in two weeks
Coachella is literally my favorite time
of the year because one I love
springtime too I love the Sun and
sunshine three I love music and I love
dancing I love festivals so I'm just so
excited for that event so in preparation
for Coachella
I made a Coachella 2016 playlist that
I've been listening to on and on that
playlist includes just the artists that
I'm excited to see at Coachella so it's
pretty biased I don't have all the
artists but they're just like whatever I
want to see whatever I like and also
I've started a new spring 2016 playlist
so in that playlist I put all of my
current favorite songs that I'm digging
and most of them are just like really
fresh sounding beats and cool vibes and
if you listen to it I think you'll just
get what kind of music it is I don't
really know how to explain it but to me
it's really fun so I'll link both of
those Spotify playlists below so you
guys can check them out and follow me
the spring 2016 playlist is one that
I'll be continually updating all
throughout spring if you guys don't know
about my Spotify playlist I make a new
playlist every season because I have a
low tolerance for music meaning I get
sick of songs pretty fast
so I've learned that in three months
after hearing the same song for three
months I'll get pretty sick of it so I
need to like stop hearing it for a while
and listen to some new stuff before I
can go back and appreciate it again so
the way I set up my Spotify is each
season I have a new playlist and when I
move on to like the next season's
playlist what I'll do is I'll move over
the songs that I'm not tired of yet onto
the next season's playlist and if I ever
have any songs that I do not get tired
of like songs that are on repeat at my
absolute favorites then I add those to
my those soundwaves playlist on Spotify
so you can find all of those on Spotify
I'm
kind of like you know a music freak
where I really like to organize my music
and make sure that I'm listening to
things that are fresh things that I'm
not tired of all right so that's it for
my favorites for this month let me know
what you guys liked and what you want to
see more of what you want to see less of
and yeah I guess now I'm just gonna sing
time to say goodbye to say goodbye
because yeah I'm proud that I learned
all the lyrics so I'm just gonna show
off if you're Italian don't judge me but
if you're not Italian and you don't know
Italian then enjoy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
