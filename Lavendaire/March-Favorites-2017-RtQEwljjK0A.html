today it's going to be about March
favorites and I'm going to make it short
because today I'm going to catch a
flight to London and Amsterdam which is
going to be super fun by the time this
videos out I'll be in Europe so before I
begin I want to announce that I'm
changing my channel upload days to
Wednesdays and Fridays
instead of Wednesdays and Sundays so on
Sundays I already uploaded a podcast and
so it felt like a little bit too much to
do a podcast plus a video so I'm just
going to have podcasts on Sundays and
videos on Wednesdays and Fridays so make
sure you come back and check on Friday's
now instead of Sundays and Wednesdays
I'll be here as usual so yeah also I've
tested out uploading my podcast to
YouTube and although a lot of you did
comment that you liked it it just didn't
get enough views as other videos and
it's just like I've decided that it's
not going to work I'm going to stop
uploading my podcast to youtube so if
you want to listen to the podcast listen
on iTunes or SoundCloud or stitcher or
Google Play it's basically everywhere
where podcasts are available alright
let's jump into March favorites so I
have a favorite pair of shoes for this
month I just got these shoes and I've
been wearing doesn't like ninety percent
of the time because one they're
comfortable too they match with
everything so I wanted to just get a
pair of black sneakers that I could wear
it every day and that would match
everything that would look stylish and
be comfortable at the same time so I got
these nike who Archie Nike I think I
can't pronounce this word but it's
called nike air horror Archie don't
judge me but anyway I love them they're
black and white so it's super simple and
it matches everything and this is
actually my first nice black and white
sneaker and let me tell you guys so I've
always been like a person on a budget I
liked
bargains in the past so I would not
allow myself to buy Nikes at full price
I would only let myself by Nikes when
they were on sale so you know the ones
that go on sale are always like the
colorful one
so this time you know with the
minimalism and everything is like by
what brings you joy keep what brings you
joy all of that so I've decided to just
like you know what I'm a splurge on a
pair of full price Nike so that's what I
did
I splurge on a black-and-white sneaker
I'm old enough to do that now so and I
don't regret it because they go with
everything I wear them almost every day
and I'm going to travel I'm only
bringing those shoes plus another pair
of sneakers and I'm like a sneaker girl
I will wear sneakers every day as I can
and I do
my next favorite of the month is an
audio book it's called born a crime by
Trevor Noah oh my goodness if you don't
know Trevor Noah she's like so charming
he's a comedian he's the host of The
Daily Show I love him so so much so I
got introduced to him because my
boyfriend loves watching standeth comedy
and we went through all of his stand-up
comedy's on Netflix and he's the kind of
guy that after his show is over like he
leaves me wanting more because he's one
he's funny too he's a great storyteller
3 he's really charming and 4 he comes
from such a unique cultural background
he's from South Africa and he's born
mixed and he had all these like
interesting experiences growing up and
he sees America as a you know from an
outsider's point of view I think he's
smart he is just so interesting so I am
just all about him his book is so good
you have to listen to the audiobook
version versus like reading the print
one because and a lot of the stories he
speaks like all these different
languages all these different South
African languages and it's just so eye
opening to hear his stories coming from
growing up during apartheid growing up
in poverty growing up as the only mixed
kid in a black community all of these
stories that you're like oh my god
because I feel like me I'm born in the
first world this is what I know but he
has seen a lot of stuff and it's just it
makes me so proud to see how far he's
come he came from just
such like a different place and now he's
like host of The Daily Show and doing so
well so just you have to have to get
this audiobook and listen to his stories
I'll post a link below for those of you
who want an audible free trial to listen
to this book for free
do yourself a favor and listen to it at
least listen to it for an hour and tell
me what you think tell me you are not
captivated in his world my next favorite
is in music so this song is called the
scientist by Corinne Bailey Rae it's
actually a cover of a Coldplay song and
it's on the fifty shades darker album I
think I haven't seen the movie I don't
really care about that
50 shades whatever but that album is
actually pretty good
so Corinne Bailey Rae I haven't heard
her voice in years I think this is how I
got to that song I was going through the
CDs that I have in my car I haven't
touched the CDs I haven't taken anything
out or put anything in since like I
would say 2011 or 2012 so those beauties
have been in there for a while so one
day I just decided to go through and
check what CDs I had in my car one of
the CDs was Korean Bailey raised I was
listening to her and I decided to look
her up on Spotify and I discovered that
she had a new song she covered the
scientist and this is one of those songs
that in the first like five seconds and
like I love it I know it's going to be
on repeat just because it's so beautiful
it's so just her voice is so raw so
beautiful with everything like the first
moment I heard the song I felt like
dancing to it and I've been taking like
contemporary dance classes so I'm all
about that like emotional style right
now but yeah that first day I was
playing it on repeat I was actually
shooting my video the sweet acts video
when I was listening to this song on
repeat I was like dancing around in the
room while I was shooting like my
sleeping video yes so that's a good song
my last favorite of the month is a
bundle of things surrounding Pinterest
so I don't know if you saw in my last
video I mentioned that I'm getting into
Pinterest I want to be more active on it
and level up my Pinterest game so follow
our Pinterest
right here down below but I actually
took a Pinterest class by Melissa
Griffin and I'll link that down below
basically it's a Pinterest class to
teach you how to use Pinterest for
blogging and to kind of grow your
traffic and grow your blog and I've
never really taken Pinterest seriously I
never took my blog seriously because I
took my YouTube seriously I feel like I
understand YouTube really well but I
don't really understand blogging as well
I don't understand Pinterest as well and
it blew my mind because I had a friend I
have all these like people I follow on
Twitter who are bloggers in the space
and they just blown up because their
Pinterest has grown and because their
Pinterest has grown then they are just
receiving so much more traffic to their
website so if you're in online business
if you have a blog if you're wanting to
start a blogger business get on
Pinterest I would not like paid to
promote this or anything but I'm just
telling you this was like all that my
month was about it was learning about
pinches taking this course and then also
using this thing called board booster
which I'm on like a free trial but it's
something that you used to like schedule
your pins and to loop your pin boards
which saves a lot of time because
instead of like pinning every day you
can like batch all your pins at once a
week or something and schedule them to
post throughout the week who knew who
knew Pinterest was so crazy alright
that's it for my March favorites video
thank you so much for watching let me
know in the comments what type of videos
you want to see in April because I'm
planning my new content schedule so post
your suggestions below I'd love to hear
them and I'm going to be off to my trip
so I'll see you when I'm back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
