Welcome back to Lavendaire.
I'm a little late, but I'm gonna do the March
review where I share my highlights, lessons,
and favorites from the past month.
So March highlights.
I think the big highlight - and this happened in the beginning of March so it felt like a while ago.
We hit 500,000 subscribers on YouTube, which
was crazy because it's halfway to a million.
I don't know, it was a very, very big number for me.
And I'm just grateful.
Thank you guys so much.
I feel like all my dreams have come true and they're continuing to come true.
It's really, really crazy.
It's just surreal.
I don't know how to explain it except that it's wonderful.
And another thing I did in March is: I got invited to go to Hawaii with Hyundai.
And that's a vlog that you guys will see very soon, so I won't talk too much about that
because you'll see the entire vlog story there.
Another thing that happened this month was: I got my first tattoo.
I don't really think it's a big deal, but it sounds like a big deal to get your first tattoo.
Actually, technically it's not my first tattoo.
My first tattoos are my microbladed brows.
And then I have this little lotus w ith a stem on my arm, and I got it at -
it's a funny story because I got it at the Eggie brunch,
the Eggie party that Jenn Im threw for her brand festival collection launch, and they
were giving out free tattoos.
And I know, it's so funny, because it was just there and I looked at the designs and
I really, really thought they were cute.
They were just tiny, cute, delicate designs.
And a tattoo is something that I've considered getting, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.
But because it was there, I don't know, I was feeling bold that day and the time felt right,
and that designs looked cute that I was like, &quot;Why not?&quot;
I think when I was younger, the idea of getting a tattoo was such a big deal
like, &quot;Oh my gosh, you're getting something permanent on your body?&quot;
And now it's not a big deal anymore because the body is just temporary.
I remember Elizabeth Gilbert told a story of a friend that she had that had a lot of
tattoos on her body.
And she would ask her friend, &quot;How could you do that?
How could you put so many permanent things on your body?&quot;
And her friend was like, &quot;You don't understand.
It's temporary.&quot;
And Elizabeth Gilbert was like, &quot;What do you mean?
The tattoos are temporary?&quot;
And she's like, &quot;No, your body is temporary.
Life is temporary.&quot;
And so I think I kind of got that as a reminder that life is temporary, that the body is temporary
and that everything's gonna be gone in the
future, so live your best life now.
And I love flowers.
You guys know, I'm very inspired by florals.
I love that it's a lotus because it's a Buddhist,
spiritual-ish kind of flower, in my eyes.
And really, I think the beauty of flowers is that they are beautiful while they are
alive, but they are temporary.
They die fast.
I have flowers in my home right now that,
they last like one week, one to two weeks.
But that's the thing about them.
When they're here, they're so beautiful and
they really freshen up your space.
Basically, they shine their light and their
beauty while they're here.
And then the next moment, they're gone.
So that's the general meaning of why I picked
this tattoo and why I really like it,
just to remind myself that me as a &quot;flower&quot;
to shine when I'm alive, and just create beauty
as much as I can.
And remember in the end that I'm gonna die,
body is temporary, and that's fine.
That's beautiful.
Moving onto a couple lessons that I learned this past month.
I feel like I've learned so many lessons and
wrote a lot of them down in my workbook.
But a couple that I can share is something
that I keep coming back to, but I always get
reminded of it,
is to just stop worrying about what others are doing.
Don't compare yourself to others.
Ultimately, just stay on your path, keep working, stay humble,
and bring your light to everything that you do.
So that's something that I constantly have
to remind myself, to trust in the universe,
that everything is happening on its perfect
timing, in its own perfect way, and that I
will be okay no matter what happens.
Even if it doesn't seem like things are going
okay, or even if I'm worried about certain things.
the only thing I can do is focus on the effort
that I put in and the light that I bring to
my creations or to my environment.
Lead with light.
I don't know if you guys remember, my theme for the year is &quot;Lead with light&quot;.
And a really cool thing is I recently got to interview Rebecca Campbell on my podcast.
She is the author of Light is the New Black.
So back in January, I mentioned that that
was one of my favorite new books that I've
listened to recently.
It was super cool that she took the time to
come on the podcast,
and we did it at an awkward time for me because
I wanted to accommodate her schedule.
So it was my 1:00 AM in LA, to her 9:00 AM in London.
But we made it happen.
And one thing that I learned from Rebecca Campbell: We each have our own personal cycles,
similar to the seasons.
We have the springs, summers, autumns, winters.
So springs and summers are times where new ideas are blooming,
things are happening, you feel like things are in flow, you're having fun.
Things are going well.
It's just sunny, basically.
And then autumn is the period of PMS, things going wrong, frustration, things falling apart.
Winter is a cold, quiet downtime.
And then back to spring when things start blooming again.
And basically, we have to honor our cycles,
understand that it's completely normal to
go through phases of ups and downs in our life,
and have high energy sometimes, low energy other times.
And it was just reassuring to hear that because it's true.
Everybody probably does go through those cycles of seasons.
And sometimes we feel guilty for being in
the autumn and winter times of our lives when
we should just embrace it
and understand that it's necessary to go through
the autumn and winter in order to come back
to the spring, get re-inspired and reborn again.
It was a really nice metaphor and I hope that helped you.
Moving onto some favorites for the month of March.
The book that I'm currently listening to on Audible is &quot;The Wisdom of Sundays&quot; by Oprah Winfrey.
This one, I'm not sure if it's a written book, but what it is,
is it's a collection of Oprah's interviews
with different people from Super Soul Sunday.
She has Eckhart Tolle, Michael Singer of The Untethered Soul, just all these famous authors
and thought leaders on her show.
To me, I just feel like I love Oprah in my life, I love always hearing her voice,
hearing those teachings from her and all of
the people she interviews.
And a lot of the people, I would say almost
half of the people she interviewed, I've heard
of them before, I've read their book.
So it's nice to refresh my mind of that person's
teachings and that book that I might have
read a couple years ago,
because Eckhart Tolle, I read &quot;A New Earth&quot;
in like 2015 or 2016, so it's been a few years.
And it's nice to get reminded of these really
important spiritual teachings.
Sometimes you forget.
You know, after you haven't read a book for a while.
So I love that The Wisdom of Sundays book
is a refresher in all these different areas
of personal growth.
Next, some things that I've been watching at the moment.
I'm still watching Hyori's Bed and Breakfast.
I'm on season 2.
And I'm watching IU-TV which is IU's behind the scenes vlogs on YouTube.
I don't know, I'm just such a huge fan of her.
I find her so adorable and interesting to watch.
It's basically like watching her vlogs, and
it's nice because I like watching behind the
scenes of music video shoots
or recording at the studio because I love
seeing how artists work.
After watching the behind the scenes of a
music video shoot, I'll watch the music video
and it'll make me appreciate that video so much more
because I know how much work went into it
and the artistic vision behind it.
And I feel like I always like watching the
behind the scenes because it enhances the
actual work itself.
Sometimes I feel like the story is more interesting
behind the scenes vs. the final artwork product.
I don't know, that's just me.
I'm also watching Terrace House, the brand new season.
I watched two or three episodes and it's hilarious.
I've missed Terrace House so much, so I'm
so happy that it's back.
I think this season is a lot more interesting
than the past season, the Aloha one.
That one was pretty slow.
This one, things are happening from the first and second episode.
Generally, those are my main favorites from March.
I don't want to make this video too long,
so I'll wrap it up there.
But just letting you guys know that I love you, I appreciate you so much.
Thank you for being here and watching, especially
if you've been watching and supporting for
many years now.
It's almost the fourth year anniversary for Lavendaire.
I think end of April will be four years with
this channel, which is crazy because it doesn't
feel like that long.
But I think, if you think about four years,
that's a pretty long time.
A lot can change in four years.
So I just want to encourage you guys to go after what you want, do whatever you want
to do, and start now if possible.
The best time to start is now, because you don't want to regret it in the future.
You want to at least give your dreams a try.
And if they're truly your dreams and you really
want to make them come true,
then it's gonna be worth it to work really
hard for them and take all the risks that
you need to take in order to get there.
At this point, obviously I'm so grateful where
I am now, but I'm so grateful to the Aileen
from 2014 who took a chance
and started making videos on personal growth
on YouTube, because back then there were no
people my age on YouTube talking about these topics.
If there were, their channels were really,
really small and I couldn't find them,
because I tried really hard to find channels
like this one that I created today.
And now, four years later, I see so many channels
popping up on self love, personal growth,
spirituality,
all this stuff that it felt so weird to talk
about back then, but now it's become more
and more normal which is so cool.
So I just want to encourage you guys to go
after whatever it is that you want, because
it's possible.
And thank you so much for supporting me.
I love you guys and I promise to be back with better videos.
I'm trying to just create from my source of
light and I'm trying to be as authentic as
I can.
Sometimes I do get stuck, because sometimes
my analytic side of my brain wants to do what
I think will do well on YouTube
and then it doesn't do well and I'm like,
&quot;What the heck happened?&quot;
So I think, moving forward, I always have
to lead with light, do my best to be authentic,
and just trust that that will take me where
I'm meant to go, and not try to rush things.
Alright, have a beautiful day.
Love you guys so much.
