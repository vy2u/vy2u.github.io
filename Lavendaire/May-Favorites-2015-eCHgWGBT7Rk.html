because summer is right around the
corner and i love everything about
summer i'm a warm weather person and I
love to swim and you know just do all
those fun summertime things may was a
really good month and it was a month of
travel and change for me I went to
Shanghai for a very short trip just to
visit family and see my grandma and I
also went to Maui with my girlfriend's
to celebrate a belated birthday and
before you ask yes my hair is different
I feel like my hair has gone through
like four different color changes since
the last time I filmed the video so to
update you guys I first dyed it in
Shanghai so I dyed it gray blue ombre
but it came out really dark that it just
basically looked black and I didn't like
it so I let it fade for a little bit
just by washing it and a couple days ago
I did this thing called color fix where
you remove permanent hair dye from your
hair and I did it just on the bottom to
create some kind of own breathing and
this is unintentionally rose gold
looking but i really like it right now
so i think i'm going to leave it for a
little bit and just let my hair rest so
on to my may favorites this month my
first favorite is this gadget this is
the way come graphics tablet called it
in to us and i invested in one of these
just because it makes designing and
editing a lot easier you know if you're
a creative person and you're always on
photoshop or premiere or you're doing
things where you need to move around a
lot then I think you'd be really fun to
to get one this just makes my creative
process a lot more fun and enjoyable
that I actually look forward to editing
more because I get to use this thing so
my second favorite are these shoes these
are the nike lunar racers and I love the
colors of these sneakers and they're so
comfortable they make me feel so bouncy
and fast because they're meant to
be you know running shoes I took these
shoes to Shanghai and they're just a
great shoe to walk around the city in
and be comfortable but still feel
stylish the next favorite will sound a
little bit passé but I still want to
mention it because I liked it so much
it's my previous hair dye called lunar
tides in smoky purple and smoky mauve
lunar ties is an Etsy store and I think
it's just one girl who's handcrafting
all of these hair colors so if your NT
pastels and want to get that smoky
pastel look rather than the bright look
then I'd recommend checking them out my
next favorite is a book that I'm
currently reading it's called a new
earth by eckhart tolle I'm only halfway
through but I already enjoy it so much
because i feel like i'm highlighting
every other paragraph in this book
everything is just so insightful and
it's one of those books that makes you
really step back and think about how
you've been thinking your entire life
and I guess it helps you step out of the
box and look at just the human beings
and how we are and I don't know it's I
really enjoy it I feel like it's
something that you have to read for
yourself to find out what it's about but
it's very eye-opening and I highly
highly recommend you guys read it it
will definitely improve your life all
right next up is my favorite song of the
month this song has been on repeat and
it's just such a smooth Jam it's called
gigantic by Torah and this is a remix
it's pretty groovy and it's really fun I
recommend you guys listen to it it's on
my those sound waves playlist on Spotify
so follow that playlist I put all of my
favorite and most played songs on to
that playlist I'll put the link below
and lastly my favorite out of the month
is the Amazon Cloud Drive app so if any
of you guys have amazon prime you
actually get unlimited storage for
photos on the Amazon Cloud Drive and I
didn't know this until recently but it's
such a game changer it's so cool because
now instead of offloading my photos by
plugging in my iphone
i just upload them to my cloud drive on
amazon and i can delete them from my
phone and i don't have to connect
anything ever and it's just very
convenient to know that i can upload
things to the cloud and have unlimited
storage for photos I am just I am about
to shift my whole life to the cloud you
know that's the future so I I enjoy that
very much and if you guys have amazon
prime then go check it out alright
that's it for my may favorites for this
month let me know what you guys are
digging lately if you have any favorite
songs or books you'd like to share
please share because I love checking out
new stuff and I love to hear what you
guys aren't into I think that's it my
next video will be about my favorite
books of all time so be on the lookout
for that one next and have a beautiful
day
maybe dumpy we just need a cell
