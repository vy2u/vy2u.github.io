favorites and I cannot believe that May
is over I feel like that month really
flew by for me a lot of things happened
first of all excuse my voice because I'm
not at 100% right now with my voice
I had my cousin's wedding this past
weekend and it was a two-day wedding
Saturday was the tea ceremony Chinese
style and Sunday was like the
american-style banquet and everything
and there was a lot of like wooing and
singing going on I mean it was just a
lot of fun I mean weddings are always a
lot of fun my cousins are really fun
people so yeah I'm just recovering and
it's Tuesday I was like I have to shoot
a video because tomorrow's Wednesday so
what's up so aside from the wedding I
also went to Santa Barbara last weekend
which was so so beautiful and so fun it
was my first time going to Santa Barbara
and I kind of planned it a couple months
in advance cuz I knew I wanted like a
creative retreat just to get away and oh
my goodness I just loved it so much it
was so beautiful I love Spanish style
architecture and the ocean and the
weather was perfect someday I realized
during this trip is that whenever I
travel I love to look at the buildings
and the architecture if the buildings
look different than what I'm used to
that I'll be like oh my god like it is
so beautiful and I really love
architecture so even if it's just like a
Starbucks that looks different if it's
like a different style architecture I'll
like want to take photos of it because I
just think it's so beautiful
architecture is like something I really
admire when I travel also the Airbnb
house that we stayed in up there was so
cute and quirky and just really well
decorated so our Airbnb host is a
wedding designer and planner so you know
that she knows how to decorate really
well so yeah that was really inspiring
just to stay in such a really cute place
all right moving forward let's start
sharing my favorites for this month so
the first favorite I'm so excited to
share with you is this Ozzie
three-minute moist deep conditioning
treatment for your hair
and this is so good it works so well you
guys know I've had bleached colored hair
for years and I'm always like changing
colors and I really care about taking
care of my damaged hair so I've tried
out so many different like hair masks
and deep conditioning treatments in the
past this works so well for being like
$3 for this bottle honestly the hair
masks that I use they're like 15 to 20
bucks and honestly this works better
than a lot of the stuff that I've tried
in the past and it's just so surprising
so definitely if you guys have damaged
hair or you just want to try out a new
deep conditioning treatment try this out
the Aussie three-minute moist and I love
the bottle there's no like cap basically
this is a hole and you just squeeze it
and I don't want to squeeze it right now
but basically it comes out really easily
you just like pick it up squeeze it so
there's no like messing with like
twisting caps and putting on caps for
the hair mask tub yeah I love this thing
so much and I can totally see myself
buying this over and over again next up
I've been really enjoying making teas
for myself and for guests that come
around so I've got sent this really cute
box of T's by Rosalee tea so they are a
tea subscription service where each
month they send you a box of three teas
that you can try and I think for tea
lovers this is like a really good model
to just get sent three packets of teas
each month this box has lemon ginger
squeeze milk along and Jen matcha and
I've tried all three of them I would say
that my favorite is either the lemon
ginger squeeze or the milk along I like
both of those flavors I think Jen matcha
is just like a typical green tea that
I'm used to so it's not as special to me
but honestly I really enjoy teas and I
think teas are like an art in itself you
can just mix a bunch of tea leaves
together to create like a new tea and
with these three teas you don't have to
like have them separately you can also
mix them to create like a fusion tea so
I think I'm just really enjoying having
a cup of tea in the morning
or in the afternoon and it just like
makes your day that much better so I'm
really happy that they sent this check
them out rosalie t my next favorite is
this super sleek minimalist wireless
charger so it's called the cheese stone
and it basically looks like a flat stone
that you put on your desk and then you
plug this other little hidden flap onto
your phone so that you can just charge
your phone wirelessly and I just think
it's super cool I think wireless
charging is the future and although
there is something that you do have to
plug into your phone it's just been
really convenient for me to just like
put this on my desk and charge my phone
really easily without like dealing with
the hassle of wires so I think that's
really fun I think this is like a really
good gift for people who are either tech
lovers or minimalist people because if
the design is just so simple and you
know minimalizing the wires and making
your texting seamless that is something
that's really cool next up I want to
share some of my favorites in media so
I've watched some pretty entertaining
stuff this month and the first one being
Ali Wong's stand-up comedy called baby
Cobra if you guys have Netflix honestly
search baby Cobra Ali Wong tonight and
watch it it is hilarious because she is
like so funny I think as an
asian-american woman obviously I can
relate a lot to her
but also she talks about like personal
growth and she mentions the
life-changing magic of tidying up and
basically I just feel like I relate to
all of her references like deep hog
Oprah you guys have to watch it you
won't get it now but she's just she's
really funny but at the same time she's
super smart and she's just very open
very vulgar in a way that is just
hilarious so I thoroughly enjoyed that
something else that I've really enjoyed
watching this past month is season 2 of
unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and first of
all I just love that show I love Tina
Fey I love that type of humor so much
and I really just went there's healing
through really quickly I don't watch a
lot of TV shows honestly most of the
times I
not watching any shows I don't really
catch up on those shows like Game of
Thrones or whatever the only shows that
I watch that I catch up with are fresh
off the boat and unbreakable kimmy
schmitt I used to also watch once upon a
time but I honestly stopped watching it
it got boring for me but yeah I don't
watch many shows but when a show I like
comes out I'm all on it and lastly two
short films that I really really enjoyed
were by Huen Kuang the first one is
called I ship it and the second one is
called Angie and Zara
first of all I've shared you Lin's work
before she's a director on YouTube and
she makes such great content like it's
very fresh very internet friendly and I
don't know I just really love her style
anything she's gonna do big things I
ship it is like a cute breakup slash
love story and it has a ton of Harry
Potter references so I think if you like
Harry Potter you might like that short
film and Angie and Zara is the other
short film that I really liked it's
basically two girls who are best friends
surviving together in a zombie
apocalypse so it's kind of like that
apocalyptic setting but focusing on like
really cutesy female friendship which i
think is something that is just so fresh
like you don't see that in mainstream
media and I think people like you Lynne
like indie directors real creative
artists are so important so if you want
to support in the artists the creators
of the future go check out you Lynn's
work she's amazing
next up I'll talk about my favorites in
music so this past month I actually
wrote a song called carry on and it's on
my channel a few videos back so if you
haven't heard it feel free to listen to
it I also made a video where I talked
about the meaning of the song and my
process of writing it and I'm pretty
proud of it I really like it I'm
planning to like record it and produce
it with my friend boquete who you might
know because I use a ton of his music in
my videos but yeah I wanted to record it
but my voice is obviously not there
right now hopefully I'll heal by like
Friday and then I could record it over
the weekend alright that's it for my
favorites for this month
so I have a few upcoming events that I
want to announce so the first one is I'm
planning to hold a live Google hangout
slash webinar free events in two weeks
so on June 15th that's the day that I've
written in my calendar to do my webinar
so basically it's gonna be a live Google
hangout event where I'll be sharing a
lesson for an hour and you guys can like
chat me and I'll answer your questions
in real time I think that will be pretty
interesting because I noticed a lot of
people are doing more live hangouts and
that kind of thing and I want to try it
out just see what happens and it'll be
like a lesson related to creating your
dream life right now I'm kind of
deciding between three topics and you
guys can totally like how might be
comment below let me know which topic
you want me to talk about for that first
webinar so the first one I'm thinking
about is how to adopt a success mindset
and I've broken it down into eight steps
so kind of like developing that solid
mindset that will help you become
successful in life the second topic I'm
considering is how to take control of
your life like empowering yourself as
the captain of your life so that you can
go steer yourself in any direction you
choose kind of like taking more of an
active part in creating your life and
the third one is how to hone in on your
purpose and vision to start creating
your dream life so those three topics
let me know which one appeals to you the
most and if none of those appeal to you
let me know what other topics you'd like
me to talk about feel free to comment

this is something new that I'm doing and
I just want to test and see what you
guys like what people even want out
there we'll see so yes save the dates
Wednesday June 15th at 6 p.m. Pacific
time for my live Google hangout free
webinar the topic will be decided after
I read your comments to this video so
seriously comment below with what you
want to see also later this month
around the time of my webinar I'm also
gonna be doing a giveaway so I thought
it'd be nice to have like a mid-year
giveaway because I haven't done a
giveaway since like my holiday one in
December so I think I should do one in
June why not so I think I'll figure out
the details for that later on but just
stay tuned does it giveaway coming
lastly if you haven't listened to my
podcasts yet go on iTunes search the
lavender lifestyle and listen to it
because this week I have an interview
with life by jazz she's another youtuber
blogger yoga instructor and together
we're talking about learning to love our
bodies so yeah make sure you check out
that episode it's my first interview and
it was kind of a rocky interview where
we had a lot of technical difficulties
and even editing it in post was kind of
like a learning experience for me but I
think moving forward I I know what to do
better now so yeah the podcast it's a
learning experience I think hopefully it
will keep getting better and better
because right now I'm still in that
learning process of getting it at that
high quality that I want it to be so
