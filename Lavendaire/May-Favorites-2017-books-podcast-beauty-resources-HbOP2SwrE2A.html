Welcome back to Lavendaire.
It's so good to see you again.
It's time for May Favorites.
I gotta be honest.
I feel like this past month,
I've been pretty uninspired.
I've just been going through this weird rut.
But on the bright side of things, it means
I took a lot of time to find new inspiration
and new resources.
So I have a lot of those to share with you.
But I did make
a podcast episode on what to do when you're
feeling uninspired,
so I'll leave the link to that below.
But yeah, it dragged on for the month.
I'm just accepting it as a time where I just
have to reevaluate myself, what I'm doing,
recalibrate my goals, and just find simple,
little things that can make me happy,
little things that I can do that will inspire
me.
Anyway, let's jump into the favorites.
First favorite of the month is an audiobook:
You Are a Badass at Making Money by Jen Sincero.
I love this audiobook so much.
I don't want it to end.
I'm almost done with it.
And Jen Sincero, I listened to her first book,
You Are a Badass, but this second book, I
love it so much more,
maybe because it's more relatable to me.
Maybe because I have a lot to learn
and grow in the money mindset department.
So yeah, if you feel like you're in a place
where you kind of have negative views about
money, maybe you hold yourself back
from making money because you think that it's
dirty or negative
or you don't want to seem greedy.
Whatever it is, this book will help you
shift your mindset into a more positive one
to invite more abundance into your life,
because money is actually just a resource.
It's just a tool.
It's really the people
behind the money that does things that are
either good or bad.
So it's not the money
that's the problem.
It's the people.
But that's another story.
Anyway, money is empowering
and it's something that we all deserve.
So definitely check out this audiobook
if you want some inspiration to make more
money.
My second favorite book of the month is The
Artist's Way by Julia Cameron.
This book is like a classic for all creatives
and artists.
I think it was written in the 90's.
If you guys are familiar with morning pages–I
talk about that a lot on my channel–
morning pages comes from this book, The Artist's
Way by Julia Cameron.
I decided to start The Artist's Way because
it's one of those books
that I've heard about for years, but I never
really decided to read it.
And I was at a party where an actor friend
of mine told me that he recently finished
reading
The Artist's Way and going through the whole
program and it changed his life.
So I took it as a sign that I should try doing
it too, since I've been feeling uninspired
and in a rut.
So I'm on like Week 2 of the program.
It's a twelve-week process.
Every week there's different exercises and
journaling prompts to help you
unblock your creative channels.
So if you're a creative going through the
same thing,
some kind of rut, then this is your sign to
read The Artist's Way.
Next up, I have some favorites in skincare.
I've been using this
Nudu toner and moisturizer almost every single
day.
I took it with me
during my travels in Europe, to Coachella,
to San Francisco.
It's like perfect travel size,
but most importantly: I love the smell of
it.
Nudu is an all-natural beauty brand
based in New Zealand.
I think they source their ingredients from
New Zealand.
So it's very unique, the ingredients they
use and the smell is just so unique.
It's sweet and floral-y at the same time.
I just really think it refreshes my skin.
It's a good change-up from the normal Korean
beauty brands that I normally use.
And I love that I'm discovering more and more
natural beauty brands,
because I think that's the direction we should
all go into: cruelty-free and all that stuff.
Another product I've been loving is this Eva
NYC hair mask.
I actually got
a sample-size of this mask in January when
I went to Gen Beauty, this beauty event.
And I loved it.
With my hair, since it's colored and it's
bleached, it's really hard for me
to find a mask that I really like, a mask
that really transforms how my hair feels.
And this mask is one of those amazing ones.
I definitely know I'm going to be
repurchasing this mask because it's one of
my new staples.
Alright, now I'm going to move onto my favorite
media from the month,
things that I've been obsessed with.
Number 1: Terrace House: Boys &amp;amp; Girls in the
City
on Netflix.
There was a good few weekends where I was
marathoning Terrace House all day,
way into the night, 3:00 or 4:00 AM.
I'm a person that I don't really like to watch
that many shows.
I try not to watch that much TV.
But if I get into a show, I get addicted.
Maybe that's why I try to stay away from stuff,
but anyway, I got a couple friends
that got me into watching Terrace House, so
that happened.
I hibernated for a couple weekends to watch
it.
And I loved it.
It's a Japanese reality show where six strangers
move into a house
and you just watch their lifestyles evolve.
And I think it's really interesting
just because you get to see the Japanese culture,
the way of living,
how they're so polite and they cook for each
other.
And it just makes me
want to go back to Japan and eat everything
and, I don't know, live that life.
It just looks so fun.
Basically, I'm living vicariously through
these people that I'm watching.
Another media resource that I've been really
inspired by–and I actually found out
about this guy through someone in our Facebook
group–is TaylorCutFilms.
I'm not sure if you guys have heard of him.
He's pretty big on Instagram.
He has a YouTube channel where he makes films,
travel films.
They're like works of art.
As a videographer and an editor, I really
love to look at other people's work
that inspires me and try to learn what they
do: their techniques of editing and shooting.
After learning more about him, I realized
that he was a videographer or filmmaker
for a lot of music artists.
He did stuff for Usher, The Chainsmokers,
etc.
More importantly, he has editing tutorials
on his YouTube channel.
If any of you guys are out there, you want
to make some cool films or cool vlogs,
I'll link his whole playlist of tutorials
down below because I've watched like every
single video
in one night and I learned a lot.
So it was just a really good resource.
My last media favorite of the month is called
The Tea Party Podcast.
And this is a podcast hosted by two music
guys in the UK.
One of them is a DJ.
One of them is a producer.
And I only listened to their first two episodes.
I recommend that you start with the first
episode.
Skip the first five minutes,
and then listen to episode.
It's basically a good podcast for you if you
are a creative,
whether you're in music or whatever industry.
The first episode is really interesting
because you get a behind-the-scenes look at
the music industry
because these guys have worked with a lot
of big names like Alicia Keys, Rihanna,
and a bunch of other people.
Just listening to their stories and also listening
to their journeys and the lessons they've
learned along the way, because the producer,
I think they said he started out as an intern,
he was getting coffee,
just doing the dirty work for the record label.
And then nine months later,
he won a Grammy for working on Rihanna's album.
It's really interesting
and he also mentioned The Slight Edge which
is a book that I love.
So yeah, that was a source of inspiration
for me this past month.
Side note: I actually had an interesting moment
of synchronicity regarding this podcast.
I found out about this podcast because I was
telling my DJ friend,
&quot;Oh, I've been uninspired,&quot; blah blah blah.
And he's like, &quot;Oh, I listen to this podcast.
It's so inspirational.
It might help you,&quot; so he sent it to me.
I decided to check it out a while later.
I listened to the first episode and I loved
it so much that I decided to tweet it
and I tagged the two hosts, the DJ and the
producer.
A couple hours later,
I got a DM in my Twitter from Complexion,
the DJ from that podcast.
And he told me, &quot;Oh my god, what a coincidence.
I was recently cleaning out my room,
and I was watching your videos to learn how
to fold clothes and tidy and whatever.&quot;
At first, in my head, I was like, &quot;Oh, cool.
What a coincidence.
Whatever,&quot;
because a lot of people watch my tidying videos.
But on second thought:
That is a weird.
It's such a strange synchronicity, these two
things happened at the same time.
We watched each other's content, and this
was content that was both made in 2015.
My videos on tidying are from 2015.
his podcast episode was from 2015.
It's really random that we crossed paths at
the same time like this,
so I just thought that was strange and kind
of cool.
I don't know, I just wanted to share that.
Alright, that's it for my May Favorites.
Please let me know if you have
other inspirational, educational, or empowering
resources that you'd like to share
because I'm always on the lookout for more
stuff to fuel my soul.
Alright, have a beautiful day.
See you next time.
