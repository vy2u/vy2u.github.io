Welcome back to Lavendaire.
We are halfway through with 2017.
I know: It's crazy.
But this year has been really good to me,
so I hope it's been
just as good to you.
At the beginning of the year, I created this
video
where I shared my 2017 goals and my theme
for the new year.
I thought it'd be a good idea to check in
with you guys midway and just see
how I've been doing with my goals, and go
through my mid-year review.
I don't know if you all know this, but I created
something called The Artist of Life Workbook
that I sold for its first year for 2017.
It's a workbook where there's a bunch of questions.
It helps you plan out your most intentional
year, and basically, there's a section
where we do monthly reviews.
There's January, February, March, April, May,
June.
And then after June, there's a whole two-pager
for your half-year review.
Today, I'm going to answer some of these questions.
I'm not going to do all of them
because some of them are specific to the workbook.
If you guys want to do this midyear review
with me, I've created a free worksheet
you can download.
Just click the link down below.
It's a little different from the workbook,
but it's what we're going to be doing today.
If you're interested in diving deeper and
actually planning in detail, your goals
and everything for the rest of 2017, then
the workbook (digital version) is still on
sale.
This print one is sold out.
I'll be making new ones in 2018.
But you can totally get the digital version.
That one's just the same.
Alright, first question: What have I accomplished
so far in 2017 that I am proud of?
I feel like it's been a big year for Lavendaire
already.
I've done so much that I'm so proud of.
First of all, we hit 200,000 subscribers.
Thank you guys so, so much.
I'm super, super grateful.
My channel's been growing a lot this past
month that it kind of scares me in a way.
It makes nervous, for some reason.
It's just something that I'm not used to.
But I am obviously so, so grateful that it's
happening.
Thank you guys for joining me.
I love you all so, so much.
Something else that I finally did recently
is: I made an official business for Lavendaire.
Literally, last week, I opened my business
bank account and I'm feeling very official.
And I also–This year was the year I started
hiring people onto my tiny team.
I have a wonderful assistant named Alice.
And I have a podcast editor.
And then I recently just hired a web designer
and developer to redesign my website
and all that stuff.
I'm feeling like this year is the year where
I am building something
greater than myself and getting help from
other people because I've just been used to
doing everything by myself, and now I realize
how much value you can get
by bringing more people into the team.
Big girl stuff.
Another thing I'm super proud of is starting
my Artist of Life Mastermind group on Facebook.
This Facebook group is related to the workbook.
Basically, it's a group
where I do monthly live chats and then every
week we have different self-reflection prompts,
and we share our weekly wins.
I've just been working really hard at getting
that group
as engaged and as valuable as possible, just
because it's something that is really important
to me.
It's very fulfilling to me to be able to directly
help people and actually
get to know you guys one-on-one.
I feel like I know a lot of you guys on a
deeper level
through that Facebook group, so it's really,
really cool.
Another thing I'm proud of is: This is the
year that I got over my fear of connecting
with other people and collaborating with other
people.
I have a collaboration
coming up next week, actually, and I've done
a couple collaborations in the past year.
And if we just rewind two years: Two years
ago, I was scared to reach out to people.
I was scared to connect with people that I
admired online, to reach out to
other influencers or reach out to photographers
to shoot.
I was just nervous
to ask people for help, just because there's
some anxiety in asking people for help
and reaching out to other people because I'm
so introverted and I'm so used to
depending on myself and myself only.
So this is the year that I've gotten over
that fear.
I've met and connected with so many new people
this year
and worked with so many new people.
So that's a big milestone for me.
Next question: Does this year feel aligned
to my 2017 theme so far?
What can I do to live my theme more fully?
My theme for 2017 was Space.
I wanted to create more space for me to breathe.
I felt like, at the end of 2016, when I was
designing this workbook and program,
I was really in hustle mode.
So I was not having work-life balance at all.
It was 100% work and no life.
This year I wanted to balance it out and give
myself more room,
more space in general.
And I would say that I kind of live my theme,
but I did fall into times where I was just
working a lot and not giving time to myself.
On one hand, I feel like I lived up to my
theme because I gave myself
more room to take breaks.
And I let myself play, go out with friends
more,
and I basically let myself do more creative
stuff just for fun.
Another thing is: I've been doing The Artist's
Way program.
I've been doing more morning pages
and taking myself out on more Artist's Dates,
which is just a date
where you do something for fun, do something
creative, make something.
Doing that, plus hanging out with friends
more this year, traveling,
it's really been good for giving myself space,
space in my life.
On the other hand, one thing that was really
important for me for making space in my life
was to meditate daily, and I have not been
on point with that.
I started at the beginning of the year and
then I stopped.
And I would just do it randomly
and then I stopped meditating for almost a
whole month.
And then I recently started doing it a couple
days ago.
A couple days ago,
I just had to have a self-care day, which
I'll make a video on that later.
It's been teeter-tottering of this theme,
but I think I would give myself a B,
if I were to grade myself on how well I was
aligned with my theme.
Next: Go over my goals that I set at the beginning
of the year.
Let's be real–
What can I eliminate or change to feel better
about my goals?
Alright, here are the goals that I set back
in January in that video I made right here.
Meditate daily to create space, peace, and
balance.
I already talked about
my journey with meditation.
It's still on-and-off.
I guess I haven't found the right way
to commit to it with my schedule.
If you guys have tips for me, definitely post
below.
Sometimes I don't have time in the morning
and then I'm way too tired at night,
but I think morning and night are probably
the best times to meditate.
I'll work on it.
Second goal: Create two or more videos a week
on YouTube.
Yes!
Success!
I've been doing this goal since January.
I have to admit: It did get pretty tough
in January and February.
Then I think in March or April, I got the
hang of it,
because it's essentially doubling the work
that I used to do in the past.
But on the positive side is, it kind of doubles
the views, it doubles your growth,
and all around, I think it was a good choice
that I made for my channel.
But I have to be honest, guys.
It is a hustle, and for the future–I don't
know when–
but in my ideal situation: I want to go back
to doing one video a week,
one really good video because two videos is
just a bit much sometimes.
And my ideal life, like I said, I need more
space.
I want more time for self-care and just relax.
Third goal that I posted was: Finish my book
by October 2017.
This is a disappointment because I was working
on creating the book in January-February,
and then I travelled in March, and then Coachella,
and then social things happened,
and now it's summer.
And now, I feel like I had to reevaluate.
This is a big goal
that I really wanted to commit to.
But it's also a big goal that I realize I
have to shift,
just because it doesn't make sense to do it
right now.
So I did the research,
and I'm not at the place where publishers
are reaching out to me,
but I'm not exactly sure that I want to self-publish
either.
So I think I have to focus
on growing my YouTube and growing what I have.
And then, in the future,
when everything's a little bit bigger, then
the book will be easier to get done.
So I'm giving myself more time with the book.
I know it might sound like an excuse,
but I do admit: I was procrastinating in the
first few months of the year
where I really could've worked, made progress
with the book, but at this point
I realize there's some better things that
I should work on.
I could be more strategic
and focus on growing my YouTube, growing my
brand, to the point where, in the future,
it'll be easier for me to publish a book because
things are bigger and better.
My next goal was to do daily posts on Instagram.
Before this year,
I didn't post that much on Instagram.
I wanted to get better.
So I would say
from January until May, I did really, really
well at posting daily on Instagram.
I'm really proud of myself at how much I posted.
I had to get really creative
with getting photos on the weekends, and what
happened was: I think, in June,
I stopped posting every day.
I just kind of gave up the goal because, basically,
I felt like I lived up to my challenge.
And then, at this point, it was just extra
work on my plate.
And like I said, my theme for this year was
Space.
And so, it wasn't a challenge anymore
and I needed more space to breathe and not
have so many tasks on my to-do list.
I happily gave myself–&quot;You don't have to
do this goal anymore.&quot;
In a way,
I think I'm taking a break because I know
I'm traveling for three weeks in July.
And three weeks is a lot of time to travel,
have a lot of photos.
So I know I'll be posting
a lot of photos during that time that it will
offset and balance it out.
I'll have 365 photos within this year.
So yes, I am rolling over photos.
Next goal was to exercise, dance, move, and
stretch at least three times a week.
I would say, I would give myself a C+ on this
goal.
I did it, but sometimes I did twice a week
or once a week, but I didn't feel bad about
it.
I know this sounds pretty anti-climactic
because you want to hear that I did all my
goals.
But I'm a normal person too.
I'm not perfect.
And you know what?
My mindset is &quot;Strive for progress, not perfection.&quot;
So as long as I'm striving for it, I'm trying,
then at least I'm taking some steps towards
that.
And I'm not going to be so hard on myself
if I'm not perfect.
Honestly, a huge win for this category for
this year is: I started to dance again,
and I haven't danced in three or four years.
And I started doing contemporary dancing
on top of hip hop.
I took classes at a studio for a few months.
And that was good exercise,
but also really fulfilling for my creativity
and my spirit.
So that is a win.
Even though I didn't exercise three times
a week, every week, I'm still really proud
of myself
that I got my butt up, I bought a pass to
a dance studio, and I started dancing again.
I also started running again at the gym recently.
That's my next thing that I'm focusing on.
My dance pass expired, and since I'm travelling,
I don't want to pay for anything
at the moment.
So I'm just running, running when I can.
My last goal of the year was to limit my time
on social media to three times a day.
I feel like I haven't been keeping count,
and even though I've done a little bit better
in social media,
not checking it so often, I feel like it's
still pretty bad and I do want to still work
on this goal.
This is a goal that I'm still gonna work on.
Something that I've been doing is:
When I'm working, filming stuff, whatever,
I put my phone on airplane mode.
I don't have access to internet.
I don't even get calls.
I also just recently discovered
an app called Moment.
This is an app that keeps track of the screen-time
that you spend on your phone.
I found out about it from someone in our mastermind
group
on Facebook, so I'm gonna test this out and
track the time I spend on my phone,
and work on shortening that time I spend looking
at my phone.
Last question: What are my top three priorities
for the next three months?
So that's July, August, and September.
My priorities, number 1:
Redesign the Artist of Life Workbook.
Number 2: Enjoy my travel time with my family.
We're going on a three-week vacation.
So just let myself play and not stress out
about work.
Give myself some much-needed self-care.
Last priority is finish the redesign
of my Lavendaire website, my channel arts,
all the banners and stuff.
That's been something I'm working on for a
while.
I just didn't realize
how long it takes to work with designers and
going back and forth.
This is something I wanted to finish in April
or May, but I'm being patient.
I know things take longer than you expect
them to, so I'm just going to keep working,
keep chipping away at it slowly and slowly.
Alright, that's it for my mid-year review.
If you guys want to do this for yourself,
then I'll post a free worksheet down below.
All you have to do is add your email.
Or, if you're interested and you want to pick
up a copy of the Artist of Life Workbook–
like I said, only the digital version is still
available online.
But it's very, very valuable.
There are 68 pages of questions and worksheets
and things like that, if you like that sort
of thing.
If you haven't already, make sure you click
that bell down below
to get notified of all my new videos.
I upload on Wednesdays and Fridays.
Although, in July, I might upload a little
bit less.
It just depends on how many videos I can finish
before I go on my trip.
Alright, have a beautiful day!
Love you all so much.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
