today's video is another episode of
artist of life a series where we feature
real people who are actively creating
their dream life today I'm so excited to
have my dear friend
Alisa here with us she goes by doctor
Alisa chopped apart shy and she is a
mental health mindfulness and wellness
advocate who's created the website calm
corner an occupational therapist by
trade she's worked with people from age
0 to 97 with a goal of spreading mindful
awareness in everyday life hi ELISA
hi Eileen how are you I'm so well how
are you doing I'm great great so I want
to talk to you about what you do in your
life just the aura that you have because
you're so calm and you're just so
welcoming it just in general so were you
always like this where did it come from
right anything as a child I was you know
quiet reserved but I wasn't scared or
shy and I grew up in Thailand for five
years when I was five to ten and then I
moved back here and started middle
school so I think with the Thai of
bringing to with the Thai culture and it
has ingrained in me to be calm but I
wasn't as calm you know until more of
the later years
I like the super calm where I'm aware
that I'm calm so it's through meditation
that I've been more calm so can you talk
about like the challenges that you've
gone through that have kind of got you
inspired to go into mental health and
right I remember especially the
transition when I move from Thailand to
here when I moved back here that it was
super challenging I would you know cry
myself to sleep cried to my mom why do I
have any friends so I knew what it felt
you know how it was like to be lonely
and not really belong anywhere no one
else really looked like me
so that was difficult so I having a
teacher who said if you want a friend be
a friend so I was like okay so the next
day this is an 8th grade I spotted a
girl in the red jacket who's having
lunch by herself so I approached her and
we're still friends until this day so
yeah yeah yeah so talk about your
journey to meditation because I know
that I'm a crazy meditation course in
Thailand where how did it start and what
have you done so far ok so all my life I
felt like I've been through school you
know from kindergarten through my grad
school to the doctorate degree I didn't
really get a break and I felt like that
was really challenging so the moment
that I started working that's when
there's a lot of things that was
unexpected so I began to feel depressed
and not really wanting to get out of bed
my contacts are still in you know in my
eyes and not really taking care of
myself so so I knew that something had
to change and so one day I looked in the
Thai newspaper and I saw that there's a
96 year old monk who's going to be
speaking at this this temple this is
where we're at what bottom echad that
he's going to come for father's day and
to you know talk about give a Dharma
talk so I came with my dad
and at that event he talked about the
opening of the meditation course next
month so I'm like huh what is this I
wasn't sure but I've had some
experiences with meditation when I was
younger I would spend summers with my
grandma
and she would take me to a lot of
temples and your whole family meditate
like no one yeah we would maybe go on
like meditation retreats for for a week
you know at the temple and we call it
this like we were a temporary nuns we
will they're all white and we couldn't
eat after noon time so this I started
when I was nine so we would go on this
retreat and I remembered just you know
being silent and just experiencing that
sense of calm at a young age so I still
when my grandma was still alive would go
back every summer and you know go to the
temples but not really meditating but
just being there in that culture and
then so part of that meditation journey
so I enrolled in the course not really
knowing because it's a six-month course
and yeah and so Ron Paul witty young
said in toto he's the monk he's 97 now
who created the course and through you
know 40 50 years of his journey as a
monk and developing that willpower and
the course he's spread compassion and
meditation through through his teaching
so there's six or seven locations in
Canada that's taught in English there's
around 300 locations and there's three
in the US and so with the LA one so they
opened up in January 2015 I enrolled it
without knowing if I can complete the
course because there was six months it
was on the weekends you know I would be
working full-time and then having to
dedicate time here so I didn't think I
could finish it and I struggled because
I didn't really know anyone there was
around 200 people in the course I was
the youngest one and I couldn't really
relate with anyone I would sleep in my
car during lunch because I was so tired
but then once an older sister reached
out to me and have me helped out at the
IT department there I was able to find a
more sense of belonging and then I you
know from then my meditation family
became my family
so now though so can you explain how do
you meditate you know okay yeah what is
your process like okay so my process so
after the six months course then we also
did our final practicum which final exam
in da antonin which is in Thailand so
that included a five-day hike at the the
highest mountain in Thailand and so I
knew that what I took from the course
was that having a word or mantra that
was the beginning towards a well
practice meditation so having if you
have you know your positioning is good
your you have your the mantra the word
and then you go on from there things
will be easier smoother so your that's
how if you have a strong foundation you
can then develop into to a stronger
branch or yeah right I thought what's
interesting when we're talking about
meditation like before this video yeah
basically the way Elysa meditates is she
focuses on one word great and it's a
Thai word
yeah means enlightenment we put tool
right so it's a Pali word actually oh
but yes but it doesn't have to be that
where it could be any word you know even
the instructor like and any word would
would do yeah you just have to focus on
that word so even when I'm driving you
know drinking Starbucks or walking my
dog I keep that word in my mind and I
feel like it's taught me to be real your
contrabass my mantra yeah which is cool
because anybody can incorporate that you
can take a word that's your mantra and
meditate anywhere you don't have to be
sitting down we're going to be walking
going about your life and we're just
bringing your mind back to that work and
help calm you down right and you could
do it while standing or lying down any
yeah position yeah right I think most
people think like oh the meditation is
so hard I have to sit down for an hour
and it can be more simple than that
right so you asked about what my
practice looks like so ever since my
grandma who's very dear to me passed
away in April 2016 last year I knew that
you know
we can't take life not seriously you
know you have to be intentional and so I
you know when she passed away that's
when I really committed to a daily
practice so so far it's been very good
and I make time for it you know sitting
meditation or the the walking meditation
but to do to try to do at least 30
minutes a day oh yeah in the morning for
me right now it's been whenever I can
find a time I'd like to you know be more
consistent preferably in the morning the
monk little poverty yang said that's the
best hour it's kind of like the Golden
Hour it's 4 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Wow yeah so I I know not a lot of people
do it but if you can do it it's I think
part of the belief is that it's very
quiet in that hour the party goers you
know kind of go back to bed now and then
they're the early risers haven't woken
up yet very interesting so golden hour I
mean there's I'm a night owl and I stay
up til like I mean I've seen up to like
four or five sixty like work and the
reason why I used to like of things that
late is because it's so quiet like
nothing else is going on the nose
distractions and I I understand that why
you would want to meditate during that
time yeah yeah since we're on the topic
of meditation about you give some tips
for beginner plant eaters because I know
a lot of people want to get into
meditation right maybe share some quick
tips sure part of the few tips which
I've gained from taking the course is
that it doesn't have to be thirty
minutes when you start it could be five
minutes right but five minutes three
times a day that's 15 minutes already
and if you do that every day right and
for a month that's a lot of minutes yeah
and once you do that the goal is that
you accumulate roll power you become
more patient you become more
compassionate so I definitely saw a
change in me and in the way that I'm
more calm when I deal with my family
right because I live with my parents so
you know dealing with family members and
brother and siblings it's it can be
tough when and so I felt like I saw a
change in me and then a change in how I
do
my job as an occupational therapist I'm
devoted I'm present and I really enjoy
what I do
and so I really believed in the course I
got my mom to join the cord machine she
was the second the second the second
class who took the course and so yeah
this sounds like meditation has really
enhanced your life overall is your
personal and your work life which is
amazing so I think it can benefit
everyone so you did mention occupational
therapy do you want to talk about what
you do and what do you love about it so
some people may not know but an
occupational therapist which call ot for
short is a profession that deals with
the everyday activities so occupation as
whatever occupies your mind or you know
your the daily activity so the moment
you get up brushing your teeth putting
your clothes on - driving - drinking pee
- skiing right any activity so if you
have some sort of barriers it could be
physical or emotional then or mental
right mental barriers we look at that
and we try to help you live your dream
life right like whatever if they want to
go back to you know their job or to
their community we help them to get
there so no so is a lot of it mentally
yes even though like and you know a
traditional ot may work at the hospital
setting or clinics or schools or home
base a lot of it you know we we look at
the physical aspect but a lot of it is
mental - if they don't feel like it it
they're not motivated you know how do
you meet them at their level so that you
can address some of those goals that
would bring them happiness right and so
it sounds like it's so seamless with the
meditation and the mindfulness and being
present with your job right so that's
it's interesting how you found that
perfect spot right so you did do your
work
so can you actually expand on what
exactly you do in your job sure so as an
occupy
shanell therapists i right now work
three jobs with three different agencies
but I chose that way because I like the
flexibility and the freedom there may be
a lot of driving but I've learned to you
know listen to podcast and inspirational
talk so that's fine but I get to work
with
first of all kids and you know kids that
I work with you know they may have
anxiety or PTSD or ADHD so how do you
you know consider that and then work
with them on emotional regulation how to
be calm and focus during homework or
play or you know in their daily routines
so at where I'm at we were on the first
ot and so there's a lot of advocacy that
goes on there too and so you're like
your own boss in a way but we were given
or I was given one office so with that
one office and you know if you know
about teas and pediatric ot you know you
usually have a gym and swings and all
that fun stuff but here there's one
office so as part of my job we need to
be creative too and so I'm like okay
we're going to use the hallway we're
going to go outside we're going to use
the elevators as a handball court we're
going to use the Rolley chair as you
know to get their sensory input so they
can focus and do more the task in the
task that they need to do so that's one
example with working with kids but
working with kids are also working with
parents and caregivers and teachers and
different disciplines so there's there's
that I guess luxury but you need to be
able to work with others too and for my
older adults in the home I meet them
where they're at so they're in their
natural setting and they're too weak to
go to the outpatient clinics right so I
go into the home and and it's you know
using the resources that they have so
sometimes we use canned goods as weight
or you know we try to work on the fine
that their endurance we may do coloring
I can bring in meditation we can do some
breathing so I feel that I can bring in
my passion
you know mindfulness meditation into
into my job yeah yeah I'm sure you're
like enlightening those as well and
enhancing their life that's was a really
fun job because you're actually helping
other people with their life like yeah
living the life that they want to live
yeah one of the patients or caregivers
was telling me she was like you know out
of all the therapists or the different
disciplines who come to visit our home
you were you're different and she was
like do you practice meditation so like
she asked me then I was like very
surprised like she was saying how I was
able to reach you know her mother who
spent the client and get to a certain
level that no one else could reach
through to her how because I feel like
most therapists sound very sciency and
there it's very like surface level right
and I feel like what you do you bring
your whole self to help others and with
the meditation my own is background that
helps a lot yeah so yeah definitely like
therapeutic use of self that's that's
what we learned in in ot school but that
it comes into play a lot so whether with
kids or you know with me and you or you
know people strangers right you need to
present or how do you relate to others
and kind of make them do what you want
in a way not not manipulate becoming
yeah but like okay with it yeah right
what they with what they want to do make
it fun yeah yeah that's Valley so I know
that outside of like your work and
personal life you also are on a mental
health board yes okay so my dad used to
work for the dorrance county supervisor
Michelle Steele and he notified me of
this opportunity that you know we can
get involved at the local level and he
knew that I was super interested in
mental health and based on my experience
personal experience and also working
with others too and
I knew that I wanted to dedicate time
for this now during that time I was
still you know doing my full-time job as
an OT and taking the meditation course
so I couldn't imagine yeah I was busy
already I couldn't imagine dedicating
time to this too but I applied and was
appointed right as a board member there
so I began to get more involved I didn't
really know anything and I was the
youngest one so like you know so there
was challenges too but another
opportunity related to that came up a
few months after I join in in April 2015
they had an opportunity for us to the
Mental Health Board to represent at the
state level and I volunteered to go and
I was able to learn more about what the
local met what the other mental health
boards are doing across California
there's you know 30 around 30-something
County so we were able to you know meet
and and so from that experience you know
they I just came back from another
meeting in San Diego and they were very
impressed with with you know how I can
deal with conflict and willing to work
you know just to be there and show up
and they they they appointed me a second
vice president of the California
Association of local behaved behavioral
health and Commission so that's the full
name but but it made me realize that we
are needed our generation Millennials we
are needed we need to sit at that table
to advocate and just bring ourselves
even though we know nothing we need to
fake it we just need to be there and
just be present and be helpful you know
and share just show up in the clubs
that's that's 80% and we need to do more
of that and I see like at the county
level or at the you know state level you
know it's more important than that right
that now is the time because if not now
when
right it's going to be never so just I
know it might become
well that's how I felt I felt alone I
felt that you know why am I doing this
why am i spending time but it's so
important I think that's awesome because
you take the time to do all this extra
work and actually get involved at the
county and the state level which a lot
of people don't think about yeah how do
people don't even realize that they can
do that that they can contribute in some
sort of way so that's really cool like
the older people they're going to be you
know retiring like we need like we need
to make our voice heard so if you really
care about a certain cause or you want
to make some change in your community
there are ways to do it there are ways
to like get involved which is awesome
right and for me too like with the Thai
American community which is near and
dear to my heart you know I might it
helps it are you know my parents are
involved in the community and they give
back and they donate their time and so
I've seen that aspect and I'm able to
keep up my tie because of the
opportunities that came up whether as an
emcee or just tell about volunteer or
through the meditation community so
there's different ways to be involved so
can I ask you what does your dream life
look like maybe fast forward like five
years maybe you're living it now right
now what does it look like um it's
always a hard question because I'm
usually I'm like in the moment kind of
person and like if I think too far ahead
I may get you know anxious and if I you
know look back then I met might get sad
you know about the things but you know
part of my dream life I think just being
bring my bring myself into everyday you
know situations because to have a happy
future it starts with today so I'm like
okay the things that I can control today
or what can I ensure that I'm going to
be calm and at peace you know doing my
meditation daily walking my dogs right
doing yoga those are the things that
bring me joy or connecting talking to
people so and I started a website calm
corner which have been devoting more
time I feel like to know blogging having
that outlet really helps you know to
ensure that I'm
happy and content even though I don't
feel like it I I can you know make
myself do it and I know that I feel
better and if I can inspire just one
person you know just one reader to read
my job is daya for that day you know so
I think having definitely devoting time
to my own self-care because if I take
care of myself I can then take care of
others right I can be there present 100%
so that's that's my philosophy I love
that that's a huge one take care of
yourself in order to take care of others
yeah and I like that it's so simple you
just want to be able to be present every
day you enjoy and the little things like
yoga walking your dog
yeah all right and so with calm corner
to you know it might grow into something
else
but right now you know I'm trying to see
if there's if we can as I can create a
community out of it or if I can lead
seminars or support groups or for people
who may feel lonely or left out because
I know how that feels you know to be to
have no one really understands you and
so I feel like I've been through that
and I have this heart that you know
compassion that I really wanted to to
help people feel that they belong yeah
yeah so what would be your best advice
to someone who is out there who isn't
necessarily other place they're at maybe
their life is a mess and they do feel
lonely or they I don't know they're just
not centered and calm yeah peaceful
what's your advice is over that I think
turning ideas into I do so you know I we
may have a lot of ideas we may be
thinking in our head a lot which is okay
but to a certain level it needs to we
need to turn that into action right so
whether writing it down right making a
plan
joining Eileen's you know love and their
you know artists of life all right you
know like I do that to to help me feel
that okay these are my goals right and
I'm going to work towards that so really
kind of following what your interests
are and maybe right now it's not
you can't afford that lifestyle but kind
of just following what your interests
are maybe you can't do a full-time job
of what you want to do but maybe you can
volunteer or talk to people or learn
more about what they're doing and what
is it that you wanted to do this always
ways to get involved and do what you
want to do in different ways not doesn't
have to be your job right
like you said volunteer something on the
side right right reaching out to people
and I also love that line turn ideas
into I do did you come up with that no
for my chaplin sita and my friend who i
met at the meditation course he he told
me that he yeah so he's really helpful
with that yeah that yeah well thank you
