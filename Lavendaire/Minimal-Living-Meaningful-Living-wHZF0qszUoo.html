living minimally and minimal means that
I want to buy less and experience more
hence I don't mind spending money on
things that are experiences I just don't
want to buy materialistic goods because
I just don't want to hoard stuff I have
a lot of stuff and I'm in the process of
getting rid of the stuff that I don't
need I feel like a lot of stuff in our
lives are just clutter when you have a
cluttered room your mind is cluttered
and I believe if you have a clean
minimal room then your mind will be more
peaceful and clear and when it's clear
then you have room for the more
important things and to focus on what
really matters the general rule of thumb
in deciding what you should keep or not
keep in your life is to just ask the
question does this add value to my life
does this thing make you happy or is it
useful or do you really need it if it
doesn't add value to your life get rid
of it if it does great keep it to me
living minimally means that I'd rather
spend money on experiences like food and
travel and drinks with friends or just
hanging out with people seeing the world
experiencing things that will stay in my
memory things that I could take pictures
of
because pictures are electronic now and
they don't take up space I've been
influenced by various sources on living
minimally I read a book by Blake
Mycoskie the founder of Tom's and he
wrote about how he likes to live
minimally he only had a boat and he sold
the rest of his belongings lived on his
boat something like that and there's a
blog that I recommend called the
minimalist and they write about a
minimal style of living so if you really
want to get deeper into it I recommend
reading their blog and you know when I
look at Pinterest I look at the kind of
rooms and homes that I want to have and
I love the minimal style where
simplicity is more I'm sure we have a
lot of physical stuff that could be
either donated or recycled or thrown
away even mentally you have to say
goodbye to something old to make room
for the new if you have something that's
always occupying your mind that's taking
up space and energy so try to clear it
up try to see what is really valuable
and what really matters in your life and
keep that close to you the more you do
it I believe that you will be happier
and your life will be more meaningful
but you know I'm still in the process of
this minimal thing and I'm still a messy
person I'm still scatterbrained and I'm
just trying my best to be minimal so
good luck guys I hope you like this idea
