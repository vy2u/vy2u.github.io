to declutter your closet for a more
minimal 2015
first off let's clarify what minimalism
means minimalism is not about not being
able to have things it's actually about
keeping only what adds value to your
life everything you have should serve a
purpose
whether it's useful or it makes you
happy if it doesn't then it's just
clutter and minimalism is about clearing
away the clutter to make room for what
really matters because a clear space
equals a clear mind alright now let's
give your closet a new year makeover
number one purge evaluate your closet
and purge anything that you haven't worn
in the past two years meaning if you
haven't touched it since pre 2013 and
chances are you're probably not going to
wear it again
ever if you have anything that's
sentimental you can store those in a
separate memory box so that it doesn't
take valuable space in your closet
number two try the reverse hanger trick
I saw this on a blog and I'm trying it
for the first time this year the idea is
at the beginning of the year turn all of
your hangers backwards and as you wear
your clothes simply put them back the
right way so that indicates that that
piece of clothing is safe at the end of
June do an evaluation of your closet see
which pieces are still hung backwards
and you can decide which ones you're
ready to let go of and donate then
continue the experiment until the end of
the year and at the end of December
that's when you do a honest evaluation
of your entire closet look at the
clothes that are still hung backwards at
the end of December and just be honest
with yourself you know if you haven't
worn this piece in the entire year are
you really going to wear it next year so
this is a huge way to get rid of a big
chunk of your closet and just start to
declutter and minimalize number three
create a capsule wardrobe this one is
for the true minimal is a capsule
wardrobe is a wardrobe that is made up
of a set number of essential staple
pieces usually created per season
it's about selecting high quality pieces
that you can mix and match and wear
often that way you're more efficient
with your clothes rather than constantly
shopping for fast fashion trends that
you wear only once or twice because
you're only allowed a set number of
pieces in your wardrobe you're forced to
decide which pieces are the most
valuable to you in your closet notice
which Styles you love to wear the most
often and then have those Styles make up
the majority of your capsule it's
helpful to create a color scheme and
stick to a lot of neutral colors if you
like you can add a couple of trendy
pieces on top to keep your wardrobe
updated each season for more info on
creating a capsule wardrobe I've posted
some really helpful links in the
description below and also check out my
favorite channels who talked about
capsule wardrobe light by Coco inspir oh
and my green closet they're super
awesome alright before I go on and make
a shout out to the people who answered
my question from last week's video
shout out to Mariela who de Devon
Margaret Casey Cara and Brittany thanks
guys for responding your themes for 2015
were so beautiful and so inspiring I
honestly love hearing from you guys so
please do continue to share in the
comments below this week's question is
if you had to wear one outfit for the
entire week what would it be and for me
it would be like a huge oversized
cardigan oversized t-shirt leggings and
a good black boot because I'm super lazy
and I love to be comfortable alright

today make sure you're subscribed if
you're not already I post videos every

closet love you guys and I'll see you
