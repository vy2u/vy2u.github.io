day one of our five days to minimalism a
challenge so if you're not caught up you
can watch my announcement video here or
in the description box basically this is
a collaboration series with my friend
Brittany of naturally thrifty mom and
each day of this week Monday through
Friday we're going to be tackling a
small area and decluttering and tidying
through that the idea is it's easier to
start small on your way to minimalism
and minimalism is an ongoing journey
there's always somewhere that you can
improve today's challenge is tidying
your purse so without further ado let's
get into it so here's my purse the first
step is to take everything out of your
purse everything I keep in my purse is
pretty intentional so we'll see what we
can get rid of today so now I'm going to
sort through each thing so my tripod I
do want to keep that my camera for
vlogging and photos I do want to keep
that hand sanitizer yes panty liner I
always need those chapstick yes
pen yes that pouch I'll do later
so external battery and phone charger
yes I knew this would be at all times as
possible so hair tie car keys and house
keys yes so now it's time to empty out
these pouches
so this band-aid backup band-aid I'm not
sure if I should keep it but I feel like
I should just have a band-aid it doesn't
take up too much space
that's pepcid and it's overdue so I'm
definitely throwing that out that
bracelet is for good luck from my mom
I have a backup camera battery that the
pouch kind of broke so I think I might
have to discard that so that's my
discard pile and now I'm just emptying
out my other pouch so those are some
random keys for a luggage that I just
put away emergency I feel like it'd be
good to have that with me some extra
business cards and I have like sprinkles
gift cards that I keep with me in case I
go to sprinkles so I have a hand lotion
I like to keep with me eyedrops I need
and face lotion I'm deciding if I need
that but sometimes I sleep over at my
boyfriend's and I like to use that so
extra business cards I'm going to put
away and that pouch because it's broken
I'm going to switch it off for another
one that I have so my wallet is actually
what's messy I don't really clear out my
wallet often so let's just take
everything out I have some rewards cards
that I could definitely throw away
because I don't ever use those I have
cash I have random papers that I don't
really need this check I already
deposited so I don't need that these are
photos and something I got from a
Buddhist temple in Japan and in the
center compartment of my wallet I keep
some like good luck stuff and things
from my travels that make me happy so
this is a business card for my car that
I need to fix so I'm supposed to call
this guy back I'm going to take a photo
of it so I don't need to carry that card
with me
these are photos that I took in Japan
with my mom cousin and aunts and they
make me really happy but I decided I
don't need to carry all of them so I'm
going to put that one away so sorting
through what good luck charms I want to
keep with me those two pennies are like
Hello Kitty pennies from Japan and I
decided I could just put those away in
my mementos box so just sorting through
these little trinkets I have a lot of
photos I have some backup phone numbers
good luck charms my student ID for
discounts and I guess I have too many
little photos so I decided that I'm
going to sort through the ones that make
me happy and really put away the ones
that don't bring me as much joy like
people that I'm not as close to anymore
so now I'm going through my cards and
I'm putting away cards that are like
gift cards and store credit cards that I
don't use all the time and I put them in
this pouch with my business cards so I
don't keep my wallets so stuffed and now
it's basically time to put everything
away back where it came from
you
day one check so please join in on this
five days to minimalism challenge I
think it'd be really fun if you do tie
to your purse today make sure you share
it on social media and hashtag five days
to minimalism and tag me and Brittany at
lavender and at naturally thrifty mom
we'd love to see your stuff thank you
and see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
