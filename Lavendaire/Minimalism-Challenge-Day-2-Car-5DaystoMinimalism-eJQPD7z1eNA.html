challenge so if you're not caught up
we're doing a five day challenge Monday
through Friday where each day we're
tackling a small area of our lives so
day one which was yesterday was your
purse and today day two the challenge is
to tidy your car so for me I know that
my glove compartment and my Center
compartment in my car always get a
little bit messy a lot of bit messy and
today I'm going to go through tidying
that and if you don't have a car then
today I'm going to suggest you do a
miscellaneous category like your
stationery so maybe your pens and your
notebooks at your desk tidy that so if
you guys join this challenge with us and
you want to share it on social media
make sure you hashtag five days to
minimalism and tag me lavender and
Brittany naturally thrift Imam as well

luck I should keep this in here because
my mom cares I care drill this - this is
for good log and protection as well so
