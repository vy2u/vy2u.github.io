this five days to minimalism a challenge
so this whole week from Monday to Friday
we're going to be tidying through one
area each day so day one was your purse
day two was your car and now day three
is your digital space so you can choose
what digital space to tidy through you
could choose your phone your iPad your
desktop your email inbox it's up to you
just pick one area and tidy through it
as best as you can so this is a
collaboration series with my friend
Brittany from naturally thirsty mom so
make sure you check out her channel to
see how well she's doing in this
challenge and also if you're going to be
sharing this journey make sure you
remember to hashtag five days to
minimalism and tag me and Brittany
lavender and naturally thrifty mom so
let's get to it alright guys welcome to
my iPad so this is what it looks like
right now I feel like there are so many
apps that I don't really use so today's
a good day to declutter my digital space
so let's get started so in that cone
maury fashion she tells you to take
everything off the shelves off the
hangers or whatever so we're gonna take
everything outside of the folders I
wonder how long this is going to take
yeah so this taking your apps out of
their folders also shows you how many
apps you really have cuz folders do a
good job of like hiding things so today
we're gonna reveal everything
all right yeah so I think everything's
out of its folder now except for my
Apple apps that you can't delete or
declutter so I'm just going to keep them
in that folder so I don't have to
reorganize it later so let's start from
page one all right so I'm just gonna go
through and delete the things that I
don't really use anymore
love reading web 10 so I'll put this on
the second page but maybe the first page
you know what maybe I have too many
pages like this is one two three four
five six that's a lot of pages I'm going
to start moving things over back to this
page so maybe my last page will be the
fun page where I keep like music and
games
and now I'm going to go into the
settings I'm going to turn off badges
for things that just annoy me so
so now let's check out my page of my
settings has a badge app but I don't
know if I can turn that off because it
has to do with this software update that
I need to do but whatever alright
so did I do everything in my power to
turn off badges let's see let's check it
out let's see what's here okay App Store
I drop that back can I do that App Store
there you go okay right now let's trip
it out clean except for the settings
update move clean clean clean
okay actually what I want to do I don't
think I'm done I'm going to put that
over there
and because I can't turn off that badge
I'm going to move this to the second
page so it doesn't bug me and that way
it looks more symmetrical so there's
four rows here four rows here two rows
here two rows there basically so here we
go now we're done this is the first page
second page third page and the fourth
page and there are no badges and it
makes me feel good except for this
setting thing that's annoying but aside
from that I feel good about it
so we're done day three check alright I
hope you like today's digital declutter
day and I hope that it really refreshed
your space make sure you tune in
tomorrow for day four of our five days
to minimalism challenge so I'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
