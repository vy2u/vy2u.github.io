made it to day five our last day of this
five days to minimalism challenge thank
you guys so much for joining in on this
challenge it's been super fun again this
is a collab series with my friend
Brittany naturally thrifty mom check out
her channel with her videos on this
challenge so let's recap this entire
week
day one we did our purse day two we did
our car day three was the digital space
day 4 was your makeup and day 5 which is
today is your fridge okay so day 5 for
me seems like the scariest because I
have a lot of like random things in my
fridge but we're just gonna tackle it
we're gonna do it let's go alright
welcome to my fridge so I live with my
mom it's just the two of us and neither
of us really cook that often so our
fridge is usually filled with leftovers
first things first you got to take out
everything from the fridge
I thought I was smart to take out the
whole tray to make it easier but I just
struggled so much trying to put this
tray back on look at me struggle I just
couldn't figure it out I think I was on
the wrong notch - yeah let's just let's
just watch this go alright so after that
I was like screw it I'm just gonna take
about one by one again so I know these
drawers are filled with only my mom's
things so I wanted to ask if she wanted
to keep everything I won't touch this
one okay okay okay you got you moving
baby yeah you moaning oh my god I got in
that's right oh that's s yeah but
no you guys that's too big a hole so
that's an Aerosmith well it's also
there's a nest so down below we have
some sparse veggies this is all my mom's
and I wanted to organize it a little bit
and put like the onions together and the
carrots together but she told me she
wants to keep them separate the ones on
top are old the ones on bottom are new
so we'll keep it that way so now I'm
just wiping down everything getting it
real clean
and here is everything that was in my
fridge next step is to sort through each
thing
so I have some kind of old fruits that
are too old I'm going to discard them
some very old leftovers are like two
weeks old Mayo I had to check the
expiration date it was expired I feel
like a lot of things in my fridge are
expired for example look at these eggs
look at that expiration date May it's
August um yeah just sorting through
everything
what's this oh it's a Chinese sticky
rice thing it's on sir
and in here oh my god we had a huge
pizza party with my family a couple
weeks ago we have so many of these like
Parmesan cheese and chili packets way
too much so I decided I'll keep whatever
fits in this red cup so yeah my mom
loves to keep like extra ketchup packets
and mustard packets and I just don't
understand because we already have
ketchup but it's like Asian mentality
like you don't want to waste anything
you know you use up everything that you
have which I understand but I don't know
what to do with all that excess
so some PB&amp;amp;J that's brand-new luckily
not expired
saute that's kind of oily so we wrapped
it
like I said we had a pizza party where
we made keeps as well so this is just a
leftover mozzarella cheese it's not
expired so I feel bad throwing out so
much cheese I might use it for some
pasta
so this is the keep pile
and discard pile now time to put
everything back
se5 check yay thank you guys so much for
joining us on this five days to
minimalism challenge it's been super fun
and really shoutout to all of you guys
who actually tidy through these
categories with us I know it's been
really refreshing for me and for

together alright see you next time
