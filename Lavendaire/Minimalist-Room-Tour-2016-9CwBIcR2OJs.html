so I have been holding off filming the
room tour because I wanted to finish
decorating before I could show it to the
world
but I've lived here for a year now
officially and my room is not fully
decorated still and you know what I
thought to myself I'm probably gonna be
lazy and this is probably gonna be what
it looks like for a while so this is the
general gist of it so the theme is white
pastel very airy and fresh so I like to
keep my room very simple and minimal
because it's where I sleep and relax I
want to be like mostly technology free
zones so rarely do I have my laptop in
here and do work in here before I go
into the Torah I just want to let you
know that I put all product description
links in the box below so if you're
interested in anything and where I got
it you can find it there and most things
you can find online but some things
aren't available anymore so I put links
to similar items so starting on the Left
we have this old white lamp that is
probably over 15 years old it wasn't
mine I think I took it from my uncle's
old house something like that but when
we moved here I put it here because it
was white next item is the Giant's IKEA
mirror and I love big mirrors it's just
wide enough and tall enough to see
everything and then the centerpiece is
obviously my bed and it's just a simple
white bed that I got a few years ago
online when I was planning the color
scheme for my bed a few years ago I
wanted to feel like I was sleeping on
clouds so I purposely got a white bed
frame I have white sheets on my mattress
that are flannels so it's like fluffy so
without my blankets and pillows it
really looks like a giant white
marshmallow but with the blankets you
know I got the sky blue color so it's
like I'm covered by
Skai I'm sleeping on a cloud and my
pillows are like just random colors not
on purpose but I like the way that it
looks mismatched because it really is
mismatched
but I mean the pink and the greys really
complement the Sky Blues it's just a
very pastel white theme moving on the
right side I have a nightstand from West
Elm and I love this thing it's expensive
so I only got one instead of getting two
nightstands I was like am I really going
to use two I think I only need one I was
trying to be very minimal here so I got
one nightstand and on top is my lavender
lamp the lavender lamp from Urban
Outfitters and I just saw that online I
thought it really fit with my pastel
theme I had to have something lavender
color in my room so I got that and I
have this rose quartz that I got from
Target and I just like the you know the
dreamy theme going on here so some
essentials that I keep in my nightstand
or my journal my pens and lavender
essential oil as well as eye hair ties
and stuff so those are some things that
I like to do before I sleep I like to
journal before I sleep sometimes I like
to put on lavender essential oil because
the smell really relaxes you and I'll
tie my hair up when I read and stuff so
moving on to this corner of the room and
this is probably the corner that I
haven't shown in videos so I have this
big painting here I painted it myself
and originally I bought this giant
canvas to put on top of my bed because
like lengthwise it fits on top of my bed
so I painted it and although I could put
it there I haven't because I really like
the colors and the textures of this
painting and I was taking photos of it
to use in my videos and I was like I
could really use this painting as like a
background for a flat lay I think the
reason why it's taking me so long to put
things up on the walls is because I'm
scared to commit because once you like
you know put something up there's like a
hole in the wall I'm just not ready yet
anyway that's why I put this painting
here it makes me happy because the door
is there when I walk in I see
the painting and the colors are
basically an expression of me pastel
everything white dreamy airy fresh you
guys get the point
and this thing that I'm sitting on is
called a chaise a chaise lounge and I
just thought it was so cute I saw a
photo on Pinterest where there was like
a chaise from Ikea and there was like a
laptop with the throw blanket and I
thought it looked really cute and I
thought it would be like oh I would love
to like get one for my room and be able
to read in the corner
well I order this online it's a little
smaller than I imagined it was online
and for some reason I haven't done much
reading here I prefer to read on my bed
but it's nice and I mean it gives me a
lot of like real estate to put clothes
on so when my room is not clean
generally this thing is like filled with
my outfits that I don't want to put away
yet also this thing that's hanging off
of the chaise is actually called a Macra
I have no idea how to pronounce this
thing but basically it was handmade by
my friend and she has a blog where she's
selling these and I'll link that below
girl in the word basically I saw her
post about her handmade items and I
thought it was really cute so ideally
this was one item that I was going to
put on my wall right here
you know this wall to the left of me was
the wall that I was planning to decorate
and put things up things that inspire me
and I have some ideas of what I want to
put up but I want to gather everything
before I commit so I'm just that kind of
person I don't know if I could ever be
able to commit to something on the walls
next up is my vanity area and this is
where I spend a lot of my time if I'm in
my room and I mean I love the chair it's
the ghost chair it's a replica so it's
not the real thing which is expensive
but it's the ghost chair with the IKEA
fur rug on the seat so you're not
sitting on like something hard and cold
I got that inspiration from Pinterest as
well so I thought it'd be nice to have
like a van
where I could journal and do my makeup
turns out I don't really use that table
for journaling because the Ghost Chair
is too high it's like an awkward
position so I just use it to do makeup I
have like you know my makeup acrylic
cases that I really like and I don't
know if we need to talk about my makeup
right now over on the right I have a
Himalayan salt lamp that my mom gave me
and Himalayan salt lamps if you don't
know have health benefits and it's kind
of like a I'm not sure if it's spiritual
or I think it has actual benefits like
physical for your health for example I
think it releases negative ions that
cleans the room it's kind of like a
natural purifier and it works when the
lamp is turned on so when the salt is
heated that's when the negative ions
happen you guys can totally research
this out maybe I'll post a link below on
Himalayan salt lamps and their benefits
I really love this thing I keep it on at
all times through the day and through
the night and I think it really actually
helps bring like a calm vibe to my room
I'm not even kidding so to the right of
my vanity I put this reading lamp
originally that lamp was like right here
for me to like read but I figured I
don't really read as much here so I put
it there so it's like my face lamp when
I do makeup at night which is not ideal
but it works under my vanity I just keep
like a tissue box nail polish and makeup
that I don't use on the daily and lastly
up top I have this white lamp that I got
to just complement the white dreamy calm
theme of this room so that's it for my
room tour I hope that wasn't too boring
I feel like it's very simple but it
makes me feel good and relaxed when I
come in here I love the pastel colors I
love the dreamy airiness of this place
and it's just like amazing alright thank
