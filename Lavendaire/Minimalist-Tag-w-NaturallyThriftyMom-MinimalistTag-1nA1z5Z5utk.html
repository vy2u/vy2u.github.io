have a special guest today this is
Brittany if you don't recognize her
she's naturally 13 moms and we did
collabs
before called five days to minimalism so
this is Kate leave that was a busy week
yeah it was stupid it was a busy week
but it was so productive it was good
yeah okay so today we're in Portland I'm
just here for the day but we're gonna do
something called a minimalist tag that
we totally made up I don't know if it's
a real thing but now it's a real thing
so we have five questions and I'm gonna
interview Brittany about minimalism are
you ready yes okay I think so
what got you started out with minimalism
um so I think I was one of those that
heard of the Marie Kondo life-changing
magic of tidying up I just really liked
the idea of controlling some of the
chaos I've had four kids so I mean
that's just chaos in itself but I'm just
felt like things were getting a little
stressful there was a lot you know kids
have toys kids have stuff they're
playing with I've got stuff my husband
has stuff we've got a busy house so I
liked the idea of just simplifying
creating less stress relaxing the whole
idea of that just having the things
around me that I really loved and I
really enjoyed like to me that just
struck almost an instant chord and I was
like yes I want that for myself so
minimalism just kind of yeah oh and
right from there in YouTube of course
so YouTube kind of made the connection
that I grew me what is your definition
of minimalism I would say minute like
not minimalist like not a minimalist but
minimalism for me is loving the things
around you and letting go of the rest
mm-hmm so if you've got you know 100
things in your closet and when you go in
there and and you look at one thing and
it doesn't make you happy you don't want
to wear that just let it go whether
that's maybe it still has the tags on
you've on it last week you go and turn
it or maybe you have a friend that wears
the same size as you maybe you can offer
it to her don't eat it whatever that be
just let it go and when you're shopping
so for future
like try to keep that mindset so if you
love it go for it I mean or if it's more
expensive thing on page stay for it in
that I think that's just yeah I know the
way I shop now is I really listen to my
intuition like this this makes me feel
good do I feel like amazing in this
piece of clothing if it does then I buy
it like before I used to be like I kind
of liked it and I would buy it but now
I'm more picky and I know there's I'm in
like my husband will ask me sometimes
like what how much is it but then it's
like but really I don't just want to get
something because it's exactly a bargain
or and I mean I used to so I'm very much
very much like a fifty shopper like I
like to get a good deal but now rather
than just going straight to the
clearance racks and see if there's
something I could make work now I'm like
I see what I like I kind of put it on a
wish list and then save up for it and
then maybe you look one sale while I'm
waiting for it yeah and I'll get it that
way yeah that's what that's kind of
minimalist for me but into shopping yeah
okay so what was the hardest thing for
you to let go of the hardest area to
declutter I don't think I have like one
specific thing but for me it's I don't
know why it's the bath and body products
oh like I'm like I have a hard time
getting rid of like either makeup or
like lotion or anything that maybe I
used it and I'm like I just really don't
like the smell I mean I'm picky about
like natural products and all along you
use like natural fragrance and stuff but
if I bought something like that and then
I end up not liking it like I feel so
horrible not finishing it up so yeah you
mean you could give it to somebody
yeah but I I just have the hardest time
like yeah I don't want to get somebody
my name like a lotion or in right that's
the hardest area because I just I don't
want to be wasteful that's another
that's a thing I very much like like the
zero waste movement and I love that but
that's the hardest area because I want
to keep it simple and I want to keep it
yeah but it just that was the hardest
area for me going through all that stuff
and like just letting it go and passing
on my could and the rest you know
getting rid of responsibility that was
really hard so number four how do you
deal with non minimalist in your life
how do idea I I think so the majority of
my you know people in my life to or I
would say not minimalist I have a couple
of friends who I mean I've they've heard
me talking about it like they've heard
me talking about trying to keep things
more simple and talking about minimalism
and they see my videos I have a couple
friends who are like totally on board
with it now yeah and they're even making
changes and stuff too but what I would
say is I don't really like deal with the
people that that aren't into it and more
so just let them do their thing and kind
of like lead by example I would say I
feel like if you're gonna
if you're gonna try to convince someone
of something they're probably not gonna
want to be convinced but if you can just
show them how you do something and that
might kind of pique their interest and
yeah I get my bike now if I've got my
coffee cup like I've got my coffee cup
in that magnet the tripod was in it so
if we want to get a coffee and I whip
that out people be like oh that's smart
I should bring my own coffee shop or I
have a glass straw I like then I can say
oh no straw and then they see my glass
straw and they're like oh that's nice so
that's more of like a zero-waste type
thing but stuff like that like yeah it's
kind of contagious it is last question
is what is your top tip or new
minimalist top tip I think it don't let
the idea of becoming a minimalist stop
you like get started now like soon as
you're interested in it and don't think
you have to be perfect at it yeah I know
it's like the Marie Kondo method you
you're supposed to get everything out of
your closet and I know a lot of people
were kind of like oh I can't do that and
so they'll like wait or put it off or
maybe they'll try to do a mini declutter
and then it's like you're decluttering
over and over and over and it's the same
cycle but I would say whichever method
you decide to go with just do it already
somewhere take one you know one day like
this is the day I'm gonna do it and go
for it don't let fear of doing something
hold you back
yeah it's really worth doing it's worth
doing don't try to be a perfectionist
about it like as long as you're doing
something it matters that's all right I
guess that's it for today thanks so much
