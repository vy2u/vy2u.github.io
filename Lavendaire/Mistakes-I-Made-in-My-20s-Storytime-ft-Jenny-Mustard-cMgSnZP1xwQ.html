it's Eileen today I'm gonna share
mistakes that I've made in my early 20s
and this is a collaboration video with
Jenny mustard I'm sure a lot of you have
seen Jenny's videos before but if you
haven't
Jenny mustard makes videos on YouTube
about lifestyle minimalism veganism and
more basically she has this beautiful
minimal aesthetic to her videos and a
quirky personality so she's really fun
to watch Jenny also made a video on a
mistake set she's made in her 20s so
I'll link it right here in the card
above and down below so check that out
after you watch this video by the way I
know this video is titled
mistakes I made in my 20s but I'm
currently 27 so I still have a few more
years of mistakes to make so I'm just
gonna look back 10 years and consider
the mistakes I made from like 17 to 27
so the first big mistake and this is a
juicy one because I've never shared it
online before is that I actually got
fired from my first internship in
college this was when I was 18 years old
the summer after my first year of
college and base was at 18 yeah I was 18
basically it was a really exciting
position at E news so I was a wardrobe
stylist assistant I got to work on set
of enews where like the first day I got
to meet Ryan Seacrest Giuliana Rancic
and Denise Richards like these
celebrities right so I was like oh my
god this is such a cool job so I was
really excited to be there and yet
because it was my first internship I
just didn't know how to act I didn't
know how to take initiative there's just
so many things that I did wrong in
hindsight basically before this
internship I was used to the schooling
system where when you go to class you're
told what to do you have a syllabus you
have homework you follow the rules and
you just do what you're told and then
you get an A in the class and that's it
so I kind of went into the internship
with that background I guess and in that
setting
I thought I was trying my best I was
doing whatever I was told to do and yet
most of the time the job was really idle
like there was a lot of downtime and so
I had no idea what to do during that
down
and because this was a fashion related
job I had a desk and I was like you know
what I'm just gonna browse fashion blogs
during my free time so in case anybody
walks by they know that I'm like looking
up fashion stuff and so during most of
my free time at that internship I was
just be at the computer browsing like
lookbook fashion blogs just waiting for
work to come to me and yet like it was
just so quiet and I was like well what
do I do I'm just I guess I'll just sit
here and then one and a half months
later one of the girls like took me
aside sat me down and let me go from the
job she just basically told me like hey
Eileen you've been here for a month and
a half and I really haven't gotten to
know you I haven't seen you like take
initiative she just told me all of these
things like they had a different
expectation then I even knew was
possible and in my eyes I honestly did
not see that coming I had no idea that I
was gonna get fired and then when she
like let me go I was like what the heck
just happened like what did I do wrong
after hearing her feedback I realized
that there were a lot of things that I
could have been doing during that free
time of my internship that I was just
wasting so I could have been using that
time to actually talk to people I didn't
know that I was allowed to talk to other
employees in the office and outside of
that office because it's a pretty big
building I didn't know that I was
allowed to talk to people because
technically I could have used that time
to talk to people and learn about
everyone's jobs in all the different
departments another thing she said was I
could have took more initiative to find
work to do for myself when there was no
work given to me for example like
cleaning up the closets picking up the
hangers steaming random clothes like
whatever work needed to be done to like
pick it out myself and just do it
without someone telling me to do it and
lastly I was honestly just really shy at
that point of my life that I would never
ask questions I would never talk to
people even the people that I worked
with every day directly I would just
keep to myself scroll the blogs I would
dress up and try to look as fashionable
as possible for the job thinking that
that's what people wanted I just wanted
to impress others rather than like talk
to them so instead of trying
to impress people by the clothes I was
wearing and what I was browsing on the
computer I should have just talked to
people ask questions learn as much as
possible from that internship so getting
fired from that internship taught me so
much that I really had to like go out
and take initiative in the real world I
had to create work find ways to help
people without them telling me what to
do and I think that was like a big shift
because I was like this a plus student
in school I did everything perfectly if
you gave me like the rules and the
homework but in the real world I was
like okay it's not the same it's not the
same as school I have to like actually
think for myself so I'm actually really
grateful that I got fired from that
internship because it taught me a lot it
taught me so much about how to act in
future internships and I did like six or
seven internships so with each
experience I learned something and then
tried it in the next one and then learn
something new tried it in the next one
so that by the time like I graduated I
started working for a start-up at that
point I knew I had to take initiative
and do this job do that job just create
my own work for myself and that's a
skill that really really helped me in
life because I got to apply it to
everything that I do today another huge
mistake I made in my early 20s was
spending too much time worrying about
the future and I know a lot of people do
this a lot of people when they're young
and they're in that uncertain stage of
life you just want to get everything
figured out like right now you want to
be successful right now and basically
like I was always like looking at the
future being anxious or just not happy
with where I am now and I never took the
time to fully live in the present moment
I feel like I was literally a zombie
during a lot of my teenage and early 20
years like I never was fully there you
know what I mean like I have really bad
memory of those years because I feel
like I just blew past them honestly when
I think back at like my college years I
really wish I spent more time just
enjoying the experience hanging out with
friends and just doing nothing I wish I
spent more time hanging out to do
nothing because those are the times you
get to bond with those
people more and I felt like I went
through college really busy I always had
activities I was always like I don't
know doing so much whether it was
working internships doing like dance I
was in a sorority and all these things
took up so much of my time that I was
always on like a go-go-go mentality and
even though I lived in an apartment with
roommates I would never see my roommates
because I would never be at home I would
always be outs and if I came home it was
to like change eats and then go out to
the next thing and so I was always on
the go I never took the time to really
like calm down
be mindful enjoy the present moment and
just relax and enjoy my youth with
friends because that's like the time
where you can really just hang out and
get to know each other and I don't know
I just feel like I could have done more
bonding socially versus trying to be so
like ambitious and productive and on the
go because you know I really didn't get
to enjoy my life another mistake I've
made that's kind of been like a lifelong
mistake and something that I've taken
many many years to improve and correct
at is being late all the time so growing
up I've always been the late kid always
late to school always late to class and
I think when I was young I just have
memories of like my mom taking us to
school being really late and part of it
was like my mom's a late person so she
would make us lay and then it trained us
to be late people and living in the real
world I've had to learn that you have to
respect other people's time and when
you're late to events late when you're
meeting up with people it shows that
you're being selfish and you're not
respecting this person's time so more
and more like I try my best now to be on
time and I'm so much better at it and
part of the reason is because I work for
myself I don't have to like show up to
work every day whenever I had to like
show up to something every day on a set
schedule especially if it's in the
morning I would always be late work
always be late school class always be
late I would miss a lot of classes as
well and I've gotten in a lot of trouble
like in high school for not going to
class or going too late late to class
and in college I mean it doesn't matter
if you're late to class so college was
easier for me but I would say
one of the most frustrating consequences
of being late is the year after I
graduated college I entered a singing
competition for Chinese television and I
was just you know making it through the
ranks of the singing competition just
imagine something like American Idol
where like you have people call in to
vote and there's like levels to this so
basically I made it to like the top ten
and there would always be rehearsals and
there was one time that we had a show on
a Friday night and we went out with all
the contestants afterwards we were
drinking and partying till late and then
Saturday morning we had to show up to a
rehearsal which was mandatory and so I
have a problem with forcing myself to
wake up in the morning it's just really
difficult especially if I don't want to
wake up so basically I just didn't feel
like getting up that day I couldn't it
was tough it was difficult so I got up
when I could get up and then I went to
that rehearsal late so what happened was
the producers of the show just like had
it they were so mad that day and they
basically told me you're disqualified
you're off the show you're not gonna
sing even if you're in the top ten
you're just not gonna sing we're gonna
not gonna let you perform and be on the
show and that that was heartbreaking
because one it's like I didn't realize
that was a consequence I just I was sad
I was also very embarrassed to tell all
my friends and family who knew I was in
this show I was embarrassed to tell
everyone I was disqualified because I
was late to a rehearsal
it was just like the stupidest reason to
get kicked off the show after that I was
really sad about the situation but I
emailed the producers I just apologized
and I just asked like can I please
perform can you just please let me
perform I don't have to like be in the
competition but I mean I've prepared
this song and I've been going to
rehearsals I just let me perform so
thankfully they were kind enough to let
me perform my song even though I wasn't
considered like a contestant in the show
I was more of like a special guest for
that episode and I just remember after
my performance I killed it okay and I
think I killed it I had I practiced so
much and I had a lot of fun because I
just loved performing I loved me
and singing everything so after my
performance like my friends brought
signs my family made signs like let
Eileen sing it was so cute but the
judges they they just said like that was
amazing it's such a shame that you
weren't in this competition good luck
with everything you're doing and that
was it so I didn't get to be part of the
competition but I'm happy I got to
perform and I I got to show something of
myself but that was just an experience
that I was just embarrassed I was like
really like I had to let my lateness
affect this so yeah that was probably
like the second most dramatic thing
that's happened to me because I was late
to something the first most dramatic was
when I got in a lot of trouble in high
school and the teachers threatened to
home-school me blah blah blah don't want
to get into I think I talked about it on
my podcast I'll link it down below
because these are all just long life
stories but I'll also link my
performance at that show as well if you
want to watch it because that video is
still up on YouTube my last mistake I'll
share today is in my teens and early 20s
I basically lived for others rather than
for myself so I lived to meet others
expectations of me I lived to like prove
something of myself to others I just
live to impress others and please others
honestly a lot of it was like wanting to
look good for my family because they
wanted me to be this perfect good
student high achieving person and I just
did my best to to do that because I
don't know I just did what was told of
me back then and I basically started
shifting like junior and senior year of
college that's when I had this
transformational shift where I started
to learn to think differently and start
to live for myself meaning like make all
the choices in my life for myself in
order to make me happy so that was
during the time where I was figuring out
what to do with my life what career to
go into and I've shared a lot about that
also in my other videos and podcasts
that I'll link below as well but
honestly when planning this video it was
kind of hard for me to find mistakes
that I've made in my 20s because I feel
like once I started to
make decisions for myself and make
decisions for my happiness and my life
it led me down this path of you know
working random jobs eventually creating
lab and dare exploring music all of
these things that I ultimately don't
regret so I don't know if I've made any
big mistakes another thing is I always
look at life experiences as a learning
opportunity so even if I did something
wrong or failed here I don't see it as a
mistake I just see it as like this
happened and I learned this from it so
it was actually good so that's why it's
harder for me to like pinpoint actual
mistakes I've made in my like later 20s
because I feel like once you start
living for yourself then all the choices
that you make like you're responsible
for them but also those choices that you
make for your happiness like all of them
are worth it in the end
you know like you'll never regret making
those choices because ultimately they
help form this dream life even if they
might not lead you in the direction you
expected them to I don't think there's a
way you can go wrong if you continually
follow your heart listen to your
intuition and do what's best for
yourself so the most important thing is
to live for yourself and not for others
and that's the lifelong journey alright
