I'm Irene and today we're going to talk
about money specifically investing so
before I go into anything I just want to
say that my goal for making this video
is to just have you be aware of
investing what it is and how you can be
smart with your money because we all
want to be smart with their money right
I also want to let you know I'm not an
expert I'm not a financial adviser I'm
just here to share the basics of what I
know and just kind of guide you in the
right direction just in case you had no
idea about any of this before so a
little background about myself I did go
to business school and I took a finance
class which means that I did have like a
general knowledge of basic finance
concepts and stuff but back then it was
just all conceptual I didn't really
think about applying it to my real life
until very recently so I always knew you
know investing was there I knew it was
good you can make money from it and it
was the smart thing to do but I just
never got into it because I was
intimidated I was scared
first of all I felt like I didn't have
enough money to start investing because
you know I'm doing this whole creative
DIY lifestyle and even though I knew it
was the smart thing to do I just had no
idea where to start where to even begin
and I felt like that was so much effort
on my part to even start that research
and I wasn't into it I was like you know
I don't really care about finance too
much I want to do creative stuff but
recently I did a podcast interview with
this woman named kana Campbell aka sugar
mama on YouTube and she's a financial
advisor and she was just like laying
down the knowledge the finance and
investing knowledge in this episode by
the way I'll link it below so you could
listen to it yourself but while I was
talking to kana I realized that a lot of
the stuff she was saying I kind of
already knew because I learned it in
class but I never applied it in life and
I told kana like I feel like I don't
have enough money to start investing and
she was like no like you can invest with
even a small amount the best time to
start is now
and so talking to connor really pushed
me to you know look at investing and
start putting my time to research it a
little bit just to see like how i can
invest my money and be smart with my
money so today i just want to share some
things that I've learned and kind of
direct you in the right direction again
I'm not going to get too technical or
too detailed because I just want to
guide you in the general direction I'm
going to post a bunch of links down
below of articles for Millennials and
beginner investors so feel free to look
that up after this video so how do you
know you have enough money to start
investing so first off you gotta have
enough cash to support yourself so if
you have any high interest debts like
credit card debt that's like 8% or
higher
don't start investing the your priority
is to pay off those debts at ASAP
because debts especially high interest
debts can really hold you back and it
costs a lot to pay those high interest
so if you have those debts focus on
paying those off now secondly you want
to make sure you have enough cash
savings for three to six months worth of
expenses so you want to calculate your
monthly expense you know the money you
spend on your internet bill your rent
your groceries entertainment etc and
then you know times that by six months
ideally and see if you have that chunk
of money because that is what a lot of
people call your emergency fund your
emergency savings because life happens
you know you want to make sure you have
some cushion to protect yourself just in
case so if you fit that criteria and you
have extra cash on top of that six
months worth of expenses then that's
when you know you have extra cash to
start investing and I want to say that
even if you're not there yet you know
maybe you don't have that much saved up
you can still start implementing ways to
save now so that you can have some extra
cash to start investing and there's
something called micro investing and
I'll recommend like a couple platforms
later on in the video but micro
investing is where you invest like
pennies or like a few dollars at a time
so it's very manageable it's very doable
for anyone so why start investing in the
first place so the goal of investing is
to grow your money faster than it would
have grown if it were just sitting in a
bank actually putting your money in a
bank doesn't really grow it that much
the interest rate is like basically zero
so it just stays the same but for
example if you invest in stocks or bonds
they have a higher interest rate a
higher rate of return where your money
will grow faster so you might have heard
the saying time is money and it's so
true because with more time your money
can grow faster and it could grow more
so it's really like magical and it's all
because of something called compounding
and compounding just means when you earn
interest on interest on interest on
interest I know that doesn't make sense
to a lot of people but just imagine like
you invest $100 and it gives you like a
return of 6% a year so in one year
you'll have a hundred and six dollars so
what you do is you reinvest the earnings
that you made so you have a hundred and
six dollars you invest that at 6% a year
and then after another year you have a
hundred and twelve dollars and 36 cents
which is a bigger number to start with
and then you invest that in 6 percent
and 6 percent again on it on it on until
your money grows exponentially like this
like it really is math basically you
make your money work for you without you
actually putting in any like physical
work so that is called passive income
and passive income is awesome you're
like making money while you're sleeping
and living your daily life your money is
just growing itself because of what
you've invested in so if you're young if
you're in your 20s the best time to
start investing is now because you have
decades ahead of your life to live
decades for your money to grow and look
at this graph you know the longer the
beginning it grows slowly and then it
gets faster and faster and faster faster
so you want to start earlier so that
your money could just accumulate faster
so even if you start with like a hundred
dollars a month you know putting that
into investment that can grow
lot for example I took this off an
article on betterment and it says that
if you're 25 and you invest $100 a month
that equals $1200 a year and you just
invest that same amount you know for 40
years until you're 65 you will have let
me look at the number you will have one
hundred and eighty five thousand dollars
and seven hundred assuming a six percent
return so if you calculate it you've
actually only contributed out of your
own pocket forty eight thousand and I
got that number by doing 1200 times 40
years equals 48 K and if you you know
subtract from how much you have in the
end basically you have like one hundred
and thirty seven thousand seven hundred
dollars of passive income like that's
how much money you grow and that's only
considering that you invest one hundred
dollars a month which is really little
because I'm sure as you get older you'll
be able to make more money and be able
to invest even more into your accounts
so I hope that the numbers didn't
confuse you I hope it makes sense
passive income is real investing is a
great way to be smart with your money
now let me talk about my personal
experience so personally my style of
investing is I'm not trying to be like a
super-duper investor I'm not trying to
be like a daily trader I don't want to
buy and sell individual stocks every day
I don't want to put that much mental
energy on it because it's not my passion
I know for some people it's their
passion they love to like check the
market and they want to make a career
out of it I'm not that person
I still love what I do creatively but I
do want to be smart with my money so my
style is I just want to put my excess
money into some investments where I'll
leave it there for like 20 or more years
just let it grow and it doesn't have to
grow super fast
I just wanted to grow more than it would
have grown in a typical bank account so
I did my research and Kanna introduced
something called Vanguard risk
questionnaire and I took
that and basically that's just a
questionnaire that assesses your risk
you know because some people are willing
to risk more some people want to play it
safe so I'll put that link below if you
you're curious of how risky you are
because there's so many different ways
to invest anyway bottom line is I did my
research I discovered a lot of new
platforms not too new but like
relatively newer platforms called Robo
advisors and basically what they are are
computer automated algorithmic ways to
invest your money so you put your money
in something and then they use a bunch
of algorithms to figure out your
portfolio mix and where to invest your
money I don't know if that makes sense
to you but traditionally like either you
do it yourself
or you have a financial advisor or human
being to help you distribute your
portfolio but you know now there's like
computer done ones that are pretty
trusted and reliable I know for people
who have no idea what this is because a
month ago I had no idea what Robo
advisors were like it might sound like
oh my god you're putting your money and
letting a computer decide what to do
with it I mean it might seem scary at
first but a lot of people use it a lot
of people trust it and that's all I'm
gonna say it's up to you everything is
up to your discretion but they're pretty
big so I did my research comparing all
these different platforms and I was
mostly comparing between betterments and
wealth fronts which are top Robo
advisors where they'll you know give you
investing advice and then to that I
wanted to mention our acorns and stash
and those are the micro investing
platforms I think they're both like an
app and I'll post the links below so you
could check out how they work basically
you invest like pennies or dollars at a
time and then there's motif which is a
new way to invest based on like ideas so
instead of picking like companies you'll
pick an idea or motif that you believe
that will grow in the future like
renewable energy or something and once
you pick a motif still like they'll
bundle some investments that fit under
that and there's one called Robin Hood
that's also like millennial friendly but
that one is just for free trading
because true
additionally there's like traditional
platforms like etrade and charles schwab
they charge you a fee for trading stocks
and those are more like DIY
do-it-yourself trading which I am NOT
trying to get into those are like
platforms for like my mom's generation
like my mom uses those websites so I was
focusing more on platforms that were
millennial friendly user friendly super
simple easy to use so again I did a ton
of research comparing all these
different platforms to see which one was
right for me and I'll post all the links
below so you guys can check them out
yourself too so in the end I decided to
go with betterment because it was
generally like the top trusted and top
popular platform for Robo advising and
I'm the kind of girl that goes with like
the number one I don't want to gamble
with anyone else so I started investing
with them the way it works is you just
like do a quick questionnaire similar to
the risk questionnaire and then they
kind of assess your risk who you are and
what your goals are and then they
recommend a portfolio mix portfolio just
means like your mix of investments so
there are different kinds of investments
like stocks and bonds blah blah blah
doesn't matter a mix of things right
like I said I don't want to get too
detailed you can do that research on
your own I just want to be here to let
you know that hey this stuff exists if
you're interested if you have extra
money you should probably consider
growing it in a way that can create
passive income so that's it bottom line
for this video is don't let investing
scare you there are so many new
platforms so many resources out there
for people like us people your age so
don't be scared don't feel like
investing is something that only old
people do or something that only
financially savvy or people good at
numbers do investing is for everyone and
there are so many different ways you can
do it it's very customizable and so
that's all I'm gonna say leave it at
that I hope you realize how powerful
compounding is I hope that it inspires
you like it inspired me because once I
like realized
really what I could have done like I
could have started investing when I was
18 that's what I think when I'm you know
researching this and you know you are
the youngest you'll ever be right now so
the best time to start is now don't
regret anything in the past just do your
best
have fun be smart and I'll see you next
