such a positive impact on my life this
past year morning pages have given me a
clearer sense of direction and have led
me to take key actions in life actually
the concept of lavender came out of a
morning page of session there are just
so many benefits to writing every day a
clearer mind improved creativity
improved productivity time for
self-reflection etc that I would
recommend it to everyone morning pages
are three pages of writings done every
morning typically encouraged to be in
longhand you're supposed to write
anything and everything that comes out
of your head don't think too much about
what you're writing
just let it flow as your mind goes the
point is that you must complete writing
your three pages if you run out of
things to say
you can literally write I don't know
what to write for three pages but you'll
find that if you continue to spill then
you do have a lot to say you just didn't
realize all this stuff was going on in
your mind we have so many layers of
thoughts morning pages reveals those
layers starting from the surface and
peeling each of them back to get deeper
and deeper to your core normally I'll
start writing about my immediate
thoughts a recap of the day before
things I have to do that day or things
I'm worried about after I get it all out
I realized that there's more going on
underneath then I usually become more
reflective and almost always end up
writing about my dreams and goals and
how I'll utilize my day to move forward
towards those goals a lot of the time
I'm also writing about things that I'm
grateful for it really puts things in
perspective and I start my day with a
sense of what's important in my life
doing this every day has shaped my life
for the better because every day I'm so
grateful for what I have and I know that
I'm taking steps to bring my dreams
closer to a reality I've become so much
more focused with a clearer sense of
direction
most importantly I'm happier my favorite
system is to write in composition
notebooks I usually spend fifteen to
thirty minutes on morning pages
depending on how flowy I feel or whether
I get distracted
I've tried typing out morning pages on
this website called 750 words com 750
words equals three pages and the website
shows your word count so you know when
you're done for the day I tried it for a
month but went back to handwriting
because I feel that I'm more honest in
handwriting
I'm pretty proud of my little collection
of morning pages notebooks so far I've
completed two notebooks and now I'm on
my third I decided to spice it up this
time and get this super adorable
notebook from Target totally worth the
extra few cents so I really hope this
has inspired you to give morning pages a
try try it out for a week and let me
know in the comments how you do also
