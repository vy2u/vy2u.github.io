into an apartment with my boyfriend
we're still getting settled in but I'm
looking forward to decorating the place
and making it feel like home one of my
goals this year is to cook healthy meals
at home more often
so today I've partnered up with
hellofresh to help me cook my first meal
in my apartment and work towards that
goal hey guys so we're in my new
apartment just moved in yesterday
basically haven't finished unpacking or
decorating at all but I thought I take
this opportunity to try out something
that I've been wanting to try out which
is hellofresh
so I'm not gonna cook it just yet but
since I got the package I thought I'd
just do the unboxing now show you what
my first thoughts on it cuz this is my
first time trying anything like this so
it looks like this box has three meals
prepared in it it has this one this one
and this one and basically hellofresh
gives you an option of what type of
meals you want I chose the veggie
package so they'd have like classic
which is regular with like meat and
veggies and then veggie and then the
last ones family plan I'm trying to not
eat meat this year I'm not completely
vegan or vegetarian but I'm that's the
goal so this is where we start and
they're all still cold I'm very
surprised and pretty sure they put ice
packs in here yep this thing this is
what keeps everything cool
oh okay oh I'm excited
there's green juice I'm just gonna drink
this right now because why not okay out
of these this probably looks the most
appetizing to me the gorgeous greens
Bowl so I'm going to open the
ingredients for that one they've got it
down to a tee so basically like on this
they have all the ingredients that you
should have in your bag it tells you how
long the prep time is 20 minutes total
time 40 minutes and then 470 calories so
it's so detailed they're basically you
know exactly what you're gonna do and
what you're gonna get and here's like
step-by-step instructions with really
clear pictures I just love things I have
like really clean instructions and clean
branding like they got it on point so
I'm actually not gonna cook it now I'm
just gonna put it back in the bag and
cook it later but I'll bring you guys
along with me when I decide to tackle
that hey guys it's a new day and you
might be able to tell I'm a hair stiffer
--nt I did my hair but today I'm gonna
start tackling the first meal this one's
gonna be the gorgeous green soir opal
the one that I showed you guys so I'm
just gonna lay it all out and try my
best to do this right I just want to put
a disclaimer that on a spare out of a
one to ten in cooking skills I'm
probably like a three or four so yeah
and by the way if you guys are
interested in trying out hello fresh
yourself then you can get $30 off your
first week of hellofresh using the code
lavend dare 30 so first I'm gonna lay
out all the ingredients from the bag
just to clarify hellofresh is a service
that delivers recipes and ingredients to
your door you choose a meal plan and a
delivery day that works best with your
schedule there's a wide variety of
chef's curated recipes that change every
week and each meal is less than ten
dollars a person I love the fact that
they portioned the ingredients for you
so that you don't have to over buy
groceries it's also teaching me new ways
to cook so I'm going out of my comfort
and learning a lot in this process
that's my question
anyway is that stick of the peel or do I
cut a little bit of the peel off and
then zest the white stuff I don't know
I'm just a first-time fasting and lemon
oh really impressed cool how much do my
best so interesting it smells so good
all right here it is I'm actually super
proud that I made this because I never
usually use the oven like baking scares
me because when you're like taking hot
things out of the oven like I'm just
scared to get burned but I'm really
proud of us let's taste it let's try it
mmm I love the lemon zest Wow I'm gonna
add more zest so overall I would say
this is a success the only thing is like
because I was filming myself I took a
little longer and I probably overcooked
some of these things like I left the
asparagus and zucchini in the oven a
little too long but I mean now it's like
nice and crispy but yeah I guess we just
broke in my kitchen for the first time
together and I'm really excited about it
I'm looking forward to cooking more
healthy meals at home since that's one
of my goals for this year and I'm pretty
proud of myself I feel like my
confidence in cooking has gone a little
bit higher I'm definitely gonna have the
YouTube simple things like how to cut an
onion how to you know do those things
but anyway if you guys are interested in
checking out hellofresh for yourself at
home I do have a $30 off promo code lab
and dare 30 so just go to hello fresh
com enter that code lab and dare 30 and
you'll get 30 dollars off your first
week okay I'm gonna get back to eating
this so thank you so much for watching I
love you all and I'll see you very soon
with some new content in my new
apartment
