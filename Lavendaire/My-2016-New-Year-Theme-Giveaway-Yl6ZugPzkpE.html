to share my theme for 2016 so a theme
for your year first of all is just a
word or a few words to guide you along
with your year so what I usually do is I
choose a theme of something that I think
I need for that year something that I
want to add more of in my life so in
2014 my theme was patience and
perseverance and in 2015 my theme was
flow and this year I actually have two
themes and I figure if Pantone can have
two colors of the year that I could have
two themes I first came up with one
theme and then as I was reflecting I
really wanted to add one more so the way
I've set it up is one theme is my micro
theme for the year and the other one is
my macro theme for the year what that
means is my micro theme applies to more
of my daily life my everyday activity
and my macro theme applies to how I want
to live my year you know in the big
picture of things so my micro theme for
the year is consistency
I believe consistency is so important
it's how you build anything in your life
so I want to get consistent on my daily
habits that's to do morning pages in the
morning to meditate for at least 20
minutes and to exercise some point of
the day and break a sweat and lastly is
to read at least 10 pages a day so those
four are kind of my foundation habits
that I want to lock in and do every
single day this year I just really want
to get consistent and really have a good
routine a good schedule and getting
these things done because I feel like
doing a little bit a day will really
take you far you know if you meditate 20
minutes a day and don't break that chain
if you can write 20 minutes a day
exercise 20 minutes a day and also read
at least 10 pages a day you will get so
far just by doing step by step the baby
steps in that every day so I think it's
so much better to be consistent than to
work in bursts you know like to read 100
pages
and then stop reading for two weeks and
then read another hundred pages for some
people that may work but for me I just
want to feel like I'm improving a little
bit every day because I know that over
time it's gonna make a big difference on
the topic of reading I just made a blog
post sharing my reading list of all the
books that I'm interested in reading so
if you guys want to take a peek at what
I might read this year in 2016 then you
can check that link in my description
below I also included the list of books
that I read last year so for all you
bookworms you can check that out below
my macro theme for 2016 is to be bolder
I really want to go out and take more
risks to challenge myself more to get
uncomfortable and to feel nervous and
more scared about things because that's
the area where you grow I realized that
in 2015 I kind of got complacent a
little bit and I was a little bit too
comfortable I felt like I wasn't
stretching myself as much as I could
have so this year I really want to push
myself more to go out meet new people
try new experiences and get more
creative with my life and with my work
with my craft
for example I'm really a shy person and
I like to depend only on myself and do
things all by myself but this year I
want to get out more and meet more
people and collaborate with other
creative people out there I want to go
out and see volunteer opportunities
locally I want to take watercolor or
painting classes things like that things
that I don't do in my daily life right
now I feel like I want to just go out do
the things that I've always been afraid
to do and just go out and just do it
this past year I was more of a homebody
than any of my previous years it's not
that I don't like being a homebody I do
like to stay home and I can enjoy being
by myself but I feel like I am still
young and I need to go out in the world
more often try new things meet new
people and just get involved in
whatever's out there because the world
and light is not lived sitting at home
in your bedroom life is
lived out there in the world so I hope
that 2016 will be a year of being bolder
a year of more risks a year of more
challenges and a year of putting myself
out there it's going to be scary because
I'm just such a hermit sometimes but I
really want to do better I really want
to just improve and I want to do it in a
big way I don't want to settle you know
I'm still early on in my career and I
have so much to learn I have so much
room to grow and 2016 is going to be my
year to get out there and be bold so
those are my two themes for 2016
consistency in the daily routine and
just to be bolder in the grand scheme of
things those are what I'm going to focus
on and I hope that you can find a theme
that you'd like to focus on for yourself
this year as well all right now for my
new year giveaway so I want to give away
this happiness pendant by Missouri this
is a gold plated sterling silver pendant
with the word happiness engraved on it
this would be amazing for anyone whose
theme of 2016 is happiness but obviously
it's great for anybody because happiness
is just a great reminder in our everyday
lives if you check out Majoris website

words on them so they also have courage
love positivity and gratitude which I
think are all great themes for your year
