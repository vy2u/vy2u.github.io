Welcome back to Lavendaire.
So today I'm filming
in a slightly different angle, just because
I want to switch things up.
And I'm excited to share my 2018 goals and
resolutions.
I do this every year
at the beginning of the year.
If you want to see my previous years' videos,
I'll post the links down below.
Hopefully by now, you guys know
what a new year theme is.
I don't have to keep explaining it every year.
But basically, I'll start with my new year
theme for 2018.
It's &amp;quot;Lead with light&amp;quot;.
So I started off with the word &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; because
I wanted to step up as a leader in 2018,
because I'm leading the Artist of Life Mastermind
group and I felt a little nervous
and scared about it.
I wanted to feel more confident in my abilities
to lead
this group of people throughout the year.
And I also wanted to step up
as more of a leader in this new self help,
new media space online,
because I feel like I see a lot of new channels
forming and I think this new space
is only gonna grow.
More and more people are gonna get into self
help online.
Honestly, my goal is to make Lavendaire one
of the go-to resources
for learning about how to improve yourself,
how to create your dream life.
So I want to step up as a leader in this space.
And part of the reason
for wanting to call myself a leader is because
I feel like, last year,
I would get caught up in comparing myself
to other people.
And I would compare analytics and I would
just get really insecure about things.
And I feel like a leader does not compare
herself to others.
A leader stands strong
in who she is, and a leader focuses on her
own path.
She focuses on improving herself
and just doing what she does even better.
She doesn't compare,
she just compares to her previous self, if
you know what I mean.
After a little bit, I decided to add the &amp;quot;with
light&amp;quot; part because it gave multiple meanings
to the theme.
So &amp;quot;lead with light&amp;quot; as a whole also means
that, with everything I do, I want to lead
with light.
I want to make sure that I'm spreading love
and light into the world.
I'm spreading positivity, and I'm helping
others, encouraging others, uplifting and
empowering others.
(Did I say empowering already?)
Basically, with everything I do and everything
I create, I want to make sure that it's coming
from a place of light, a place of inspiration,
and not out of obligation or anything.
And another thing is, leading with light also
means I want to do things that light me up
in life.
I want to come alive more in 2018.
Sometimes I get into the hustle or the grind,
and I feel like I'm doing things out of obligation
or because I have to.
And this year, I want to kind of do more things
were I come alive, do more things where I
light up, because I honestly believe the world
just needs people to light up.
It needs more people to come alive, more people
to light it up.
I know that, for example, my previous videos
on finding your purpose or finding your ikigai,
talking about finding your strengths and your
gifts and all of that, it can feel really
frustrating for some people if you don't know
what your strengths are.
You're trying to find your &amp;quot;purpose in life&amp;quot;,
or whatever.
Honestly, I realize it's so simple.
It doesn't have to be … You don't have to
overanalyze yourself.
You don't have to overanalyze things in life.
All you need to do is to just do the things
that light you up.
Do the things that bring you joy.
Do the things that make you come alive.
And that's as simple as that.
All good things flow from the place of light,
a place of love, and a place of joy.
Alright, moving on, I want to share some goals
and resolutions for 2018.
I didn't make them super specific this year,
because I want things to just flow and happen
on their own time.
I don't want to force things to happen.
I just want them to come organically.
So one of my main goes is just to improve
my content, to become a better artist and
a better communicator so that I could create
even more beautiful videos and be able to
communicate my ideas in a more effective way,
in a more engaging way, in a way that's helpful
for you guys, because I just want to be able
to get better at delivering this message,
if you know what I mean.
On top of creating better content, I also
want to be more organized in planning ahead
and creating ahead with content.
Just creating a better system of making videos
and podcasts in advance so that I don't feel
like I'm doing it week by week.
Sometimes, my videos – like today, I'm creating
it now and I'm planning to upload it tomorrow
or the day after.
It's very right-when-it-happens.
But ideally I want a buffer of two weeks in
advance of content, so that I don't feel pressured
in that way, you know?
I just want to be more on top of my content-creating.
So my goal is to plan out content three months
in advance and have a backlog of two weeks
of content.
So I'm working on that now.
This year I'm ready to expand my team a little
more.
So I'm looking to hire a podcast editor and
a video editor.
There's a lot of fear around the video editor
because I've been doing all my videos this
entire time and I know it's gonna be clunky
transferring, teaching someone how to edit
the way that I want them to.
But I know that if I want to grow my business,
it's something that I have to learn how to
do eventually, how to work with other people
on the creative.
Basically, I'm ready to get help on my videos
because I feel like I have more ideas in my
head that I could possibly physically create
myself.
So it would be so nice to have help with that.
And then I'll also have more time to be able
to work on my book, which was something that
was a goal last year but I didn't get to finish,
so it's another goal this year, is to write
my book in 2018.
And for that one, I felt like last year, I
put too much of a pressure to finish the book,
and I didn't.
And I felt really disappointed in myself.
So this year, I'm not gonna put pressure to
finish, but I'm just gonna make it a resolution
to be working on it and just keep myself consistent
in actually putting in the work, but not giving
myself any pressure to finish it.
Another goal that I'm really excited about
is: Create the aesthetic apartment of my dreams.
I'm moving into an apartment the end of this
month.
And so I've just started furniture shopping.
I just really want to make it my sanctuary
and decorate it really beautifully.
I'm gonna have to compromise because I'm living
with my boyfriend, so I can't make it that
girly.
But I'm pretty excited to create a new backdrop,
new set and everything.
I also want to keep up exercising three times
a week.
I think three times a week, I feel really
proud of myself doing that.
This year, towards the end of the year, I
got kind of lazier.
I started exercising just once a week.
But for me, anything is better than nothing.
And so it's an ongoing resolution to continue
moving my body.
Another one of my resolutions is to cook more
healthy meals at home.
Hopefully when I move into my apartment, I'm
excited to cook more with my boyfriend so
that we don't eat out as much as we did this
year, because I feel like when we eat at home
and cook stuff at home, it's really healthy.
And I guess I want to learn more recipes and
have more dishes in my pocket that I can make
on my own at home.
Lastly, I want to create more space for self
care and positive habits.
For example: I love having slow mornings,
mornings where I could spend a lot of time
doing morning pages, meditating, having tea,
and exercising, doing yoga in the morning.
And also making time in the evening to read
and do skincare.
And I also want to floss more this year.
I'll try to floss at least four or five times
a week this year.
Flossing is just one of those things that
you know you should do but you don't like
to do.
I don't know, if you guys have tips on how
to make flossing a more joyful activity, definitely
let me know down below because I'm trying
to figure that out.
But yeah, I do want to improve my oral care.
I bought a tongue scraper recently, and gotta
take care of your teeth because it's the same
set of teeth for the rest of your life.
Alright, that's it for my new year theme,
goals, and resolutions.
If you'd like to share yours down below, feel
free to do so.
I'd love to read what your themes and your
goals and resolutions are.
Sorry if I have low energy in this video.
I had a flu last week and I feel not quite
myself yet.
Even though I feel like I've recovered mostly,
I don't know.
Something different about this year, I feel
different.
But we'll see.
Hopefully I get back into the flow of things.
Have a beautiful day.
I love you all so much, and I'll see you next
time.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
