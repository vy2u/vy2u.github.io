hi everyone its Eileen
today I want to take you along with me
as I do my evening skincare routine so
there are about nine steps to my typical
skincare routine I don't always use the
same product sometimes I switch out
products here and there but the steps
are generally the same so after spending
a long day wearing makeup
I can't wait to wash it off so first
thing I got to put on my headband get
those bangs out of my face whenever I
wear makeup I like to I'll cleanse first
so here I'm using moons a Qui cleanser
it's just an oil-based cleanser to break
down all of the makeup that's on my
space especially like the eyeliner and
stuff and the yes I am aware that I have
eyelash extensions and you're not
technically supposed to use oil-based
cleansers because it takes off the glue
of your lash extensions I don't really
care because I've had these extensions
for long enough so honestly I just like
using oil to remove my eyeliner because
if I'm just using a cleanser I feel like
I'm scrubbing at that area for a little
too long and I'd rather just break it
down in the beginning then I'll go in
with the second cleanse and this is like
one of my all-time favorite cleansers
it's just one that I've used for years
and years and I feel like I always have
to repurchase it so just wash it my face
off because oil cleansing is not enough
I feel like you do have to wash that oil
off and the best feeling is having a
clean freshly washed face after wearing
makeup for an entire day I just love
having a bare face alright next I'm
going in with a witch hazel toner I'm
gonna put this on a cotton pad and I
kind of consider this like my third
cleanse I like having a cotton pad to
just you know make sure that I've got
everything off of my face so it's like a
toner plus like last layer of cleanser
next I'm going to use this coconut water
toner and I'm gonna spray multiple
layers onto my face so this might take a
while I'm not gonna make you watch me
spray all these layers so I'm just gonna
do it once on screen but just so you
know it just depends on the night
sometimes I feel like spraying more
toner I'll do up to like six or seven
layers and that's just really helps my
skin like drink in all that moisture
next I'm going in with this Misha time
revolution essence I love this as you
can tell I'm almost done with this
bottle so this essence is a dupe of the
sk2 essence so I'm actually gonna try
that next
after I'm done using this bottle but
it's made of likes fermented something
fermented that I know that it kind of
like helps you rewind the aging of your
skin I'll post a link below for more
info but yeah here I'm doing like two
layers of this essence because yeah I
just like to pack on the layers of
moisture my skin is really dry so it
really appreciates like the extra layers
after essence is serum so right now I'm
using this leaders truffle oil serum and
this is just one that I'm trying out I
can't say that there's anything
particularly amazing about the serum so
I'm just basically using the bottle
until it's done all right now I'm gonna
go in with this night cream buy a new do
and I like using something heavier at
night just to seal in all of those
layers of toner and essence so this is
like kind of on the oily side but
because my skin is so dry it I don't
mind it I like that it's heavier and
oily err next I'm gonna go in with some
eye cream this one's by Cramer lab which
is a Korean beauty brand and eye cream
is something that I sometimes get lazy
about but I realize it's super important
as I get older because that's like where
your first wrinkles start to form so
I'll put on eye cream under my eyes and
then the crow's feet area even on my
eyelids and then if I have any extras
I'll put like them on either in my
forehead or like the smile line wrinkles
just to like prevent those aging
wrinkles you know
got a rewind my skin lastly this is like
my favorite product out of the bunch
this is the Lonny's lip sleeping mask
and it's essentially like a really thick
lip balm or a lip mask that you put on
before bed I love that it just seals in
the moisture on my lips it's not like
your normal chapstick or anything it
really is amazing so it's something I
highly recommend I loved lineage they
also have like a sleeping mask that I
usually use but not tonight
and there you have it that's my typical
evening skincare routine with the
products that I'm using right now but
like I mentioned I always swap out
products so it's constantly changing but
the steps are always the same in that
same order alright have a beautiful day
or a beautiful evening love you all so
much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
