contraception day coming up we're gonna
talk about birth control bear and its
international partner organizations
invited me to be part of the world
contraception day movements and support
the it's your life it's your future
campaign the vision behind the campaign
is to have a world in which every
pregnancy is wanted to achieve this goal
it's important that we're able to make
informed choices about our sexual and
reproductive health and since world
contraception day is coming up on
September 26 I want to help raise
awareness because I care I want you all
to be empowered to take control of your
body your life your future to know your
options for contraception and make the
best possible choices for your life
since some of you might feel
uncomfortable asking questions about
sexuality and contraception it might be
easier to ask on behalf of a friend
that's why I'm gonna share about my
personal experience with contraception
and encourage you to share and ask
questions using the hashtag a friend of
mine first off I know talking about and
dealing with birth control can be
uncomfortable and awkward trust me I
know coming from an Asian family where
it's always been taboo to talk about sex
birth control has never been something
I've been able to talk about openly with
my parents even after my mom's known
that I've been with my boyfriend for
like over eight years but the thing is
you got to face the uncomfortable when
your life and your future depends on it
and I found that the more I share with
friends that I'm close with the more
comfortable I feel talking about sex
growing up contraception options outside
of using condoms weren't really taught
to us in my school we did learn about
the female body and the reproductive
system and the miracle of life but birth
control options for females was not
emphasized since we weren't really
taught birth control options in depth we
really had to do that research on our
own and even if you did the research on
your own there was a barrier to getting
birth control because you had to go
through the doctors which might
your parents which meant I was probably
not gonna happen
personally I knew a good handful of
girlfriends who got pregnant too soon
like I remember sitting in physics when
my friend behind me told me that she was
pregnant and was showing me her
ultrasound photos in her folder I was
just like oh my god what are you gonna
do these were all smart girls who did
well in school and in life
we all just weren't fully educated or
empowered about birth control especially
as young girls growing up in an Asian
community most of us were really shy and
he was scared to talk or ask about
anything related to sex or birth control
at all for a while I remember I was
still going to a pediatrician and my mom
would still take me to my doctor's
appointments so there was a time where I
became sexually active and started to
get urinary tract infections all the
time I had to just keep going back to
the doctors for it so my doctor just
like looked at me with a face and asked
do you have a boyfriend and I straight
up was like no because I was scared I
didn't know what to say but it's so
important to go to the doctors and be
honest with the people who are trying to
take care of you I realized in some
cultures it's taboo to address female
body parts and so some women don't get
regular at pap smears girls get your pap
smears take care of your body and tell
your friends to do the same even in
college when I was on my own I still had
this tinge of shame guilt and fear
regarding birth control I'm sure for any
of you out there who have been sexually
active and not on birth control you
understand there's that fear you get
every month when you get closer and
closer and closer to your supposed
period and you're like freaking out like
crap is my period you're gonna come that
uncertainty is never a good feeling it's
never a good place to be so I finally
went to the doctor's because I knew I
had to get on birth control and protect
myself from any unplanned pregnancy so
together my doctor and I talked about it
and found a method that suited me my
body and my lifestyle so since then I've
been
a contraceptive ring on and off so I
started using it in college and then I
stopped using it after I graduated
because I ran out of health insurance
from school but even after I got health
insurance again I took almost a year to
get back on birth control because I was
like scared to face the issue like I
said a big part was that inner shame
guilt and fear regarding admitting my
sexuality and just the fact that it was
outside of my comfort zone I didn't want
to have to face someone and talk about
it I can be pretty non confrontational
so if something scares me or is awkward
or I don't know how to deal with it I
would just avoid it at all costs if
possible so during that time I was off
birth control my boyfriend's older
brother started dating his first
girlfriend which was a pretty big deal
so I remember my boyfriend telling me
about how his brother's girlfriend got
an IUD which is a form of long-term
birth control that goes in your uterus
and once I heard that my heart just like
sank not because of the girlfriend or
the IUD but because it was a reminder
that I have been putting off my birth
control for so long like I was just
really annoyed and frustrated at myself
for not being brave enough to handle
that situation like an adult like I was
avoiding it so I just got really
sensitive about it and I felt insecure I
started comparing myself to this girl
like oh my god look at her she was
responsible enough she was strong enough
and brave enough to go to the doctors
and get an IUD done which was something
that I had been considering for a while
so I just felt really inferior I was
very disappointed in myself and
generally I just felt bad for not being
responsible about my body but after all
of that settled down I realized that
hearing that story it was what I needed
to get me to go back to the doctors to
get back on birth control because
ultimately I knew that my life was in my
own hands and I had to be brave and
empower myself to take full control of
my body and my life now I'm almost 26
and all
be honest honey say that only in the
past couple years or so do I finally
feel confident and empowered about
talking about birth control and just
being fully educated on the topic which
took a long time it's kind of sad so I
just wish that I was more brave and
confident in this topic much earlier on
in life my point is it's so important to
at least educate yourself on your
options for contraception we live in a
world where we have so many options we
should feel lucky and take advantage of
them I just want to open up the
conversation around birth control and
safe sex I want to encourage you to go
out to do your own research by
consulting credible resources and talk
to your doctor about what works for you
your doctor is the best person to go to
for accurate information and individual
health advice note that not every
contraception method is made for every
body you really have to find the one
that's right for you recently I was with
my girlfriends talking about this and I
realized that we're all on different
forms of birth control something that
works for me totally did not work out
for my girlfriend and vice versa so
different options work best for
different people you just have to do
your own research and consult your
doctor together you can in trial and
error until you find the best one that
fits so here are just some options and
honestly I didn't know about most of
these until recently you have condoms
the pill contraceptive ring
contraceptive patch implant shot sponge
IUD whether it's hormonal or copper and
more every birth control method has its
own possible side effects so you do have
to communicate with your doctor and
weigh your options I understand that
some people have an issue with altering
your body's hormones and chemicals I get
it there are pros and cons to everything
I say to each their own the choice is up
to you I'm just here to share knowledge
and information to help you make better
decisions about your body and your life
for best advice about sexuality and
contraception talk to your healthcare
provider to find out more about all the
different methods available if you also
have a story you want to share you could
post it using the hashtag
a friend of mine remember you are in
control of your life it's up to you to
make the best possible choices you can
for yourself it's your life it's your
future
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
