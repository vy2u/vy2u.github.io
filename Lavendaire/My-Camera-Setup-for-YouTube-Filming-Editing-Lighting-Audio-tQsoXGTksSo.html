to share my camera setup and all the
equipment that I use to film YouTube
videos and this is part of a Q&amp;amp;A series
on starting a YouTube channel or blog if
you want to watch my other video on
advice that I have for people starting
out then you can watch that right here
it has a lot of good information but
this video is purely technical so I know
a lot of you guys are just starting out
so how I'm going to structure this video
is I'm going to share the equipment that
I use now and then I'm going to share
equipment that I recommend for people
who are just starting out alright let's
start with the camera so I literally
just upgraded to a new camera like a
couple months ago so the camera that I'm
shooting with now is the Canon ATD and
this is like a brand new camera I got it
because of its autofocus ability it can
autofocus really fast and really well
which is great for video before the ATD
I was shooting with a Canon t4i for
about 4 years
so the t4i is a great entry-level DSLR
honestly for those of you starting out I
highly recommend that you invest in a
Canon Rebel series so I think the new
one is like t6i but you can also get
like a used t3i t4i t5i whatever if you
want to invest in the DSLR this is like
a good one to really start with because
it can do a lot for being small and
compact but if you're looking to start
with a point-and-shoot camera which is
the smaller ones then i recommend the
canon GX 7 I think that one is like
super popular for vlogging a lot of
people recommend that one or if you
don't have any budget you can definitely
just use your phone to film your videos
at the beginning just start using like
an iPhone it's great quality already
better than like the macbook video
quality that i started with a long time
ago
next up let's talk about lenses so the
lens that I use for vlogging that's on
the camera right now is the Sigma 30
millimeter f-stop 1.4 so this is my
favorite lens to shoot most things
honestly because f-stop 1.4 is like an
app
sure that lets you open it up real wide
it lets in a lot of light so shoots well
in darker areas and it allows for that
like blurry background effect the next
lens that I'm really enjoying right now
and just learning to use is my new 18 to
135 lens that came with my 80 D so I got
this because it has like a huge zoom and
because this lens is made for this a TD
camera because the a TD is great at
autofocus and this lens is like really
quiet at auto focusing so if I'm filming
a video where I need to auto focus like
quietly then I will use this lens I'm
really really really loving it it's
amazing because with my Sigma lens I
just manually focus because the
autofocus is too loud those are my two
main lenses right now I also have a
broken on fish eye lens that's eight
millimeters that one I used for all my
travel vlogs in the past but it's just
not a very practical lens I haven't
found many cases where I needed to use
it so for anyone starting out and who
wants to find a good lens for YouTube I
highly recommend the Sigma 30 millimeter
one and another one that's really
popular is the canon 50mm meter one that
one's really affordable and gives you
that really beautiful background blur
effect next up in my camera kit system
are my tripods so i also got a new
tripod recently and it is amazing it's
the Manfrotto i don't even know what
number it is i'll put it down below but
it's a Manfrotto tripod that has a 3-way
pan so it has that smooth video motion
and if you watch my closet tour video
that's the tripod that i used for that
video with all those like smooth panning
but before that I had these other two
relatively cheap tripods one of them is
like this simple tripod that I didn't
even buy it was like at my house cuz it
was my uncle's old tripod for his
camcorder and basically I found it and I
used it for many years in YouTube that
one is similar to one that's on Amazon
right now and I'll link that below
another tripod that I started with was
this
tiny Sony one and it's because it's a
table tripod it was very convenient for
me to film at my old house because I
could just put this on a table or on my
like dresser in front of my bed to film
my old videos but now I have this giant
Manfrotto tripod that I love but yeah
you guys really don't need to start with
much sometimes I just stack books and
put my camera on there be creative if
you're starting out just stack things
and make it work also there's tons of
cheap tripods that you can find on
Amazon I'll link those below next up in
the system is this handy-dandy
remote so I got this from Amazon it's
pretty affordable but basically this
remote is so essential to like kind of
like start and stop videos you can use
it to take photos of yourself you know
it's just so convenient to have a remote
so that you don't always have to like go
behind the camera press start and run
back here because once you've set that
focus like I said I do manual focus most
of the time then I sit here make sure
it's focused and then I just press the
button to start shooting and to stop
shooting it's so convenient definitely
invest in a remote so for my videos I
record audio through this mic that sits
on top of my camera it's called a
shotgun mic it's the rode videomic
shotgun and I it's about like 2 or 3
years old I didn't buy it I got it from
my job where I work as a video producer
so perks of working in video it gets the
job done basically because it takes
higher quality audio than what your
camera takes but this mic has been
causing me problems recently and I would
upgrade to another one basically I do
enjoy having a shotgun mic on top of
your camera for vlogging but if you're
shooting things where you're really far
from the camera then you have to have
like a love mic which is a mic that you
wear on you I don't have those kinds of
mics so I can't talk about it but if
you're starting out you guys you can
honestly use your phone to record audio
your iPhone's mic is actually really
really good
so what you do is you take your iPhone
you open that voice recording app and
you put your phone as close to you as
possible but out of shot so then just
record press record on the camera and
you have to cap you basically clap so
that later when you edit the video you
could sync up the clap from the camera
to the clap from the iPhone audio so
after you're done recording your video
you just stop recording on the phone and
you send that audio file to yourself
whether through email or whatever and
when you edit your video you pull in
that audio file you match up that clap
and then voila you have amazing audio
for your video so if you guys ever watch
movies like they have that slate that's
what it's for it's to sync up the video
and the audio because it's always
recorded like separately next let's talk
about lighting so honestly nowadays I
try to use natural light as often as I
can I don't really like to use
artificial lights but I do have two
umbrella lights that I've used for my
videos especially in the past if you go
back to my old videos in my old bedroom
I have like two umbrella lights right
here towards me and that did the job
because I didn't have any natural light
in that room but now that I have more
natural light I try to use it and
natural light is free so if you don't
have a budget just film right in front
of a window that's the way to go if
you're looking for another cheap
alternative lighting then you can get
those paper lanterns I think they're
like five or six dollars each but just
hang those like white paper lanterns in
front of your face and you have lighting
so currently I use Adobe Premiere Pro
cs6 and I love it so previously I
started with iMovie that's free on the
MacBook and then I upgraded to Final Cut
Pro X that a lot of youtubers use
honestly Final Cut Pro is probably the
most popular program for youtubers to
use but I switched over and I wanted to
learn Adobe Premiere because I learned
that that's what filmmakers used to edit
films and I kind of got into the film
industry at one point so I was like oh I
should pick up that skill so after using
Adobe I think I edit faster on Adobe
than Final Cut so that's my
a program of choice but honestly you can
use any program and it doesn't matter as
long as you have somewhere that you can
edit your videos it really doesn't
matter what you use it's just how you
use it because you have to still use
your own creativity so for editing
graphics like making my thumbnail or
graphics for my blog I use Photoshop I
basically use Photoshop for everything I
know that not a lot of people can get
Photoshop so another really popular
program that I've used in the past is
PicMonkey and you just go on
picmonkey.com and you can upload your
graphics and create your thumbnails or
whatever graphics from there it's pretty
useful and I know that there's a ton of
other apps out there that make creating
graphics really easy so go out there and
do your research
lastly someone asked what kind of laptop
I have so I thought I'd just mention it
I have a MacBook that I got in 2015 that
is a 15 inch Retina screen I don't
really know the specs right now but it's
a good laptop I made sure that I
upgraded to this one last year because
my old MacBook died out I think creating
videos takes up a lot of space and it
takes up a lot of memory so you have to
make sure that you get like the fastest
laptop that you can afford to get I also
can't forget to mention my external hard
drives I have so many of these this is
my main one right now is 2 terabytes
Seagate and basically when I edit videos
I edit it off of my external hard drive
because this has more space than my
laptop and you want to make sure that
you edit your videos on something that
has a lot of space and is really fast
because you don't want to you know have
videos that get like malfunctions it
that can happen we're like those green
screens pop up anyway I've learned my
lesson editing videos on my computer so
now I only edit videos off of a hard
drive and as you can see I have a ton of
hard drives I think I have four hard
drives right now but this is my main one
all the other ones just have my old
stuff my old videos on them but just
when buying a hard drive just buy the
biggest size you can afford because you
don't want to get a smaller hard drive
and then have to upgrade to a bigger one
and then a bigger one you just want to
try
put everything in one big hard drive
which is the lesson that I've learned in
the past few years alright that's it for
this video make sure you check out my
other videos in this series such as
advice for people starting out on
YouTube and how to start a podcast if
you're interested I'll see you next time
