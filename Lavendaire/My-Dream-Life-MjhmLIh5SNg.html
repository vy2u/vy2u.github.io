five things that make up my dream life
hopefully by now you know that my
channel is all about how to create your
dream life through personal development
learning reading growing experiencing
the world or lifestyle design whether
you're building new habits or setting
goals and trying to you know do all of
these things to create this life of your
dreams around you the last time I made a
video talking about my personal journey
was a little over a year ago so in this
video here I talked about my life where
I came from where I was then I feel like
now I'm in a different place where I'm
more simpler in what I want so today I
just wanted to update you guys and tell
you what I've decided for now
the five things that will make up my
dream life because I feel like I'm just
a little further ahead than I was the
last time I made an update video I'm
still learning and growing so maybe I'll
keep updating you guys but for now these
are the five things that make up my
dream life for the rest of my life I've
decided I want to be a creator I want to
make things and I want to keep making
things and not stop making things and be
on a good schedule of making things as
well because I get lazy and I
procrastinate and I just want to be more
consistent with creating because I've
learned that I feel my best when I'm
creating you know that's where I find
myself in flow when I'm making a video
or recording a song whatever I'm doing I
have the most fun creating and also I
feel the most satisfied and fulfilled
once I'm done creating something you
know when I finished a video I literally
just sit there and watch it and I
appreciate my work and it's I'm you know
I'm proud of myself so in whatever form
it may come out of whether it's in
videos film music art anything I just
want to keep creating for the rest of my
life
books I love to read books and I want to
keep reading as many books as I can at a
good pace and just learning talking to
people growing absorbing the world
around me so that I could just I don't
know fill my mind with interesting
things I feel like if you're interested
in things and you learn more it makes
you a more interesting person and you
just expand your repertoire of what you
can contribute to the world because you
know so much basically I want to be a
student for life that is Who I am in my
dream life you guys already know that I
love traveling I feel like it's the best
way to go out into the world and learn
and absorb and also it makes you feel so
small and insignificant because you're
so little in this big world and this big
universe so it's really great to put
things in perspective this is also part
of learning and growing and expanding
because traveling is like the real life
way to see what's out there also I made
a video a while ago about how to slow
down time and it's really about putting
yourself in new situations in new
environments whenever you experience new
things time slows down for you because
you're more present your body and your
brain is like kind of making sense of
all of this new stuff around you it
really has to pay attention to the
details that's why when you travel your
mind is more alert and you're more aware
of what's around you versus when you're
at home you see these things every day
your brain is kind of shut off in that
sense so travel really exercises your
mind your body everything I think it's
just great it's really fun to see the
world to meet new people I just don't
want to stop traveling for the rest of
my life I want to be continuously
traveling forever
I want to see the love in the world I
want to give love I want to spread love
be a living expression of love I've made
a video like that in the past but it
really is about just seeing the world
through the eyes of love so you see the
positivity and the hope and you see
another human being as your family as a
part of you versus seeing people and
things as separate I think that it's so
important to see the world through the
eyes of love because there are so many
bad negative scary things that are
happening in the world around us it's
very easy to retreat it's very easy to
be negative cynical and just live in a
state of fear and put our walls up but
really what the world needs is more love
I can't preach this enough the world
needs so much love and needs people to
care about each other it needs
compassion kindness and it needs us to
kind of bring our love that we have
inside into this world by doing positive
things also I want to put love into
everything that I do as much as I can so
create things out of love speak to
people out of love and act out of love
in my dream life I want to be the
example of love I want to just be loved
like an aura of love and kind of spread
that and try to do that as best as I can
because I feel like love is the way to
lift each other up it's the way to bring
us together love is really the way that
you can contribute and make a positive
impact on the world and that's what I
want to do so so vitality means that you
are alive like 100 percent alive and I
want to try to be that as much as I can
a big part of that is health and
wellness you know taking care of your
body eating well exercising because
that's what really makes you feel good
about yourself and joy just to have as
much fun as I can every step of the way
joy is about being present and enjoying
the moment I want to be able to enjoy
every day every step of the way even in
the little things the boring things just
because it's all worth it you know this
is all life
it should be fun I honestly believe that
life is meant to be fun time is always
going to be moving forward
so once the moments over it's over
forever
so enjoy the moment while you can be
present that's what it's about that's it
those are the five things that make up
my dream life I feel like if I keep
doing those five things daily
consistently continuously then I will
have lived a good life and I will be
proud of myself for living a life like
that I think it's interesting because a
couple years ago I thought creating my
dream life meant to set these huge life
goals and to just do whatever I can to
make those things happen and a part of
creating your life is setting goals and
trying to reach them but I think now I'm
focused more on what I can do in the
daily routine of things you know what I
can control on the smaller scale I used
to set these huge goals and think I
would be happy once I reach those goals
but that's never a good way to you know
go about it because you don't want to
wait to be happy you don't want to wait
for something big to feel like you've
made it or something so really living
your dream life is being the best that
you can be being who you want to be in
the everyday so previously I always felt
a little anxious and uneasy because I
didn't feel like I was where I wanted to
be but now I feel like I'm exactly where
I need to be and I just need to keep
living life day by day enjoying it but
doing what I can to create be my best
self every day and I believe that if I
continue to do these five things
consistently in my life then it's going
to take me to where I need to be and
it's going to be an awesome journey
alright that's it thank you so much for
watching I'm so glad that I got to share
a personal update with you guys by the
end of 2015 because I feel like I'm
changing a little bit every day and I
don't notice it but through this channel
I get to like really keep track of this
journey so thanks for being here thanks
for just like your presence your
attention and your love and support I
really appreciate it and I'll
you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
