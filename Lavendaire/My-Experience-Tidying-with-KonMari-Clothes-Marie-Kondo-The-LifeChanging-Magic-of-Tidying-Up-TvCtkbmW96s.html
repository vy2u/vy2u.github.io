interested in seeing my tidying journey
so I thought I'd just make this video
showing some of the clips that I've
taken throughout my process of
decluttering and reorganizing my closet
before I get into it I just want to
preface it with this you know
decluttering is not a pretty process
it's not that easy for me to show my
mess to the world but you know I'm okay
with that I just want to be honest and
share my journey and hopefully that will
inspire and empower some of you to
declutter your life and you know refresh
and be happier with a new lifestyle so I
spent an entire Sunday tackling tidying
so I think I did tops bottoms and hung
clothes on that Sunday I just started
the process of asking myself does this
spark joy and at first it was really
difficult I didn't really know what I
was feeling about certain pieces I mean
some pieces I knew definitely yes I love
this piece because I've worn it recently
and I want to keep it but there were
some pieces that I was just kind of
apathetic about and I was like I don't
feel anything so maybe that means I
don't feel joy but at the same time I
felt like it would be a waste to discard
it so yeah that process of asking
whether it sparks joy was kind of
difficult for me in the beginning as I
went on and I started decluttering you
know tops bottoms hung clothes I kind of
found that there were some clothes that
used to make me happy but don't make me
happy anymore because they're a little
too worn in now or I just got tired of
them you know I must have I may have
liked them a couple years ago and I used
to be my favorite item it gave me a lot
of joy then but I realized that it
doesn't give me joy anymore and so with
those items it felt really good to be
able to kind of put them in the discard
pile release them and say thank you for
giving me so much joy while you're with
me thank you for making me feel
beautiful I'm ready to let you go peace
out so that felt really good
there were a lot of clothes that were
maybe so I had a maybe pile that I went
back to at the end to decide whether it
sparks joy because in the beginning
intuition is not that strong so if you
really don't know about a certain piece
you could put it in a maybe pile and
then come back to it when your intuition
is a little bit stronger after that epic
day of tidying the rest of my tidying
journey was just found in little pockets
of time in the following two and a half
weeks just because I had other work that
I wanted to do and you know you have to
keep a balance the next time I tidied I
think I started folding and putting away
my pants putting away my hung clothes
and the tops were a huge pile that I
actually didn't deal with after I
finished a couple other categories just
because it took a long time to fold the
tops I think I took about three or four
hours
folding tops and putting them away I
remember thinking to myself as I was
folding all the tops that I could still
probably discard some more because I
just feel like I have so many so if you
get that feeling feel free to continue
to discard stuff the following
categories were smaller so I could
discard and organize in a day so I did
my socks underwear and accessories in
one day I believe also hats are kind of
tricky I feel like has take up so much
space so I don't know what to do with
them eventually I tried to put hats
in hats kind of like how Kondo tells you
to put bags in bags just to save space
so once I finished most of the
categories I only had one category left
and that was shoes and I kind of
procrastinated to tackle that one on
because the shoes were just kind of the
last little thing that I was afraid to
tackle basically I think I had about a
week break before I tackled my shoes
shoes are just difficult because they're
heavy and when you're tidying shoes you
got to work physically you're gonna
you're bending down you're picking
things up you're stepping over all these
other shoes and trying to get from here
to there and there's just they take up a
lot of space I definitely had some
sentimental moments with my shoes
because I used to dance hip hop and I
have some shoes that I will
are to the death of them in college
dancing so here are a pair of my
favorite creative wrecks in college I
wore them so much I thought they look so
cool and I danced so hard in them that
there's a hole in the soul I was so sad
when I saw that hole I would have worn
those shoes forever yeah but with pieces
like that they meant a lot to me and
it's hard to get rid of them but I know
that it's not giving me value in my life
anymore it's just sitting there
so with those kind of pieces I took as
many photos and video clips as I could
and when I put it in the discard pile I
genuinely said thank you for all that
you've done for me in my life I'm going
to let you go have a nice life bye so it
felt really fun to do that with some of
my shoes I think in the end I threw out
half of my shoe collection
I kept around 40 shoes I threw away 39
shoes so throughout this cleaning
process I had my discard pile left in my
brother's room because he's not living
there right now he's in college so I had
just piles and piles of clothes in there
and after I finally discarded my shoes I
decided to tackle on my discard pile
start folding them up and deciding which
ones to donate which wants to throw away
so this is what I am donating there's
one big pink bag then the rest are
smaller bags so it goes I guess there's
six small bags and one big bag and that
black bag over there just trash and
these are just some shoes that I want to
donate so basically through this tidying
journey I've gotten rid of half of my
wardrobe and half of my shoe collection
so I think that's the ratio for me I'd
like to know as you guys are tidying
what's the ratio for you how much of
your stuff are you discarding and giving
away I've kind of taken a break for a
couple weeks on tidying just because
other plans are getting in the way but I
am deaf
really not going to give up I'm going to
finish tidying eventually Kondo says
that to tidy in one dramatic swoop
usually takes people around six months
so it's not an immediate process but if
you think about it six months out of
your entire life is a short amount of
time so keep at it keep doing it keep
going at your own pace you know keep a
balance in your life do what you got to
do but tidy as much as you can on the
side I think the most important thing is
that you just don't give up eventually
you're going to finish in the categories
and you're gonna feel even more and more
fresh after completing each category all
right that's it for this video let me
know how your tidying journey is going
I'd love to know and in the meantime I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
