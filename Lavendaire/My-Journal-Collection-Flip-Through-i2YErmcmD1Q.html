love putting pen to paper and letting my
thoughts flow this is the way that I get
to know myself it's the way I heal
myself and it's just a way to document
my life today I'm sharing most of my
journal collection just because I think
it'd be fun to just look back and see
where it all started this first one is
from junior high this is when I really
started to pick up journaling
consistently I started with poetry of
heartbreak so honestly all of my junior
high years were writing about my
relationships love heartbreak lots of
emo moments I was villian to rock emo
music and I was write down some lyrics
that spoke to me and yeah a lot of
emotions but at the end of his notebook
I did keep like a page of my favorite
inspirational quotes so maybe that's
where it started I don't know alright
this notebook is from the later years of
high school and again relationships
heartbreak relationship heartbreak
and I think this is hilarious I kept a
breakup letter I wrote in high school
this is actually the draft breakup
letter and what I did was I wrote it out
I gave it to my friend tawny and she was
like okay I'm going to highlight the
parts that are too mean and she
highlighted like 90% of it and so I had
to rewrite the breakup letter so this is
just a draft the real ones are in the
hands of another guy all right so this
notebook is from college my college
years I kept a poem that my friend just
gave to me something that she thought
was sweet yeah and at the end of this
notebook I noticed that I started to
write chords and lyrics to songs I guess
I started to try to write music in
college it never really came out to
anything though
yeah I just basically had a lot of ideas
that never really finished anything all
right this is a notebook that my friend
Alan gave to me before I studied abroad
in Italy so I kept it as like my travel
in those book a place to journal my
thoughts as I was traveling and studying
abroad so it only was a place where I
really got to start soul-searching and
take more time to myself so I think this
is where I started to journal more and
read more it's so funny to look back at
life my to-do list back then and what I
was going through at this point I was
trying to like find inspiration I guess
inspiration and guidance on what to do
with my life from here on out not to lie
though those first couple weeks in Italy
were really hard because I went without
finding an apartment so that's why I
received at the hotel I stayed at for
the first like week I didn't plan on
staying there that long I thought I'd
find an apartment by then but I just
couldn't find one and it was like have
to be in a new country where I don't
speak the language but I mean I'm okay
I've lived and I'm okay now
and I remember just like doodling the
couples I saw there saying how romantic
this place is
so this is one of my favorite entries of
all time I basically went to the theater
in Milan to watch long long play long
long is a pianist and he is amazing so I
was journaling in the theater sitting by
myself in the box office and being super
inspired and I just kept flowing and
flowing and flowing and it was really
really a beautiful moment so I kept the
ticket stub and on top I wrote down like
the melody that he was playing at that
moment so I would not forget it and I
kept that brochure so yeah long-long at
Teatro alla Scala Teatro and I was still
trying to write music in Italy just
trying to find inspiration to create
something the rest of the entries are of
my travels so I traveled to like over 10
cities in those six months and it was
really life changing as you can see I
cut my receipts from shopping and I just
like to keep this notebook separate just
because it's like a very unique chapter
in my life that I cherish
all right this notebook I got from
France and since this I started to like
buy notebooks whenever I travel because
to me it's like a souvenir that I can
cherish for many many years so these
entries are about my post-grad life just
being lost figuring out what to do just
kind of documenting all the random
things I was doing at that time
literally I was doing so many different
things a lot of failed opportunities and
all the while I was trying to work on
music so here I wrote down like my
inspirations and music and planning out
how to create my album which I did in
2013 this is when I was like actively
getting into self-help and reading a lot
of books exploring and experimenting
with a lot of different things in life
and I would always be re-evaluating what
is meaningful to me what makes me happy
so this is like one of those industries
oh and this entry I wrote when I was in
New York this is after I finished my
album and I was playing two shows in New
York and it was snowing and I was there
with friends it was super fun like a
really good memory the few months after
that I was kind of lost again I wasn't
sure if I should continue with music or
listen to my heart which was kind of
hugging me in another direction maybe
like entrepreneurial I wasn't so sure at
the time so here is an entry where I was
talking about how I have a show today I
have a performance yet I'd like watched
youtube for two hours and something
about YouTube was like intriguing me and
I asked myself why do i why am I so
attracted to the lifestyle of youtubers
and I guess is where I got honest with
myself with what lifestyle I really want
with my life and I thought that I kind
of like gave this dream away where when
I gave up on my music YouTube channel
but the dream was still there
so I had to explore it so I wasn't quite
sure if it was even feasible and it was
scary to be lost again but a few entries
later I noticed that I wrote this one
where I was like I have to allow myself
to try I have to allow myself to be
vulnerable and give it what I got you
know few months later as that's where I
came up with the name lavend dare and
yeah that's where it began and I started
planning my new channel and this new
direction that I was going in and that's
where that notebook ended so this mode
book I'm just going to flash through
because I showed it like a couple times
in previous videos already it's my
currently future me journal where I kind
of saw few meant where I am where I want
to be and I also have like monthly
highlights and kind of like a little bit
of planning in this journal
this is my current bedside journal I got
this in New York at the Frick Museum and
it holds a special meaning because that
museum experience was really special to
me I felt like that was a lucky day for
me where there was a long line it was
raining I was by myself and the security
guards either they liked me or they felt
sorry for me that I was by myself in the
rain that they just let me in to cut the
line and I felt like there were a lot of
serendipitous moments during that trip
so this notebook really brings me back
to those special moments so these are
entries that I would just write at night
whenever I felt the urge to express
myself or write something these are just
four years of going through life and
dare planning my life here is like my
vivid vision that I've shared with you
guys before in a webinar but yeah this
is like where it all happens all the
life planning and the life assessing now
trust in the universe just have my
moments of inspiration and moments of
doubt and just like any normal person
you know this is my current morning
pages notebook this is where I do stream
of consciousness writing where I just
flow in the mornings I don't always
write every day anymore but I just write
whenever I can and these are all of my
previous morning pages journal so I love
using composition notebooks I just made
it a tradition to do so but yeah I feel
like I'm pretty impressed and proud when
I look at all of these notebooks and I
can say that I filled up each and every
one of those pages it's kind of crazy
right
I never usually go through my old
morning pages notebooks just because
they're so messy and it's just so a
stream of consciousness that they don't
really make sense sometimes but I like
to keep them because why not this is
like me this is the evolution of me
documented on pages day by day and I
think there's a beauty in that that I
really appreciate though I will never
throw these away
this notebook I got from Japan and it's
a notebook for me to like take notes on
things that I'm learning so whenever I
take like an online class or something
this will be my notebook it's fairly new
I have like a lot of unused pages so
yeah and lastly my artist of life
workbook so most of you have probably
seen this workbook before basically it's
a way to plan your year and I have like
a lot of blank pages in this notebook so
I've used that to do like a success and
joy and gratitude journal so whenever
something good happens in my life I will
document it here and that's it those are
my journals from my journal picking
lives kind of excessive and that's not
even all of it but that's okay this is
me thank you for watching see you next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
