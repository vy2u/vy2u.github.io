Welcome back to Lavendaire.
Today I want to share a few simple things that bring me joy at the moment.
Joy can be found anywhere, even in the littlest things.
And life is just better when you can find the joy and beauty in everything.
So first: I love slow mornings where I have no plans, meetings, or obligations,
and can just do my full morning routine:
make some tea, journal, meditate, and just take time for self care.
#2: Having fresh flowers in my home brings me so much joy.
They're such a simple addition to my space, but they make it feel pretty and lively,
like my space is handled with care.
Caring for your space is like caring for yourself.
Small acts like this make a huge difference in your well-being.
#3: I'm happy I finally framed my artwork for my apartment.
These were laying around for a few weeks
because I procrastinated on trimming the prints to fit the frames that I bought.
Seeing the artwork in my living room now really lifts my spirits up because,
again, those aesthetic details make all the difference.
#4: Having a clean and tidy apartment brings me so much joy.
This one is a constant struggle because I feel like we're always messing up the place
after cooking or having a busy week.
Your space reflects your life.
So, admittedly, my space and life can be quite messy.
Taking the time to clean it up definitely sparks joy
and makes me feel like I'm getting my life together.
#5: Journaling with soft piano music in the background brings me joy as well.
Journaling out my thoughts really helps me clear my mind and feel at peace again.
Especially with some nice piano music in the background, I feel so relaxed and light.
This is one of my favorite self care practices and I'd recommend it to anybody.
#6: I have so much fun playing with makeup as a creative expression.
I love experimenting with different colors
and styles.
I see it as painting, but just on your face which to me is an art form that I really enjoy.
#7: Watching Hyori's Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast brings me so much joy.
I've already mentioned how much I love this show.
I just love watching their lifestyle in nature.
Seeing them find so much joy and fun in simple things inspires me to do the same in my life as well.
#8: I love finding great songs to sing to.
Singing is one of my biggest passions and sparks so much joy within me.
When I find a great new song that's fun to sing, I literally can't stop playing it.
[Singing] I can be all alone, watching reruns at home
But I seem to be waiting for you, just for you
Can't sleep, because I'm thinking of your face
Waiting for the phone to ring, just once tonight
#9: I'm also having a lot of fun with Wilson, learning to cook new dishes together.
It's becoming my new creative hobby
and I've already learned how to make some new soup and noodle recipes that I love.
#10: Wearing a new hair color also brings me joy.
I love playing with hair color, obviously.
And Coachella gave me a reason to experiment with this red ombre that I normally wouldn't wear.
It made me feel bold and fiery and it was just fun to switch it up.
After seeing this list, I realized that a lot of what brings me joy
is just creative expression in different forms and creating my dream space.
I think this revealed a lot about me as a person.
Now that you know about my joy list, tell me what things bring you joy.
Share in the comments below because I'd really love to know.
Alright, hope this sparked some inspiration in you to find the joy in your life.
Sending you so much love.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
