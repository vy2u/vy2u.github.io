video I mentioned that I got laser eye
surgery this past month and I loved it
so much so far so I know a lot of you
guys are curious about LASIK so I wanted
to make this full video dedicated to my
experience getting LASIK before during
and after the procedure so let's start
with what is LASIK what is laser eye
surgery even mean so this is your
eyeball there is a layer called the
cornea on top of your eyeball and how it
works is in LASIK they cut that top
cornea they cut it open and it flips
open and then a laser shoots into your
eyeball to change the shape depending on
whether you're near-sighted or
farsighted and what degree your vision
is yeah they will adjust it accordingly
to give you 20/20 vision I'm not going
to go into too much detail on how it
works because you guys can totally do
that research on your own I just want to
cover some common misconceptions about
lazy so something that I didn't actually
know until I went to my consultation and
read those pamphlets was you cannot go
blind from LASIK I think that's a fear
that a lot of people have they think
that if something goes wrong like
they're gonna go blind and they're
scared that that's going to happen
so in the u.s. no patient getting LASIK
surgery has ever gone blind and that's
because LASIK they only operate on the
top part of your eye so they don't touch
like the nerves or whatever's on the
inside which is how you could possibly
go blind I think and another
misconception is that LASIK is more
dangerous than wearing contact lenses
there's actually an article that I'll
link below about how contact lenses
could be statistically more dangerous
than getting LASIK and that's because
when you wear contact lenses every day
there's more probability that you're
going to get an eye infection and me
I've been a contact lens wearer since a
junior high school till now I would how
many years is that like
ten or more years wearing contacts and
I've got like two or three eye
infections especially during high school
where I got super lazy I would sleep and
take naps and contacts and wake up with
infections it was bad so on that note
let's talk about my thoughts before
getting LASIK and I'll just give you a
quick history of my eyes so I started
wearing glasses in fourth grade and I
think in seventh grade I started wearing
contacts in junior high and high school
I wore soft contact I think I mainly
used Acuvue contacts the ones where you
wear it for two weeks and then switch to
new ones and in high school that caused
me more problems because my eye started
getting really dry wearing those
contacts and like I said I would be
really irresponsible with sleeping in
contacts and get eye infections so my
eye doctor changed my contacts to daily
contacts so those are pretty pricey
because daily contacts you just wear a
day throw it away
it cost me almost six hundred dollars a
year for those contacts and ever since I
was like a senior in high school around
that time I knew that I wanted to get
laser eye surgery at some point in my
life I just knew that when I was older
like twenty something in the future that
I wanted to get LASIK so it's always
been on the back of my mind the question
was like when was a good time and they
always say that you should wait until
your vision plateaus and stops getting
worse and worse so if your vision has
been the same consistently for many
years then it's it's okay to get LASIK
so since I started college which was
like 2009 ish I had the same
prescription which was four point five
on this eye and 4.25 on this eye so
aside from not wanting to rely on
contacts and glasses the rest of my life
another big reason for getting LASIK is
that it's more cost effective in the
long term so like I said my contacts
were like almost $600 a year and
hopefully if I live until I'm an older
age that's gonna be like 40 50 60 years
that I'll be paying $600 a year if I
continue to rely on contact
glasses so if you can't afford LASIK
then it's actually an investment that
will save you money in the long term and
if you're wondering what the price of
LASIK is it really varies and depends on
where you go and what doctor you go to
but I'll post a link below that has an
article about like the average LASIK
prices alright let's jump into the
process of getting LASIK so the first
step is you go for a consultation and I
signed up for my consultation when I
noticed that I was running out of my
contacts and I was like all right I'm
not gonna order new contacts I'm just
gonna do it I'm gonna get laser eye
surgery so at the consultation they
basically check your eyes they do a lot
of those eye exams with the machines I
don't know what they're really doing but
they're just checking to see if your
eyes are suitable for LASIK depending on
like how well your eye takes pressure
how thick your cornea is I found out
that I have a thick cornea which is good
for LASIK because you have a thicker
flap for them to cut open and it's just
easier to heal one thing they also do
during that consultation is that they
dilate your eyes so that they can open
up your eyes and see what's inside so
they give you this eye drop that dilates
your eyes and they take you to a dark
room where the guy shines a light into
your eye which to me and my eyes are so
sensitive to light so it was kind of
hard but after the procedure like your
eyes stay dilated for I think a couple
hours you can drive home on your own it
will just be a little bit blurry so I
drove home a little bit blurry but it
wasn't too bad and they give you these
eye shade so you can protect your eyes
from the sunlight if it's sunny outside
but that's about it after all your eye
exams then you meet with the patient
manager who will talk to you about the
procedure she'll go over everything
answer all your questions and then also
go over the payment so what I really
liked about the place that I went to is
that they offered a payment plan so that
you don't have to pay everything at once
you could split up your payment over the
course of the next two years so that's
what I'm currently doing right right now
I'm paying like one hundred and
something dollars a month for my LASIK
for the next two years which to me is
pretty affordable for that kind of
procedure so
at the end of my consultation we set an
appointment for my laser eye surgery
date so I did this because I had
coachella coming up and I told the lady
that I wanted to go to Coachella and I
knew that I wanted to wear eye makeup at
Coachella and be fully functioning so
she was like okay then we need to give
you two weeks to fully heal before you
go to that kind of event and wear eye
makeup so she booked me like an
appointment the week after my
consultation so I didn't have that much
time to prepare but I'm really happy
that they could accommodate my schedule
because that was really nice of them if
you wear soft contacts you have to take
out your contacts three days before your
surgery so I took out my contacts on
Tuesday and I had my surgery on Friday
if you wear hard contacts then I think
you have to take out your contacts
earlier so maybe two weeks earlier and
the reason for that is because contacts
can affect the shape of your eye and
they want you to take out the contact so
that your eye can go back to its normal
shape and then they could like measure
your eye the morning of the procedure to
get a more accurate result
another thing is they gave me two eye
drops to start dropping in my eye three
days before the surgery so one eye drop
was just tears so tears are just to keep
your eyes moist and wet and the other
eye drop was antibiotics so I think
that's just for preventing infections
from happening they also tell you to
shower and wash your hair before the
procedure because after you get the
procedure you can't really get your eyes
wet for I think 24 hours after a few
days of preparation you are ready for
laser eye surgery so let's talk about
the procedure
so my appointment was at 3 p.m. and they
told me to reserve 3 hours for the
procedure I actually got out an hour
earlier so I think I got out around 5
p.m. so once you get there the person at
the front desk gave me a Tylenol so I
took that tylenol and then I waited
awhile when they called me in they did
all of those same eye exams that they
did at the consultation but what's
interesting is that my eyesight actually
changed after not wearing contacts for
three days so like I said before my
vision was like 4.5 is
and it went up to like a five I think so
my eyes are pretty bad by the way you
have to make sure that you arrange for
somebody to drive you home after your
procedure because you need someone to
drive you home you can't do it yourself
you can barely open your eyes don't do
it so after all the eye exams I waited a
little bit and then I got taken to the
pre surgery nurse area where the nurse
gave me a packets on all the things that
I would need after my surgery so let me
just show you what was in that packet
it's really simple so they already gave
me these tear eyedrops and antibiotic
eyedrops before the surgery but in the
packet we're just more tear eyedrops
which I really love these things they're
really great and then they give you
these eye shells so these are just
plastic shells that you wear over your
eyes when you sleep and they give you
like a roll of tape so you just like
take it on your face after the procedure
they tape this on my eyes and put this
like sunglasses thing over it so that my
eyes are protected the reason is when
you're sleeping you don't notice if
you're like rubbing your eye or not this
just protects your eye from getting
touched when you're sleeping and I
actually really grew to like these I
call them my eggshells I just thought
they were so cute
my boyfriend thought I look so stupid
with them anyway I show so after they
gave me the packet they gave me this
like head wraps to wear to cover my hair
so you put your hair up and after that
they take you to see the doctor the
actual doctor who will be performing
your surgery so you get to sit down with
a doctor right before your surgery ask
him any last questions that you have and
get all of those fears and anxiety out
and then they take you to the actual
surgery room when I got into the room
there was a nurse who gave me these two
stress balls that I could squeeze if I
got nervous during my surgery and the
nurse like drops these anesthetic eye
drops into your eyes and in a couple
minutes you'll feel that your eyes feel
like numb and heavy and then they lay
down on a chair where there
machine on top of you and the doctor
comes in and they talked to you during
the whole time they're really friendly
so let's see what do I so I'm just gonna
tell it like I remember it
so first going into surgery I was not
scared I was never afraid of the pain
because I didn't I heard that it doesn't
hurt you just feel the pressure and I
had read all the pamphlets and I knew
like logically what they were gonna do
to my eye I knew that they're gonna cut
it open flap it open shoot some lasers
in it I was fine with that um things
changed a moment when I was like laying
there the doctor was talking to me I'm
like cool cool cool let's do this and
then the doctor takes us like plastic
thing and like holds your eye open holds
this eye open like he like food and that
was kind of disturbing because I didn't
expect for that to happen I mean
obviously if you're going to do surgery
on here I you don't you want to hold
them open but just the pressure of
having that plastic thing hold my
eyelids open was interesting and that
was when I was like oh my god it's real
it's getting real and I mean nothing in
the surgery hurt nothing caused me pain
the thing is you can still feel the
pressure on that area if something's
shooting your eye or he's touching your
eye you feel the pressure you you know
what's going on because your eyes are
open the whole time so he holds my
eyelids back and then I just remember
the doctor like painting things on my
eye like dropping things and painting
things on my eye which is a new
sensation because you didn't know that
someone could have like a paintbrush and
paint some things on your eyes that's
just a new feeling that I've never felt
before and there is a machine on top of
you where there is a red light and the
doctor continuously says look at the red
light look at the red light look at the
red light and then what happens next is
probably the most difficult the most
like part of the surgery basically I
remember the nurse talking to me she's
like all right I'm gonna hold your hand
everything's going to go black for a
second just for a moment and
then you'll be able to see again don't
be scared it's just going to be a quick
second and I'm like okay so they're like
alright three two one oh they counted
down and I heard this machine go on my
eye everything went black It was as if I
went blind for a second it went black
and then it opened up again and that was
what I noticed that they cut open my eye
they cut open that flap I knew it and so
that was like this machine the doctor
takes I don't know if he takes off the
machine but basically after that he
tells you to look at the laser red light
and that's all you have to do you just
sit there and you focus on the red light
to be honest there were times where like
my eyes felt like everything got blurry
and out of focus and I couldn't even see
the red light anymore he's like focus on
the red light and I'm like where is it
so there were those times where my like
I don't I wasn't even sure what my eye
was doing I feels like an out of world
experience it feels like a weird kind of
dream but once that eye is done then
they move on to your next eye so they
did my left eye next and trust me the
second eye goes by much faster it's a
fast process anyway but because you know
what they're gonna do you know what's
happening you're like okay it's this
again everything went black okay yeah I
know what's gonna happen
look at the red light I know so that
happened and the funny the thing that
was different about my left eye was when
the lasers were shooting my eye I felt
the pressure and I smelled the burning
of my eye
it doesn't gross me out but I just think
that's interesting because that's my eye
it's weird it's weird it's definitely an
experience that I never had it's an
interesting ride after the procedure
which was like 10 minutes because it's
five minutes per eye um I don't remember
I think they I set up they put the eye
shells on me this was when I'm just kind
of like everything is blurry and I don't
want to open my eyes so they told me to
just keep my eyes closed and rest and
just wait for my right to come
and they reminded me that in my packet
where my sleeping pills two sleeping
pills one to take right after I did the
procedure and one like later on in the
night if I woke up so my boyfriend came
the nurse escorted me out and my I think
my eyes were closed the whole time so
people were just escorting me into the
car and it was funny because my
boyfriend brought me ice cream because
just saw the celebration and I wanted to
eat the ice cream I was trying to eat
the ice cream but I was like trying to
open my eyes to see the ice cream and I
was really hard but anyway I took the
first sleeping pill in the car and I
pretty much knocked out by the time we
got home and then I ended up on the bed
sleeping sleeping sleeping I think it
was like 6:00 p.m. and then I slept till
9:00 p.m. that's it I don't know why I
woke up and once I woke up I took the
second sleeping pill so that I could
continue sleeping so I think when I woke
up that was when the anesthetic started
to wear off and so I noticed my eyes
were just uncomfortable a little bit
itchy but obviously you you're not
supposed to touch it so it was
definitely a little bit uncomfortable
but I just took the next sleeping pill
knocked out until like 5:00 a.m. so I
slept through it when I woke up at 5:00
a.m. I took off those sun shades and I
was still wearing those eyes shells that
were taped to my face and when I opened
the eye shells it was like I could see
through them I was surprised that I
could see and what really wowed me was
when I took off the eyes shells like I
could see the time on the clock at night
and I wasn't wearing contacts I was like
whoa I could totally see everything
everything's clear this is weird so a
few rules that you have to follow after
the procedure are the day of the
procedure don't shower don't wash your
face you don't want to get water in your
eye because it's like a fresh wound and
you cannot wear eye makeup for two weeks
you have to wear these eye shells to
sleep for two weeks and what else and
you have to drop those eye drops as much
as they tell you to so I did the attaboy
eyedrops every four hours and the tears
every hour and the morning after my
procedure I went back for a checkup
because they like to check you the day
after you get your surgery so I went in
at 8 a.m. that's Saturday morning and I
just basically did the typical eye exams
and they tested my eyes and my eyes were
20/20 for the first time in my life
crazy and everything seems to be normal
so I was really happy with that so they
let me go and I went back to sleep I
think and I just had a really relaxing
day I think it was you could probably do
normal daily activities like the day
after you get your surgery you just have
to be careful with touching your eyes
don't do anything that involves like you
know activity around the eyes basically
one thing that I did notice was the
first night that I experienced with my
new eyes that Saturday night I was
overwhelmed with how clear the things
were I think I got dizzy because
everything was too clear and if you guys
have gotten new glasses it's kind of
that feeling where like the new
prescription is so strong you're like
whoa so I would have to close my eyes
many times during the first day just
because I didn't want to get dizzy and
another side effect of getting LASIK is
that at night you will see like extra
big halos around lights so it's not it
wasn't a big difference for me I didn't
notice like it affected my vision but
some it affects some people more than
others and they told me that though that
halo effect will fade after like two
months and even now a month after my
procedure I don't I'm not bothered with
those halos like it does I don't even
notice it it doesn't bother me I guess
it's not that bad for me so definitely
the second day after surgery things were
a lot better because my eyes were
adjusted to the new vision and I think I
lived a pretty normal life for that
first week and the only thing was it was
really hard to not wear eye makeup
because I had to film a video and one
day I actually broke the rule and I wear
eye makeup for a video but I wore very
light eye makeup and I was super gentle
with like washing it
and I'm okay so so the following week
after my surgery I went back for the
weekly checkup and that checkup they
check your eyes do the same thing they
just want to make sure that everything
is stable and what I was really happy to
hear was that my cornea had healed
perfectly smooth because there is a
possibility if you mess it up that the
cornea will heal like wrinkled so I
don't want wrinkles in my eye I'm happy
that I don't have wrinkles in my eye
everything is good now a month later
after my procedure I literally feel like
my eyes are normal
nothing is wrong no dryness I see things
clearly and at night I see things pretty
clearly too I noticed that my vision is
better in the day versus at night time
but it could be that halo effect that
will improve over time but it's not a
big deal and I still drop those
teardrops maybe once a day you could do
it more or less depending on how dry
your eyes get but like I said my eyes
don't feel that dry they feel pretty
good alright so if you guys watch this
far then that means you are really
interested in getting LASIK because I
think I gave a lot of information I have
no idea how long this video is going to
be but anyway if you guys are curious
the place that I did my LASIK eye
surgery is called IQ laser vision I went
to the one in City of Industry but they
have several locations all over
California and I really really really
really loved my experience honestly they
were super professional super friendly
they really walked me through every step
of the process and I felt really taken
care of I had heard of IQ laser vision
before through my mom through friends
and so I was really familiar with their
name and if you check them out on Yelp
they have amazing reviews so I for me I
definitely wanted to go to a place that
was reputable a place that I could trust
what's really great about IQ laser
vision and by the way they're not paying
me to talk about them at all they're not
paying me to make this video but what's
so great about them is they gave a
lifetime guarantee which really kind of
makes you feel comfortable because
essentially they're saying
if your eyes do get worse any time in
your life then you can go back and
they'll do the enhancement surgery for
free so that was something that I really
really loved because for me I was always
worried like what if in ten years my
eyes change and things happen so that
really like who makes you feel
comfortable with going with them so if
you guys are in the Southern California
area then I highly recommend you
consider them if you want to get laser
eye surgery because they are
professional and like I said I told that
lady I wanted to go to Coachella so she
was like okay let's go around your
schedule and I'll book you in time for
Coachella so that was like super nice
and literally they're the best people
they like the week after they remembered
me they remembered my name we took a
picture I think my photos on the wall
it's a fun place so if you guys are
interested I'll post their links and all
their information below so you can check
them out they also gave me like a stack
of referral cards that I can give to my
friends for $500 off so if you're
serious you could go to them mention my
name
Eileen sue with the code and get five
hundred dollars off so I actually
emailed them before I was planning to
shoot this video and they told me that
they'll give you guys a thousand dollars
off if you go in the month of May and
mention my name
Eileen sue and my code everything will
be in the description below okay so I
think we talked enough about LASIK for
the day I gave out a lot of information
if you have any more questions for me
then feel free to leave a comment and
I'll try my best to answer them thank
you so much and I'll talk to you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
