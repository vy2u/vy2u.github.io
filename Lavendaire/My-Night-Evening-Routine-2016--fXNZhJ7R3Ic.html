winding down by brushing my teeth and
pampering myself I just got this
electric toothbrush and I'm pretty
excited about it my favorite part of the
evening is definitely skincare I love
taking care of my skin so first I
cleanse with some micellar water and I
use this because sometimes I'm just too
lazy to actually wash my face after I
cleanse I grab moons rose toner and
swipe that all across my face this toner
really soothes my skin and I just love
the feeling of it next I reach for
Mischa's time revolution essence and
this is like a fermented essence that
helps keep your skin young it's like one
of those Korean beauty products that
everybody has to try once in their life
I love it
after the essence I'm using major
republic's aqua cream and usually I
layer on a ton of different skin care
products I have different ones on
rotation but the ones I use in this
video are like my current staples so in
bed I'm usually on my phone and one
thing I like to do is head to my day 1
journal app and I'll write a journal
entry for that day so I'll pick a photo
that I took that day something that
reflects what happened and then I'll
just like write a summary of what
happened that day just to keep track of
my life and what's important then I'll
head to my notes and I'll read through
some of the goals that I've written for
myself so I read through my life goals
and then I'll read through my yearly
goals after that I'll read through my
vivid vision which is basically a very
detailed description of my dream life
then I'll plug in my phone to charge for
the night and do some reading so I love
to read at night so that I could learn
something new and have that energy
absorb into my brain as I sleep so
currently I'm reading capture your style
by ami song of song of style this book
is about Instagram it's very beautiful
it's really fun and I'm actually
learning a lot when I'm done reading
it's time to go to sleep thanks so much
for watching guys good night and sleep
tight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
