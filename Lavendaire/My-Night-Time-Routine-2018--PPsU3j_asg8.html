Welcome back to Lavendaire.
So today I'm going to take you through my
night time routine which is heavily focused on skincare.
Usually at night, I am working until it's time to go to bed.
Usually I'm editing or just working on my
computer until I'm tired.
So when it's time to sleep, that's when I turn off my computer
and then I go change into my PJs.
Then time to brush my teeth.
Usually this is the most boring part of my routine.
I just think brushing your teeth is not that interesting.
Moving onto skincare, I'm using this 
Pixi Double Cleanse cleanser.
I really like using this because when I'm
wearing makeup,
the oil just takes it right off and I don't
have to scrub my face.
I love cleansing twice because I think your
face just feels extra clean.
Once my face is clean, I move onto this spray
toner that I'm really loving.
It's by Leaders, and it's so cute because
the name is &quot;What Happened Last Night?&quot;
Then I'm moving onto the 
SK-II Facial Treatment Essence.
And this one is quite a splurge, but I personally
think it's worth it.
After I started to use it, I just couldn't stop using it.
So I put that all over my face.
And then after that, I have this serum by Lancome.
It's the Youth Activating Serum
and I find that this really plumps up 
fine lines under my eyebags.
So I use that on my face, then I'm using this
new SK-II Facial Lift Emulsion Lotion.
Basically, it's a face lotion that adds the
moisture onto your face.
And I'm trying this one out.
This one I recently got last month, 
so I'll see how it works.
Next step is eye cream.
So I just got this eye cream.
I'm not sure how to pronounce this name - Sulwhasoo?
It's a Korean brand, and I saw this at the
airport and I bought it duty-free.
I just thought, the lady said it was a really
good product so I wanted to try it out.
So this one, I love it because it's think and it has ginseng in it, which wakes up your eyes.
It's a very energizing â€“ that's the right word â€“ 
energizing eye cream.
Lastly, if I'm feeling extra and want that
extra boost of nourishment and moisture,
then I use this Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask.
And this one, I just love it because I love
putting a thick layer of lotion on my face.
It just locks everything in, all the previous
steps that I've done.
Usually after I have that layer on, I'm ready to go to bed
and let it marinate in my face overnight,
which I actually think that all of these steps
work and they all do their own thing.
After my skincare, I head to the bedroom.
And there, I usually play with my phone.
And two things that I try to do every night is:
I use my Day One app, which is a daily journal app
where I will post photos from that day and
then I'll just log what I did that day.
It's like a digital diary, basically.
So today I had a shoot with LEAFtv, which
is what I'm doing right now,
so I wrote about that in my diary.
And then I will look through my notes, and
I usually write my goals
and the vision that I want for my life in my notes.
So at night, I will just take a couple minutes
to read over my 2018 goals,
all these insights and lessons 
that I've collected over time.
I like to just review it so that 
I end the night on a positive note
and remember what I want my life to be.
I think it really helps to focus on important
things before you go to bed.
And then, after that I try to go to sleep.
And that's basically my night routine.
By the way, if you guys want to see my morning routine,
you can check out my WAKE UP WITH episode 
on LEAFtv,
and I'll link that in the card and down below.
I hope you guys liked this video.
Thank you so much!
Love you all.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
