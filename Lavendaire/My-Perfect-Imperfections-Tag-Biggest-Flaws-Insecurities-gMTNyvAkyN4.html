wanted to do the my perfect
imperfections tag I first saw Jen in
from Close Encounters do this tag and it
was really refreshing to watch her just
share about her flaws and be vulnerable
in that way but also share like the
stuff that she does love about herself
and after watching that it just reminded
me that everybody is human we all have
flaws but at the same time we are all
perfect in our own way
and I think it's really important to
remember that even if you do feel like
you have flaws there are things that you
don't necessarily love about yourself
you are still lovable and you are still
like perfect in your own way perfect as
you are
okay so first imperfection that I've
always been self-conscious about are my
thighs and I feel like this is a general
problem area for a lot of women just
because some of us are just you know
blessed in this bottom zone a little too
blessed and I think it started when I
was in fifth grade I was around the same
height as I am now so sad I was like 5-1
in fifth grade and I was wearing size 1
pants in adults and in fifth grade
you're still like a kid and I think all
the other girls in my class were still
wearing like kids sizes and I was
wearing like an adult size one even
though like now thinking back size one
is pretty like small but I just remember
like bending down and this boy was like
oh my God look how big her butt is and
so I think since then I realized that I
was a little bigger down there compared
to some of my other girlfriends and I
think it didn't help that growing up I
took kung-fu for a few years and in Kung
Fu you have to do like horse stance
which is like a squat for like a long
time like they'll make you hold that
squat and build like your bottom muscles
so yeah I think that definitely
contributed to like my leg muscle and
just the thickness of it down there
hard hurts but generally yeah this is
why I like to wear dresses more than
pants I've just never felt like pants
have been very flattering for my shape
ever so that's probably like the biggest
thing that I don't necessarily like
about myself physically my next
imperfection are my eye lids and eye
bags so like the general eye area
because I have uneven eyelids I have
like multiple folds in both eyelids and
they're not the same so one eye always
looks bigger than the other and then I
have like natural eye bags I always get
comments on my videos like you look so
tired or you need to get some sleep
whereas like I probably got like 9 to 10
hours of sleep the night before so it's
definitely genetic and I'm gonna call
out my brother like if you look at my
brother he definitely has like those
same eye bags when he smiles I think
it's just natural in our faces and it's
been like something I'm self-conscious
about because I hate when people are
like oh you look so tired you look so
tired especially when I'm not wearing
makeup and that's like the most annoying
thing to hear right it's also a
challenge because understanding like the
shape of my face and the eye bags like I
don't always look good in every single
lighting situation you know I I think
with my YouTube videos I know to put the
light in front here but when I used to
act and I used to be in short films
there was like a time we were shooting a
scene in Taiwan and my producer was like
Eileen did you sleep last night like you
look so tired like your bags are huge
and it's because in other certain
lighting situations you know in film
they have like dramatic lighting and
they put the lights in different areas
so like you know if the lighting is not
right my eye bags are pretty prominent
and it just doesn't look good on screen
and so I just felt like that just was
something to be self-conscious about and
a little insecure about but I think as I
get older I'm just like learning to
brush it off more like I don't care if
people think I look tired this is my
face and I know what lighting works for
my face it's kind of like I learned how
to work with it you know my third
imperfection are my
hoes and it's just weird for me to like
bring it up and talk about it because
I've always been self-conscious of my
toes because my big toe is like a little
bit crooked it's just like not normal
and I know that it's genetic because my
grandma has the same type of toes and
just growing up I was always really
really embarrassed to show my feet I'd
always keep socks on wear closed-toe
shoes and even in college like when you
start wearing heels and stuff I would
always wear booties and not wear like
open toe heels and it's still now I'm
more comfortable wearing like closed toe
shoes even though now I'm like I don't
care if people see my feet now but
there's definitely been like one of my
insecurities growing up so even though
this is something I'm self-conscious
about the bright side is it's like a
reminder of my grandma my family
like recently I went back to China to
visit my grandma and she has Alzheimer's
so she basically didn't remember who I
was and there was a funny moment where
like I took off my shoe and I showed her
my foot I'm like look hey we're related
we're definitely related so I think that
was like a sweet little moment all right
so moving on to things I do love about
myself so I love my hair I love my hair
as my form of self-expression I love
playing with different colors and styles
cuz my hair is really symbolic to me I'm
sure you guys can tell I've learned that
my hair is actually quite strong and it
can handle bleaching I think before I
started waking my hair I always thought
that it was really like fine and thin
but the stylist told me like yeah your
hair can handle a lot like I've bleached
it for so many years so many times and
it's still really manageable and really
it gives me no problems like I really
like that it's straight and it's very
very like hassle-free another thing I
like about myself is my skin so I've
never been the type to really break out
or have bad acne or skin problems I
don't get rashes my skin is not too
sensitive so I'm happy and grateful for
the skin that I have it is just like
normal skin and that's why I love skin
care so much I love taking care of it
and keeping it moisturized but I mean I
just
rightfull that it doesn't give me any
problems and I've never had to deal with
those issues like that the third thing
that I like about myself physically is
my shoulders so I feel like I really
like the top part of my body because for
some reason like the top part is like
skinny naturally and then the bottom
part is like the more voluptuous
naturally like blessed type of body type
so my body's not balanced but I do like
the shoulders because I always felt like
I have good posture I think it's from
like yoga or dance or whatever it may be
but I don't know I just like wearing
like no sleeves tops to show off my
shoulders it's just something that I
liked I like just like this area all
right so moving on to like personality
or emotional things that I like and
don't like about myself and I'll start
with the imperfection first my
personality imperfection is that I am
not good at keeping touch I'm not good
at socializing that much in a way like I
just get this like anxiety when the
phone rings and I'm just like oh I get
this feeling like I don't want to pick
it up I want to ignore it even if it's
like one of my close friends I get like
that I just get like anxious or
resistant to it and I usually like the
issue with friends and the passes like
they always reach out to me and I never
reach out to them I don't like asking
people for help I don't like I just I
had to teach myself to learn to check in
with friends to see if they're okay you
know I had to teach myself to think
about others and reach out and put an
effort into friendships and
relationships that's something that I
had to like teach myself over time but
naturally I'm just kind of like lazy at
socializing lazy at making that effort
so that would be my personality
imperfection and something that I like
about my personality is that I'm very
understanding I feel like I can easily
understand someone else's point of view
I can easily put myself in someone
else's shoes and I'm really like quick
to understand like the situation or I
can understand concepts really easily so
that's something
I like about myself because I think it
takes empathy and it takes compassion to
be able to do that and I'm like the
person that can understand both sides of
a situation and really feel for both
sides because it's something that comes
so naturally to me I know for others
like they have a hard time understanding
someone else's point of view but I think
I just get it quicker and I think that's
something that's valuable and it's
useful and it's a positive trait to have
alright that's it for this perfect
imperfections tag if you're interested
feel free to do this tag as well if you
make a video tag me on Twitter so I
could watch it and share it if you're
not gonna make a video feel free to
comment below with your perfect
imperfections include 3 to 4 things that
you think are imperfections and 3 to 4
things that you do love about yourself
so I'd love to see that and I'd love to
just continue spreading like this
message of it's okay to be vulnerable
it's okay to have flaws it's okay to not
like everything about yourself but you
should learn to love and embrace
everything that you are I hope it makes
sense alright have a beautiful day and
I'll see you next time
