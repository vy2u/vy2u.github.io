In this video, I'm going to talk about my
personal journey in life so far.
The prequel to this video is actually this
vlog that I did on the best piece of advice
that I received in business school which is
to take your biggest risks while you are young.
So if you haven't watched that video, I highly
recommend that.
But in this video,
I'm kind of intimidated because I have a lot
to cover and I'm not sure how to cover it
all.
But I thought I should share a little bit
about myself and my life,
and how I took that piece of advice and moved
forward after graduation.
During my senior year of college, the first
half I spent in Italy studying abroad,
and at that time I was already anxious about
what I was going to do with my life after
graduation.
So I brought some books with me that were
self-help, how to find your purpose,
how to get out of your corporate job kind
of life.
Reading those books while traveling
really shaped my perspective and my views
on life.
My second semester of senior year
I came back to LA and felt like I came back
to the real world
because I was back at school and all of this
pressure just came bombarding at me
because people were asking, you know, &amp;quot;What
are you going to do after graduation?&amp;quot;
And I was like, &amp;quot;Oh my god, I still don't
know.&amp;quot;
Everyone was getting jobs
and so I thought that was what I SHOULD do.
I started recruiting and interviewing
with all of these companies, when deep down
I knew my heart was not in it
to the point where I would not go to interviews
because I'm like,
&amp;quot;I'm not even going to want to do this job
if I get it.&amp;quot;
So I would cancel interviews that I got.
I don't know.
I was lost.
I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew
it was not that lifestyle.
Because I had previous internships throughout
college, I had about seven internships
and I did not like any of them.
They were in &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; areas too,
they were in entertainment, marketing, advertising,
social media.
I just felt like my talents were never utilized
and I was not where I was supposed to be.
I've always been a performer my whole life.
I love being in front of the camera.
There are a lot of things that I love to do.
None of what I had experienced in internship
and working life felt right.
After graduation, my big risk was to not take
a stable corporate job
like what I thought I should do or what all
my peers were doing,
but instead set out to discover what I really
wanted to do, what I was meant to do
and create this ideal lifestyle of what I've
always wanted in my life.
My biggest struggle was to get over this definition
of success that I had
growing up with my peers and my family that
your worth is defined by
how prestigious your job is or how much money
you make,
and instead create my own definition of success
and what I want to do with my life.
To me, I want to chase meaning (and not money)
and I want to find a lifestyle
where I can be creative and where I can be
fulfilled at what I do,
where I am utilizing all of my talents and
skills in the best way possible.
So that's what I started with, and over the
past two years I've been clarifying my purpose
and my goals, and each day it gets clearer
and clearer which is awesome.
At that time I knew that I wanted to keep
doing music, and I knew I wanted to be
an onscreen personality of some sort because
that relates to my big goals
of being an artist and a personality, where
I'm a speaker and I'm writing books and,
I don't know, all of that stuff, building
an empire.
But the problem was I didn't know where to
start.
I put more energy into music and YouTube and
I learned how to produce music,
and I took classes on music production and
songwriting.
During that time I also decided to volunteer
for this small festival called 626 Night Market
because I had the opportunity to be a spokesperson
and a host.
To me,
that was a fun summer gig where I could practice
speaking on camera, and practice being a host.
That was a fun job to me, being able to interview
chefs and taste food on camera
and make fun food videos, and so I was really
happy that I got connected to that,
even though it was a small thing and I had
no idea where it was going.
Well fast forward to two years later, I'm
still with 626 Night Market
and we've grown so much as an event.
And as a spokesperson, I've been able to speak
and be interviewed on major media outlets
like LA Times, NPR, NBC News, Fox News,
and it's crazy, because I never would have
been able to have these opportunities
if I took a normal job after graduation.
Also I get to produce videos,
now I have my own little team of videographers.
And all we really do is make fun little videos
with talented people and I feel like I'm surrounded
by people
who are more talented than me and it's awesome.
It's a great, fun, and super flexible job
where I have a lot of time to pursue my own
personal projects
like my music and this new blog and vlog Lavendaire.
And with my music journey,
I wrote, produced, and released a mixtape
and my first album, my first EP, last year
and that was a huge personal project for me
that I'm really proud of.
Also I got to perform a lot last year, all
over LA.
I performed at House of Blues.
I even performed in New York, and that was
a risk in itself because,
I mean I wanted to go to New York, I wanted
to perform there so I thought,
&amp;quot;Why not reach out to all these venues and
see if I could perform there?&amp;quot;
And that was a risk, and I felt like, honestly,
I had nothing to lose
by reaching out to these venues.
So I did, and two got back to me,
and so I went to New York and I played two
shows.
That was a really fun experience.
In-between, I had so many failures.
I auditioned for a lot of hosting gigs,
a lot of acting gigs, a lot of which didn't
go through.
And some almost went through,
like I got a job, went to the first meeting,
and it just dropped and fizzled out.
I was also part of this other startup that
I had high hopes for but that fizzled out
and that died too.
I guess it's all about taking risks and putting
yourself out there in the best way that you
can.
A lot of stuff is not going to work out, but
the ones that do are going to reward you
for taking those risks.
So I think it's always worth it to go out
and reach for what you want to do because
it's worth it.
It's worth the risk.
And you'd rather live your life doing what
you want to do,
than living it always wondering &amp;quot;What if?&amp;quot;.
You never know until you try,
and right now I am still trying.
And even though I'm not even close to where
I want to be in life,
I feel like I'm on the right path and I am
so much closer today than I was two years
ago.
It's just a journey in continuing to discover
yourself and find what works for you
and find where you're supposed to go, and
to create opportunities for yourself.
To me, the big goal is to be an artist/personality
where I am creative,
where I can create beautiful and meaningful
things whether it be through music,
through video, film, or writing.
I just want to create and share what I have.
I want to write books in the future.
I want to just create and share.
And hopefully it'll inspire some people.
That's a huge reason why I started Lavendaire
because it feels very close to my purpose,
and it felt like I could jumpstart this journey
a little bit more by creating this vlog, because
Lavendaire to me is a place
where I can share what I learn with all of
you guys and hopefully it could add value
to your life.
I'm trying to live my ideal life and create
these opportunities for myself,
and I'm learning that everybody can do this.
Lavendaire as a person, me,
I'm trying to live my ideal life.
But Lavendaire as a vlog and a blog, is me
sharing what I learned from my journey from
my failures and mistakes,
and sharing it with you guys so hopefully
you guys can be able to create your ideal
life.
So that is the huge ultimate goal of it all,
and I hope that makes sense to you guys,
hope it doesn't sound too crazy.
I mean, there it is, you know.
I've shared it!
If you guys have any questions, comments,
thoughts, please feel free to leave me a comment.
Or if you want to email me, you can email
me at lavendaire [at] gmail [dot] com.
I hope what I shared today helped you guys
a little bit.
I feel like it's kind of messy,
and I really haven't-I really didn't cover
a lot of stuff, so I'm really might do another
video.
This is the overall picture right now.
I hope you enjoyed this video.
Come back for a new video next Wednesday.
I'll try to put in some videos in-between
because I have some other ideas that I want
to do.
Good luck to you all, be brave, do what you
want to do.
Love you guys, bye!
Peace!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
