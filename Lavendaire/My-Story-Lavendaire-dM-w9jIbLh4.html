wanted to share more about my story and
really go over the key moments that
brought me to where I am today so
hopefully by now you know that lavender
is my blog about personal growth and
lifestyle design where I share knowledge
and inspiration on creating your dream
life so how exactly did I get here
first off I went to college at USC and I
studied business and communications so
throughout college I was really trying
to figure out what kind of career I
wanted and I tried out a lot of
internships so I did about seven
internships in entertainment social
media fashion advertising and at the end
of it I still didn't like any of them I
didn't feel like I really fits in any of
those jobs or industries and I really
did not know where I was supposed to go
what I was supposed to do so during my
senior year of college I decided to
study abroad in Italy and it was there
that I really had a good chunk of time
to start soul-searching and read books
and journal and blog and discover myself
so that was really the start of my
journey to personal development and when
I came back from Italy I still did not
know what I wanted to do and at the same
time I was being bombarded with all this
pressure and stress to get a job after
graduation and I kind of had this
breakdown that time so ultimately I
decided that I did not want to get a
corporate nine-to-five job like all my
other peers were doing I just felt in my
heart that that was not for me that I
had something else that I should be
doing when I was really honest with
myself I realized that in my dream life
I wanted to be creative I wanted to be
my own boss
have location freedom and really do
something that made a positive impact on
the world I just did not know how to
make that happen so after graduation
instead of getting a job I decided to
set out to try everything that
interested me so in the next few years I
pursued music
I released an album and performed all
over Southern California and New York
and collaborated with music producers
from all over the world which was really
cool I also started working as a PR
manager and spokesperson for the largest
Asian food festival in America and
eventually I became a manager of my own
video team there so together we shot
food videos interviewed chefs and small
business owners and had a lot of fun I
also tried out hosting acting and
producing so I produced my first short
film in 2013 and I also acted in a
couple other short films so I did a lot
of really fun creative things but don't
get me wrong I had my fair share of
failures and rejections as well for
example I got dropped from the first
film that I was ever cast in I got
rejected from this program called Red
Bull Music Academy that I worked really
hard to get into and I gave up on
creating an app that I had prototype
took classes for and worked on for
months through these experiences I
really learned how to listen to my
intuition and let my heart guide me
through life and I also developed a lot
of positive habits over time like
writing morning pages meditating and
reading and doing yoga basically I
learned a lot by exploring and trying
everything that interested me and
through this process I really started to
weed out the things that didn't fit me
or fulfill me and hone in on the things
that did and eventually I learned how to
build my life around that sweet spot of
doing what I love and what I'm really
good at so this whole experience
encouraged me to create lavender because
I just wanted an outlet where I could
share all these amazing lessons about
creating my dream life now I'm going to
place where I love my life and I'm so
grateful to have built this amazing
supportive community online recently I
even gave my first TEDx talk which was
literally a dream come true
and it moving forward I am only going to
keep pursuing my dreams and work on
creating an amazing life for myself so
as I share my journey through lavend
dare my goal is to empower you to
embrace your true potential
creates your dream life as well so let's
all become master artists of life and
rock this world together
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
