previously I made a video called my
camera setup for YouTube where I share
the things that I use to make videos and
recommend some camera for people who are
starting out on YouTube you can watch
that videos here but today I just wanted
to give an update on my new camera gear
and also just share the camera gear that
I bring with me as I travel so cameras
for vlogging and for taking photos
mostly for Instagram so this is my new
baby this is the sony a7s 2 and I've had
this for a few months now I got it right
after I did YouTube next up because they
gave us like a gift card to purchase new
equipment which was really cool but
basically this is my second camera I use
this to shoot b roll and more filmy
pretty scenes because i still use my
Canon ad D to shoot like this kind of
vlog because it has a flip out screen I
like to be able to see myself with a
flip out screen and I really like my
Sigma lens so I still have that camera
but I got this camera because it's like
really powerful for low-light shooting
for video so whenever I travel I don't
have control of the lighting and this
video quality it just looks so gorgeous
it's like film and people do shoot short
films on this thing so it's super
powerful
so the sony a7s it's a full-frame camera
I just wanted to upgrade to full frame
and I've got this because it's a
mirrorless camera which means it has
like a smaller body this camera is just
so much easier to travel with than my
Canon because it's smaller plus I got
this lens for my Sony the 24 to 70 this
range covers everything that I need when
I'm shooting travel vlogs and travel
photography I just wanted to get like
one lens for this camera because I don't
want to be like changing lenses here and
there so even though it could be like
much more powerful and prettier with
some prime lenses I'm really happy with
the zoom lens that I have right now the
only downside to the Sony Asia
is like I said the screen doesn't flip
out 180 degrees I can't really film
myself with this camera so that's like
the biggest thing also it doesn't have a
touchscreen and my Canon has a
touchscreen so I'd have to get used to
you like just navigating the Sony menu
and stuff so yeah this is my main camera
for shooting video and photos when I'm
traveling I think if you look at my
Instagram maybe like 75% of the photos
are taken with this and then the other
25% are taken with my iPhone and I got
this case that molds perfectly to the
shape of this camera which is really
convenient because it's small enough to
fit in my little backpack purse so it
basically looks like this in its case
and I just put it in my purse just like
it is the second camera that I bring
with me is the Sony point-and-shoot this
is the rx100 mark 3 and this one has the
flip out screen so this camera is
actually perfect for vlogging on the go
like if you want to look at yourself and
the quality of the images is really good
already so this is pretty good it's just
the fact that I wanted to be more
creative with my shots
I wanted to create more bokeh in the
back and I just wanted to create more
like filmy travel style vlogs or just
fill me videos in general so if you go
to my Instagram and scroll like I have
some videos that are just like mini
movies I want to create like one-minute
mini movies for Instagram and that's why
I'd like to have my bigger camera to do
that kind of stuff but honestly this
camera is fine for vlogging for photos
whatever next I just bring one tripod
with me when I travel I always have this
in my purse I don't use it as much as I
want to but I always have it with me so
this is the Manfrotto mini tripod right
here it's small but it's super strong
like you can put a really heavy camera
on here
like my big camera does just fine and
there's a button you can push here that
it like you can move this thing on top
I'm going to test out how I like this
I'm going to see if I can like do some
vlogging like this but
I don't know it's just nice to have one
tripod with you something that's small
and powerful next I just have this pouch
of extra batteries so I have two extra
batteries for my sony a7s - the big
camera because that one kind of goes
through batteries really fast it just
doesn't hold that much charge and the
small one I have like one extra battery
that I put in this little pouch so I
don't know if you watch my previous
video on hat like packing tips
I love pouches I keep pouches from
everything these are not pouches that I
bought I always use pouches from other
stuff so this is like a pouch from an
Amazon remote this is a pouch from like
a beauty I shadow thing so yeah those
are the cameras that I travel with and
they are more than enough to suit my
needs and my desires as you can tell I'm
on the Sony train now I do love Canon
and I like I said I still use my Canon
ADB but this is becoming like my
constant favorite camera I'm always
using this to like practice photography
and shoot everything in my daily life
this is a camera I carry with me every
single day of my life because I want to
shoot photos just for fun you know for
Instagram if you want to shoot photos
actually more than videos I would
recommend you get like the sony a7r - or
this just for a 7 because the a7s2 is
for video it's more catered towards
filmmakers because of its like low-light
capabilities it shoots 4k it just has a
lot of stuff in here
but for me because i mainly shoot video
plus i like to take photos this is the
camera for me this was like a really
popular camera now with youtubers i see
more and more people converting to sony
so it's kind of crazy you can research
all those like so many versus canon
videos i'm sure you'll find that sony is
like up-and-coming and they're taking
over so yeah alright links to everything
are down below thank you so much for
watching I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
