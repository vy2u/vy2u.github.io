lab and dare today is gonna be a chatty
video just to share my life update I
wanted to show off my new hair of course
and just catch up
I guess cuz I haven't really talked like
this and expressed what I'm going
through and where I am now for a while
I've made a lot of like well edited
videos and just thinking like my channel
has grown quite a bit in the past two
months and I realize a lot of you are
new so you might not really know
anything about me so hi what's up if
you're new welcome to lavend dare
welcome to this beautiful space this is
like a space that's really special for
me it's a space that I wanted to create
for all of you to come here and learn
about personal growth get inspired and
just find your people if you've always
felt like you're going through like a
lost phase in life or maybe you're just
a little bit different than your peers
like this is the space where we're all
welcoming we're all supportive we're
encouraging and this is a space to
discover yourself to explore and really
get to the core of who you are and what
you want to do with your life so yeah in
short lavender is all about personal
growth and lifestyle design and I'll
post like a playlist right here that
shares a little bit more about my
background story and how all of this
started but essentially like this was
supposed to be like a channel where I'm
tracking my personal growth and how I'm
figuring out how to create my dream life
and as I'm reading books and figuring
things out I am sharing all the lessons
and tips that I'm learning in my life
and now it's just evolved and I feel
like I am maturing in this with my
channel and in life and that's the
reason like why I did my hair I had this
like major urge to transform myself in a
new way like I really needed a refresh
and for me my hair is like a symbolic of
me like Who I am what's going on with me
so like I don't know whenever there's a
major life event I changed my hair in a
big way like I always wore like long
black hair
College high school and before and when
I graduated college that's when I
decided to chop my hair off into a bob
and that was like a major transformation
and then it followed me through my years
of exploring through music and working
and auditioning all that stuff and then
in 2014 I decided to bleach my hair and
start going to do those pastel colors
which was super fun and I've been doing
that for the past 3 years or so so the
year that I bleached my hair that was
the year that I started blabbing dare
with this new look and I guess like I
like having pastel hair because it's
always changing I felt like I was going
through a phase of life where I was
constantly changing I was constantly
learning and growing and trying to
figure out my way and now I feel like I
don't know I just can't explain it but
I'm definitely in a different stage in
my career at least I feel like things
are more stable now I finally feel like
I'm in a place where I'm like okay this
is working this is happening like my
dream life is literally a reality like
so much of it is a reality and all the
things that I wished for in college when
I was lost and confused like all those
things that I wanted in my dream life I
was like I want to be my own boss I want
to be creative I want to make a positive
impact and help others in some way I
feel like I have that now and then in my
head now it's more like okay well what's
next and how do I tweak it how do I
continue tweaking this dream life into
something better how do I keep improving
on it so one thing I can say about that
is that if you've ever contemplated like
starting a channel or making videos
being creative in some way like
definitely do it because you're going to
grow and for me I mean you know I love
journaling I love documenting my life
this is just like another expression
another way that I can document things
and share it with the world so yeah if
you want to start a channel do it
to be honest the real irony with my life
and where I am right now is that this
whole month of August I've kind of been
like in a slump because I traveled for
three weeks and then like I had two
weekend trips after that so I felt like
for five weeks I was constantly packing
and unpacking and I was like trying to
like catch up with like my youtube
schedule but I couldn't I I'm not sure
if you noticed but I didn't post so
consistently in August I missed a lot of
like my regular upload date so I felt
like I was falling behind I felt
overwhelmed with the amount of things I
had to do or did things that I wanted to
do and it just I felt like a mess kind
of and that's why like when I finished
coming back from my the last weekend
trip I had to take I decided to like
chop off my hair nacho you know my bangs
and recolor it to get a fresh start just
because I want to start over again in a
new way and the irony is like I feel
like you know everybody goes through
these moments where we feel imperfect
where we were like struggling but at the
same time like every day I get like
positive grateful messages from all of
you guys sending me like emails or on
Instagram Facebook and it's just crazy
that I mean I'm super thankful that I
get these nice messages and I'm really
really like honored to be able to help
you in your life it's just like a weird
juxtaposition where you feel like crap
and then you get these messages that are
so kind and they do make my day they do
lift me up but at the same time I can
feel like an impostor you know what I
mean
you
I guess what I wanted to share with this
video is just a glance at reality
because no matter who you are if you're
going for your dream life or not like
there's ups and downs in life and even
if your life is pretty good like you
really have everything you ever dreamed
of it doesn't mean it ends there like
there's still so much life left to live
and there's going to be new challenges
and new things that come along and
that's part of the journey so I I don't
know I just think that doing these
chatty life updates gives you more of a
reality check I want to be as authentic
as possible with these videos but at the
same time when I'm creating a lot of my
like life tips and listy advice type
videos I know a lot it can seem like all
that I'm about is like positive tips and
stuff which I mean who doesn't like that
I mean it's helpful yes but the parts
that are real are also helpful so I
think it's important to show all sides
of the journey the good and the bad and
you know we can share about our
struggles together at the end of the day
I think always be kind to yourself
whatever struggles you're going through
even if you're having good times bad
times whatever like always be kind to
yourself especially when you are
naturally the type of person that sets
such high expectations for yourself and
you want yourself to do the be the best
everything or whatever like if you're
super ambitious like it's going to be
tough sometimes when you don't meet your
own expectations and that's like
self-inflicted disappointment so always
be kind to yourself be gentle and
realize that no matter what happens
anything that happens no matter how bad
it is like if you're still living then
life goes on good and bad because
honestly for me I feel like you know all
the things that I wanted in life is
almost basically all here like I am so
grateful to be able to help people
genuinely help people all around the
world I'm grateful to get to be creative
I'm grateful to have a life where I can
wake up whenever I want
I have so much freedom in my life and
you know I feel filled so much of my
dreams that I've said this before that
like I can technically die tomorrow and
I'll be fine with that like I'll be
happy with that but the thing is like
I'm still alive and I still have to keep
living I still have to keep going and
doing things and then on the flip side
like if you're going through like a
really like sad or depressing bad time
in your life if you're still living life
goes on so whether you're in a good
place or not so a good place like life
will always move on there will always be
new experiences and new challenges it
doesn't end meaning there's there's so
much more left to learn and explore so
yeah so for me this month was all about
I mean trying to catch up with my work
but not being able to feeling
disappointed feeling stressed feeling
overwhelmed and then after all of that
just trying to be kinder to myself be
gentle with myself and just let myself
let go let myself rest let myself take a
break let myself miss a few days of not
posting videos on my consistent schedule
and not feeling so bad about it honestly
like if sometimes I think about it it's
kind of like I stuck to my schedule so
hard because you know it helped me stay
consistent while building this channel
but at the same time like you know it's
not gonna be the end of the world if I
like disappear from social media for a
week actually it's pretty refreshing to
disappear from social media for a week
it's pretty refreshing to not post on
Instagram every day and it's more like
it's nobody really cares what I'm doing
if I disappear I don't I think it's fine
people are gonna continue living their
lives and I can continue living my life
too so I I think sometimes you make
things such a big deal when if you
really take a step back it's not such a
big deal and it's fine like we'll always
go on no matter what I think at the end
of the day if you could find peace with
yourself if you could learn to kind of
like what's that called defuse the
stress
if you can learn to stay present in the
moment and just do your best at this
very moment right in front of you then
that's the very best you can do
sometimes if your best is just like
laying in bed for like thirty more
minutes just because you just physically
can't get up like that that's your best
sometimes your best is you're in flow
and you're working hard and things are
going great that's great but other times
it's a struggle just physically mentally
whatever it is and just do your best at
that given moment so I guess moving
forward let me know what type of content
you are interested in seeing do you like
getting to know me and Chatty updates do
you like more of just like informational
inspirational videos that can help you
with your life obviously I'll be making
a lot of those I just don't know what
type of like personal content that you
guys want because I do want to keep
making videos for my community you know
you guys who actually know me and care
about me to some level rather than just
like the people who are passing by so I
think honestly I'm just gonna continue
tweaking lavend dare to what feels right
and I wrote this in my journal the other
day like I have to always remember like
why I started I have to remember the
whole vision of lavender which is just a
platform to inspire and empower others
to be their true selves and live their
dream lives because I think that's like
the most important thing in the world I
know you can argue with me on that one
like oh no this is more important or
that is more important but I honestly
think like with a diverse amount of
human beings on this planet everybody
has something unique to them some sort
of gift something that they are the best
at doing something that they have to
share with the world because when you're
doing what you love that's when you're
bringing your best to the world and
you're you know tying in all your unique
skills and your unique experience to
contribute to society and
some way and I think we need everybody
to contribute to society in their own
unique way and collectively that will
change all these different industries it
will change like just society as a whole
and that's what I think is super
important like there's no more time for
people who live a life that they don't
want to live it's there's no time for
people to just settle at a job that
they're not fulfilled at because there's
no time to settle like we don't have the
luxury to settle like the world needs
you the world needs what you have the
world needs your experience your unique
lens of the world your strengths and
your talents the world needs it because
it needs you to be your best so that
like everybody needs you to be your best
so that we can all help each other and
gain from each other we could all build
a better society together like I
genuinely believe that we need everybody
to be operating at their highest level
we need everybody to be inspired and
fulfilled and feel joy in their lives
because imagine what a world that would
be like if everybody was like that like
it would be amazing and like I think
that you know all the industries would
balance out because yeah I know a lot of
people like go into finance and
accounting because it makes money but
there are people who are genuinely like
really good at numbers and really good
at calculating stuff and they're meant
to be an accountant but a lot of those
people they're actually meant to do
other things and you know that's why you
see I don't know it's kind of like they
could be contributing in another area
where they could be doing more but
instead a lot of people settle and a lot
of people don't take that risk to live
your life to the fullest and you know
untap your fullest potential so that's
what I'm passionate about and I feel
like I'm constantly trying to utilize my
experience my gifts to you know create
what I creates in the world and I'm
doing my part the best I can
obviously like nobody's perfect we're
all trying so I just hope the
I can be here to encourage you to keep
trying as well no matter how bad things
get okay that's all I have to say for
now I hope this wasn't too messy or
crazy but I love you guys have a
beautiful day I'll see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
