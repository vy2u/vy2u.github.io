officially one week into 2015 and I
don't know about you but I'm super
excited for making this my best year yet
today I'm going to share five questions
that will help you close 2014 with a
bang and create an amazing year for
yourself in 2015 these questions are
based on my own year-end review that
I've done for myself these past couple
years and they've just been so helpful
in helping me reflect and steer myself
in the right direction so without
further ado question 1 what were the
highlights of 2014 so write down the
most important and biggest moments that
you've had this past year and try to
write down at least 10 things what I do
is at the end of each month I kind of
write down my highlights from that month
and at the end of the year I kind of
just pick the highlights from those
highlights and I do this because I think
it's so important to remember your best
moments and the moments that made you
happiest or the most excited in that
year because you want to cherish those
moments forever I believe that a few
years down the line you're probably not
going to remember a lot of these moments
and memories from 2014 unless you write
them down and so just write down the
things you want to remember the things
that you want to capture and keep
forever about your life question number
two what did you learn in 2014 what were
your biggest lessons so write down all
of your life lessons that you learned
this year and also tie it to the
experiences that you had and the reasons
why or the story behind how you kind of
learned that lesson it's important to
kind of capture this wisdom and keep it
with us forever you know what I do is I
keep a notes section on my phone where I
kind of write down you know phrases or
the kind of lessons that I learned
throughout the year it's so important
because you don't want to make the same
mistake twice you know if you've
experienced something you live and learn
and make sure you kind of keep that
knowledge and wisdom and you're just
going to be a better person in the
future if you are mindful of the lessons
that you learn question number three how
did your life evolve in 2014 this one's
about growth look at what you
accomplished this year how is your life
different today compared to what it was
January 2014 how are you different from
who you were one year ago this question
is super important because you want to
make sure that you're growing and that
you're constantly evolving if you notice
that you or your life haven't changed
that much in the past year then maybe
you should consider taking a little bit
more risk in 2015 or learn something new
you know try new things make sure that
you're not too stagnant and that you're
not too comfortable because you know we
always want to be growing and moving up
you want to level up moving forward
question number four is what do you want
to invite into your life in 2015 what do
you want to experience and what do you
want to feel this is where you can write
all of your intentions everything that
you want to invite into this year
everything that you desire whatever you
decide to write it should make you happy
and excited for this year you know you
can list any habits that you want to
create anything you want to learn what
do you want to improve on any places
that you want to travel things you want
to do put them all in this space and
feel free to list any goals that you
have for 2015 but make sure that you
don't list too many because if you list
too many goals it kind of falls into
that category of New Year's resolutions
that don't ever really happen what's
important is that you pick a small
handful of important goals to you and
you can focus and commit to you have to
believe that these goals are very doable
and you have to know that you could
commit to making these happen also make
sure that you put these goals and
intentions in some sort of notes that
you can review constantly you know try
to review them once a week every day
every night as often as possible because
the more that you review them the more
focus you can be on making
happen and that's how you create your
amazing year in 2015
final question question number five is
what is your theme for 2015
pick one word or one short phrase that
could be your focus for 2015 your theme
is your guiding light that will help you
prioritize your life if you ever faced a
dilemma or you have to make a decision
or if you kind of fall off the path and
become discouraged your theme should be
on top of all your goals and intentions
you know it kind of leads the way my
theme for 2015 is flow and that means
that I want to be in a relaxed
productive State to be operating at my
optimal level and flow also means that I
want everything in my life to flow in
congruence meaning I want everything
that I want to do everything I have in
my life to be aligned with my purpose
you know to be aligned with who I am and
who I want to be and if it doesn't fit
that then feel free to release that from
my life and so that's what flow means to
me in 2015 I want to know what is your
theme for 2015
let me know in the comments below so
that's it for my five questions but I
also have a bonus tip for any one of you
who want to kind of dig deeper into
making your year even more amazing i
highly recommend creating a vision board
for 2015 a vision board is a visual
board of images of things that you want
to invite into your life and images that
inspire you so it's very similar to
question number four where you list your
goals and intentions but in a visual
format and images are just so powerful
that once you see an image of something
your brain kind of relates it to reality
because seeing is believing and so kind
of the more that you see it the more you
can believe it can happen and it can be
your reality so having a vision board on
top of you know all of your goals and
intentions is
adding like another oomph layer you know
I mean a vision board is a concept that
kind of deserves its own video so I'm
just going to leave it at that and let
you google the rescue yourself alright
that's it for today thank you so much
for watching I hope this helped and I
hope you create an amazing year for 2015
