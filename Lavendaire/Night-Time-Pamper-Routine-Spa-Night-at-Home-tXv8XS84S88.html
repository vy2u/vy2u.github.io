there today I'm going to show you my
nighttime pamper routine these are just
things that I do to give myself that
extra little love and care to just feel
amazing in general and for me February
is all about self love and self care so
I just made a video on the self love how
to love yourself better and I'll put the
link to that video in the description so
you can check that out but today's video
is focused on self care just taking care
of yourself from the outside in because
it works you know it makes you feel
amazing inside when you just feel like
everything's on points outside today's
video is a collaboration with my friend
Sarah nurse she's actually an American
living in Germany currently and she does
videos on intentional living living
abroad traveling etc so check out her
video on her nighttime pamper routine
I'll have that linked below and also the
card in the upper right corner I don't
know if it was that way or that way
so I hope our videos today can give you
some new ideas on how you can take
better care of yourself and just up your
self-care game alright on to the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
