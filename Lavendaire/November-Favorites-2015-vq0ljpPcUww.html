favorites video I hope you all had a
wonderful Thanksgiving and that you
spent your time with your loved ones and
eating really good food this past month
has kind of been a transition month for
me since I just moved and now I'm just
settling into a new place buying new
furniture and so that has influenced my
favorites for this month I have a couple
of favorites that are home goods and I'm
just getting more into like researching
home decor and that kind of stuff my
first favorite is the core water bottle
I got this water bottle because my old
one was just getting really scratched up
and bad I previously used the water
bottle which I loved because I loved
that big size 32 ounces I tried to find
another water bottle that's 32 ounces
that looks cool but this is the best
that I found so this core water bottle
is 25 ounces I think and I just love the
shape I'm really into water bottle
designs and so if I have a water bottle
it has to look really cool what's nice
about this bottle is that it's a flip
cap so when you flip the cap open that
rim is really smooth and it has a mantra
on it this one says be the change and if
you flip it over it says imagine so I
think you can kind of like customize
whatever you want it to say and it's
kind of a nice little reminder for you
to kind of read while you take a drink I
also love this triangular handle because
it makes it really convenient to just
take this bottle everywhere and I really
do take this bottle wherever I go
because I'm kind of a water freak and I
love drinking water all the time so if
any of you are in the market for a new
water bottle or if you want to just buy
it as a gift for someone for Christmas
then I highly recommend this bottle it's
cool it's sleek it's easy to use and I
love it so much my next favorite is my
new desk chair which I love so so much
because it's so cushiony and comfortable
and unique it's this modern light gray
tweed chair it's actually a replica of a
designer chair it's called the organic
chair so I will post the links of where
I bought this chair on Amazon versus the
actual real designer chair they look
exactly the same different color but
honestly this chair is like
built so well and it feels so nice to
sit on I love it so much my next
favorite is my desk lamp as you can tell
I'm redoing my workspace so this desk
lamp is awesome because it's shaped like
a calla lily and I think it looks very
modern and whimsical and it just it's
really fun when I saw it I was like yep
I like that one
so this light has four brightness
settings and it's also LED so it saves
energy next up are my favorites in music
so a Samba has been on repeat is Justin
Bieber and healthy the feeling out of
his entire new album I like this song
the most another song I've been really
digging is impression of you by giraffe
page this is just very fun and it brings
me back to those summertime good vibes
and I love happy sounding like lush
types of electronic productions so the
song is just really like ear candy for
me lastly I watched something called
World War 2 spy school on Netflix that
was so fascinating so this is produced
by the Smithsonian Channel and it's kind
of like a documentary but it's like
better produced and it's just really
cool because it tells you the story
behind Camp X which is the first camp in
North America to train spies
so think about James Bond and those
types of spies people who go incognito
and have to train in so many different
skills so yeah that's what it's about
it's just super cool super fascinating
and I really love that they actually had
like these old men in the documentary
who went to spy school so it was these
old guys talking about their real-life
experience and just of how they I don't
know when on missions and how a lot of
their friends didn't make it and it's
very interesting it's kind of sad but
it's kind of like empowering and it's I
don't know it got me emotional at the
end as well so of course it's about war
it's kind of brutal but it's just very
very very interesting to watch alright
the Sun is setting so I'm gonna sign out
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
