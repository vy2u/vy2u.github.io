channel lavender today we're gonna do
November favorites and first off I just
want to say like I haven't done this
sitting down talking video in Ohio I
think the last one I did was October
favorites if I'm not mistaken I'm not
sure but it just feels like it's been a
while cuz a lot has happened in this
past month so first off I started off
this month with a trip to Portland
Seattle and Vancouver and I have a vlog
of that video that I'll link below but
that was like a really fun family trip
but right after I got back from the trip
I had to like pets it's my friend's dog
for like a few days and then right after
that I had to go to YouTube next up
which is a program that I got into if
you haven't heard it was like kind of a
competition where we entered a video and
some essay answers and YouTube picked 20
creators to invite to their studio we
had like a week long video bootcamp and
we like learned a lot made a lot of
friends made videos and it was quite the
experience so I plan to edit that vlog
next so if you're interested in that
week stick around on my channel but yeah
after that it was like rush for the
holidays because I had like a
friendsgiving and then Thanksgiving with
family and then since then I've just
been kind of like recuperating and
unpacking my stuff from next up just
slowly just trying to figure out how to
get back into my regular schedule and
routine again but I don't know if it's
possible since Christmas is around the
corner
I feel like the holidays is a time of
the year where my schedule is just all
thrown off because of social events and
just random things like that but I can't
complain everything is great I'm so just
thankful for everything and by the way
we hit a hundred thousand subscribers
like acknowledge that on the channel yet
but I've posted it on snapchat and
Instagram I'm doing a giveaway you guys
stick around till the end of the video
if you want to find out how to enter but
basically I'm giving away these three
Amazon fire tablets so you guys can read
and browse the Internet my favorite way
to read is through ebooks on my tablet
so I thought I'd give the gift of
reading ebooks to three winners so I'm
gonna pick three winners maybe next week
so yeah like I said instructions at the
end of the video so alright let's jump
into November favorites I don't have
that many favorites this month because I
was just traveling and doing random
things but I'll share the things that I
did like this month so my first favorite
is this big scarf that I have it's huge
I've never had a scarf quite this huge
it's like literally the size of a throw
blanket and I think this is called a
blanket scarf yeah I love it so I took
this with me to my Seattle Portland
Vancouver trip and I love it because it
doubles as a fashion accessory but when
you're on the airplane or in the car for
a road trip it's basically a blanket you
know I always get cold in airplanes and
cars and this is like perfect because
it's not quite like a jacket you just
throw it on top and when you're too hot
you just go like this and it's easy and
it's so soft and fluffy and it's
comfortable so I do have to disclose I
got this sent to me through fabfitfun
through their box and it was part of
their fall box but that was like a
really cool gift from them my next
favorite is this Korean skincare product
that my friend Jean recommended to me so
thanks Jean basically it's this essence
called make OOP raw sauce and it's a
essence that is made from maple tree sap
and I use this when I was at my friend
jeans place and I just fell in love at
first like drip because the consistency
is thick and it's kind of like a honey
issue consistency except it's not sticky
it's more watery
and essence is basically the thing you
put on after toner before your
moisturizers and I love trying all these
different kinds of Asian beauty skincare
products and this has really been useful
I feel like it's thicker than this
previous essence that I use the Mesha
time essence and this one is more like
moisturizing and thick for winter
because my skin is dry and when it gets
cold my skin gets even drier and I just
like to pack it on so also when I was
traveling this month I took this essence
with me by just putting it into this old
serum bottle that I had so the lesson
here is keep your skincare bottles and
packaging just in case you'd like to
pack something bigger into something
like travel sized alright the Sun is
setting but I'm gonna finish this
so my last favorite is a concert that
was earlier this week I got to see
Porter Robinson and Maddy on in concert
and it was like such a great show if you
guys follow me like you know how much I
love Puerto Robinson he inspires me he's
basically one of my favorite artists out
there right now because I feel like his
music is great but he also brings that
aesthetic and the storytelling behind it
and like his shows are just so pretty
because his songs like he mixes like
pretty and soft beautiful things with
like the hard and party type of beats
and I just I I appreciate that and when
he played divinity which is like my
favorite song like the visuals were like
all pink and cloudy and I just it felt
so like girly and dreamy and beautiful
and that's what I love
so that show is just really fun to watch
and I don't know it was my first time
going to like a sit-down EDM concert and
it felt a little weird like watching the
earlier acts cuz we're like sitting in
an auditorium assigned seats instead of
like standing randomly in a club or
something and it really I was like wow
like real people pay to sit down to
watch DJs now and that's what thing
anyway it was strange but yeah that's it
for my favorites now on to
way before the Sun sets even more so the
giveaway is simple I got these 303
Amazon fire tablets they're very very
versatile because obviously you can read
a Kindle you can read any books that you
want from the Kindle app and I think
when you have a fire you get access to
Kindle unlimited which is like Amazon's
library of a bunch of free ebooks that
only their tablets can read and also
obviously you can watch on YouTube on
this you can watch the lab and dare on
this tablet so a lot of cool things you
can do and I think as I send these out
I'm gonna like add some assorted makeup
because I have a lot of like random
makeup that I've been gifted that I
don't need and I'd love to just share it
with all of you guys so to enter this
