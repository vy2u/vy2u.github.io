it's Eileen it's so good to see you
again
so today it's time for November
favorites and November was a great month
a lot happened it was very bold I went
to Japan and had a blast I think my
highlight was like going to Disney Sea
which is just a gorgeous Disneyland on
water with a ton of boats and I love
water so that was really fun I also
soft-launched my artist of life workbook
if you're not caught up on like
Instagram or my email list then surprise
I have my artists of life workbook up on
my website I haven't like launched the
actual video on youtube because I wanted
to wait until my website issues are
fixed so I've been kind of having a
nightmare this week dealing with like
tech issues and trying to upgrade my
website and I don't want to create any
problems for you guys so just be patient
and I'll let you know when everything is
fine now that that's out of the way
my first favorite of this month is this
bucket bag that I got in Japan isn't it
so adorable I love that it looks like a
bucket with a little handle and I
spotted this at the mall at the train
station in Yokohama and I'll post like
down below where exactly I got it but I
just thought it was super cute and ever
since I got it I've been wearing it
every day and it genuinely makes me
happy like when I hold it with the loop
I feel like I'm holding my lunch pail or
something and I just think it's so fun
my next favorite are my new skincare
products and I'm gonna get real bougie
on you guys because I basically got
these two items duty-free at the airport
coming back from Japan so obviously I
wanted to take that opportunity to shop
tax free and I don't know I think this
year I'm allowing myself to splurge on
skincare because skincare is growing
more important to me I think because I
just turned 27 and I think this time is
when you want to preserve as much as you
can and do as best as you can so I don't
know I just gave myself permission to
splurge so I got the SK 2 essence
lemare creme de la Mer I think that's
what it's called but these are two
staple really popular items from these
two major brands and I've heard so many
great things about these two products
and I've been testing them both out
together and I think I tried like a week
just using the sk2 and then now I'm in
the process of just trying lemare just
to see which one is better because I
know when I combine them the results are
really amazing but I want to be able to
tell like which ones doing what so I'm
still in the process of really
experimenting but I will say like I
think my first thoughts are the lemare
creme has more of an effect on my skin
versus the sk2 essence and I was
surprised because I thought the essence
was like I mean everybody loves this
product everybody raves about it so I
thought that I would see like immediate
amazing results and I did but I'm just
saying like comparing the two I think
the lemare is better for my skin because
I have dry skin and the lemare is like I
just like that it's such a thick cream
and it I don't know it has magic in that
jar next I'm gonna get real basic on you
guys another favorite was Taylor Swift
her new album and reputation but also
like all of her albums from the past so
this whole month I've been on the Taylor
Swift like wave and I feel like since
reputation came out I bought it I
listened to it I loved it there were
songs that I didn't love as much and
songs that I really loved and thought
she was like an artistic genius for
writing songs like this and then
listening to reputation made me want to
go back and listen to all of Taylor
Swift songs from her entire history of
writing music and guys I probably cried
to Taylor Swift songs in my car this
month like over 10 times I'm not even
joking I'm not exaggerating I cried so
many times to Taylor his songs this
month like her olds a good like
beautiful storytelling like all too well
I cried just so many songs like she's
just so good at like drawing out emotion
from you she's so great at painting a
picture of a story where you see
yourself in that story like you know
that feeling she's talking about so
I just think she's amazing and this
whole month Oh another thing I really
really love this month was watching her
making of videos so she has a series of
videos where she shows how she wrote her
songs for her new album there are like a
lot of the videos are up on YouTube so
you can search them yourself but I
personally love seeing the creative
process as an artist I love seeing the
behind-the-scenes looks at how to create
a hit song just because I love music and
I love being able to appreciate
something go from an idea something
going from a rough draft to like the
polished end version and I love seeing
how lyrics change throughout the
versions I love hearing how the
production changes through the versions
and it's just surprising like I respect
Taylor Swift as an artist so much and
anyone that wants to talk her down like
oh my god don't even don't even start
the hate don't start the judgement
because in order to be where she is
today she definitely has the talent
she's definitely worked hard for it and
she might be misunderstood yeah she
might have made some mistakes yeah
but so do all of us so I'm the person
that has no judgment for celebrities
like I accept them and I see them as
humans and I see them as artists too and
like I just have so much respect for
Taylor Swift and I am thankful that
she's revealed her like creative process
for us to watch alright now I'm gonna
get a little more obscure for you my
next favorite is this book by ill chili
it's called I've decided to live a
hundred and 20 years I know what a weird
title right you're like what the heck
like 120 years are you crazy
so let me give you a little backstory
ill chili is this guy fun fact is I
actually met him in 2015 his team
invited me to Sedona to his Meditation
Center and I got to interview him so
I'll post the link to that vlog right
here since then I've stayed in touch
with them and this is his most recent
book and I just started reading it I'm
only like a fourth through the beginning
basically this book talks about how we
as a society are conditioned to plan our
lives up until like age 60 like we don't
really think about what we want to do
with our lives
past age 60 when in reality we actually
live to like 80 90 even a hundred now
like there are a lot of people who are
living longer than ever before but
they're spending like 20 years of their
life doing nothing
20 years idle with no plans and no
dreams because their dreams stopped at
age 50 or 60 or even younger so ill
Julie is 67 years old and he's at a
place in his life where he originally
thought that this was the end of his
life but he realized that he could plan
for so much more because in reality
humans have the capacity to live till
120 years old but why don't we plan for
that why don't we continue having dreams
up until that point so he just is all
about continuing to use your life to do
good continue to fulfill your dreams
continue to create new dreams and
fulfill them even in the later half of
your life and it's really inspirational
I think it's catered towards people
older obviously but it's beneficial for
people of all ages because the younger
you are the more time you realize you
have so I think traditionally like we
think that by 30 we want to get married
have a house and have kids and by 65 we
retire but these age numbers were
determined in like the 1800s like in the
1800's or 1900s like 65 was the
retirement age because so many people
died before then so many people died
like when they're like 50 so we have to
change our mindset about age now that we
live older so if you are 30 now you're
technically like 20 or something you
know what I mean like we're much younger
than we think we are because we have
more years in our life so I was just
really inspired to read about this
perspective because I never really
thought about it before I've you know
I've set my life for dreams until like
age 50 and then after that I just
thought I'd be a potato and just live
everyday life like I didn't really think
about what happens after that and I'm
not saying that you have to have the
idea now but it's just the fact to keep
dreaming keep creating new dreams for
yourself as you get older and open your
mind to believe that you will probably
live to a hund
and beyond because of our modern-day
medicine and technology so if you were
to live until 120 what would you do with
your life what would you do if you have
that much more time on your hands the
title is kind of deceiving because when
you read like I've decided to live 120
years you're like what the heck like
this guy's crazy no way he's gonna live
that long or why does he think he's
gonna live that long like it's not
really about that the key word here is
decided so what he's saying is we cannot
guarantee how long we live we can die
tomorrow
anything can happen tomorrow but the key
message here is the word decided like
I've made a plan to live that long and
so I have things that I want to do with
my life in those years instead of just
like living your years with no purpose
or no goal in mind another part of this
is if you truly believe that you're
going to live 120 years then you're
gonna start taking better care of your
body you're gonna start exercising more
eating better for your body getting
enough rest like doing all the things to
take care of yourself because you want
to prolong your life and because you
want all of those years to accomplish
your big goals so I think it just kind
of reminds you that if you want to do
good work in the world if you want more
time to fulfill your dreams and live a
beautiful life then the first step is
taking care of yourself
so yeah I'll link this book down below
so you can read more about it alright
that's it for my November favorites now
