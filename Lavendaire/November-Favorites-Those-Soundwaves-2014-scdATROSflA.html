doing a typical November favorites video
this month I'm going to kick off a new
video series called those sound waves
where I share my top three favorite and
most played songs at the moment I much
rather talk about my favorite songs and
my favorite things and so I'm very
excited for this video series so this
past month I've been traveling I went to
Taipei and Seoul and throughout my
travels I like to get ready in the
morning to music and so these top three
songs are my most played songs as I'm
getting ready in the morning and so when
I listen to them they kind of bring me
back to those gloomy but very exciting
mornings in Asia so here we go the first
song is paradise awaits by Xue and this
song is so fun it's like light groovy
and the beat is just super lovely and
the vocals are just kind of silly I feel
like this song is a little bit of silly
and a lot of cool cuz the beat is just
so dope so I'm a big fan of Xue but just
listen to the song it's really fun it
makes me happy and makes me want to
dance and when I hear it I just have a
good day you know I just like I'm ready
the second song is called hangover by
Charlotte OC and this song has been the
song that has been stuck in my head for
a lot of this month and so the melody is
just so catchy and I remember being on
the plane on the way to Asia and back
like with this song just like repeating
in my head and you know a melody is good
when you just can hear it over and over
again and not be sick of it still so I
don't know I really like the song I love
the vocals it's kind of a slow groove
with a bit of edge and I feel cool and I
sing
and I don't know it's really fun too the
third song is fated breath by Tinashe
and this song I love so much it is slow
Moody um beyond and just kind of like
those underwater R&amp;amp;B vibes that's what I
call it I call this style underwater
music because it feels like you're
underwater and everything's kind of like
kind of you know like the weekend or
jhene aiko that kind of music to me it's
underwater R&amp;amp;B um but I just love this
song it's just so beautiful and I love
the first half I don't I'm not a huge
fan of when she goes up in the second
part but I do love the ending how she
ends with a long instrumental that's
just really beautiful so basically the
song is perfect for those gloomy rainy
mornings so there you go those are my
top three favorite songs at the moment
if you want to hear more than I have a
