quick October favorites video talking
about some of my favorite things in
beauty books music and mobile apps from
this past month so let's get into it
so my first favorite is this lipstick by
bites and the color is in Aberdeen white
is one of my favorite lipstick brands
and this color is a deep red plum that
is perfect for fall I love wearing deep
lipstick colors so I've been wearing
that pretty often this month the second
favorite is this Amazonian clay blush by
Tarte in the color tipsy and I love it
because it really does last long prior
to this I've been using the same blush
for over 4 or 5 years I'm not kidding
but I just stuck to that one and it
finally ran out so I had to pick a new
blush to be my new favorite so I did
some research and people really liked
this one
and I agree I like it so far
so my next favorites are these hair dyes
by Pravana and these are in silver and
violet so the color that is on my hair
is half a tube of silver with a drop of
violet although it has faded a little
bit but I really like the color and it
lasts so much longer than what I was
using before as you guys may tell from
my channel I like to play around with
colors I use Manic Panic which is a
vegan diet that you mix with conditioner
but the thing is Manic Panic lasts for
maybe one to two weeks depending on how
often you wash your hair but yeah
Pravana is definitely longer lasting
than Manic Panic and I'm really happy to
have tried it and I love it and I'm
gonna keep doing this my next favorite
is the book that I'm currently reading
it's called the slight edge by Jeff
Olsen and I highly recommend this to
anybody it'll help your life no matter
who you are special thanks to Kristin
and Cathy for both recommending it to me
I've had this book on my reading list
for over a year and I finally got to
pick it up and start reading it a few
days ago and
I'm almost halfway through it's so good
it's so motivating the book kind of lays
out things that we already know where
we've already heard of but from a
different perspective that it feels so
new and so refreshing so I'm really
excited about it
yeah if you have time put it on your
reading list read it the slight edge by
Jeff Olson finally my last favorite of
October is the song by Odessa
it's called say my name and it's been on
repeat I love Odessa right now and this
song I mean I love everything about it
the vocals are awesome and the beat oh
my god when the beat for the verse drops
it's just so like groovy and fun and I
jump to this in my car very often so
that's it for this month October
favorites thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
