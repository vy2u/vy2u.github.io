laugh and dare so October was a great
month for me very eventful because first
off it was my birthday month so I hope
you guys watched that birthday
rollercoasters video I made on my day
that I spent at the theme park so that
is like a little cute visual journal
entry that I'm quite proud of and I feel
like I've just been celebrating and
going out doing different things in the
past couple weeks so it's been really
fun I also started a vlog channel this
month I have like a couple vlogs up and
trying to get the third one up soon so
you can follow that vlog here or the
link is in the description below but my
vlog is just like a way that I could
share more personal casual sides of me
because I feel like I have a lot of
footage and a lot of ideas that won't
quite fit into my main channel so I just
thought why not I'm just gonna have a
second channel to put everything else
there also I have some pretty exciting
news to share I got into a YouTube
Nextup LA's program and I don't know how
many entries there were but like I was
chosen as one of like 20-ish
people vloggers creators to go to this
YouTube creator camp and will be there
for like a whole week learning
production skills and meeting other
YouTube people and I don't know I'm
pretty excited because I have no idea
what to expect and it's something
different out of my comfort zone and I
don't know I'm excited to learn a lot so
that's happening in a couple weeks so
follow my vlog I'll be vlogging that
entire experience alright let's jump
into the favorites of this month my
first favorite is this jacket that I got
from Zara and I just love it because
when I saw it I was like this is fire
like I really love the embroidery and
it's like a piece of art I haven't been
excited about a piece of clothing in a
while and I just remember like the first
few times wearing it I would just look
at the mirror myself
like whoa this is fire I love it my next
favorite is a music video that you guys
have to watch it's Porter Robinson and
Matt eons shelter music video basically
it's like an anime short film and it's
just beautiful first off like I love
Porter Robinson I'm such a huge fan of
him I'm gonna see him in concert in a
couple weeks or next month and I'm so
excited about that but just his level of
storytelling and his music is like blows
me away it inspires me so much because
he captures like so many emotions into
his music and he adds so much depth with
the visuals that he puts with his music
so definitely watch that music video and
tell me you didn't cry after watching it
like I cried so hard watching that music
video it was beautiful it was tragic
it's just beautiful it's very inspiring
it's like a masterpiece a work of art
and it always inspires me to see other
artists do things that elevates this
their the way that they share their
content the way that they promote their
art and on the topic of music videos I
actually became in love with another
music video that same day and it is SIA
the greatest music video like I've heard
this song before and when I first heard
the song I was like okay it's a good
song but I'm not in love with it but
after watching the music video I was
like I'm in love with this it's
beautiful
it's like empowering and it has a
message and the art and the acting and
the tone of everything and the song
lyrics I can't I can't
so the way I stumbled on this music
video is actually through a friend so a
close friend of mine a girl that I grew
up with she just finished going through
radiation therapy for this like thyroid
issue that she had and I've been
following her journey like she had a
GoFundMe page where we all contributed
to her medical costs and basically she
posted a blog post about how she's done
with therapy and she's starting to heal
and she's actually starting to regain
her energy because the last time I
talked
her like last month she was like really
exhausted she was talking about how she
couldn't even do basic things like walk
the dog or get groceries
so just reading her blog post about how
she's healing she posted like the music
video of SIA the greatest along with
that post so obviously I watched it and
that went hand in hand like I didn't
realize how empowering that song was
until I read it with my friends post and
then I clicked into YouTube and watch
read the comments of CEA's music video
so I read the comments and that's how I
found out that this was a tribute to the
Orlando gay club shooting because there
are 49 kids in this video and there were
49 people who were shot and killed in
that incident and it's just like she is
an artist she knows what's up that's all
I'm gonna say she knows basically I just
think this is such a great example of
how something can be created for good
something can be created to evoke
certain emotions and really move people
and spread awareness and madelyn that
main girl dancer she is so good she is
just so amazing the emotion she captures
in her face and in her dancing like I'm
just so inspired when I watch this music
video so I hope you guys watch it and
that you get inspired too so since then
I've just been playing that song on
repeat because it's just a great song
it's so powerful my next favorite is
another video that is actually a branded
video and normally I don't have these in
my favorites but it was just so well
done that I was like wow and it was
positive with a great message and I'm
like this is how companies or businesses
should do their branding so for some
reason I landed on Pink's website
because I was like considering trying
different products for periods and
obviously I've seen things all over
Facebook so I went on their website and
I rather about page and I got to this
video and I watched the whole thing all
the way through and it was just very
well done and very informative very
empowering especially as a woman so
basically the video covered the topic of
periods why
is so taboo and how we can break that
stigma and just like the issue with
women in third-world countries
who miss school because of their periods
which is something that can be avoided
so the video just explore this issue and
I showed how things is working with
women in Africa to donate cloth pads to
them through their business because you
know it empowers women to stay in school
because if a girl misses a week of
school every month it's more likely that
girl's gonna fall behind and eventually
just drop out of school and when women
drop out of school then it's harder for
them to enter the workforce and to get
ahead in life and it's just like
snowballs into this like negative cycle
that contributes to poverty and all that
stuff so basically a lot can be impacted
if we just learn to empower women just
by taking care of their periods it's as
simple as that and just watching that
video I just felt like it was really
well done and it really moves me and it
really sold me on the purpose and the
passion behind the founders of things
this is how a branded video should be
done and of course I'm not sure if you
guys know but businesses that have a
social good aspect have a special place
in my heart because if I weren't doing
YouTube I would be doing something in
that area I was like totally looking
into social entrepreneurship after I
graduated because I do believe that
business as a way to change the world in
a positive way if you can use your
business for good and my last favorite
of the month is of course a marie forleo
video because I just love my youth
channel so she has an interview with
Seth Godin that I thoroughly enjoyed
because I feel like Seth Godin has so
much knowledge and wisdom to offer and
just anybody is a creative or in the
online space watch that interview
because you'll learn so much I'll post
the link to that video and all the other
videos in the description below I also
mentioned that video in my latest
podcast episode actually my last podcast
episode of the year because I just had
the season 1 finale of my podcast this
past Sunday so if you guys haven't
get out yeah check out the lavender
lifestyle podcast it's basically done
for now I'm taking a hiatus and then
I'll be back in 2017 alright the Sun is
setting so I do have to go that's it for
today's October favorites thanks so much
for watching I'm sorry if my energy is
like low or different in this video I'm
just kind of tired and I feel like a lot
is happening I just came back from Vegas
yesterday and I'm gonna go to Vancouver
on Wednesday so I have a lot of fun
travels going on plus a lot of like
exciting videos that I want to finish
and get done before I head to YouTube
next up the following week after I come
back from Vancouver so November is gonna
be a very busy month for me but I do
have another artist of life episode
coming up soon alright have a beautiful
day and stay warm bye
