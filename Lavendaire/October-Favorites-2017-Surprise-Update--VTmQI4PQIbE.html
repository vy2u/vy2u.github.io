dare it's Eileen today it's time for
October favorites and as I'm saying that
like I wanted to look cozy for the fall
but it's actually like 102 degrees in LA
right now so it's really really really
extremely hot I don't know what's going
on I might just do this because it's
pretty hot right now
but I hope you guys are doing well
October was my birthday month so I had a
lot of fun just birthday festivities and
stuff thank you so much for your
birthday wishes I felt so loved like
just everywhere on YouTube in our
Facebook group a lot of you guys made
posts and there so it was really cute
and really sweet so thank you for that
fYI I'm gonna share something really fun
at the end of this video it's kind of
like a surprise secret but not so secret
once you see it obviously but yeah stick
around to the end all right so my first
favorite of this month is this song
street car by Daniel Cesar I don't think
this is like a new song by any means but
I found him through another song that he
posted more recently and then I went
back to listen to like all of Daniel
Cesar's music and this was I just one
that felt so nice and warm and I just
remember it playing on shuffle in my car
and I would just like start singing to
it and harmonizing with it creating my
own melodies to this song sometimes
there's like a song that plays and I'll
sing my own melody with the artists I
got to sing my own thing just using
their chords I also really like the
lyrics to streetcar and he has this
metaphor where he he's talking about
streetlights seeing them pass and it's
just like moments passing seems like
street lights glowing happen to be just
like moments passing in front of me so I
hopped in the cab and I paint my face
seon-ah mots ass nation
I'm just not there in the streets okay
that's all do for now but it's so nice
right it's like the moments are passing
and he's talking about like getting into
the car he knows where he's going but
he's not quite there yet so it's about
like being in the present moment
watching these moments pass by but you
know realizing that you're still on this
journey I mean you can go ahead and read
the lyrics and analyze it yourself but I
think it's a really nice song I've been
in more of a singing mood this month
like another one of my favorites is
Miley Cyrus's performance on BBC Radio
like she had like a whole set of like
five or six songs and her entire set was
really good so I'll post the link below
to her set or at least like at the top
song and you can listen to it I don't
know I was just in the mood to listen to
singers and sing along with them and
feel the emotions with music I think for
a while I haven't posted any favorites
and music in my videos so I feel like
maybe now is the time to like bring it
back every time it becomes fall I get
into more like an R&amp;amp;B like just like a
cosy mood with music and I like to like
section my playlist by seasons if you
don't know already I have a bunch of
playlist on Spotify that you guys can
follow right now I'm currently obsessed
with the fall 2017 playlist and yeah a
lot of like cosy chill laid-back music
my next favorite of the month is this
podcast called how I built this with guy
Raz it's an NPR podcast and it's very
popular but if you haven't heard of it
already then I'd recommend you listen to
like one or two episodes just to see how
you like it
it's about entrepreneurship and he
basically interviews founders of big
companies and ask them how they built
their company so my favorite episodes
are the Airbnb episode and the Bumble
episode I'm always fascinated with
people's journeys how they got to where
they are today and I think listening to
people's stories helps you break down
like oh there are not like superhuman
they're not super intelligent or super
anything like they're just
other people like you and me and it just
so happened like I feel like in
everyone's story there was a little bit
of luck but then obviously they had to
work really hard to get to where they
are but definitely it makes it sound
like everyone's story is kind of like
fate like I truly believe in this
guiding force of the universe that
brings opportunities to you it really
makes me see that everything happens for
a reason and that even if you may fail
or have a low point like that could be
the beginning of the best thing that's
ever happened to you in your life so
hearing a lot of those stories are very
motivating and if any of you are
entrepreneurial creative or just like
hearing stories about people's lives I
highly recommend listening to how I
built this my next favorite is this
makeup brush cleaner I think it's called
like a brush egg so I got mine on yes
style but you can get it on Amazon a
bunch of other places and it's basically
just a silicone gadget thing to clean
your makeup brushes and your Beauty
blenders so I use Beauty blenders every
time I do my makeup and they're really
hard to clean I felt like even when I
use my hands they're still like makeup
residue on them and I just felt like I
was so annoyed to clean them so after I
got this thing it was like whoa it was
like magic I felt like it does such a
good job cleaning my Beauty Blender that
I was like whoa so I thought it was
worth mentioning just in case any of you
out there have the similar struggle of
like being annoyed of cleaning your
makeup brushes and your Beauty blenders
all right now it's time for the surprise
so I just wanted to give you guys an
update on my workbook I had swatches
sent to me from China and I basically
picked one of these colors for my
workbook I mean I'm just gonna tell you
which one I picked I picked this one so
it's definitely gonna be blush with some
gold like foil lettering on the cover
I'm SuperDuper excited because like I
don't know this is just the next step I
said I wanted to keep you guys updated
on my workbook progress and I felt like
this wasn't really enough to make a vlog
around and the process is really just
like me sitting there working so yeah
I'm just gonna share like little
snippets and random videos at the
so that way you can like stay tuned one
more thing if you guys want to submit a
question for a future Q&amp;amp;A I'm still
gonna try to do those audio q and A's
I'll post the link below for you to ask
me a question I don't think I got that
many submissions last time so if people
don't continue submitting audio then I'm
just gonna not make a future Q&amp;amp;A so if
you want future q and a's like the tea
time with eileen then submit a question

audio file all you do is like record
