very special to share with you all if
you follow me on social media then you
may already know I've been working on a
film for a little over a year now and we
shot the film in Taiwan earlier this
year and I also made a blog about it
called keep doing things that scare you
now I'm so excited to share with you our
teaser and Kickstarter campaign this
film is essentially a passion project
it's a labor of love our team from LA
got together because we're just a group
of friends that wanted to create
something awesome something beautiful
and something bigger than we've ever
done before so I know that myself my LA
team and our Taiwan team have put so
much love and hard work into this
project that it would just mean the
world to us if you guys could simply
click the link in the description check
out our Kickstarter campaign watch our
films teaser and just let me know what
you think the film is called picture
Taipei and it's about a me an LA girl
whose life was falling apart so the
story really is about a girl who's
rediscovering herself as she is
traveling and experiencing a new
environment and it's about learning to
do what you want to do versus living
life by default so Aimee was a character
who until then really just lived life
doing what she thought she should do
doing what she's been told to do she
never really made any decisions on her
own when she's in Taipei the people and
the places she encounters kind of
transforms her and helps her see the
world through fresh eyes so if you guys
know me if you've been following my
channel for a while now then hopefully
you could see the resemblance between me
and Aimee because a lot of the story was
inspired by my life and the directors
life as well as well as a lot of our
team's inputs but I personally had an
experience where I felt like I was
living life by default I felt like I was
sleepwalking throughout my life up until
college and then I went to study abroad
in Italy and that kind of changed my
life and opened my eyes in a way so this
story really is about me it's about you
it's about a lot of people out there and
it just holds a special place in my
heart I hope that this message gets
across and I hope that you're interested
enough to check out our Kickstarter
campaign and watch the film teaser I've
been making videos for you guys for a
little over a year as well and honestly
I can just say that I'm so grateful to
have this platform to have this audience
and to be able to connect with so many
of you out there like it there really is
no experience like it you can't
replicate this thing that I have on
YouTube and my blog it's just so special
and unique and I'm really really
grateful to have that so I just want to
say that as I'm sharing my life and my
journey everything I learned through
Lavandera through these videos and these
blog posts I hope that I've impacted
your life in even just a little less bit
and if I have if I have made any sort of
impact whatsoever I want to ask that you
consider giving back to me because if
I've helped you in your journey I'm
asking you now to help me in mine
because this film is really a passion
and I really need help we really need
help to make it happen
so yeah that's just what I want to say
it's about giving and giving back so
please check out our Kickstarter check

you think and I love you guys so much I
thank you guys so much and I'm so
excited for this project it really is

opens up new doors and new opportunities
