dare so today's video is another words
of wisdom whereas the wisdom is a series
where I share my favorite quotes and
words that inspired me so today's words
of wisdom is around the idea of kindness
and I have two quotes that I want to
share but they're basically the same
meaning the first quote is in a world
where you can be anything be kind and a
similar quote that I always go back to
is be kind whenever possible it's always
possible and that's five is all a llama
so these quotes about kindness I want to
share just because I think it's so
important especially during this month
of February where I'm talking about self
love and self care it's so important to
always be kind to yourself and to others
so being kind to yourself is that self
love and self care taking care of
yourself and doing things to support
yourself because you are your own best
friend really if you're not there for
yourself who is so being kind to
yourself also means to be easier on
yourself be gentle on yourself don't be
so hard on ourselves and I know a lot of
times we fall into like these deep pits
of sadness or judgments negativity
whatever it is I know sometimes I feel
down when I don't feel productive like
if I am not doing something with my day
if I'm just being like a potato and I
call it I just like lie there watch
YouTube do nothing I'm sure we just all
have those off days days where we don't
feel OnPoint days where we're not at our
best maybe we are lazy unmotivated
unconfident whatever it is I know that
sometimes we can be so hard on ourselves
or maybe like you didn't finish a
project that you really wanted to and
you feel just like why am I not good
enough you know you don't feel amazing
you don't feel at your best but in those
moments remember to be kind
with yourself be as gentle with yourself
as you can you know not everyone's going
to have a perfect date every day you're
going to have your on days and your off
days and the best thing you can do is
just learn to be kind to yourself and
forgive yourself as fast as you can so
if you have a bad day or if you make a
mistake or you fail at something don't
be so angry at yourself don't be hard on
yourself don't feel so like frustrated
or anxious whatever you however you deal
with it just be kinder to yourself how
would you treat your best friend if your
best friend was going through these
negative emotions they were having a bad
day or maybe they feel that something
you would be kind to them you'd be like
you know what it's okay just try again
tomorrow it'll be okay everything will
be okay so tell yourself those kind
things learn to love yourself no matter
what even if you don't meet your
expectations for yourself even if you
disappoint yourself be kind learn to be
kind and gentle with yourself as much as
possible the other side of this is to be
kind to others whenever possible so I
know most of the time it is easy to be
kind to others because if you're just at
the grocery store or you're meeting up
with your friends like yeah it might be
natural to be nice to everyone and if
that's not your natural like maybe you
should try to be more kind to people but
I'm talking about like the times where
it's not easy to be kind to others like
when somebody is angry at you or they're
attacking you for something they're
complaining just in that bad mood try to
be kind to those people as well so most
of the times even when someone's like
mean to you or bullying you talking
behind your back that reflects on that
person it really shows that maybe
they're insecure about themselves or
they're going through a tough time in
some area of their life and this brings
me to another quote that I always go
back to is be kind for everyone is
fighting their own battle I'm not sure
if that's the exact wording but it's
something like that basically every
one is going through their own struggle
behind the scenes you don't know the
full story you never really know
everything a person is experiencing only
that person knows so when that person
kind of like snaps at you or gives you
some sort of negative attack or emotion
do your best to not let it hurt you just
detach yourselves realize that it's not
about you it's about that person and be
kind as much as you can be kind whenever
possible and it's always possible so
that one takes a bit of practice because
I know that you know when I'm fighting
with my boyfriend it's not easy to be
kind to him but you know in those
situations realize that fighting and
arguing is not really going to get you
anywhere plus it's going to ruin
everyone's day and what's the point of
that you know so be kind show love and
compassion whenever possible even if
it's tough so if you can love yourself
and be kind to yourself then you'll be
less likely to kind of be so hard on
yourself and feel in a bad mood and when
you're kinder to yourself it's easier
for you to be kinder to others so you
know on the flip side if you're kinder
to others it's easier for them to be
kind to you and vice versa so be kind
whenever possible and it's always
possible hope you like today's words of
wisdom if you have any comments let me
know down below let me know if you have
any tips on how to be kind especially in
those tough times all right by the way
