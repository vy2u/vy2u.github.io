so today's video is for my girls
it's about period products that every
girl must know about so if you're that
girl that still uses the typical pads
and tampons that you buy at the store
this video is for you because there are
just so many new options so many
alternative options that are better for
you like they're better for your body
and your health better for the
environment and in some cases better for
your wallet so today I'm going to share
about menstrual cups organic cotton camp
ponds and period panties and I do want
to give an honorable mention to reusable
cloth pads because that's another option
I just personally haven't tried them yet
so I can't really share too much about
them in this video all right let's start
with my favorite option which is the
menstrual cup so I've been using this
cup for over a year now and I first
learned about it from the youtuber from
head to toe she has a really thorough
and amazing video on menstrual cups so I
recommend you watch that video for like
the gritty details I basically got the
same cup that she got and it's by this
brand named Scoon but there are so many
other menstrual cup brands out there
they each have like slightly different
shapes different hardness to them so it
depends on what works for you but I
tried this one and it works for me
pretty well so far the way it is is new
fulbe is into a specific fold there are
like so many different folds but I use
this version and you kind of like insert
it similar to a tampon and once it's in
it will pop out like that and then it
will just catch all the period blood and
the best thing about this actually there
are so many best things number one this
option is very eco-friendly because you
don't create much waste you don't have
like plastic packaging to throw away
each time that you change it basically
it's just a cup made of silicone you
wash it before and after you use it and
that's it
number two it's super cost effective
because one cup can last you up to
years so it's made of silicone and it's
pretty durable so if you take care of it
then it can really last you a long time
so imagine making one purchase for a
period product and you don't have to buy
anything else for another almost ten
years it's just so much cheaper in the
big picture compared to like when you're
buying and restocking pads and tampons
every month also it's cleaner and safer
for your body because it's made of
silicone so I'm not sure of you all know
but a lot of the pads and tampons that
you buy in store like the very big
brands they are not made of organic
cotton they do have chemicals and if
you're like sticking chemicals up your
body for hours at a time we're just
having chemicals in that area it's not
as clean as you would think so there's
something that's silicone it doesn't
like you miss anything and it's just
it's it is cleaner and safer but
honestly though for me the best part
about menstrual cups is the lazy factor
and the invisible factor so I love that
you only have to deal with the cup
basically like twice a day in the
morning and the evening you can leave
this in your body for 10 to 12 hours so
that's like half a day right there so I
just put it in in the morning and empty
it out in the evening and then put it in
for the night and then the next morning
do it again so it's really easy to just
like handle your period in the comfort
of your own home like in the morning
when you wake up and at night before you
go to bed which is amazing because the
most disgusting thing about like pads
and tampons are changing them in the
middle of the day in public bathrooms
like well so that's what I love about
this thing and also the invisible factor
the fact that while you have it in you
throughout the day you don't even notice
that you're on your period you see no
blood and someone like me I don't like
seeing blood so it just it feels clean
that you don't see blood you always see
it in the morning in the evening and
that's not a big deal I think the
sacrifice of like getting a little bit
dirty with your fingers like inserting
and removing that is worse the
cleanliness throughout the day of not
having to deal with your period so for
those of you who love tampon
tampons are your favorite period product
of choice I would definitely recommend
switching to some organic cotton tampons
so these are by Laura and they're
originally a subscription-based tampon
company but I think now they sell Cora
and Target which is pretty amazing so
what I love about Cora is their branding
they package their tampons in very sleek
black classy packaging it comes with
this like little pouch and they have
this big box for you to put in your
cabinets and they also give you these
like individually packaged tampons for
you to share with a friend like I said a
lot of those big brand pads and tampons
are made with cotton that's not organic
and there are chemicals added in those
products and if you're serious about
like taking care of your body and doing
what's best for your body I don't think
I would want to insert anything with
like chemicals or pesticides into my you
know area so definitely give some
organic cotton tampons to try there they
feel the same there's not much of a
difference except the fact that you know
that it's made with cleaner products and
it's made sustainably and more ethically
the last product I want to share our
period panties these are sinks underwear
and I'm sure you might have seen like
Pink's ads all over your Facebook that's
how I found out about them and I just
decided to give them a try so I
purchased one and the concept is weird
you know having you're letting your
period flow straight to your underwear
and you know just going about your day
like that so I was like does it really
work like does it really last all day so
I am here to tell you if you haven't
tried period panties before that they
are cool but it is like wearing one pad
I wouldn't wear this all day because
once you leak into here once your period
slows in here it is wet it's not like
your period disappears magically and it
still feels like new underwear so I
would say that one panty would last like
four to five hours depending on your
flow and I got this one the hipster they
have different styles I think I would
wear period panties on
like days so for those days where it's
not really worth it to wear like tampons
or you just don't want to wear pads on
your light things then Pru pennies are a
cool option but like I said I don't
think it's like I couldn't live with
just this option because it does feel
not as clean because it's like you know
wet down there but it does work it does
not leak I have not had any leakage
problems with these underwear and you
just have to get used to like washing
them right after you use them and then
you could throw them in the washing
machine for when you're ready to like do
your laundry another similar option to
period panties would be reusable cloth
pads so if you're a pad type of girl
then consider switching to reusable
cloth pads and the reason that it's
gaining popularity is because a lot of
people care about reducing their waste
they don't like that each time you have
pads like you have to throw away all
this plastic and packaging it's bad for
the environment so if you have a cloth
pad that you can just wash each time and
reuse like a few then it's just more
sustainable also the fact like I said
the chemicals and whatever in those pads
that are sold in stores but I'm pretty
sure there are also organic cotton pads
out there I haven't done my research to
try those out but I really like the
system that I have here I generally I
just use a menstrual cup if I need to
and sometimes I'll use those organic
tampons and on very light days I will
use period panties these I just bought
to experiment for fun but like I said I
wouldn't use this as my only option
alright I hope today's video opened your
eyes to some new alternative options for
managing your period let me know in the
comments if you have other suggestions
or other tips for all the girls watching
this video and like I'm not an expert at
this I just wanted to share the stuff
that I've been experimenting and
discovering so yeah also if you
recommend any good articles or resources
related to period products and new ways
to manage them definitely let me know in
the comments and I'll put the links in
like the description so more people can
learn alright thank you so much for
watching I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
