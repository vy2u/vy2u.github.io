on a creative retreats I have planned
this day out for myself in January where
I did this thing called the amazing
workbook so I filled out a book of
different pages planning out my year and
kind of the things that I want to invite
into 2014 one of the exercises was to
plan a day completely for yourself and
so today is that day
and I'm going to be going to the OC Art
Museum and maybe stop by the beach and
just write all day and be inspired I
just want to be surrounded by art and
nature and just write whatever comes to
me and take this time to just enjoy
myself I guess the point is that it's
important to take the time for yourself
and spend a day doing the things that
you want to do and things that you love
to do and it's kind of like a personal
vacation so yeah I encourage you guys to
plan a day in the year where you have
the whole day to yourself and you do
whatever you want to do because I think
it's important to kind of give ourselves
that love and appreciation so I hope you
enjoyed this vlog and I will see you
guys soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
