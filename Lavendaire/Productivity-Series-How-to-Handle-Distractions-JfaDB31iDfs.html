handle distractions and this is part of
our productivity series where I'm just
sharing productivity tips that have
helped me so distractions happen to
everybody and with the invention of the
internet it's so hard to avoid
distractions but it's possible to handle
them and to be better at focusing on
what's important tip number one do not
read emails first thing in the morning
you don't want to waste your fresh
precious brainpower in the morning on a
menial task like reading and responding
to emails because you could do that
later on in the day when you really
don't need to be that sharp in the
morning you are very sharp and so you
want to use that brainpower on something
more important on doing the important
things first also you don't want to be
reading emails in the morning and not
responding to them just yet because once
you read an email you're gonna kind of
have that over your head and you're
gonna want to respond and you're going
to be thinking about it until you have
the time to respond so it's better to
just not check it until you're ready to
respond and until you've done more
important things first tip number two
block specific time slots later in the
day to check messages emails and social
media all at once this is going to help
you avoid getting distracted at various
times throughout the day because you're
checking all these rounds of
notifications you want to make a habit
from getting push notifications to
creating pull notifications meaning
instead of checking your social media or
emails or whatever right when you get
the notification you turn off those push
notifications or you ignore them and
then you pull the notifications when
you're ready resist the urge to leave
your email and social media tabs open
which I know is something a lot of us do
and I'm totally guilty of too but
keeping those tabs open is like a
distraction waiting to happen
because but anything could pop up and
then you're gonna check it and then
you're going to get distracted for 5 10
15 minutes or maybe an hour or two and
it's just you want to turn off all of
those things to focus on what's
important first tip number three take a
break go outside take a walk move around
and get some fresh air this is going to
help refresh and revitalize your brain
so that you're ready to get back into
work and focus on doing important
productive things taking a break really
helps you recharge your energy and it
helps prevent the need to succumb to
distractions that pop up throughout the
day
bonus tip you can use an app to help you
focus on your work there is self control
for mac and cold-turkey for windows both
of these apps temporarily block
distracting websites so that you can't
go on them and you have no choice but to
focus on your work alright I hope you

distractions if you guys have any more
