I'm going to be doing a Productivity
series where I'll be posting shorter
videos sharing some sort of productivity
tip so I'm doing this partly because
I'll be working a broad all throughout
the month of March and I don't really
have time to shoot videos while I'm out
and about so I'm shooting these videos
ahead of time and I'm just going to be
editing and posting as I go today's
video is about how to set your
priorities because knowing how to
prioritize is super important and I
think it's the first step to being a
more productive person so here's a tip
do the most important things first the
important things are usually the biggest
most difficult and scariest things that
we have to get done and sometimes we
even tend to avoid them because they're
so scary but they're scary because
they're important and they matter these
are the big tasks that we have to
conquer in order to move forward and
achieve our goals so how do you know for
sure what's important well ask yourself
if this is the only thing that I get
done all day would I be satisfied and if
the answer is yes then that's your most
important task for the day and if it's
no then obviously it's less important
than something else out there
sometimes people get caught up with
trying to be more efficient because they
think that by being efficient they're
being more productive but actually being
effective is much better than being
efficient because what you do is
infinitely more important than how you
do it you have to know how to prioritize
and do the important things first
because that's what's going to matter in
the end even if you're efficient if
you're not doing what's important then
you're not being productive because
you're wasting your time
being efficient on some
important tasks it's also easy to
confuse what's urgent with what's
important for example an email pops up
into your inbox and you know you have to
respond to it well obviously you're
going to feel antsy and you're going to
want to respond but you have to stop
yourself and don't get lured into the
trap of what's urgent you still have to
do the most important things first all
right I hope you liked today's tip now I
want to challenge you guys to take
action so this week each morning I want
you to write your most important tasks
for the day and I want you to do that
most important task first or do it as
soon as you can
because once you do it and you get that
big thing done you conquer it you're
gonna feel so accomplished and the rest
of your day should be a breeze also if
you have any more tips on how to
prioritize or how to be more productive
please share them in the comments below
because I'd love to know and I'm sure
everybody else would love to know as
well thank you so much for watching I
will see you guys in my next one bye
