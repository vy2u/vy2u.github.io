series I want to share with you all
Parkinson's law so this law is also
mentioned in the 4-hour workweek by Tim
Ferriss and it states that a task will
swell in importance
the more time you allot to complete it
what this means is that the longer you
give yourself to complete something the
more big important and daunting it's
going to feel so for example if you give
yourself three months to write a paper
you're gonna feel like you need those
three months to write it but in reality
what you're going to do is you're going
to procrastinate and you're going to be
doing other things and throughout all of
that you're going to have that task
looming over your head and giving you
pressure and stressing you out and
taking up mental energy when in reality
you know you could complete it in a week
or maybe a day or maybe even two hours
if you only had two hours to complete it
because I know we've all been there
before and it's possible if you can
focus you can get it done in a shorter
amount of time so the lesson learned
from Parkinson's law is to set tight
deadlines for yourself and more
specifically to set time limits for your
tasks and for meetings if you give
yourself forever to do something it's
going to take you forever to do it so
just try it out for a week instead of
making a to-do list or kind of going
with the flow try setting time limits
and time deadlines for everything that
you want to complete that day or that
week and see how it goes because once
you start doing that and getting into
that habit you start to know how long it
takes for you to do things and you also
catch yourself when you're getting
distracted and not focusing on your work
knowing Parkinson's law can help you
understand how your brain perceives time
so you can kind of hack that by setting
tight deadlines and time limits for
yourself to get
done and be more productive that's it
for today I hope you like this
productivity tip if you have any more
tips that you'd like to share please

you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
