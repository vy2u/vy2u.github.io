series we're going to go over the Pareto
principle more commonly known as the
80/20 rule so if you haven't heard about
this rule already it says that roughly
80% of the effects come from 20% of the
causes and this rule is wildly popular
because you can literally apply it to
almost every aspect of life for example
in business it's a general rule of thumb
that 80% of your sales come from 20% of
your customers and in school maybe 80%
of your grade comes from 20% of your
tests and assignments and on YouTube 80%
of your views come from 20% of your
videos and you can keep going and apply
this rule to so many different areas of
life and it's really interesting how it
just works that way so what do you do
with this newfound knowledge well in
productivity you can say that 80% of
your results come from 20% of your
effort and you always want to try to be
more efficient and effective with your
efforts to get better results so look at
your life and see where you can apply
the 80/20 rule then find out what makes
that 20% in whatever it is you're
looking at and once you know your 20%
focus on it and prioritize it above
everything else because that's how
you're going to get more output and
better results from your inputs in the
4-hour workweek Tim Ferriss talks about
how he cut down his work week from over
50 hours a week to just four hours a
week and he did this by applying the
Pareto principle so he focused on his
20% of the tasks that brought in 80% of
his income and the rest he just cut out
or offloaded to outsourcers and he
continually focused on the 20 percent
and 20 percent and 20 percent so that he
would get the most bang for his buck out
of his efforts and get optimal results
so the 80/20 rule is very powerful
and everybody can use it you can use it
today you can start looking at your life
and seeing where you can apply it and
where you should focus your time and
your energy that's it for today if you
have more tips on how to be productive
I'd love to hear them in the comments um
I will see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
