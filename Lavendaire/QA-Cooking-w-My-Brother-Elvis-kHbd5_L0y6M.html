the rest we could just put it back hi
everyone welcome back to la bandera so
today I'm gonna do a little Q&amp;amp;A session
normally I do like a sit down and have
tea with me I mean I do have some tea
right here but it's actually
Thanksgiving and my brother surprised us
he came home without telling us and I
think today we're gonna make a green
bean casserole so I thought it'd be cool
to do the QA and whenever he's done
getting ready he'll come and we'll make
this casserole together I'll just take
you guys along because why not oh good
hi Eileen it's Ashlyn my question for
you today is how do you remain so
positive and happy all the time
sometimes it's hard to be positive and
happy when school and life gets in the
way thank you for always greeting me
with such a lovely smile whenever I
watch your videos
do you want to answer should I answer
yeah you go first
okay hi actually um honestly though
nobody can be super positive all the
time but I would say that I'm naturally
an optimistic person and the way to be
more positive is to just learn to see
the brighter side of things because
there's always like there are multiple
sides of a situation there's obviously a
negative side but it's up to you to
choose what to focus on I think start
with like being grateful for what you do
have and what's around you and what are
the things that are going right in your
life so I would ask questions like that
what's going right what am i grateful
for what's the bright side of this
situation about you so the question was
how do you stay positive by not caring
as much good yeah
care less about things yeah like care
less about things that don't really
matter that don't need to take up your
brain cycles you know there's only a
couple of things that you should really
care about on your day to day and
anything else is kind of
extra and if you learn how to block that
out it's easier that's true
stop caring as much yeah okay so we stop
mushrooms to clean that's it let's just
clean that so the first part about
washing mushrooms is always to make sure
you have a nice swirl your the more
swirl you have the more kind of toxins
unleash away from the mushrooms so
really don't be scared to like get deep
in there you know
do you like some shaking that dirt yeah
look at all the yellow water that's all
the toxins and what you want to do with
the toxins is wash them away like your
problems okay this is justin from
california really like your youtube
channel my question for you is if you
were stuck on island food water and
shelter provided what three items would
you take my huh it depends on whether
you have internet on the end what type
of island are they talking about are we
talking about a small island that
doesn't provide a desert food water
shelter provided he said food water so
yeah so you yeah you don't have to
struggle to survive but what would you
do if you were alone I'm assuming what
would you bring one of them has to be
like a musical instrument something with
the high skill cap so then yeah because
like something you could work on
throughout and always get better and not
only stop anywhere I mean I would bring
a journal on pen first of all I need to
write things down and maybe write yeah
but love is if you write on the paper
okay maybe this is an iPad you need a
charger okay so pen and paper
bring a big notebook with paper B so
that I could write a novel or something
or write write down things uh-huh you
know those Nintendo DS games where you
have like a virtual girlfriend I don't
really need much you have food water
shelter and then you just need
entertainment all right yeah maybe like
a book that teaches you how to build
stuff from like nothing so then you go
yeah yeah you know like learn how to
build like I don't know boats yes and
stuff you can do on an island it could
be anything like a bird watching yeah
or even like how to pick the right
berries - yeah yeah cause I don't know
how to pick berries Survival Guide okay
yeah yeah like oh that's true I would
get a gardening book beautiful garden on
this island yeah yeah I guess that's it
hi Eileen it's Marie from Germany and I
just wanted to ask you where do you see
yourself in five ten and maybe even 20
years from now thanks for answering and
goodbye
she's so cute okay for me in five years
I want to be an author and have a book
written that's like one of my major
goals and then aside from that I mean I
already like what I'm doing now and I
just want to keep doing it and keep
growing lavend dare and I think in ten
years I'll be like late thirties ten and
twenty years I have no idea because I
can't really see that far ahead
ideally I'm just like having more free
time to chill I want to create a life
where I have more free time to just do
things like have free time to do yoga
paint dance that's honestly the
lifestyle I want where I like to have
like a beautiful peaceful life that's
honestly all I want I don't really need
too much about you in five years
probably be building something or doing
something with either a random interest
or building a product or something doing
it with friends in ten years hopefully
continue expanding whatever I started in
five years and make it pretty awesome
and cool and in 20 years I will plan to
have a brain chip in my head yeah by the
time it's 20 years from now I think
technology's gonna be so far advanced
that uh I don't know that's true I'll be
doing something crazy then I will have
any idea what to expect you same okay
random question how old do you think
you're gonna live till forever really
maybe maybe yeah I want to live to like
115 or something that'd be pretty cool
no I think it's well I then but then
what if what if you could like put your
brain inside like you don't have a human
body anymore but your consciousness
somewhere but wouldn't but would you get
bored because you have I mean because
everyone's there with me like let's say
when it's like you know you have a
physical body so you can do things and
dance or you know to me physically but
when you're just a conscious thing you
can talk to people yeah I guess you can
build stuff to like see where I just
think that I'd be bored if I didn't have
anything to do yeah yeah what does that
beeping sound hi Eileen
it's Lexi I'm currently a freshman in
college I am finishing up my first
semester of college currently I wasn't
originally accepted into my dream school
so I was wait-listed but I received a
letter saying if I transfer I would get
on mic acceptance to attend the school
in 2018 and I can either choose to take
a year off or go to another University
for a little while and then go to that
school so currently I'm at a different
school just because everybody told me
well you didn't get accepted technically
so you should just stay home to stay
home and people are still telling me to
stay home it's cheaper to stay home
that's better to stay home you can learn
the same things here um I don't feel
that's true
I'm differ from my family in that aspect
I still really would like to go to this
school and I do agree with my family it
is out of state and we are not well-off
financially but at the same time I can't
help but feeling that I should do this
if that makes sense if any of this makes
any sense to you
so my question basically is what would
you do if you were in my situation like
would you choose to just listen and just
stay home or would you go out to the
school that you wanted to go to and
you're like this is a perfect question
for you to have what's the I always
transferred to USC from Community
College yep doing really well right now
what's look so the question is should
she go to us in between her and her
dream school lourdes it's like she
didn't get accepted to her dream school
the first year but they said if you
apply one year and transfer then you'll
get in for sure and then all her friends
have found they want her to stay home
because and just like have a year off no
no she's going to a school near her
house now and it's cheaper than going
out of state to her dream school but she
could still go to her dream school yeah
she can't she can still transfer it's
the question is should she change I
think it's obvious why she should you
obviously live with financial burdens
like you're not you have to calculate if
it's you know how you're gonna make it
work personally I think you should go
with your intuition and always do what
you feel is right even if it's the
harder decision or even if other people
are telling you to not do that yeah I
mean I completely agree it sounds like
you already a pretty set on thinking
what's the better choice for you so I
think you should stick to what you
believe in the hard part is when it
comes to like the money aspects
financials and I think you could figure
that out
there's tons of scholarships that are
out there that are just like
surprisingly no one applies to and like
no one yeah there's so much money on the
table and if you if that's really a
thing that's blocking you there's so
much you could start researching and at
least try to ease that up a little bit I
think once you make the decision to go
like the ways on how you can make it
happen will show up as you keep
researching or asking people for advice
I think it'll come to you yeah
plus like this is I mean your chance to
kind of like break free do your own
thing and explore it's so much personal
growth and just if this is something
that's for you you'll know it's for you
don't listen to the other people making
you decide something that should be your
choice it's always worth it to do the
scary thing leave no cheese behind
alright Eileen how do I get over my
limiting beliefs of myself so that I
could have a life I fully want to live
it is hard it's time and I think the
step one is to be aware of what your
beliefs are for me I do it through
journaling I would ask myself like okay
what are things that I believe are true
and I would write them out but then you
can look at what you wrote and be like
you know what none of these are
necessarily true it's just what I
believe and then by being aware of what
you believe you can start to like flip
it mm-hmm
I'm a strong believer of if you want to
change something about yourself you can
easily do it I mean people are born a
certain way but people grow in different
ways - I think if you change your
limiting beliefs to believe that I could
change period I mean I think that's like
the foundational thing I thought about
when I told myself men I really don't
like these characteristics or how a
certain portion of my life is turning
out and what I would do is sounds kind
of like the lazy method but I think
about it every single day and as long as
it starts becoming a lingering thought
that's always in the back of your head
you start consciously making decisions
to go against it and I think as long as
you believe that it's possible for you
to change as a person it'll happen
I mean sometimes it'll feel weird that
you're going against what you always do
but in the end it kind of starts to feel
more and more natural and in the end a
couple months later you'll be like wow
I've changed a lot for the better yeah
so believe that you can change that's
step one and then become aware of your
beliefs and then do something what
opposites yeah or just challenges
challenge yeah challenge your beliefs
and do what you want to do become who
you wanna who you're seeing yourself as
mm-hmm
all right thank you guys so much for
watching this is my brother Ella bases
