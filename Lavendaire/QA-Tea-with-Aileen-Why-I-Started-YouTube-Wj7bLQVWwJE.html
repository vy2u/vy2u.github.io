today I'm gonna try a new Q&amp;amp;A format
called tea with Eileen so I don't know
if that's a good name I just thought of
it but I have my tea this is I don't
know how to pronounce it I think Roy vos
tea with ginger so I asked you guys have
said some questions and audio formats so
that it could feel like we're talking
together and my whole idea behind this
is these are questions that you would
ask me if we were to sit down and have
tea together so originally I called this
like a coffee date but technically like
here's a fact about me I don't really
drink coffee I don't like coffee
it's I mean I kind of like coffee I like
coffee ice cream
but I'm very sensitive to caffeine so I
never drink coffee because it makes me
feel weird to like crazy even if I drink
too much tea I'll get wired so this tea
that I'm drinking right now is
non-caffeinated but anyway let's begin
shall we hey Arlene so my question for
you is when did you know for sure that
you wanted to start a YouTube channel
was it influenced more by a specific
event or did you just wake up a morning
and decide to that you want to become a
youtuber hi Cynthia thanks for sending
in your question so I've shared this
before but maybe a lot of you know that
I started a music YouTube channel like
way back in 2007 I was a senior in high
school and I loved to sing and play
piano but it was like on the down-low
like I really didn't tell any of my
friends about it it was pretty much a
secret
I discovered Mari a Digby on YouTube and
she had like a hit cover of Rihanna's
song umbrella and I heard it on the
radio it just blew my mind that people
could just record themselves and upload
a video of them singing onto YouTube and
it would become something that's what
inspired me
start my first YouTube channel like I
just had I just got a new MacBook it was
the first time I had a webcam so I just
put it on top of my piano I opened it I
pressed record and I played and sang a
Mario igby song actually because I was
very very inspired by her what inspired
me to start this lavender channel was I
was pursuing music and acting and
working part-time and doing all these
random things but I was also reading a
lot of self-help books and blogs
learning about myself
journaling soul-searching basically and
I realized that I have a lot of
knowledge that I don't find young people
sharing I feel like now
more and more people are sharing
personal growth self-help
minimalism all the stuff on YouTube but
back then 2014 I it was really really
hard to find like solid channels talking
about this so I had the knowledge of
YouTube I actually kind of like gave up
on YouTube for a little bit I saw that
my YouTube for music wasn't going
anywhere I was pretty discouraged and I
was steering myself another route I
wanted to create an app and be an
entrepreneur in the digital space but I
would watch youtubers constantly and I
would find myself envious of their lives
or wanting what they have and one day I
just sat down I'm like why am i so
envious of these people what do I want
of their life into my own and I thought
that I gave up on the dream of YouTube
but at the end of that journaling
session I realized I know I still
haven't given up on YouTube even though
my music YouTube didn't really work out
like I still want to be something like
that like some sort of personality that
can just create and share myself with
the world so a lot of little things
added up to inspire me to create
lavender hyolee this is Kai from
Switzerland with my question for you if
you could be any animal in the world
what animal would you be and why and by
the way I'd be an elephant by
hi Kai thanks for sending in your
question if I could be any animal I am
like tied between two and I'll explain I
think my natural instinct wants to be
some sort of bird because obviously I
think it'd be so cool if you could fly
around the world and see the world from
another perspective and I think birds
are very free and a lot of what I love
and what I want in my life is to be more
free so I think some sort of bird I wish
I could be more specific on the type of
bird it wouldn't be like an eagle or
anything big it'd be like a cute bird
and then on the other hand this is
influence because my friend Clarissa was
talking about dolphins on social media I
think it'd be really cool to be a
dolphin
because dolphins are super smart and
they have their own language they could
communicate underwater and I think it'd
just be cool to see the underwater world
through the eyes of an intelligent
dolphin hylene I hope you're having a
good day my name is Sarah and I really
want to ask if you ever have
experimented this we're feeling of
antennas like you are working really
hard to make things happen while they
are not working at all and no matter
what you do you always feel a big hole
inside your chest I really will
appreciate any tips you can give me or
give us thank you very much for
listening and for being the way you are
you are such a peak inspiration I send
you lots of hacks from Galicia why hi
Sarah from Colombia oh my goodness
you're so sweet I feel like we could be
friends in real life so the feeling of
emptiness yes definitely I think I felt
a lot of this during college and doing
internships just at that point where you
start becoming aware of like what the
heck am I doing with my life like what's
the point of all this what's the purpose
because I think growing up we're
conditioned to just like look at you
know what society tells us what's
important like school I think throughout
elementary school in high school I was
focused on doing well in school
because it helped you get into college
and then once I was in college it was I
don't know there was like a turning
point like where where I started asking
what's the point of all this if I'm
gonna work hard and get a job that I
don't like and not find like happiness
or fulfillment in my life what's the
whole point so I think those were the
questions that define that whole period
of like emptiness loss and struggle and
you think the feeling of emptiness comes
from not feeling like you matter not
feeling like what you're doing is
important feeling like your life isn't
worth that much like you could disappear
one day and there wouldn't be a big
difference and I definitely did go
through a period of feeling like that I
would say pretty depressed where I felt
like I could die any moment and no one
would care and it wouldn't matter but I
think this is why it's so important to
find some sort of purpose in your life
some sort of reason for living something
that will drive you forward and motivate
you and it has to be intrinsic it can't
be an external motivator it can't be
like money or looks or material things
it really has to come up from within my
tips for getting out of that empty sort
of feeling is to start switching your
perspective because I think so much of
that perspective comes from seeing the
lack in your life seeing the negative
seeing what you don't have and be like
oh I don't have happiness I don't have
this I don't have friends I don't you
know and I think you have to flip it and
start to see the things that you do have
in your life start bringing gratitude
into every area of your life really
gratitude is like so much of happiness
gratitude is just so important I would
say start making gratitude a habit every
morning and every evening write down
five things that you're grateful for and
make it a challenge to write five
different things each time so once you
start to change your perspective you
start to see your life in the eyes of
like gratitude in the eyes of abundance
seeing I do have so much
I have this and I have this and I'm
grateful for this and this and you'll
find that there's more and more to be
grateful for and there's so much that
you have that you overlooked before when
you were feeling empty so first thing is
gratitude and number two is to
definitely seek whatever it is in life
that gives you a sense of joy that gives
you a sense of purpose find something
that makes you come alive it's different
for everyone and that's the cool thing
you get to explore and you get to
discover and it's fun because you get to
know yourself in the process
ask yourself in the past what were the
moments where I came alive because when
you come alive that's when you're living
like 100 percent fully and you
definitely don't feel empty when you
feel alive like you're living and it
could be simple like for me coming alive
is when I ride roller coasters or coming
alive is where I'm like in flow of
creating something editing a video or it
can be like painting oh I come alive
when I'm singing and I'm performing and
dancing on the stage time to go out
there and explore experience new things
and then you can find out like hey this
is fun I actually really enjoy doing
this I enjoy doing that maybe you
haven't found it yet you know maybe you
haven't tried sailing and that's
something that makes you come alive so
if you haven't found it yet that's okay
just know that it's out there and
continue seeking keep exploring
don't settle until you find it alright I
wanted to do more but I think the Sun is
setting so I should probably wrap up now
before it gets dark
but thank you guys so much for watching
if you want to submit a question of your
own I'll have a link to a Google folder
down below where you can just upload
your audio file and when you're
recording make sure that you're
recording in a quiet place no background
noise and don't like hold your phone set
it down somewhere so that there's not
too much noise let me know what you
think of this Q&amp;amp;A formats if you like it
or not and in the future I'm considering
making it like a podcast series where
you can submit audio questions and then
I'll go answer them in a podcast but
yeah let me know what you think about
the video and the tea with me alright
have a beautiful day love you all I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
