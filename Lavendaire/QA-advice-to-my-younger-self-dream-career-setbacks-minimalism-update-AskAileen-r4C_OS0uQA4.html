so today the backgrounds a little bit
different because I'm filming in a
different area because the lighting is
better here in the afternoons this is my
music stuff where I write and produce
songs anyway today I am going to be
answering your questions for you in this
Q&amp;amp;A series hashtag ask Eileen so if you
guys have any questions for me feel free
to comment below or ask me on Instagram
and I'll be collecting questions to
answer once a month or so so today the
first question comes from tofu for
thought she asked what advice would you
give to your 18 year old self I think
when I was 18 years old I was just
getting into college and I was so young
and fresh I didn't know that much I
wasn't really present in life but I knew
that I was very opportunistic I was the
type of person to be interested in
everything and I wanted to join all the
clubs at school so I joined like 10 to
20 clubs I would sign up for everything
and it would be really hard to make it
to that many club meetings and to be
that involved but I just I don't know I
couldn't help it I was interested in a
lot of things and I wanted to test
everything out but on the flip side of
that I really spread myself thin and I
was like running from here to there all
the time I didn't have that much free
time and I didn't have enough time to
really get deep into any one thing you
know I didn't have time to make really
good friends in one club because I was
always running to the next meeting or
the next thing so I would just tell
myself to chill out a little bit and
just pick five or less things to do with
my time and really put my all into
devoting into like one or two clubs and
really getting to know the people in
them and developing deeper relationships
because I felt like I was so on the
surface with a lot of my friendships and
relationships at that time just because
I was always like you know thinking
about the next thing and what else I
could do and what else I could
learn about so I didn't give myself the
chance to make a lasting impression on
myself I just kind of like I was like
this literally my mind was so scattered
I would also tell myself to worry less
and have more fun because I think I was
always so ambitious and driven I wanted
to really get ahead looking back I think
when you're 18 years old you still have
so many years to just like explore
experiment and have fun and you should
really be just enjoying your life yes
you should be working hard and working
towards what you want but I think I was
kind of too focused where I really could
have had more fun in college my freshman
year the second question is from petite
eats and it's if you could send the
entire world one message what would it
be and why I really love this question
because I think everybody has like that
strong message that comes from within
them that's really important and is
necessary to be heard I think all of you
guys have something that you could share
that's like helpful but anyway if I had
one message that I could blast to the
world it would probably be something
regarding love you know learn to love
better learn to love yourself and learn
to love every living being on this
planet equally by that I mean like
showing more compassion towards yourself
and towards others and not
discriminating like who you love and who
you don't love and you know these people
are my family or my group and I don't
care about the rest I really think you
have to open up your heart to every
human being every living being because I
care about animals and plants - yeah and
I think if everybody saw the world
through the eyes of that kind of love
then the world would be such a more
positive and beautiful place the next
question comes from Joanne Mercado when
she asks what's your dream career to be
honest I am living my dream career right
now but I'm in the very baby stages of
my dream career so I think the past few
years I figured out that the career and
lifestyle that I want is that of a sort
of media personality
II and author so I've always dreamed of
writing a book and like traveling and
going on book tours and traveling to
speak as well and obviously I really
enjoy doing YouTube and right now I'm
working on trying to make this a
full-time thing where YouTube is where I
can you know make money but I can also
use YouTube as a platform to launch
bigger things that I want to do like
release a book and go on speaking tours
and I don't know just be that kind of
person like I really look up to people
like Oprah who's a huge media
personality but she stands for love and
beauty and strength and she has like her
own companies and she has so many
different businesses and she's just
doing amazing things so that's like the
kind of person I want to be first and
foremost I think you have to be a
personality of some sort where you have
a strong positive message and underneath
that you have like several little
businesses that support that so that's
my dream and right now I'm working to
build it and I have to thank you guys
for being here with me on this journey
just supporting me because this is
what's really happening in my life and
it's so awesome yeah I think I will be
sharing my career for the many years to
come with you guys so hopefully I will
be growing and hopefully you guys will
be growing with me yeah all right the
next question is from Hilda Dee and she
asks how did you begin and continue to
do so about following your dream doesn't
your family and peers pressure you down
how did you fight it so this was like my
journey after college till now I think
now I'm at a place where I'm very
confident in my path and my dreams and I
feel like almost all of my friends and
family really support me and I have all
the love that I need the hard part was
like senior year of college and a couple
years after that when I
was lost and I didn't know what I wanted
to do but I knew I didn't want to get
like a corporate job just like all my
other peers so during that time that I
was lost it was because I was unsure of
what I wanted to do that it frustrated
myself and also frustrated like my
family around me especially my parents
you know because my mom and dad they
were just pushing me to just do
something just get a job why are you
complaining why don't you want to get a
job like what you're supposed to do and
I just knew in my heart that that wasn't
the right path for me but I couldn't
explain what was the right path and it
was kind of like I was insecure when my
peers from college or just any friends
would ask me Oh what are you doing now
what are you doing now and then I'm just
like I'm not sure what I'm doing and I
mean I did have a part-time job and I
was pursuing music just figuring out
what kind of creative path I wanted to
be on but I didn't have a solid answer
in what kind of path I truly wanted to
be on so I think over time I had to
learn to listen to my true voice within
I had to listen to my heart and really
trust that deep down I knew where I
wanted to go and just you know kind of
cut out everyone around me
I think everyone around you means well
and especially when you're family they
kind of don't support what you're doing
it's because they're worried about you
and they just want the best for you so
obviously when I'm looking lost Brook
depressed I'm like crying all the time
that doesn't look good to your parents
and your parents just want the best for
you so they're like you know what why
don't you just do this why don't you go
to grad school or why don't you just get
a job and you'll be happier it's because
they just want you to be secure and they
want you to be safe and they want to not
have to worry about you but over time as
you figure out what you truly want to do
that's when you gain that confidence and
over time it really took me a while to
really hone in on exactly what I wanted
and to gain that confidence that like
yes this is what I want and I'm going to
go for it and once you're like super
confident and what you want then what
everyone else says doesn't matter and
eventually what I saw was that like the
more I was
confident in what I wanted the more the
people around me to started to support
me because once people see that you know
what you're doing and you're going for
it I think it's inspiring so people will
support you and give you all the love
all the way so that's really awesome
alright the last question is from tui TJ
and it's how is your minimalism journey
going in terms of maintaining the
lifestyle etc any stuff crept back in
are you enjoying it so you guys know
that I'm a huge supporter of minimalism
I love having this minimalist mindset
but I don't want to be considered like a
serious minimalist because I'm very like
flexible with my values and I like to
just keep what makes me happy and that's
what makes me happy you know if it looks
like a lot to other people who are like
SuperDuper minimalist then I'm sorry
I'll just call it my own thing so ever
since I tidied all of my things through
the con Mari method I moved and I also
continue to tidy like little by little
over this weekend I threw out two more
bags of clothes and one box of old shoes
but generally I really enjoy clearing
out the things that don't bring me joy
anymore and making sure that everything
that I own is something that makes me
happy or adds value in my life it is
hard for me to say goodbye to things
because I'm sentimental or I'm also very
practical like okay this is brand-new
and I technically could wear it if I
want that's the hardest part so I think
I still keep things that don't bring me
so much joy but they're just ok but
that's ok with me for now I think I'll
continue tidying little by little as I
go and that's just how I'm doing it I
also appreciate that minimalism has
changed the way that I shop so now when
I shop I am more conscious and aware and
I'm more picky about the things that I
buy so I'll buy something only if I
truly really enjoy it and if it fits me
like perfectly I think before I would
buy things that don't fit me perfectly
but just like I kind of like just
because they're on sale that kind of
thing and now I'm looking to buy higher
quality things even if
higher price I don't mind because I want
to buy higher quality things in less
quantity and my ideal closet is like
high quality pieces that I could wear
for much longer
and I think now I'm starting to shop for
that higher quality level of clothes and
trying to just evolve my style that way
alright guys that's it for my Q&amp;amp;A video
