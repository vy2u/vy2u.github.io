there so I wanted to start doing and ask
me anything type video series where you
guys can ask me questions on Twitter and
I will answer a few of them in each
video so I may be doing this once a
month or so just tweet me your questions
at lavender and I will collect them and
answer maybe four or five at a time
all right the first question comes from
Katy she asks what do you think is the
best way to be motivated and relaxed and
just accepting of whatever happens I
forgot where I once read this but
someone said that their secret to
happiness was I don't mind what happens
I don't mind what happens this comes
from the idea that you can only control
the things that you can control like
what you do the actions you take the
words you say etc but you can't control
the outcome or the results usually
people are so stressed out over the
result or what's going to happen or
what's not going to happen that it just
it's unnecessary worrying so ultimately
if you learn to cultivate this mindset
of I don't mind what happens then you'll
be able to just focus on the things you
can control and everything else you just
release it from your worries next up
Clara asked how did your spiritual self
improvement journey start I have a video
that I made last year on my personal
journey so far I guess that's a good
starting point to watch that video and
get a feel for my story basically I'm
not sure exactly where it started but I
guess it started growing more my senior
year of college I studied abroad in
Italy that's where I really have intent
on going to discover myself to spend a
lot of time out there in the world a lot
of time alone I was journaling a lot and
I started reading more and more books in
that self development category because I
was just trying to find my purpose in
life I was trying to figure out where I
wanted to take my life career-wise and
obviously this whole concept of
of growth and lifestyle design is really
important to me and I'm inspired and I'm
very passionate about it so I guess I
just stumbled upon it senior year of
college well I was finding myself and
now I feel like I'm more confident in
myself but there's always always room to
grow there's always something new to
learn and there's always ways to stretch
yourself so it's an endless journey next
up I got a couple emails from so Liana
and Isabel both asking the same question
on how to start a blog what's some
advice that you could give to people who
want to start a blog so on the technical
side I guess number one is choose your
platform you can blog on tumblr blogger
WordPress I mean there's a ton of stuff
out there I prefer using WordPress I
feel like if you're more professional
than most people use WordPress it's all
free if you want to get your own domain
though like a something.com then that's
when you have to pay for domain web
hosting and stuff like that the best
advice I could give is to just start
start writing something now just write
blog posts and try to carve out a
certain amount of time every day to
write something it doesn't matter if
it's good or bad just write something
and post it write something and post it
because blogging really is a practice
you get better as you write more and as
you write more you also learn to develop
and hone your voice and your style so
there's really not that much to
everything else can be learned
there's tutorials and how-tos on
everything out there so if you have an
urge to start a blog I would say pick a
platform and just start next up is a
question from YouTube I sorry I can't
pronounce your user name the question is
what would you suggest to do to decrease
stress without canceling any
appointments or postponing work or
school so stress is something that
happens to all of us it's totally normal
and I feel like most of the time stress
comes from one being overwhelmed with
everything that you have to do when
you're just like standing there looking
at this big picture like oh my god I
have such a long list of you know
responsibilities and it also comes from
worry
about the future because you may be
stressed about the outcome you're
stressed about whether or not you're
gonna meet this deadline or whether or
not you're gonna hit these goals or
whatever so a lot of this stress comes
from focusing on things that are out of
your reach at the moment so I think the
best way to decrease stress is to
realize that the only moment that you
have power in is this present moment
every second every minute where you're
currently living that's the only time
that you have control over this is the
only time that you can do something
about your life and the things that you
have to do so
standing back looking at the big picture
overwhelmed is not going to get you
anywhere the best thing that you can do
is to just handle the present moment
handle what you can in this moment right
now do what you can you have five
minutes do what you can in this five
minutes use what you can and don't sweat
it
outside of that just focus and stop
worrying about everything else I
recommend this book called the art of
stress-free productivity if you feel
like you need a better flow in how to
handle your to Do's then I recommend
reading this book it really helped me
with my system and it helps you kind of
prioritize what's important what to
focus on right now alright the last
question comes from Chelsea and she
basically asked about meditation she
says that she sees visions while she's
meditating and she's wondering is that
right if she meditating right is there a
right way to meditate alright so I'm not
an expert on meditation but from what I
know I know that it's okay anything that
happens is okay the point of meditation
is to focus on your breath
clear your mind observe your mind so
Chelsea I think if you see visuals
that's really cool for me I don't see
things but I just hear words and I hear
my thoughts
but meditating really is learning to
focus on just focus on one thing whether
that is your breath or some people focus
on counting from one to ten and then
starting over again there's different
ways to meditate some people focus on
sounds but my point is you're not doing
anything wrong as long as you're sitting
there
relaxed and you're trying to focus and
clear your mind if you see visions
that's okay you're just observing
so imagine it like you're seeing the
clouds pass by in the sky you don't have
to really act upon it you don't have to
do anything the point is just to observe
it see them and then let them pass once
you become aware of what you're seeing
then bring your focus back to whatever
your anchor is whether it's your breath
or something else so I think it's all
okay as long as you are being consistent
and practicing daily then you're good if
any of you guys out there would like to
share your thoughts please comment below
alright those are the questions I'm
going to answer for today if you guys
have any more questions feel for you to
tweet me at lavender I'll be collecting
these questions for the next video all
right thank you so much for watching

your thoughts see you in the next one
