to think about how you've changed or
grown in the past year so lately I've
been noticing that I am different from
who I was a year ago in these little
moments but in general I feel like I've
changed and I've grown a lot as a person
in a positive way and specifically I've
noticed that I've changed a lot as a
performer I started performing heavily
in January of 2013 and 2013 was like my
year of performing I did multiple shows
a month and I got a lot of practice
lately I've noticed how I'm different
when I'm performing now versus how I was
a year ago
for example a year ago I still had stage
fright and I would be super nervous and
I'd be shaking before I go on stage and
my hands would be shaking as I'm playing
piano and I get like sweaty and it was
horrible but fast-forward to my recent
performances I'm so much more chill now
I feel like I can be comfortable being
myself on stage and I can just put
emotion and soul into playing and focus
on playing because I'm not thinking
about anything else outside of the
performance so last year I was just
caught up in my head and over analyzing
things and getting distracted and just
all of that stuff while performing and
this year I've become more
well this year I've become more
comfortable being myself basically also
a year ago if I made a mistake and
messed up on stage I would apologize
and/or let that mistake
snowball me down this drain of messing
up and just making more mistakes and
being so judgmental on myself but I've
learned and this year I've noticed that
when I make mistakes and I still do
I just brush over it I keep going I
don't let it face me I just keep playing
and do my best I don't overthink it I
don't in my head I'm not like though
you're so stupid because I used to have
that self-talk in my head and that would
distract me from what's going on out
here
and lastly and most importantly I would
say I learned to get my self-worth and
validation from myself a year ago I
would be insecure about myself and I
would ask people after the show if they
liked it or what they thought about it
and whatever they said had a huge impact
on me because I kind of got my
validation from others so I was
susceptible to whatever they told me and
even if people told me it was great
I would be like are you sure are you
sure and it was a lot of my insecurities
playing out and I realized that it
shouldn't matter what other people
things I noticed recently that when I'm
performing and I know that I put my
heart and soul out there and I am doing
my best and I'm feeling it then I've
done a good job simply because I felt it
in myself I entered the flow state and I
just gave it my all and that's all that
I can do so now when people tell me
after the show oh my god you were so
amazing or I loved the performance I
smile I say thank you but deep down I
don't need it whether people tell me
that or not it doesn't matter because I
have that confidence
that I did a good job and I am happy
with myself in the end and with that
mentality I definitely care less about
trying to impress others or what others
think about me it's more about my own
personal journey so that's how I've
changed as a performer generally I've
learned that to perform well you just
have to stop carrying go out and do you
the best that you can do at that moment
so that was my answer and now it's your
turn let me know how you think you've
changed or grown over the past year and
in what ways are you different what
lessons have you learned all of that
good stuff I'm really interested to know
because everybody is learning something
new every day and there's always all of
the stuff going on so leave a note in
the comments subscribe share like this
video and let me know if you have any
questions for me you want me to answer
but I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
