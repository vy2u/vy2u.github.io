today I want to share some of my best
relationship advice while I do a get
ready with me video so I hope you like
this new format here we go alright so
first I'm just gonna clip some hair out
of the way and let's talk about
relationships so one thing that I've
been hearing from a lot of girlfriends
lately I mean just in general I feel
like this is something that a lot of
people talk about or complain about is
like relationship problems what's going
wrong in their relationship and I guess
my first thing that I wanted to share
today is that I realized after hearing
all of this stuff and I do it too
talking about what's wrong in my
relationship is we spend so much time
focusing on what's wrong instead of
focusing on what's right so that's like
one shift that you can make in your
relationship whether it's romantic
we're also relationships with your
friends and family to instead of
focusing on what's wrong with that
relationship focus on what's right so
lately I try not to wear foundation and
I really just use concealer so I'm gonna
conceal now another thing in
relationships that I am personally
guilty of but I see a lot of my friends
do is wanting to change the other person
whether you want to change your
significant other push them to be better
or even like people like your family
members sometimes like I want to like
push my mom to like take risks and not
be scared of everything you just want to
like help them grow and improve so the
problem with that is you're actually
projecting your own insecurities and
judgment onto the other person and even
though it might come out of like good
intentions it might come out of love
that you care about them and want them
to be better at the end of the day that
person will only change if they want to
change and there's only so much that you
could do to like guide them towards that
direction you can't ever force anything
like that to happen instead what you
should do is you should focus on
yourself so instead of like focusing all
your energy on this other person focus
your energy on yourself and ask yourself
what can i improve about myself what can
I change about myself because you have
complete control over that
um okay this is interesting I usually
don't talk when I'm getting ready so I
feel like I'm multitasking here I'm just
gonna finish this up I don't know if he
can take me seriously when I have like
marks on my face giving this kind of
advice by the way I've been using this
blender from Juno it's actually really
great it's better than the beauty
blender in my opinion because it's a
little fuzzy so it's kind of like tiny
brush strokes with the sponge I love it
today I'm gonna use two pallets that are
my current favorites I love this Too
Faced sweet peach palette and the pixie
Whaley palette as well so I'm gonna go
in with this shade it's called girl and
put that all over my lids so on the
topic of bringing the focus back on
yourself instead of the other person
always ask what can I learn from this so
whatever situation you're in ask
yourself what can I learn from it
because relationships are essentially
our greatest teachers in life I know
sometimes we feel like we're the
righteous ones and we're trying to help
this other person see the way or
whatever but in reality that situation
is supposed to teach us something so ask
yourself what can I learn from the
situation whether it's learning to love
someone unconditionally accept someone's
flaws learn patience and forgiveness
there are so many lessons that we can
learn from these situations instead of
like just trying to change someone else
one it's easier to start with ourselves
okay now I'm gonna go into candied peach
I have no idea what this will turn out
to be and what I'm doing is I'm just
putting it in like the center as part of
my eye lid
and now I'm going to go in the shade a
potato from this Whaley palette onto the
outer corners of my lid I'm going to use
this puree color and just blend it we'll
see how this looks
lastly I'm gonna go into this color
summer YUM and go into the bottom part
of my eye I'm gonna pop on some eyeliner
because I don't feel complete without
eyeliner the next big tip that I want to
share if you want to have better longer
lasting relationships is to release all
expectations so don't have any
expectations and then anything that
happens will be a bonus so when you have
expectations you're setting yourself up
for failure so you expect this person to
do something and if they don't do it
you're gonna be disappointed and then
you're gonna get mad or sad just try not
to have any expectations and learn to
love and accept the other person
unconditionally a big part of that is
actually learning to love yourself
because when we have high expectations
for ourselves we don't meet them we get
disappointed in ourselves and some of us
are really critical and hard on
ourselves so you'll notice that the more
critical you are on yourself the more
critical you are on other people so
whether it's your significant other or
just friends everyone in general so it's
a reflection of yourself so if you judge
yourself a lot you're probably gonna
judge your significant other and that
doesn't make them happy that's gonna
lead to arguments and more relationship
issues honestly a big part of like
learning to love someone else
unconditionally is learning to love
yourself unconditionally so a lot of
times it relationships are teaching us
how to love ourselves better it goes
back to self-love and that's because if
you can love yourself with all your
flaws unconditionally and accept
everything that you are you're it's
gonna be easier to do that with someone
else so now I'm gonna go into like this
brow palette and powder a little bit of
my brows I have the micro bladed but
sometimes I just add a little bit just
to fill it in because it's been like
over a year since I got them done
hopefully they still kind of look good
normally I don't put anything on them
but sometimes I feel like it also on the
topic of like not having expectations
for others some of you might ask like
well what if you have like zero
expectations and this
takes advantage of you and you still
accept it that that's a different story
I think when it there's a line where it
becomes like abuse whether it's verbal
psychological even physical abuse you
have to know how to recognize when that
person is genuinely hurting you and it's
not good for yourself and that's the
point where self we come back to self
love again because if you love yourself
enough then you won't allow someone else
to violate yourself like that in that
way usually if you don't love yourself
enough you will let other people get
away with taking advantage of you or
hurting you and doing all these things
because you don't feel worthy or you
feel like that's something that maybe
you deserve
I don't know but deep down it all starts
with self love and if you love yourself
enough then you will recognize the point
of abuse whether it's something you
should not tolerate and then leave the
relationship or do whatever you can to
like you know stop that all right now
I'm gonna go in and bronze my face with
this Too Faced chocolate bronzer it
really smells like chocolate so it's
really fun like every time I put it on
my face I get cravings I mean it makes
me happy honestly the smell of chocolate
makes me happy so going back to if you
have people in your life that you care
about and you kind of want to change
them or push them in a better direction
the best thing you can do in that case
is simply to love them love them for who
they are where they are in their life
and then you should lead as an example
to guide them in the right direction
just lead by example be the role model
and also give them love love them
unconditionally and then patience
because over time you may just inspire
them to see that it's possible to change
and they might start to change without
you like trying to push them and force
them so hard alright I hope you guys
like this get ready with me advice
chaddy style if you do and you want to
see more let me know down below also
give me like feedback on how I could do
this better and what else you want to
see but in general I just want to leave
you with this relationships are all
about learning to be patient and love
it's about learning to love and accept
someone else for everything that they
are with their mistakes and flaws
everything and in turn it's also about
loving yourself unconditionally learning
to accept everything that you are
without judging yourself or being too
hard on yourself so in reality
relationships are mirrors in life
because they reveal who you are inside
they reveal to you places that you can
heal places that you can work on
yourself and it really is an opportunity
for you to learn and grow from the
situation rather than like judging
others or blaming others so it really is
about yourself start with yourself focus
on yourself and lead by example and
everything else will follow from there
