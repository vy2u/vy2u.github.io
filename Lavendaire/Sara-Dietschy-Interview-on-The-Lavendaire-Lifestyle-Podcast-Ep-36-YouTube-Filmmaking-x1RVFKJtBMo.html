TV and interview series that aim to
explain the where and how behind
creative life when she's not drinking
Lacroix or making YouTube videos she is
most likely watching YouTube videos just
like that hi Sarah guys thank you for
having me on I'm so excited and I like I
was saying earlier I learned so much
from you in terms of like editing color
grading like just thank you for sharing
what you did for
like adjustment layers is that gyy
changing what it changed my life oh like
it's so fun because you know I love to
do entertaining stuff like vlogs and
things but it's always so cool to share
what other people have taught me and you
to the such a good tool for that so that
means so much that it helped you yeah
no seriously anyone out there who's into
video editing check out Sarah teaches
channel because all a lot of knowledge
there okay so I want to ask you what got
you into filmmaking you know where does
all this knowledge and background come
from yeah so it starts with embarrassing
school and high school projects so I was
always a person whenever the teacher
presented the class of the project you
know maybe it was specifically to make a
video or to write a report
I would always aim it towards how about
I make a video and specifically I made a
fair amount of rap music videos so like
educational rap music videos so there's
still one out there on the internet that
actually has so many views it's so
embarrassing but it's basically me
rapping to to a song that we rewrote
it's called the law of supply and demand
and so basically we made this rap song
and we taught about economics and you
know there would always be a video
attached to that so I really learned how
to edit through just school projects and
it was just so fun so I really didn't
get into filming until after high school
I never had rigged my own camera
equipment I use my dad's Canon t3i so
yeah it all started with kind of in
school and just figuring out creative
outlets within the public school system
sometimes it was hard but you know all
my teachers were super rad and we're
always like heck yeah do it and so yeah
that was always extremely fun so that
was kind of my way into it and I played
in a band I played electric guitar for
10 years and so oh that's so long so I
didn't know once I started really
getting more into music in high school
you know like we need a music video
we need a promo video for our show so
that that alongside of the high school
projects really kind of kicked things
off and that's where I started to find
my passion video I love that so did you
start your YouTube channel like then
like when did YouTube come into the
picture my first youtube video ever was
in 2011 I was a junior in high school
and it was about a guitar pedal
so basically guitar pedals are just like
a box that makes your guitar signal
either sound fuzzy or do something
special with it and I wanted to sell it
and it was kind of a rare pedal so like
this YouTube thing I feel like if I made
a video put it on the YouTube people
would see it and someone will buy this
guitar pedal
and so I did that and it was the first
time when I realized wow this internet
thing there's actually people out there
because it automatically got 3000 hits
and I was I was so just blown away by
that I was like okay I put this in a
Craigslist ad and people from the
internet are already finding it
organically through YouTube what is this
about and so that was kind of my first
exposure to this world of online video
and the fact that there's these people
on the other side of the screen
searching out your content finding it
and so that was my first youtube video
ever was just that and I made some other
sets more centered around music so
really it all started with music and
that's how I really fell in love video
maybe over photography or something just
because you're putting images to music a
lot of the time and so I think that's
where I get also more of my video
editing style is it's very around music
and kind of editing to music so it's
been a huge part of my life I love that
it's funny cuz I didn't know that but I
didn't tell you but actually I started
YouTube in high school from music as
well like I was singing playing piano
doing cover songs and stuff but that was
longer ago like everyone though I feel
like everyone has this posit and coming
of her music videos somewhere on the
internet yeah yeah it was so much fun
and it really like taught a lot of
people about video and editing and stuff
that's amazing yeah you have creative
spaces TV which is super cool on your
channel can talk about what made you
start that series krantz spaces TV
started out of something that I wanted
to watch so I remember loving in TV
cribs I would always watch MTV Cribs but
while watching is like I don't care
what's in there frigerator like I want
to see what is on their desk what are
they shooting these things with how do
they make the music they make if they're
musicians how do they film what they
film so I was definitely just interested
and the spaces the offices the tools
that creators use to create and I didn't
really see anything out there and during
that time was also I watched this video
it was on Gizmodo it was a three part
series of a dude by the name of Casey
nice that he only had about 150,000
subscribe
some YouTube at a time and I was
watching this Gizmodo studio tour and I
was blown away I was like oh my gosh
wait are there more of these I want to
know more of this you know I want to
know how creators create and so it kind
of came out of those two things like MTV
Cribs and seeing that studio tour of a
person who would later actually have a
lot of influence in my video career and
I was like wow if no one's making this
why don't I and I was really looking for
a project that would give me more
credibility because I was making travel
vlogs and things but I was always very
interested in filmmaking but I never had
a project that could really prove that I
could do it and so I saw it as an
opportunity to one meet amazing creative
people and to just to have this series
that can you know use as a case to maybe
get jobs and video or could just be a
good example of like look I can do this
then I can use season one as you know
something to show bigger and better
creative people that I can get for the
next season and so on so forth and so
yeah I just started it and I saw it as a
way you know at the time I probably only
had a thousand two thousand subscribers
when I first started creative space TV
and I really needed ways to reach beyond
my audience and making something and
providing value to someone else you know
these people who are was interviewing
they had tons of friends and maybe a
little bit of a social following and you
know their family got hyped on a video I
made for him so it was making something
for someone and really connecting to
their spheres of influence and with
every video I made it was just expanding
my circle just a little bit more and you
know looking back it did so many epic
things for me now in a hindsight but it
made me a better filmmaker it made me a
better internet error and made me just a
better like human I met so many awesome
people know there's so many like good
points that I want to pull out of this
because one I think you're so smart to
do that because yes it did like build
your credibility because I like many
people found your channel through that
how did Casey Neistat of law exactly but
it was really like the creative spaces
TV where I'm like whoa like this girl
knows what you're doing it looks
professional and
and I don't know it's just a smart thing
for you to do so like other creatives
out there take note and do something
like this not the same idea but like
create stuff where you can expand your
sphere of influence that's what you said
thank you yeah and something that you
know really stuck with me what Casey
himself said in the video after he saw
the video I made about him was you know
he was like this how did Casey and I
start of log it's funny it's good but
you know the backlog of content that she
already has in her channel is quality um
and so it's not only I think you know if
you're doing anything in the social
sphere it's one yes like think about
what is the type of content that's going
to put you in front of new faces and new
people but then at the same time you
have to make sure that you're making the
content that you really care about and
that's going to keep your audience
because yes you might make a viral
something but if you don't have anything
on your channel or your Instagram or
whatever that's not going to keep the
people there then that's pointless
that's such a good tip because
everyone's trying to just make viral
content but you have to make good
content to stuff that you want to watch
yeah so for people out there who don't
know like Sarah made of viral super
viral video how to case be nice that a
vlog that Casey nice that saw and talked
about and so it just blew up right yeah
yeah I have like one point five moles
news yeah so how was it to meet him by
the way I saw that you like Medan yeah
yeah amazing you know that kind of just
started a relationship with him very
just you know maybe back and forth a
little bit on Twitter and then we
started going to the same conferences
and stuff and you know we're able to
develop a relationship you know off of
the internet like actually in real life
and you know it's so cool to someone who
is just one of your heroes to be able to
casually like call them your friends you
know that's that's crazy yeah and he's
yeah he's just killing it on all
accounts at all times so it's you know
still to this day it's just crazy that
to have just one of those people that
you really look up to to say just
amazing words and like validate your
work but it's just you know it's amazing
yeah yeah and I mean I'm curious have
you learned anything from him like
what's one thing you can share
oh maybe it was something yeah that
surprise you remember man yeah it's not
surprising but something that I think
just really hits home with everything he
does and it's you know an awesome
message that he spreads with every
single why he makes is just you know if
you want to get to point B if you have
that goal in your head if you were ever
you need to go in life what's in between
point A and point B it's the work it's
the work and I think he does such a
great job of through all of the content
he makes to you know he makes it fun but
he also shows that and meeting him in
real life and just having conversations
with him it's you know he's not just all
talk he lives but he breathes it and
it's insanely inspiring
that's so cool so it's about the work
the actual wooden work you put in so you
upload quite frequently I think you
upload daily right yeah so I upload
every weekday so 5 uploads a week Monday
through Friday I try to hit that 8 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time it's more it's
more of like for me so I don't wait
until midnight to post it yeah but yeah
five five days a week I'm curious how do
you balance that what's your schedule
like and are you do you feel like you're
always chasing that like 8 p.m. time
like you're stressed out before like 7
p.m. yes yes so I am a very last minute
person and so it's funny you're asking
this because this week is the first week
that I actually took time on the weekend
I filmed a little bit ahead because
pretty much ever since high school
college I was the same with schoolwork I
was always a very last networker but
because of that that's why I kind of
wanted to push my limits a little bit
more was 5 uploads instead of Monday
Wednesday Friday that I was doing
previously because I find when I just
spill all of my time or most of my time
with work that really pushes out the
time that I would procrastinate so maybe
I found that it doesn't change a lot
from uploading more videos because now
just that time that maybe I'd be
watching too Netflix shows or something
I'm just editing another video so it's
it's not necessarily you know I up to my
work so it's not necessarily degrading
my quality of life but it's just you
know fitting in work I feel like there's
always room
and maybe be less on Twitter or less on
Instagram and so the value that I'm
getting from posting more and having
more opportunities to see my stuff I've
found is so worth it but yeah it's an
ever evolving process I never have
things truly figured out but I think the
goal always is to be able to be ahead a
little bit
um and I'm worried out here is that
slowly no that's good I think that's
already like you're doing really well
alrighty five videos a week because I
would run out of ideas on like what to
vlog you know cuz I'm just at home so I
don't know how you doing where are you
based out of I'm in LA we need a little
outside of LA but west coast yeah
whatever you're at yeah I'll hit you up
grow hang up let's take a break because
I want to tell you about better help

trial today the link is also in the show
notes alright back to the podcast ok so
I mean I also wrote down this question
but you might have answered it but maybe
you have something else you want to say
like what would you say is the most
challenging part of what you do the most
challenging part is probably the most
rewarding part and it is the feedback so
it's the best thing in the world because
I've been able to develop this amazing
community of just like Internet
community of you know peachie fans
they're amazing and it's a ton of
creative next level human beings who are
you know trying to achieve their dreams
and
you are doing it right alongside me and
so every single day I get to have
encouraging conversations with people
who watch my stuff and it's amazing but
it's also the most challenging thing
because it's the internet and you're not
always going to have it's not always
going to be rainbows and butterflies and
so dealing with just that little bit of
hate you know one negative comment can
completely wreck 100 positive comments
if you let it and so that's something
especially that I've been having to kind
of push through and has been a big
challenge recently as I'm making stuff
that's growing my channel and I've kind
of hit a pace where I'm growing at a
good pace and my stuff is being served
up and the YouTube algorithm and things
but with that comes people who maybe
aren't aware of where I've come from
what my story is what I've been doing on
YouTube for the past four years and so
they kind of just get the screenshot of
the video that they watch and they you
know will leave a nasty comment or
something and as much as I deflect those
things there's still one or two that
always you know get under your skin and
so every day it's kind of a it has to be
a conscious decision of okay you look
through the comments cool that's a part
of your job don't dwell on it and it's
something that's so easy you know you
you talk to other people who maybe don't
have an Internet job and if the answer
is the same every time and it's I just
don't focus on it you know like they
don't matter just ignore it ignore it
ignore it ignore it and that's true like
that is the best thing to do but at the
same time that is so annoying to hear
because they don't at all understand
what it feels like and so so yeah that's
something definitely that is a challenge
every single day but every single time I
do choose to focus on the positivity
it's the best thing ever when you're in
the moment you wanna you want to hit
back at people you want to kind of have
these you know little hissy fits on line
but every time that I chose to just
breathe and maybe focus on a positive
comment that someone has left it so it's
the harshest thing in the world but it's
it truly is the best thing you can do
but that will always be a challenge I
see
if you create content online if you
create any type of art you will have to
butt heads with those people who often
kind don't have a clue what it's like to
create actually those are usually the
haters we just got to move on because
those people they don't know you there
just browsing by like I can totally
relate because this happens like if you
have a video that is more popular you
just get a lot of strangers coming by on
your channel and it's just like the way
I think about it is like oh these people
they're here and they're gone like they
don't know me I don't know them like
whatever yeah you know I try to brush it
off but I it's true because some can
hurt you
deep you know it just depends on what
they say are you saying and it's always
you know it's sometimes there's the
trolls and you can just ignore it
because they're trolls but then other
times I really hit home on things that
are just like oh god yeah it's hard you
know what I think it's the times when
you feel like there's a little truth in
what they say and then you're like oh oh
 like yeah and I really like that
and you question yourself yeah it's the
insecurities that you have to learn to
work through and 100% okay so let's talk
about your future
I'm so excited like what are you
planning ahead for your channel for your
life what do you want to do good
question yeah I'm wondering right how to
take Sara DG yeah yeah so I definitely
you know still see myself in New York
City for a a good amount of time and
just I love the city so much and I'm
always going to be so passionate about
YouTube and that will forever be my main
source of content creation but there's
definitely things that I'm really
looking forward to one little thing is
you know I recently went to Cuba and I
came back with enough stuff to actually
form a like my first documentary that's
going to be like 50 minutes which I'm
really excited about yeah I've done a
lot of documentary filmmaking but it's
always been in these 15 to 20 minute
like short docu-series Signac so I think
that's a super exciting challenge for me
you know to make something because at
the beginning I was like okay
documentary in here or maybe like 90
minutes but I can't even sit down and
watch something hour and a half so I'm
like you know what Nick challenge
accepted I'm going to make an
entertaining 45 minute video so I'm
really excited
that and seeing just how I can take some
of my creative concepts and shows to
different platforms I think you know I
don't know what that means yet but just
collaborating with the right people to
really scale what I've done on my
youtube channel and so taking this
concepts from creative space of TV and
also just kind of you know my life in
New York City
vlogging and kind of merging those
worlds and potentially making it into
you know something that involves an
actual people outside of me to where I
can be filmed
interacting with these different
creators and showing you their journey
showing you their space and do that in a
way that helps me just you know maybe
gain a different audience and a bigger
audience that's maybe some we're not on
YouTube so that definitely excites me
and something that I'm pursuing full
force this next year and there's just a
lot I feel like every single week I'm
meeting just someone so talented and new
into my life who's doing something
creative
so just collaborations ahead yeah it's
an exciting time it's just wow I know
that sounds super exciting so just
documentary filmmaking on a bigger level
outside of YouTube which is cool because
what you're doing now like vlogging is
basically documenting your life exactly
right super cool okay so last question
is do you have any advice for young
aspiring filmmakers or vloggers out
there this is something that I say so
much that might be getting old but it's
something I so truly believe is just
when in doubt keep creating keep
creating keep pushing through those
barriers because every time that I've
made a huge breakthrough in the creative
space that I'm in on the other like
directly on other side of that was just
chaos utter chaos like so many reasons
that I shouldn't be making that video
like so many reasons I shouldn't be
going to this networking party or
something so many reasons to not meet
with that person but once I do and once
I actually like put in the work and
recognize what my priorities are and
just go full steam ahead once you're on
the other side and you like see the
results of you just putting your head
down
working it is so so worth it if you do
anything you know you can be creative
with any job and often times you're
going to have doubts like you you're
going to have doubts about your own
talent you're going to have doubts that
come from other people's opinions on
your work and the goal is to just not to
dwell on it
but to just keep pressing on like do not
bail before that breakthrough because it
is it can be so close and you don't even
know it until you hit it and then once
you're on the other side you're like oh
well I'm so glad that happened I mean
the video that changed my life that we
talked about earlier how to case-knife
out a blog I was so insecure about that
video I almost didn't post it cause of
what I thought I looks like on like the
intro that video and I'm so glad I
posted it obviously you know you came
and I I got and so I think it's just
yeah it's a little you know little
insecurities little just challenges that
you have to kind of take one one step at
a time and just keep moving forward like
you've got to keep going on because it's
the only thing you can do creates create
and put your work out there even if it's
not perfect right even exactly great
about you can't you can't wait for
perfect because it's never time
what if you don't have inspiration
though okay no yes one more question
yeah that's a good question because
that's always a question I can't answer
because I truly think when it comes to
finding what you're truly passionate in
life like that has to be such a big full
searching process on your end of things
like if you're lost and you don't feel
inspired and you don't think you're
doing what you should be doing right now
you have like no right to complain about
it if you're not out there like trying I
recently signed in this like interview
that I did to is it's just when you're
doing something you hate it really
pushes you into what you love so when I
was in college and the point of that is
even if you don't have a job that you
love even if you don't have something
that you absolutely love that you're
doing don't just sit around like try
things try new jobs try going to
different events like just try try try
and even if it's something that you're
not liking your
still doing something you're still
meeting people you're still figuring out
things that you don't like so you don't
have to like dwell on that anymore when
I was in college and pursuing electrical
engineering you know it took me three
years of college to figure out that is
so not what I wanted to do but at the
same time when I like hated my life
doing my Electrical Engineering homework
I was really being pushed into video and
I was sharing that out and I was
pursuing kind of these small video jobs
on the side and I was really figuring
out like wow I actually enjoy this this
is something I can do and I was just
doing you know I was doing my electrical
engineering homework and I was doing
video edits and I was doing u2 so I was
pursuing passion projects I was pursuing
jobs that you know I was working with
clients and then I was also dealing with
the bureaucracy that is College and just
all of the things that was that and I
wouldn't change it for the world because
I learned so many unique lessons within
each of those experiences that have now
just like become the sum of who I am
today
that is such great advice I agree a
thousand percent you have to keep trying
and doing doing and while you're taking
action you figure it out you know
exactly yes thank you so so much for
