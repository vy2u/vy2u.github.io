probably the most touristy thing you can
do but it's a must the view is so
beautiful up there and the weather was
perfect I'm so happy we went in June
when it's not raining we're at the Space
Needle
so what do we do today Elvis
know what they were using so we went to
get chowder the best chowder we've ever
had the best chowder in America that we
walked around Heidi's place and now
we're at the Space Needle and then we're
gonna explode up all the glass gardens
and some other places so we hung out up
there for about an hour just enjoying
the water and the city then afterwards
we went to the Chihuly glass Gardens
Chihuly is a glass artist and his work
is just amazing this was probably one of
my favorite spots in Seattle
there's just so much going on in his
work all the colors and the way that
light reflects and interacts with the
glass it was very beautiful and very
interesting
so outside they place the glass art in
the gardens and made it look like it was
part of nature I thought that was so
cool after that we went to the Japanese
gardens and it was so green and peaceful
you will discover two smaller paths the
first leads to the base to the waterfall
the second to the tea garden the three
trees growing along the west side of the
main path
so day two in Seattle we decided to take
the ferry let me explain
so we're gonna ride the ferry boat we
couldn't find parking so we're gonna
drive onto the ferry all the way to
Bates bridge
thirty minutes
so instead of riding the ferry as
passengers we decided to drive onto the
ferry which I think we all secretly
wanted to do because it's so cool and
we've never done it before
so I was filming as we were driving onto
the ferry and I didn't even realize that
we were already on the boat I thought we
were driving into a parking garage for
some reason it didn't click in my head
until I looked out the window to see my
right and I was like
I love being on the water so it was
really fun and the view of Seattle on
water was gorgeous it was very windy
right here as we walked in the front of
the boat
this is bainbridge island it was very
green we just explored for a couple of
hours took some pictures enjoyed nature
then we headed that's to Seattle it's
crazy because the Sun doesn't set until
9 p.m. and the days are so long lastly
these are just a few clips that we took
at Microsoft's Elvis gave us a tour of
the campus but I didn't really include
much that's the soccer field and the
Microsoft Commons so yeah this is where
my brother will be the rest of the
summer
good luck Elvis have fun so I always
wanted to make a speech for you guys but
sadly my camera ran out of battery and
he got cut off so this is all we got
right now yep what should I say should I
tell them about how much how much I
cried over the years so ever since I was
a little boy but no I shouldn't should i
sorry oh this the world wasn't ready but
thanks guys for watching my Seattle vlog
I had such a great time and I would
definitely go back only when the
weather's nice though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
