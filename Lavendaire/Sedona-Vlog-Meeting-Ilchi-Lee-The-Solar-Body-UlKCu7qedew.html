Sedona for an event on the solar body a
book by ill chili I stayed at the Sedona
Mago retreat a secluded spiritual
retreats also built by ill chili I got
to meet and interview ill chili himself
and he gave me a very special blessing I
also met and connected with awesome
people from the solar body and body and
brain yoga community and then I cut to
explore the magic of Sedonas Red Rocks
okay how did this all happen let me
start from the beginning
remember that video I made called how to
restore your body's natural healing
power well the team behind the solar
body book really enjoyed my video and
after meeting over Skype they invited me
out to Sedona for this event it's kind
of crazy how this all happened but I'm
so grateful that it did so I just landed
in Phoenix Arizona we're going to meet
up with my friends I'm gonna hang out
he's gonna show me his life in Phoenix
and then we're gonna drive to Sedona
we arrived in the evening and I was so
surprised to find out that I would get
to interview ill cheeley the next day I
totally did not expect that so I got
pretty nervous about it the next morning
we woke up at 6 a.m. to do a morning
meditation and afterwards we had a to
breakfast after breakfast we met with
Linda the PR manager of body and brain
yoga and we basically became instant
friends Linda gave us a tour of the
entire retreats which is huge
my favorite spot in the retreat is
hands-down the healing garden and
meditation Lake I really can't get over
how beautiful this place is
it's truly a heaven on earth
here Linda's showing us the rosemary and
sage that they grow by the lake then she
walked us through their garden of fruit
trees herbs and veggies
what's also cute is that they plant
these fruit trees along the rooms where
we stayed after the tour we hung out in
my room and took a quick nap when I woke
up it was time to meet eel chewy
that's his translator Michelle she's
awesome
right after we met ill Julie gave an
impromptu performance on the sweet
we chatted for about half an hour I
shared my story and he shared tons of
wisdom from his life after meeting him I
see that he's such a true soul and
gentle human being and he genuinely
wants to create great things for the
world I feel so lucky and honored to
have met him his interviews pretty long
so I'll post snippets of his wisdom in a
separate video the link will be in the
description below and then this happened
from what I know you have your website
and you need these videos because you
want to help people in some way yeah you
made a decision of greatness it's a
really sharp thank you ya know cuz in my
journey I've gone through like my own
personal struggle and finding myself
what am I supposed to do with my
children
i'ma go to instead of that now I
realized that I can create the kind of
life that I want to live like I can
create my dream life progressive to a
fellow but somewhere who couldn't enter
one and the Thai market actually doesn't
go inside all of your life yeah so now
I'm trying to share it with other people
to the crew bus attendants another guy
ended up yeah or something it's an
excellent choice thank you very much
icing for your growth they like to eat
bright shiny energy you can receive that
energy to your heart's content don't be
afraid anymore
huge huge piece are surrounding your
body and it will protect you forever so
this energy that came to me now it's
coming to you and then please share this
energy with the people for ya
okay thank you receiving that blessing
was such an amazing and special
experience it's something that I hope
definitely remember for our lifetime for
some reason the line that stuck out to
me most was don't be afraid anymore
after the event I felt so much more
powerful and confident in myself I felt
an energy in me and I believe more now
that I can create whatever I want in
life after our meeting we drove out to
Sedona for the solar body event the
first Linda had to take us to try the
best sandwich ever the best sandwich
ever according to Linda passion life
this is life loving it the event was to
introduce the solar body to the
community so the speakers were a doctor
and an author whose lives were
transformed by the solar body method it
was all very touching then ill Julie
came up to speak as well
he played his favorite song for us and
started dancing which I thought was
pretty fun afterwards he said something
along the lines of I was not dancing I
was just moving my body if we call it
dancing then there's a pressure involved
but dancing really is just movement and
singing is just talking so let's not put
so many labels on everything and just be
after the event I got to go hiking at
the famous Cathedral Rock in Sedona this
place was so beautiful grand and
majestic and I just felt so small
overall I had an amazing weekend
