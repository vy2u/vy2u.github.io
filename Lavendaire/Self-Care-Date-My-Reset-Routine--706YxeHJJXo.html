things and I start feeling overwhelmed
cluttered and messy in my mind in my
life and my space so it's times like
these where I realize I need to take a
step back and reset my life so this
happened recently and I just cleared my
schedule for the day and gave myself a
self-care date the first thing I did was
to start journaling so I normally try to
write morning pages one two or three
pages in the morning but sometimes I
forget to write it for too long that all
of these thoughts just get clustered in
my head and I'm like I need to get it
all down so I won't give myself a limit
I'll just write as much as I need to
feel okay next I set a timer to meditate
so meditation is one of those things
that I wish I would do every day but I'm
still not quite there yet I know it's
really good for me but you know I just
forget or just don't feel like it but
it's a proven method for centering
yourself and feeling more at peace and
calm so it's absolutely necessary for a
self-care date next I decided to tidy up
my space because it's gotten quite messy
this is like a luggage from a weekend
trip I took a couple weekends ago and I
still didn't fully unpack so I told
myself I just got to get it done let's
do it right now I'm sure a lot of you
know that having a clear space will help
give you a clearer mind and it's so true
so I noticed that whenever I get really
cluttered in my life I feel overwhelmed
and really busy I notice my space is a
mess and once I start cleaning up my
space then I'll feel more clear in life
and it just really helps boost my mood
and helps me feel ready to tackle on
whatever I need to get done after that I
decided to fold all of my laundry which
has been done for like a couple weeks
I'm one of those people that just likes
to keep my clothes in a pile and hang it
up or fold it when I absolutely need to
so I took the time today to make things
right to put all my clothes back in
their homes back in their space and just
literally reset
my space to zero next I tackled my
vanity area so whenever I do makeup I
kind of leave a mess on the table and I
just leave the things that I use
everyday on the table because I'm lazy
to put them away and take them out again
but today I decided that I'm going to
tidy this place up and I'm going to do
it right so here I am going through all
of my makeup I even like decluttered
some that I haven't used in a long time
and yeah next I decided to go through my
closet and declutter some low self-worth
outfits so any clothes that don't make
me feel amazing vibrant beautiful joyful
I took them out and put them in a bag
for me to donate later I noticed there
were a couple of dresses that were
really grey and bland that don't really
fit my personality anymore they were
pretty boring and whenever I put on
these clothes it was because I was
trying to hide something or just blend
in with the crowd and not feel very
confident in myself so it was those
types of outfits that I decided to
release from my closet and donate after
that I went to get some much-needed
exercise I went running in my
neighborhood and I went with my mom
actually which was the first time that I
made her run outside with me so that was
pretty fun after a good run of course
you got a shower then in the evening I
lit a candle and I played a very
soothing playlist called piano in the
background I'm loving this playlist
right now then I decided to do some
light works just edit some videos that I
was going to use for my website I just
want to remind you how important it is
to make time for self-care in your life
because sometimes we can just overwork
ourselves or just spread ourselves too
thin when we really just need to give
back to ourselves but you have to give
yourself the love time compassion and
energy that you need in order to be your
best self good luck guys love you all
and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
