tap into your creativity and spark
inspiration a tool for nurturing your
creative soul called the artist date the
artist date is one of two basic tools in
the book the artists way by Julia
Cameron the other tool is mourning pages
which I've already shared about on my
channel multiple times in a nutshell the
artist dates is a weekly solo date to
explore something that interests you
spending quality time with yourself to
nurture and fill your creative soul I'd
like to thank Cannon for sponsoring this
video and for creating amazing products
that allow us to be creative express
ourselves and share our gifts with the
world I honestly wouldn't be here
without them
for my artist date today I decided to
explore my new neighborhood and capture
whatever inspires me I just parked on a
random Street and started roaming around
freely I brought my new Canon EOS m100
which is great for travel because it's
so portable and lightweight the EOS m
100 is a mirrorless camera that takes
beautiful images thanks to its fast
autofocus an advanced image sensor and
an intuitive interface it also has the
tilt type LCD screen that rotates 180
degrees perfect for vlogging and selfies
there's also a fun feature called
creative assist which allows you to
customize the look and feel of your
shots check out the link in the
description below to learn more about
the Canon EOS m 100
the author Julia Cameron describes the
artist date like this artist dates fire
up the imagination they spark whimsy
they encourage play since art is about
the play of ideas they feed our creative
work by replenishing our inner well of
images and inspiration when choosing an
artist date it's good to ask yourself
what sounds fun and then allow yourself
to try it after exploring the city I
went to a nearby garden to relax with
nature I find myself more inspired by
plants and flowers lately and it was all
I felt like capturing today it was also
really fun to test out the camera in the
setting because to be honest I felt more
at peace here because there were less
people around less eyes judging me while
I film so I felt like I could take my
time here and just be more creative
finally I found a cute quiet spot to sit
down and journal
I love journaling anywhere in parks at
the beach in airports anywhere where I'm
alone basically it's just so nice to sit
down and share my thoughts of the moment
to just be present and document that
feeling of peace
I also took this time to review my 2018
goals in my artist of life workbook just
reminding myself of everything I want to
create with my life this year I also
took time to check out my bucket list
and cross off anything that I've done so
far
and of course I wanted to document this
moment on this cute bench with a selfie
I loved that I could send photos from my
camera to my phone via Wi-Fi
this feature is a must for me I use it
all the time
I hope you'll take this as a sign to
start giving back to yourself carve out
that one to two hours a week to take
yourself out on an artist date and
nurture your creative soul do something
for yourself just for fun let yourself
play now I'm curious what would you do
for your artist date share in the
comments below because I'd love to hear
your ideas make sure you subscribe for
more videos like this love you all so
much and I'll see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
