how can we love ourselves better I was
having this conversation with a really
good friend of mine recently and she
asked me what the self love looked like
to you I thought about it and generally
it boils down to these three things so
first of all to love yourself fully is
to accept and embrace yourself for
everything that you are including your
strengths your weaknesses your flaws
everything you have to love yourself at
your best and love yourself even at your
worst it's about just embracing who you
are and owning it and not wanting to be
anyone else or have a different life
because you should love and accept your
life love is unconditional so whatever
happens you still have to love yourself
number two is to learn to forgive and
this comes in two parts the first part
is you have to learn to forgive yourself
this means not being so hard on yourself
if you ever make a mistake or you mess
up don't dwell on it just acknowledge it
learn from it and move on the second
part of forgiveness is to learn to
forgive others who have hurt you even if
they haven't apologized or even if they
don't deserve it this is hard and it's
tricky but if you can do it then it's
extremely powerful if when you have an
argument with someone or you have a
grudge or there's some sort of unsettled
situation that occupies space in your
mind and there's just this negative
energy where you're always hurting
because you haven't gotten over that
situation so you want to learn to
forgive others not necessarily because
they deserve it but because you love
yourself too much to let yourself keep
hurting over that situation it doesn't
have to be a verbal connection you don't
have to tell them that you've forgiven
them it's more for yourself that you
forgiving this person and let go of the
situation just so that you can have
inner peace because forgiving yourself
and forgiving others is
learning to treat yourself well and it's
loving yourself because you don't want
to keep hurting over anything that's
happened in the past number three is to
take the time to really listen to
yourself and do what's best for you in
loving yourself you have to really know
yourself and through that you can do
what's best so I do this through writing
writing is my way of talking to myself I
have a bunch of journals and I do stream
of consciousness writing which means I
just write whatever flows out of me
whatever is off the top of my mind and I
keep going and I keep writing writing
writing until the voice inside of me
comes out it takes a while to peel off
the layers of what's on the surface you
know on the surface we think about our
daily life and the things that we have
to do but if you keep listening to
yourself and keep digging then you start
to find the most honest core of yourself
and the voice that is truly you so
that's how I get to know myself and I
listen to what I am really feeling and
what I really want through that I try to
take action and do things that
complement what I truly want and what's
best for me so those are my three
criteria for self love and how to love
yourself better I'd love to know what
you guys think
self love looks like to you please leave
a message in the comments and don't
forget to subscribe share and like this
video I'll be back with another one but
in the meantime try to love yourself a
little more bye
you
