Welcome back to Lavendaire, 
and happy Valentine's Day.
Sending you lots of love.
Today I want to share some self love journaling
prompts that you can do today
to just cultivate more self love for yourself,
so I'll just get right into it.
The first is an easy one that's actually in
my Artist of Life Workbook,
is to list ten things that you love about yourself.
So this one's pretty simple.
I know it can be hard for some people who have never really thought of themselves like that.
So if it's hard for you to find things that
you love about yourself,
why don't you start off with things that you like?
Like what personality traits that you like about yourself.
Or you could ask some friends 
what they think your best qualities are,
and then start from there.
The next journaling prompt is to take some time to sit down and write a love letter to yourself.
Now, I know I've shared that one before because
I love it so much.
But the fun hook is: You can do it 
on this website called FutureMe,
where you send that love letter to yourself
for next year's Valentine's Day, you know what I mean?
So as you're writing this love letter and
celebrating everything that you are,
you're going to feel amazing as you're writing it.
You're gonna feel the love start cultivating for yourself.
But at the same time, the fun part is that
because you're sending it back to yourself
a year later for next year's Valentine's Day,
then you're gonna get a little surprise in a year.
And maybe you can do this every year so that you send yourself a love letter every year for Valentine's Day
because duh, self love is super important
and you can never have too much of it.
Alright, the next journaling prompt is something
that I learned from my friend, Kajal Pandey,
this past Sunday actually.
We did a live chat together on Facebook.
If you want to watch that full live chat,
it's really amazing.
I'll link it down below so that you can watch the chat.
Also, follow my Facebook page because I'm gonna do more live chats and just post more videos on Facebook.
Anyway, this prompt is to list all the things
that you don't exactly like about yourself.
List all those traits that you find yourself
either worrying about or complaining about.
Anything that just doesn't sit well with yourself,
list those traits and then add 
&amp;quot;â€¦but I love myself anyway&amp;quot; at the end.
So for example: &amp;quot;I feel lazy and unmotivated
today, but I love myself anyway,&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;I don't always feel pretty or confident
when I'm in a social setting, but I love myself anyway,&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;I think that I talk too much, but I love
myself anyway.&amp;quot;
Do you see what we're doing here?
So you're taking a trait that is kind of seen
as negative in your head,
those traits that you're usually like,
&amp;quot;Ugh, why am I like this?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I don't like
this part about me.&amp;quot;
Basically the traits where you're being judgmental
on yourself or hard on yourself,
because that's what we do all the time.
And then just listing it out, being honest about it,
and then end it with, &amp;quot;â€¦but I love myself anyway.&amp;quot;
So this is a great way to learn to love all that you are,
the good parts and the bad parts, or the strengths
and the weaknesses, because love is unconditional.
Love encompasses all.
I know we started out with the things that
you do love about yourself,
and this is another way to kind of be honest
about the things that you don't necessarily
like about yourself,
and yet you love yourself anyway.
Because nobody is perfect.
If you think about the people that you love
in your life, they're not perfect.
They have flaws.
They have times that they make mistakes.
And yet, you love them anyway.
So learn to treat yourself in that way.
Yes, I might not like this characteristic
about myself.
Or I might feel this way that doesn't support
me, but I love myself anyway.
So it's just learning to be unconditional
with your love.
It's so great, right?
Like I said, if you want to watch that full
video with Kajal,
I'll link that video down below so you could catch up.
Next, I'm going to share some journaling prompts
that you can actually ask yourself
every day in the morning, just to get yourself
off on the right foot,
because every day you want to be listening
to yourself and doing what serves you best.
So at the beginning of every day, you can
always ask yourself questions like
&amp;quot;What am I excited to do today?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;How can I give myself that extra care today?&amp;quot;
Because I'm all about self care, guys.
And lastly, &amp;quot;What can I do to protect my energy?&amp;quot;
And I love that last question.
I actually have that question in my workbook too
because it's being aware of how you can protect
your energy in a way that
you're not allowing toxic people in your life.
Or you're not just saying yes to people
just because you're a people-pleaser, you know?
A lot of times, for me personally, it's hard to say no.
But in order to protect my energy and my well-being,
I have to learn to say no more often
so that I don't find myself in those awkward
situations
where I'm doing something that I don't want to be doing,
but I said yes so I have to do it.
And it just doesn't feel good.
You don't want to put yourself in those situations.
But yeah, I think that's a pretty good start
on journaling prompts
that you can do today 
to cultivate more self love in your life.
Also, as you're checking out that live chat
video on my Facebook,
just go ahead and like my Facebook page 
while you're at it,
because I'm going to be doing more live chats 
here and there,
and I'm just trying to post more videos on
Facebook and be more active there.
Alright, I hope you have a beautiful Valentine's Day.
I will see you guys in the next one.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
