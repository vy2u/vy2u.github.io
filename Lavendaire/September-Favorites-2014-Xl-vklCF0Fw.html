fun to do a September favorites video
where I talk about some of my favorite
things from this past month because I've
had quite a few things so I'm gonna
cover a beauty fashion lifestyle books
music mobile apps just so you can get a
taste of my tastes and things so the
first one is literally my favorite
beauty find of the year so far because
it's made that big of an impact on my
face so it's actually this unique 3d
fiber lash mascara I heard about it
through a friend because she said it
changed her life and so I ordered it and
it is changing my life or my face at
least so it comes in this box that looks
like an eyeglass case and it has these
two tubes in it one is gel and one is
natural fibers and these fibers are made
of green tea so you put the gel on your
lashes then you put the fibers and
they're like micro fibers that look like
many pieces of hair and what they do is
they add so much volume and they
literally extend off of your lashes so
that you can almost double the length of
your lashes it's kind of crazy so you
put the gel and then you for the fiber
that you put the gel on it again to kind
of make it harden and look like a lash
and I don't think I'll be buying regular
mascara any time soon because this is
super awesome so I highly recommend it
I'll put the link in the description box
I got it from my friend's friend because
she recommended it to me
so thanks Jessica and thanks Judy um
anyway so number two of my September
favorites is the Nike Training Club app
I don't know if it's for Android but
definitely if you have an iPhone and you
are into working out or looking at it
working out more then I highly recommend
getting it because it's just so easy has
like programs for you where you can
choose depending
on your level beginner intermediate
advanced and you know you can also
choose what you want to do get lean gets
home and get strong and it's very easy
because I don't have to think about
anything
the app is literally like a personal
trainer and it tells you exactly what to
do so say there's a 30-minute program
it'll have like do push-ups for one
minute lunges for another minute jump
for this minute and there's this woman
talking to you and pep-talking you she's
like don't stop don't give up and it's
freaking awesome because I love
exercising with a teacher you know I
love going to group classes where you do
yoga or Zumba where somebody's telling
you what to do because me by myself if
I'm at the gym I don't really know what
to do I just I mean I only know how to
go on the treadmill elliptical I you
know you could kind of do some weight
but I don't know I like to have a
program where it tells me exactly what I
need to do every day and it just makes
it a lot easier for me I don't have to
think oh what should I do next what
should i do today so I absolutely love
it it's changed the way that I work out
and I can do it at home so highly
recommend that so next up are my
favorite fashion finds of this month the
first one is this white top from Toby
and it's a crop top and I love it
because it has mesh on the shoulders and
sleeves and it looks super cool and
modern and sleek it's one of the tops
that I wore for my photoshoot for lab
and air you can watch the behind the
scenes of that photoshoot right here
I'll put a link on the screen and I also
love the long lace cardigan that I wore
to that photo shoot as well so that's my
second favorite fashion find of the
month so that one is from forever 21 you
could probably find it in the store or
online I'll put the link in the
description box so next up is my
favorite book that I'm reading at the
moment I'm reading steel like an artist
by
Austin Kleon and I'm halfway through
it's a super-sharp book it's just very
straight to the point he has really fun
graphics so as an artist as a creative
or just I I feel like it applies to
everybody these really easy lessons I'm
probably gonna blog about some of the
things I learned in that book but that's
what I'm reading right now and finally
my favorite music fine of the month is
Toki monstas new album desiderio I don't
know if that's how you pronounce it does
it darien but it's amazing i am a huge
fan of toki monster she's a producer and
she is freaking awesome I went to her
show a couple weeks ago and she was just
rocking out with her Ableton and just
like Bam Bam she was so cool and she is
the queen she's like my queen basically
so check that out I'll put that link in
the description so that's it for this
month September favorites video I hoped
you guys liked what I recommended if not
it's totally cool I'll be back with a
new video on Wednesday it's gonna be my
creative analog day vlog of where I hang
out with my friend and we just use
traditional old-school materials without
technology to plan and be creative don't
forget to subscribe I'll have new videos
every Wednesday and those will be the
Lavender inspirational sharing knowledge
type videos and on Mondays I'm gonna try
to do more fun videos on things that I
like so yeah see you guys soon talk to
