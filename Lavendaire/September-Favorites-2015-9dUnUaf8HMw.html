favorites video it's fall already but it
does not feel like fall here in
California honestly I don't know why
everyone is so in love with fall I love
summer and I'm sad that summers going
but everyone's getting all excited for
wearing sweaters and having pumpkin
flavored everything so I'm just gonna
jump into my favorites for this month I
have one favorite product this month and
it's the anastasia dipbrow pomade I
previously was using the Anastasia brow
pencil and oh man after trying this
pomade I liked it so much more because
it's so smooth it glides on with that
brush so well and I like that you can
blend it and make it lighter in some
areas darker in other areas I feel like
this pomade and fresh combo really gives
you more artistic control over what
you're painting on your face on your
brows so I enjoy that a lot more than a
pencil
my next favorite of the month is the
marie forleo interview with elizabeth
Gilbert's on her book big magic so if
you guys saw my last video you already
know that I got super excited over the
big magic book and the magic lessons
podcast by Elizabeth Gilbert's well now
that I'm over halfway through with the
big magic book I can say that the marie
forleo interview really covers like 80%
of the book I think because I saw the
interview before reading the book I felt
like the book wasn't as magical because
I kind of already heard this and I heard
that and the book was kind of just
giving me a review and going more in
depth with what they said in the
interview so if you guys are not
planning to read the book then I highly
recommend that you watch the marie
forleo interview carve out that one hour
of time because it'll be so inspiring
for your creativity and your life but if
you are planning to read the book then
maybe not watch the interview I don't
know I'm not sure because I already
watched the interview before reading the
book and now I can't go back all right
next up are my favorites in music this
month it is fall so I have a new fall
2015 playlist on Spotify that you guys
can follow I'll put the link below my
first favorite in music
is Gavin Tareq's album you're invited
produced by toki monsta i am such a huge
fan of toki she has such a distinct and
cool style so her production style mixed
with Gavin's soulful vocals is such a
great combo it gets me so inspired and
so excited and honestly like that female
power duo I look up to both of them so
much next up I found myself going back
to listening to CEA's album a thousand
forms of fear I've heard this album
before but I wanted to go back because
SIA is such a good songwriter and I
wanted to go back and really listen to
her lyrics and listen to her music so
there's a deluxe version of her album on
Spotify and the piano version of
chandelier came up and I don't know why
but I had not heard this version before
when I heard it I was like oh my
goodness I just see it as so raw she's a
true artist and her voice is
surprisingly powerful I think normally
her songs have like epic productions so
it kind of like matches the power of her
voice but when it's stripped down and
you hear just her voice it's amazing I
think she's so cool so I was driving in
the car listening to this album and when
her first chorus hits in that chandelier
piano version I was like like I made
that face to myself because like it was
so it was so much it was so much and I
was like oh my goodness she did it she
went there so that was really exciting
and I've been listening to that on
repeat it's so good and also churches
came out with a new album called every
open eye so I'm super excited for that
because I just love churches period
right now my favorite song off the album
is clearest blue but I think I need to
listen to the album a few more times to
maybe find some new favorites in there
so yeah you guys can follow my fall 2015
playlist I'll be continually adding new
music on that playlist throughout this
whole season alright those are my
favorites for the month a little bit of
an update obviously you can tell that
I've been really into music this month
because I've been spending more time
writing and producing music and I'm
gonna start recording pretty soon just
for myself just to create and I want
get on a consistent schedule with music
also next month I'm gonna be traveling
to Japan for a couple of weeks with
family so if any of you guys are from
Japan or you know the good places to go
let me know give me some suggestions and
some tips for travel I'm gonna be going
to Tokyo Kyoto Osaka and a weekend in
Takayama so I'm super excited for that
trip because of that plus music I'm
probably gonna be very busy next month
but life is good I'm excited
good things are happening and yeah
alright that's it for this video thank
you so much for watching I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
