lavender today I'm gonna talk about my
September favorites and before I go into
it yes my hair is a different color it's
a little bit more blue than the last
time you saw me I actually got really
inspired to do like a silvery teal color
but I don't have green I just have blue
so I thought that it would you know work
out but it did and it came out more blue
than I thought it's totally fine this is
why I don't make videos on how to do
hair color because it really is just
like an experiment and an art project
and whatever happens happens I don't
really try too hard I don't like to be
too perfect about it anyway let's talk
about September I do want to make a
quick shout-out to myself I do want to
highlight basically the videos that I
did last week which were the first
episodes to my artist of life series if
you guys haven't seen it yet I basically
interviewed my photographer friend Karen
she is super awesome such a cool chick
so inspiring and we talked about her
journey to becoming a fashion
photographer and it's just really good
stuff I worked so hard on those two
videos please watch them and if you like
them please share them because I
literally spent like so much of my heart
and soul into this series and there's
gonna be many more episodes where I'm
gonna interview different inspiring
people that I know personally and just
hopefully in the future people that I
meet honestly the series has been
something I've been dreaming up for like
over a year I was just like too scared
to go forth to actually create it but I
got over those fears and I put this huge
project together I worked with a team
where I had like videographers and
someone to audio and I mean the whole
shebang
it's basically content on another level
just higher quality a larger production
that
normally comfortable with and I'm so
proud of it so watch it and yeah so this
past month was cool because I took some
time to try out some new things that I
thought would be fun so first off I got
class pass for a month and through class
pass I took a sunset paddleboard yoga
class where we swam out to the ocean on
a paddleboard and did yoga and it was
like a windy day in Newport Beach and we
were like you know the paddleboard is
moving and you're trying to hold a yoga
pose it was quite challenging but more
so it was like terrifying because I just
was scared to like fall off the board
into the water even though that's not
like life or death I was just like
scared it got me on my toes but it was a
very fun and exciting a beautiful
experience especially at the end when
you're doing shavasana you're like
laying down and the paddle board is like
just lightly waiting on the ocean and
just all around you is you see just
water such a great experience so that
was really cool and then another class
that I did through class pass was aerial
silks and I went with my cousin Donna
and aerial silks is there something that
I've been wanting to try for a long time
just because it looks so pretty but when
I went to the class I realized how much
upper body strength you need to do that
kind of activity and I am so weak on my
upper body and it was quite a challenge
and but it was really fun and I think
when you try new things like this that
are pretty challenging and just
different than what you're normally used
to it's like really rewarding to be able
to do something new like just learning
the simple new moves like how to climb
up the fabric or how to twist yourself
into different poses was really like
once I did it I was like wow I did that
it took me like you know the lesson was
only an hour and I think we learned like
three or four different tricks with the
aerial silks and I felt like in an hour
that's like a lot of new things that you
can learn so that just inspired me
like try more new things like this
because you can really learn a lot in
the short amount of time another fun
activity I did this month that was not
part of class past but just with my
cousin we went to a studio to take swing
dancing lessons so I love dancing but
I've never taken classes for like
partner dancing couple dancing I've
always done like solo stuff like hip hop
or jazz or modern but yeah just taking a
swing dance class was something I've
always wanted to do and I we stayed
there after the swing dance class and we
watched other people take classes and
then there was like a free tango class
Argentinian tango so I learned swing
dance and Argentinian tango basics in
one night and it was just like a fun
time I love to dance and I love to
explore all these other types of dance
and I think I don't know I just love it
it makes me happy to move my body in
that way so if you guys are interested
in trying like active classes and yeah I
recommend trying class pass for a month
they have like a deal where it's like 19
dollars for a month you can take five
classes and that's really really cheap
considering like one class to go to like
paddle board yoga might be twenty bucks
another favorite experience that I had
this past month is I had the opportunity
to speak on a panel at this marketing
conference that was held in Microsoft in
LA and that was something that was
totally outside of my comfort zone but I
like pushed myself to do it because I
knew that it would help me grow and even
though I was like really terrified of
going up there to speak on a panel with
all these like corporate marketing
digital social media people I feel like
the fact that I did it really helped me
grow and it helped me become more
confident and just like I met a lot of
people and helped me in so many ways so
I made a podcast episode specifically on
this experience and also on like the
other little ways that I pushed myself
outside of my comfort zone this past
month if you guys want to listen to that
episode I'll put the link in the
description below but it's basically
episode 19 growth happens outside of
your comfort zone
and for those of you who have no idea
like I have a podcast it's called the
lab into your lifestyle so it's on
iTunes or you can listen to it on my
blog or on soundcloud everything will be
in the info box next up my favorite book
that I read this past month is called
nobody wants to read your shit's by
Steven Pressfield I am a huge fan of
Steven Pressfield he wrote a couple of
my favorite books the first one was the
war of arts and another one is turning
pro and both of those are like the Bible
for creative people like myself I feel
like if you're an artist or you you're
pursuing a creative path you have to
check out those two books and also this
new book that he came out with nobody
wants to read your is about writing
and it's very concise he's a very like
straight talker Steven Pressfield has
worked in so many industries as a writer
he's written novels he's written
nonfiction Hollywood scripts advertising
copywriting so he's understood writing
in all these different industries and
his book is just about how to write in a
way where people want to read your
because the truth is nobody wants to
read your you have to make it easy
for people to digest your information
and it's all about you know how to craft
a good story because people don't
realize for movies or novels it's so
important to understand how to craft
like a story arc and understand that you
have to put all these certain pieces
into it to make a story feel right and
it's not necessarily a formula but it's
like kind of a guideline so I think for
me I'm always like fascinated on how to
improve my work how to improve my craft
in making videos and writing and also
like my upcoming huge project that I'm
planning to like dive into is to write
my first book so as I'm like starting to
write that book I am so happy that I
read this book at a great time because
it really gave like a foundation for
what I need to be considering as I'm
writing my book next up I have a ton of
favorites in music because it's fall and
I started a completely new playlist my
fall 2016 playlist is on Spotify you can
follow it in the description below I
realized that I never made my summer
playlist public and I just like made it
public now so I went through a whole
season without publishing that playlist
anyway my fall playlist is up and it's
like a different vibe than my previous
playlist because I just put more like
R&amp;amp;B and soul like Frank Ocean chance the
rapper and I mean I have a lot of
favorite artists that came out with new
music on that playlist so like Banks
came out with a new album there's new
music by the weekend
Louis the child and chainsmokers have a
new song but for now I'm gonna share
just three of my absolute favorite songs
of the moment
the first one is alunageorge not above
love I love alunageorge ever since like
2012 ish like before they even came out
with their album I just like I saw them
twice at Coachella like she is the best
I love them so much and I just love to
hear how their sound has evolved and I
always thought that their their kind of
pop is the kind of pop that should be on
the radio and yeah they did have a few
hits on the radios but only remixes like
the DJ snake remix and like their
collaborations with the zoo but I feel
like this song just makes me so happy
you guys listen to it it's like the beat
is just so fun and it just makes you
want to bounce and like I just hope that
this album is where their singles will
actually get on the radio because I
think they deserve that my next favorite
is a song lifted by CL and for those of
you who don't know who CL is she is a
Korean rapper she's a badass chick and
I'm so happy that she's debuting in the
American markets basically CL is in the
right hands I mean her manager Scooter
Braun who does Justin Bieber ariana
grande Carly Rae Jepsen so she's just
about to make waves and it just makes me
so excited not only cuz I think the song
is so great the song is fun though beats
good you want to do
to it you just want you feel so powerful
listening to it but it's just the fact
that I'm just so proud as an
asian-american that we have more Asian
faces in mainstream media especially in
music where we don't really have too
many of those and even though CL is not
asian-american like she's from Korea I
still think it will do great things cuz
she is like so strong and it will help
defy those old stereotypes of like
submissive Asian females you know I feel
like that stigma is still out there and
I feel like the more like bold creative
badass chicks that we have out there
it's like girl power and I've always
been like a fan of Spice Girls since I
was young I grew up with girl power so
this has agent girl power written all
over it
some CL lifted and my third favorite
song that's been on repeat is on the
softer side it's called ten goodbyes by
Tim Atlas and I stumbled upon him atlas
because I was like watching The Voice
videos and I saw Tim's face and I was
like I know in that face so Tim was
actually like someone that I watched on
YouTube because he was in a band called
April chase and he dated another
youtuber that I used to love and I mean
he still loved her
Jenny sook so yeah it's just funny
because it's like he was a face that I
always saw I never really listened to
his music per se but I noticed that I
saw a familiar face on the voice so I
decided to look him up on Spotify and he
has like a new album he has some great
songs but ten goodbyes specifically when
I first heard it I was like this guy
knows what he's doing he understands
music and his sound in this song is more
like a Jason Mraz a young Jason Mraz and
it's really the melody that got me I
love when a guy can go from like the
chest voice of the head voice and it's
just like really pretty the way that
melody has like such a wide range so
it's a pretty song really fun to sing to
check it out if you want something like
nice and acoustic sounding and there it
is that's all I have for my September
favorites video
no physical products to show you guys
this month because even though I did try
some new things nothing was like a
favorite you know as usual it's the
music and the content that inspires me
the most they always end up on my
favorites but yeah let me know what you
guys have liked this past month I'd love
to know your favorites if you have liked
recommendations for books and movies and
music send them my way I will see you
guys next time thanks so much for
watching love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
