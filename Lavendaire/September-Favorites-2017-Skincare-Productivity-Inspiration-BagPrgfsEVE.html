it's Eileen today I'm gonna share some
favorites from the month of September so
this month was a little bit better than
last month I felt like last month was a
struggle this month was eventful and fun
and just trying to get the momentum
going I have been hibernating a little
bit more on social media cuz I've been
working on the next year's artist of
life workbook something cool I got to do
this month was speak in Inglewood at an
event organized by femme scholar so
femme scholar is a nonprofit dedicated
to empowering young women to achieve
success through education and it focuses
on young women in the community so I got
to speak with a lot of seniors in high
school from Inglewood and just like you
know sharing tips and advice on school
and how to organize your life honestly I
felt really honored to be there I was
really inspired by the women there
because it wasn't just me there were
other like mentors there and there's
something special about like women
supporting women women empowering each
other coming together and feeling for
each other even though we come from
different backgrounds so that was pretty
cool moving on my first favorite of the
month is in a similar vein it's
something online that you guys should
all definitely check out it's called
time first women who are changing the
world so it's just a bunch of features
and interviews and just content on women
who are badass who are succeeding in
life doing something really cool
changing the world and I love that a
features women in all different areas
there's women in the arts in science in
sports in business and I think it's just
so incredibly inspiring if you are a
woman who wants to do something with
your life or do something in the world
definitely check out this website go
through all the interviews you don't
have to read them all I didn't read
through them all I only watch like the
videos and I picked like the people that
I was curious about but I also was
really pleasantly surprised to read
about people that I've never heard about
like astronauts or oceanographers and
racecar drivers so it was just so cool
and I just reminded me that women are so
cool
we are so
badass we are strong we are smart we are
capable we are so multifaceted
multi-talented and we each have our own
unique gifts that we should use or share
with the world in some way and you know
it all comes down to like figuring out
what your strengths and your gifts are
and what you can do in the world and
then doing that to the best of your
ability so I was just super inspired
reading this you guys will definitely
definitely love it and I'm so so so
happy that time is posting more
collections like this I mean I always
follow those like 30 under 30 or times
100 most influential people like I love
those lists because I aspire to be in
the same world as those people and I
don't know I I love it it's just so much
fuel for my dreams my next favorite is
this coconut water face toner that I
found on thrive market for six dollars
like that is so cheap for toner and I
even bought another toner but I like
this one more because of its spray the
spray just miss your face in such fine
liquid particles like the particles are
so tiny it's not like it doesn't splash
on your face it literally is like the
perfect mist that's the reason why I
like this toner because like I don't
have to you know put the toner on a
cotton pad or on my hand and do this I
feel like you know the water drips
around I like to put on toner
I mean first I'll do it with a cotton
pad but I second or third or more times
I'll use my hands so with this I will
just spray it on my face Pat it in spray
it on my face Pat it in and the reason
I'm doing multiple layers of toner is
another recent discovery the lady who
does my nails is also in beauty and
makeup and she gives seminars on
skincare and she told me that she puts
on over five layers of toner every time
and me personally before I would just
swipe on one layer of toner and then
I'll go on with essence and serum and
all the other stuff and she's like no
your skin needs to drink your skin needs
to like drink the water
so she just does multiple layers and so
I
to do that and I love it it makes a
difference it does take considerably
more amount of time but I mean I have
fun doing skincare so I have fun like
spraying patting spraying patting it's
really fun for me
I also looked it up on Google and I
found out it's a real thing like in
Korean Beauty they do pack on layers and
layers of toner and essence which are
the more watery products so this entire
time whenever I saw a headline like
Korean nine-step skincare routine or
nine step this seven step this 15 step
this I thought it was because they had
nine different products because Koreans
do have a lot of different products and
it could go up to like seven to ten
layers but I realized that part of the
steps is repeating the same toner for
five or more layers yeah okay anyway and
since I mentioned my nail lady like
honestly these nails are my favorite I
feel like every time I got new nails I
mentioned them as my favorite so it
might get old for you guys but this is a
new style and I'm really enjoying it
it's super cute and I feel like I could
grow them out and they will still look
good I like to grow my nails out for
like five weeks four to four to six
weeks the last time I went to do it I
had them grown out for six weeks and
they were so long but I'm just kind of
lazy going back to the nail place it's a
commitment but I think it's worth it my
next favorite is an app called Trello so
Trello is an organization and
productivity app where you can organize
your two dues organize your projects
organize different areas of your life
you can really do a lot with it because
of its like flexible interface so there
are cards that you can organize so I
like having a list of things but I also
like rearranging that list constantly
you can create labels and color
coordinating you can sort things by
their due date and I personally love
using it because I'm using it to
organize my work book project to do's
and also I've created another board for
like content ideas so for a long time
I've been like using Google Docs and
Google Spreadsheets to organize my con
and ideas but Google sheets can get
really messy plus it's hard to like move
things around it's hard to write notes
where you want them attached links and
attached images where you want them so
with Trello I find that there's more
flexibility in doing things like this
and also Trello is great for like
collaborating with other people so if
you work on a team it'd be really
helpful to like have a shared Trello
board together honestly there are so
many different ways you can use Trello
I've seen people use it for meal
planning for planning a remodel of their
home job hunting and just any creative
projects like if you're working on a
film there are different like parts that
you have to constantly be in touch with
lastly I'm gonna like repeat my favorite
from last month is Kevin Hart's
audiobook I can't make this up life
lessons I mentioned it last month
because I just started listening to it
well this month I finished listening to
the entire book and I can wholeheartedly
1000% recommend listening to this
audiobook because one you will laugh you
will laugh so much and you will learn so
much Kevin Hart is inspiring he's
hardworking he gives a lot of like words
of wisdom and he like you know pairs it
with like his realness with his comedy
and he's not afraid to be so vulnerable
but that he shows the bad parts of
himself the parts that like I know
everyone listening will probably judge
him a little bit because he shares his
flaws he shares his mistakes he shares
everything he shares the good he shares
the bad he shares like the most wise
inspirational parts of himself but he
also shares like the worst parts of
himself the parts where he like hates
himself for and it's not something that
a lot of people are comfortable sharing
and so he is definitely like doing
something really refreshing with this
audiobook after listening to it you'll
fully see the journey of a man who had
nothing who grew up in this place and
ended up all the way up here and just
the ups and downs that came along the
way because even when he's successful
nothing's perfect he has a lot of issues
and a lot of product problems that he
years so it's fascinating I think it
just gives you a whole view of a human
being that nobody is perfect nobody's
life is perfect but at the same time you
can still live a life that's full and
inspiring and still like on the move
like at the end of this book like he
said like I'm not done yet I'm just
getting started
like he wants to create so much more
with his life and do so much more and
listening to that I think at the end of
it the most inspiring part was to
remember to not rest on your laurels
never stop just continue to strive
continue to do better than you were
before don't get too comfortable even if
you've reached success even if you've
made it in the traditional sense there's
still so much more to reach for all
right so that's the first time I've ever
recommended something twice which you
know means it's really really good and
its really worth listening to Plus Kevin
Hart is so relatable that I think the
average person can relate to him alright
that's it for today thanks so much for
watching make sure you subscribe click
that bell if you haven't already love
you all and I'll see you next time
