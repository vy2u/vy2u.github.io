lavender today is another episode in our
back to basics series and today's video
is for anyone out there who is feeling
overwhelmed you have too much on your
plate you need to simplify and
prioritize so this is something that I
try to do as often as possible anytime
that I feel like I have too much going
on I always try to simplify what I have
to do prioritize what I have to do so
that I don't get too overwhelmed so
first I'm going to give some general
tips on how to simplify as prioritize
your time and then I'm going to go
through an exercise that you can do
right here with this video to help you
declutter your to-do list all right so
first tip is you have to decide what's
most important to you we can't do
everything you have to decide what
really matters you have to decide the
things that you want to be the best act
because the things that you want to be
the best that you have to give all of
your time and energy to that you have to
really super focus down in order to do
anything right so it's really hard to do
everything perfectly it's hard to do
like so many different things and do
them well if you want to do something
well you really have to hone in on
either one two or three things next you
have to decide what is not a priority
you have to decide what not to focus on
and yes you're going to have to let some
things go you have to decide what you're
willing to sacrifice what you're willing
to not be so great at which you're
willing to just let go so it's really
helpful to make a not to do list or just
be clutter your to-do list when you
realize that these things are not really
a priority and it really feels so good
to declutter and cross things off and
let yourself off the hook another key
thing to know is that it's always better
to be effective rather than being
efficient and what I mean by this is it
really matters what you're working on
the content of what you're working on
matters it's better to work slowly on
the important things rather than doing
the unimportant things in a really
efficient
fast way so for example if you're a
blogger then it's probably most
important to be actually writing your
blog post because creating that content
is like the meats of what you have to do
and even if you're a little bit slower
in writing the blog post it's still so
much more important to be working on
that rather than being really efficient
and answering emails really quickly or
like tweeting really quickly because
that's just like a side part of what you
really have to do so the content matters
it's better to be effective at what's
important than to be efficient at what's
not important my next tip is learn to
say no so I totally made another video
on this that I'll link right here but
you have to learn to say no to
opportunities that aren't the right fit
for you that aren't really important
that aren't a priority and it's so
important to just cut out the fat I know
it's hard to say no because you want to
be nice you want to help other people
when they ask for it but you have to
just realize that you know if you say no
to something that you're not 100 percent
excited to do then you're not going to
give your best - whatever that is it's
not going to be a positive experience
for both parties because you feel like
you're like I have to do this because
they asked me and I feel obligated and
then to the other person you're not
giving them your best work you're not
putting your best foot forward so it's
not good for both parties so for me like
more and more I realized that I should
only say yes to things if my whole body
is like telling me yes I want to do this
I'm excited to do it otherwise it's okay
to say no and you have to practice
saying no politely and kindly and I
think other people will always
understand okay so it's time for our
simplify and prioritize exercise that
you can do right here with this video
all you need is a pen a piece of paper
or if you want to just open up a notepad
on your computer that works too so I'll
walk you through the instructions let's
go number one write down all of the
goals all the things you want to achieve
or accomplish in the next three months
so pause this video and take the time to
write down everything you want to do in
you
or work lies personal life relationships
everything just think of everything you
can imagine write it down
alright now it's time to decide what is
most important to you out of the huge
list so put a star next to everything
that's important to you everything that
is like a non-negotiable something you
must do something you really want to do
something you really care about remember
it's all about picking your priorities
alright next part is my favorite it's
time to cross off anything that you've
decided is not actually a priority so
maybe you're like okay maybe I don't
need to get this done in the next three
months or maybe this is not as important
as anything else on the list so take
some time to cross off things and
declutter your list remember this
doesn't mean that you're never going to
do this thing it just means that it's
not a priority right now maybe it will
be a priority in the future but not now
so pause those videos start crossing up
doesn't that feel amazing
I always feel like when I'm like okay
I've decided that I don't want to do
this it's not important it just feels so
good to cross things off alright so our
next step is to pick the number one top
priority of this month so out of all the
things you start circle the most
important goal or task to you alright
now that you've decided your most
important goal for the month it's time
to write down the three most important
tasks that you can do to take yourself
closer to this goal alright the last
step is a challenge and the challenge is
to pick one of your most important tasks
and do that right now after this video
do it today or as soon as possible
because this is the baby step that will
take you closer to accomplishing your
most important goal of the month which
is huge so I hope you like today's
exercise this is just a taste of what
it's like to simplify and prioritize so
I hope you get the concept is to just
decide what's important to you what's
your priority cut outs of stuff that's
important and then just fine-tune and
simplify and simplify until you boil it
down to the next baby step that you can
possibly do to take yourself forward
hope that was helpful I love you all let
me know your feedback below if you like
these interactive type videos I'll see
you next time with another back to
basics video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
