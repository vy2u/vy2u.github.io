good luck song because I do and it's a
song that's playing right now it's
called as I lay me down by Sophie B
Hawkins it's a beautiful song it's one
that I've loved since I was a little
girl singing it on karaoke but first of
all what is it good luck song well to me
a good luck song is a song that comes on
randomly and very spontaneously and acts
as a good luck charm it kind of lifts
you up or makes your day a little bit
better and adds like a magical touch I
think I first dubbed this song as my
good luck song when I was in college
driving I think to an interview or
something where I was a little bit
nervous and the song came on on coast
103.5 which is the love song breeding
station in LA and I hadn't heard this
song in years and it was a song that I
sang when I was a little kid and when I
heard it it just brought back a lot of
memories and good feelings and the song
itself is really beautiful it talks
about springtime and birds chirping and
it's really happy and positive and so
all of a sudden I was like ah this is so
beautiful in the world is so good to me
right now and it just felt really good
since the song is from the 90s it's not
a song that plays very often on the
radio or comes on on my shuffle very
often so when it does it's kind of a
special moment I'll probably hear this
song about once every two to four months
so that's when my good luck song hits
the reason why I bring it up is because
this song came on yesterday as I was
driving on the freeway I was kind of in
that zone where I'm not thinking about
anything in my mind it's just blank but
once the song came on it kind of woke me
up and I was like woah my good luck song
and I noticed how beautiful the Sun
looked that afternoon and the mountains
were green and I was like wow the world
is so beautiful right now and I
so happy that song just lifted me up and
made my day a little bit better because
I was aware of the world and aware of
the beauty around me and so add a color
to my day and little things like that I
feel are a blessing and it's like a
little mini good-luck charm so that's my
story now you guys know about my good
luck song you may think it's ridiculous
but whatever it makes me happy and it's
a part of my life that I thought I would
share with you guys I haven't shared
this with anybody except for maybe my
brother so there you go a little bit of
me so let me know if you guys have a
good luck song if you're thinking of
choosing a good luck songs I will pick a
song that means a lot to you and a song
that doesn't play too often on the radio
but sometimes get the little airplay so
that it will come on randomly when
you're out or on your shuffle so that's
it for today I hope you like this idea
of a good luck song and I will see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
