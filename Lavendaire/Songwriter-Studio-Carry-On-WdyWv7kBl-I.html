something new today I'm gonna call this
songwriters studio so I recently wrote
the song called carry on if you haven't
heard it go check out that video on this
channel but I thought it would be fun to
share my thoughts on the song what it
mends where it came from and kind of my
inspirations for the song so before I go
into it if you are the kind of person
that likes to interpret art on its own
and not know the real meaning behind
what the artists want to say like
totally don't watch this video because
it might mess up what you think the song
means to you because I think at first
glance carry-ons might sound like a
breakup song and it's totally not about
that at all it's not about love but yeah
I just want to clear that up so I'm
sorry if you didn't leave yet but there
you go it's not a breakup song what it's
about is the journey in growing and kind
of finding your place getting deeper
into what you're interested in and as
that journey goes on you realize that
you're kind of moving on and leaving
parts of your old life behind
whether it be like your old personality
or your old friends anything I think for
me it started with the feeling of being
lonely because for me a lot of my
closest friends like I have a friend
who's a childhood friend from my
elementary school I'll have friends from
college they're all over the place
they're all of them all over the world
my best friends in London one of my good
friends moved to San Francisco and I
don't know I think as time went on I
kind of disconnected from the people who
were closest to me but the fact that I
continue to change and I continue to
grow that sometimes I don't feel like
the people in my life can understand
those parts of me the parts that are so
important to me the parts that I share
on YouTube about like personal growth
spirituality etc sometimes when you get
into those topics like come on if you
talk about spirituality and Eckhart
Tolle those kind of things too deep it
can sound pretty weird to a lot of
normal people out there I feel like the
more I'm getting into
these topics the more I disconnects from
other people and it's not a bad thing
it's just that I'm in a place where I'm
growing and what I'm doing and I guess I
just haven't found my tribe yet I don't
feel like I found my tribe I was talking
to someone who's a bit older than me and
she's like way further in her career and
I asked her like hey do you have the
same friends as you do when you were in
your 20s and she's like no I have a
completely different set of friends in
my 30s because as I'm growing I kind of
find the people who are going the same
pace as me the people who are interested
in the same things as me etc etc so I'm
just going through that transition phase
where I feel like because I'm growing
and I'm growing in like the specific
direction I'm kind of leaving a lot of
the old life the old me behind so that's
what carry on is about it's about kind
of diving into this weird world this
Wonderland of knowledge or other things
whatever it may be for you but it's just
diving into this weird world and just
learning a lot growing in it and I use
the metaphor Alice in Wonderland I hope
you can hear that from the song because
I used a lot of words from that book or
movie so you know when Alice goes into
Wonderland all these crazy things happen
she goes through all these adventures
and when she comes out she's not the
same he's like you can't go back to the
same person that you used to be after
you've seen all of those crazy things
it's like kind of once you open your
mind and you dive deep into these topics
or whatever it may be you're just
changed and it's not necessarily a bad
thing
so now let's jump into the lyric so you
guys can open up the description box and
read the lyrics with me so let's start
deep inside the quiet times you open up
my mind so I started writing that just
because I was at home by myself I was
feeling kind of lonely it was really
quiet and I didn't feel like I had
anyone to really call or talk to you and
I'm just like what should i do what
should I do and I went to my piano and I
started playing some chords and I
she started crying because sometimes
when I play some chords and it's so
beautiful and I sing some melody to it
it just makes me emotional in a good way
so I was like humming this melody and
that's why I came up with a melody first
actually and then I put words to it so I
came up with a melody of the song with
the chords and I started humming and
then I started freestyle singing and
just seeing what came out so the first
thing that came out was this first line
deep inside the quiet times you open up
my mind and it was because it's quiet
and I feel like it was a time where I
could think and then I wrote the line
sink into a funny world of wonder and
this is where I was like aha
I want to bring this theme of Wonderland
into my song so I I'm not sure what I
wrote next I think I wrote the up Oh
what have we become part after that so I
mean all of this was I was freestyle
singing to the piano and I just I played
the chord and it was like oh and I was
like that sounds cute I was like what I
did is like I play the chords and then I
just sing to it so honestly with the
song the reason why Oh what have we
become that part sounds like a chorus
but also that the ooh part sounds like a
chorus as well it's cuz I think I
couldn't decide between two choruses and
I was like you know what I'm just gonna
put them both in there okay so out yeah
after that I wrote the Oh what have we
become
we originally it was just gonna be those
two lines as a pre-chorus later I added
to it anyway let's continue with the
lyrics alright let's jump back in to the
second verse so wandered into wild lands
the curious at hand so again this is
just talking about discovering all these
new worlds and new things and it's the
curious people who are diving deep into
these topics and I feel like a lot of
people who are with me on YouTube you
guys are all curious because we want to
learn we want to grow there's just so
much out there in the world we want to
know what's up you know and then pretty
Pink's and dreamy blue hues okay
basically once I decided that I wanted
it to be Alice in Wonderland theme
before I wrote anything else I came up
with like a bunch of words from Alice in
Wonderland some words that describe the
imagery or the colors of that world
so these are just some words that I
brainstormed that I wanted to use and
take from that world of Alice in
Wonderland because I think when creating
a song you really want to paint the
picture and add some beautiful imagery
or whatever fits that world that you're
trying to bring that person into so I
thought about that whimsical world
there's like pretty pinks dreamy blues I
was thinking about her dress it's like
that really pastel blue really pretty
and so I really liked those colors I
think in general I like that palette
pastel colors like my Instagram so
pretty Pink's and dreamy blue hues I
love that line that's one of my favorite
lines of this song alright uh-oh what do
we become so that line it the uh-oh came
naturally and I just added the what have
we become because it made sense like
uh-oh what have we become like oh we've
gone so deep into this Wonderland what
have we become like we're so different
are we going crazy and I was young I was
scared I was so unprepared and I lost it
I lost it this one came out of a
freestyle as well but I fixed it up
afterwards so
I was young I was scared because just
thinking about who I used to be young
scared unprepared for this journey and I
lost it I lost it I like that line I
lost it because it refers to so many
things it's like I lost it I lost that
old young unprepared scared side of me
because now I'm more confident as a
person but also I lost it I lost that
old part of me that is anchored to my
old friends old habits etc so losing a
part of you is both good and bad it's
neutral I mean everyone grows and leaves
the past behind but yeah oh what have we
become and then I have the second chorus
or the real core is the oh I guess I
have to carry on without you so this one
the that who's really came really
naturally to me that one came as a
brainstorming before I even wrote the
full song so I I think you guys know
what it means I have to carry on without
you you being the old me the old life
everything that was in the past I have
to carry on without it even if it's I
mean it doesn't matter if it's good or
bad I just have to move forward because
life moves forward so there we have the
chorus so let's go to the second verse
which is what I wrote the next morning
so like I said I had this whole list of
like words that I wanted to include and
the second verse I really wanted to just
go deep into that crazy Alice in
Wonderland world because the first verse
was about like sitting quietly thinking
just starting to explore that world and
then the second verse is like you're in
that world you're playing in it so I'm
like now I'm painting roses red
adventures in my head
so in Alice in Wonderland she paints
roses adventures in my head because all
of this like knowledge and whatever it
is swept into this funny world of wonder
I really wanted to repeat the word
wonder I like how that repeats chasing
time into a place
not one familiar face so Alice in
Wonderland chases that rabbit and that
rabbit is like I'm late I'm late the
time so I really like that line
chasing time into a place so not one
familiar face I'm just saying in this
place I'm in there's a lot of it is
unfamiliar a lot of it is new and I'm
still learning to navigate it so it's
like there's not someone that's super
familiar or not it's not very
comfortable tell me have we all gone mad
this is like my second favorite line in
the song and it's I wanted to reference
the Mad Hatter and also the fact that
people think that it's a little bit
crazy to get so deep into these things
and I don't know it's like like I said
that feeling of get it going into this
Wonderland and everybody outside of it
who hasn't gone in doesn't understand
what you're going through and if you
talk about things like chakras or
whatever that's just something that's
like a spiritual term that normal people
won't understand and it's just like tell
me have we all gone mad have we gone mad
by going so deep but it's I'm not like
angry I'm not mad I think it's awesome
but it's just I think it's cute like
we're like the Mad Hatter we're crazy
but it's good to be a little bit crazy
and then at the end what else is a girl
to do that just felt really right
because I'm just like I don't know what
else to do I just have to carry on with
my life and accept that I'm gonna change
and the world around me is gonna change
as I change because the world around me
reflects me so it's just like an ode to
my past just admitting that I'm
different and I might have to leave some
things behind but ultimately I don't
regret anything
so yeah that's this that's carry on I
hope you guys like this video let me
know what you think I'll see you guys
next time bye
I guess I love to carry on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
