today's video is an episode of artist of
life a series where we feature real
people who are actively creating their
dream life so we explore how they got to
where they are and what they learned in
their journey that you can apply to your
life
my name is Eileen and I'm so excited to
introduce the lovely with piloted and
the very fierce sorry a hello
Sasori yang is a dance teacher
choreographer and singer from the Bay
Area currently living in LA and she is
like a ball of energy
she's a beam of light I love her so much
she's super inspiring so a little
backstory we actually went to USC
together and we danced on a hip-hop team
together
and it's just so amazing to see like how
far she's come so I'm so excited to have
you here I'm excited to be here thank
you for having us thank you for yes yes
that's gonna be the only want to be but
yeah yeah okay so let's talk about your
story a little bit because I know you
went to school for business but you've
been dancing since high school and ever
since I've met you you've been like an
amazing dancer so can you talk about
like your path how you decided to take
dance more seriously my motive was just
to have fun I was like still really
serious about basketball I've been
playing since I was like a little girl
and still like super into a play in high
school and then my friend and I were
just like let's do something like extra
it's like fun together and we just found
a local dance studio and we signed up
for a beginning hip hop class once a
week so I started dancing once a week
and just pretty soon realized that I
could kind of dance it was like okay
like I'm not terrible and like
they're some yeah anyway and I really
like I just fell in love with it
instantly fast-forward I moved down to
LA for school not for dance to go to USD
and I was really serious about pursuing
this like business career and like want
it to be like marketing you know just
executive blah blah blah blah and then I
joined grv still like love dancing and
but I still saw my career and my
education as like kind of my priority
and that was the direction I was still
headed and you were like working right
yes I had a job plus you were doing trv
yeah I had a work-study job all
throughout college like 20 hours a week
he was an office job I had grv which was
we didn't have like a curfew at that
time so regular rehearsals were onto
like three or four I am concurrently and
I had 18 units a semester because I
wanted to graduate early
oh god I was totally just like yeah so
still and I and I finished school I
graduated and I went straight into the
marketing job so just like all
throughout this journey like yes dance
like I was really passionate and I loved
it and I my passion and love for it
helped me like motivated me to train and
to grow and get better but it was never
because I wanted to become a traveling
choreographer it was just because I was
pretty fun
yeah for climbing for like the love and
you happen to be really good at it and a
lot of people I thought yeah right well
I guess yeah but uh if I graduated one
to a full-time marketing job and within
I think it took like two months two
months and I was just really not happy
because super miserable like I just
driving in traffic like like in the rain
like crying like the most like
fanáticos when I just gasps those
clothes and I would at work I would just
like look at the clock and be like I
can't wait till work it's over so I can
go take class and I would often drive so
I worked on in Turin and it would take
me like sometimes two two and a half
hours to drive oh no help in rush hour
to take the classes I wanted to take man
yeah I was just like yeah thinking about
dance all day really miserable at work
like knowing that having
feeling that I wasn't doing what I was
supposed to be doing because I was just
not it just didn't feel right and then
ironically like one of the
responsibilities I had at my job was as
like social media
whoa one of the aspects was managing the
social media accounts and so I had to
post empowering messages like every day
and it was just really a you know like
follow your dreams like I was in his art
and I would when you're at the AA
ladylike I like I'm not doing these
things but you know posting them every
day and I finally came across one and I
never say this correctly but it was
along the lines of if you want to know
where heart is follow your mind when it
wondered okay yeah and and then I
thought about it and I was like I'm
thinking about again all the time and so
that was kind of like the symbolic start
of it and then from there this number
started popping up everywhere I don't
want to share the exact number but it's
a really rare combination of number kind
of creepy when you're getting probably
everywhere like I am receipt license
plates I would be driving behind the
queue if I was like you know in line to
get food yeah I like number like the law
of everything the price how many times
just is one of only two oh yeah you said
it is like it's just the fact that I saw
it everywhere it to the point where I
was like okay you know sometimes when
you're looking for things you just see
them to learn but to the point where
you're like in traffic and you look up
and the license plate like it
I can't rescind you go eat and the
receipt it's like that's your number and
everything like the number of like I
know like the somme so silly but like
the number of likes on post and just
like everything was this number like
four I would say at least a month and it
was in freaking me out
and I finally googled it I was like
maybe there's like some symbolic meaning
behind this like even if it's not really
valid or from a credible source like
it'll give me some type of answer I
found one really
just like discrete website and it talks
about like this angel number that I've
heard of these
yeah angel number yeah like an angel
number what my number list and then the
meta message said that basically like
whatever you want like however you want
to like that effects yourself a newsman
offense than the word like yourself to
the world like whatever you want to
become like it will take care of you
okay so because I think the biggest
thing for me that was holding me back
from taking the leap of faith into dance
was just pure like 100 percent financial
like how would I make this work I like
just graduated from a crazily expensive
university and I'm in debt and like how
am i paying my rent you know like how am
I going to make all this work and so
that was my fear and that's kind of what
held me back that along with not
believing that I was good enough to
begin with and then all of us all these
things combined nothing happy at work
design that kept coming up and then
finally researching like this angel is
just like oh like the cherry on top like
okay silent so I read that and I was
like you know what like yeah I need to
do this and I will say like
simultaneously a lot of choreographers
that I really respect and look up to
started like not handing opportunities
but reaching out to me and bringing me
into like studio shoes and rehearsals
and projects and things like that and so
they were showing like a belief in me
then I didn't have in myself at the time
like you know so that helped me a lot
just okay these people I respect are you
know telling me giving me connect they
might leave engaging me yeah and I
thought okay like I think the final just
to kind of like conclude my life story
the final thing that I kind of realized
in making that final jump into quitting
my full-time and figuring out how to
make dance like work was deciding that
it wasn't about being good enough
because I always use that as an excuse
I'm not good and I'm never going to be
like this choreographer I wouldn't look
at the top Crowder and be like I'm not
at that level I'll never be there like I
can't do what they do you know making
excuses like I started too late like I
didn't have like all the training yeah
and then I realized like yeah I'm not
where those people are and maybe I'm not
good enough right now but that doesn't
mean that if I don't put in the work
that I went become there you know like I
would get to that level yeah that allows
me to to do those things that to live
out those dreams you know so once I
decided like yeah soar like you might
suck right now like you know I mean
being overly harsh but like that doesn't
mean you need to that doesn't prevent
you from becoming great I'm trying
yes I'm trying it and like yeah you're
going to have to put in like so much
work but that's I just decided not about
being good enough but about wanting it
not enough like wanting to be good
enough that isn't badly enough yeah I
love it okay so you decided that you
wanted it more than you know not equal
trying yeah I mean I just I knew that I
wasn't where I needed to be to be like
you know an international like Sucher
have a nobody to starts out that way I
couldn't do a comparison like when we
compare ourselves to successful people
we look at them
and when they're in the light is because
they succeeded you know if they've been
yeah and have reached that level of
greatness and I think just deciding like
I can't use that like I can use that as
my motivation but not as like something
to discourage me you know I'm not a host
to that I mean there's a saying like
don't compare your chapter one to
someone else's chapter 20 exactly you
don't know how many steps they take you
to get there so it's all about like just
start very hard
totally yeah and even the way that
people get to like similar destinations
is so different I think like not making
excuses because of maybe where you come
from or how much money you have or you
know the mentors you may or may not have
like those things like should never
stand in your way because you can still
become successful you know like you can
find a way to become successful
yeah it'll happen the way that it's
meant for you and you can find a way yes
anyway okay next
I want to ask is since you've taken that
leap of faith what has been the biggest
challenge in becoming like an artist or
you know what I mean pursuing your
dreams so I think I got this question a
lot in towards the beginning of doing
danceable time and in the beginning of
the number one answer was finances so
just when you decide to leave a very
stable paying job for something very
unstable very uncertain not guaranteed
it's how do you stay afloat especially
when you know if you're pursuing art
you're going to have to invest like you
just start out by investing investing
investing in yourself and your growth
and your in putting yourself out there
and I just didn't have the luxury of
like having a lot of money to like
propel me in that way you know so in the
beginning I was juggling so many
part-time jobs just to get like extra
money every week like every week would
be different well I think that was one
year I forget which maybe this was 213 I
think I counted I listed all the
different random drops I can so can you
give an example of like what kind of
weird job you have yeah well so one of
them was I was a personal assistant and
it ranged from doing like the very
typical like filing paperwork organizing
office spaces to going grocery shopping
at Trader Joe's for people or taking
care of like their parents
you know like koalas or yeah yeah and I
also was like a tutor and academic tutor
which is not my forte
in terms of just not not academic not
academic swapping my forte but just like
being patient with people like spinning
like them but I tutored a lot I did
really random I did like random acting
things do my agency but I'm like the
worst actor ever so don't look so lean
anywhere else I know I was going to LA I
know
I'm just telling you I'm terrible no I
apologize but those think uh what else I
was a PR at this then I worked for like
this kind of like startup PR agency for
a little bit I was a lot of writing just
a lot a lot of different thing I just
found ways to make money and yeah I
found ways and that was successful
because every meet like your your point
you're searching you're playing your
you're going you're driving all over the
place and just to get like an extra two
in two bucks a week for whatever
expenses for food for gas so that was um
yeah the initial struggle was
financially staying afloat supporting
myself
all the while investing and making
myself you know get to the level that I
mentioned that I wanted to you know so
if you invested in taking class yeah and
also like you know when you're starting
out as a dancer it's really important
that you create work and I can start to
build like a portfolio of presence and
that's that requires like a lot of
investment you know they're like videos
and stuff but if you're you know
scraping by to like make rent and stuff
like you're not thinking about paying
hundreds of like not hundreds but like a
couple hundred dollars or videos and
stuff so even not like that was
difficult but fast-forward to like a
couple years later and I'm doing okay hi
I'm like let me grab thank you I'm just
left like you know stressed about every
single like juice i buy yes or whatever
like I would say moving forward the
greatest challenge is I think it's like
aligning Who I am and like what means a
lot to me was like what I do like and
just making sure that like as I move
forward I'm fulfilling like a thousand
percent of like my gift and my potential
just because it's so uncertain and like
as a freelance artist like you have to
decide things for yourself and like it's
like move forward like there's no boss
telling you like what to do where to go
what directions ahead and what how you
should spend your time how you should
express yourself like what methods or
let's you should be you know focusing on
and I think just like it's just always
not like overriding like existential
like like this is paralyzing me
yeah like what's the point I think
that's been a huge question is like with
everything I do and like it's always
challenging to find like the most
effective way to like use my voice and
my gift and whatever opportunities I'm
given to like maximize you know yeah
that's what I appreciate about you
because you really care about your voice
and the energy you put out and you can
tell by like everything you post on
social media it's always positive and I
watched that video I want to put a clip
in it here like where you told that girl
like I am strong ah that was so cute
Amy look if you learned today yeah yeah
so things like that I think it's really
important and it shows that you're an
artist which is really cool I want to
ask about that like where does that
positivity or that side come from and
how do you stay connected with that when
you're going through like a tough time
oh gosh cuz I know it's not easy you
know I don't I can't pinpoint it to like
one source or one of those I just feel
like I've always been like a very fiery
person were you raised like that make
your parents supporting yeah my parents
have always just been very like you can
do anything you want like no limit yeah
there is the best they're like super
supportive like never held back any
beliefs in me or anything like that with
anything I wanted to do and I think yeah
that has a lot to do with I just growing
up I've always had as been this very
like loud like wanted to be you know the
leader and like like spread president
right yeah I'll hear oh yeah but um I
don't know where I come from I just
think I've always had this I felt this
responsibility like a moral obligation
but deeper than an obligation like a
responsibility to like make the world
better
before I had X amount of followers yeah
yeah but look even when no one knew who
I was I still felt like how can I make
this
better and I feel like people who are
there a lot of people most people that I
meet align with this kind of feeling
it's just a matter of like taking action
on it you know but I just always I've
always felt that way like wanting to
make the world better I think I'm a
really maybe sensitive I'm super
sensitive super emotional and hugest
crybaby and like when other people are
in pain or in sadness like I feel it
really deeply like you're not in a vain
empathy much I'll say like mirror
neurons you know like I don't watch like
Grey's Anatomy or like when someone gets
the cut I'm like ah I just know he'll I
just feel like I have a lot of feelings
yes it comes from being really and it's
like compassion yeah I guess they could
call it I like making it really
complicated cost compassion empathy yeah
I just feel really strongly and I think
a lot of us Canada like Natalie to that
time yeah totally so what was the
question because where does this come
from but us I don't know yeah perfect we
know but also like once or yanks having
a bad day what what does that look like
do you snap yourself out of it or or do
you just like rain so I have a lot of
bad days like no be honest I mean I I
think my bad days come from they always
stem from not being productive I'm such
like I feel like I get a lot of
fulfillment and happiness from creating
things and accomplishing things and when
I feel like I'm not maximizing that day
and like my potential that day I know
this sounds like really extreme but I
feel really like wasteful no I know I
hate not being productive enough and I
just feel like get into yeah space was
feeling down like hot like you're
wasting your life sort like what are you
doing you know I was really better like
just chilling yeah really bad at it and
it's not not necessarily a weakness
because it's good it like you're
productive but you could learn to like
not be so hard like hi right definitely
that I did not see harm myself sometimes
for sure but I am just naturally and I
think the way I get out of it is
um just like I'm a rat like I love just
like Johnny things on I was planning and
so I just like you know it's about like
even when I'm having like a down bail
just like develop like a plan like how
do I get out of this what things you
want to create like what steps you need
to take mom a little blah
yeah and in just terms of like staying
positive I use Twitter a lot like
everyone makes fun of me for it so I'm
just like a serial tweeter
but a lot of the things I treat about
are things that I realize myself when
I'm like in moods that aren't so great
and they're they're just like reminders
to myself or things that I've learned
that help me get out of those states you
know that are empowering and encouraging
and just like kind of grounding yeah and
then I always like what I'm tweeting it
it's like note to self but also just
like if this helped anyone else like get
out of write whatever state you're in
then that's great you know so you talk
yourself out of your a little bit and
like you're like your own motivational
yako respective right like when you're
in a dom mood like oftentimes you know
sometimes think we can't control those
things but you can control how you
choose to look at things that i think
like yeah I do know I love that yeah
because I grow it all a lot too and when
I feel bad I'm always like why yeah I
juggle through in at the end it's always
like on a positive note right yeah and
it also helps that dance is so
therapeutic so it's like the one thing
that I love is not the one thing I love
the only thing I look but I like you
know I think I think I love that so much
and such a huge part of my life is the
thing that always ends up like uplifting
me anyway you know Danis kind of awesome
like even if dance is the source of like
stress or sadness or frustration it's
always dance that brings me out of it
too you know yeah you can't stay mad and
dance right like you just can't it gets
it all out yeah yeah for sure
so at this point you've travelled to so
many places around the world to teach
dance I want to ask what has been the
most memorable or impactful moment from
okay one was in Hong Kong the first time
I went to Hong Kong it was during a time
where I was traveling a lot
internationally law
Ashley and I felt very directionless or
kind of just didn't understand the like
what the point of what I was doing was
like I just felt kind of lost in what I
was doing like yes I was travelling if
that like you know on the surface level
it looked like I was like being you know
successful but I just didn't feel quite
right fulfilled like I just felt like
everything was about social media and
everything is like so like say mensis
name is that and I just felt really
turned off by it and then I so I wasn't
feeling good I also wasn't feeling good
about just where I was ability wise just
down on my I was just a period of time
where I was down on myself and like a
little bit lost and not fully confident
what I was doing then I went to Hong
Kong and I taught a class blah blah blah
and then afterwards like students will
come say thank you take pictures and
talk to me and there was this one girl
she was 15 13 or 16 but like a young
teen and she told me that because of you
like I want to be strong and I like know
that I can be strong too because like
you're small like me you know and and
like I didn't think like someone like
you could be strong and just I she said
of way more to the point but it was that
message and for me it was that moment
where I realized like what I do has
greater implications like beyond dance
you know it's just like when people come
to class like they're learning lessons
that will hopefully stay with them you
know in their lives like forever it's
not just about like a step like
mastering a step in like whatever it's
like this girl you know in Asia and like
I've traveled those many different
countries in Asian so very patriarchal
so very like women are secretaries women
are otherwise like and to be able to
travel to like a you know and see like a
young small Asian girl today you know
what like I've seen you like you can be
so strong so I want to be strong too
like I know I will cry no I'm like I
only try not to cry like
about it I was doing a time riding smelt
so lost and I'm like oh yeah all I did
was teach like a piece and for for that
to impact her the way that it did it was
just like you know she's going to be
like a boss one day now yeah like CEO or
whatever she wants to be a biologist the
coder like any day singer like she's
gonna like the fact that I kind of
helped her believe that she can be as
strong and as big as she wants to be
like through a piece yeah dance like a
sixteen you know was so I love that is
own car that wasn't like SIA FBI like
I'm going to keep going like this is one
like this is why I was given this weird
way that I move like this is it short
like this yeah you know it all comes
together while you get up yeah so that
was like super dividing and kind of just
like I think about it every time I feel
a little lost or like purposely
directionless I'm like you know what
like this is reaching people I don't
know that it you know beyond my own
acknowledgement like I get it I don't
know who this could be reaching I guess
is what I should say and and because of
that like I should keep going you know
so that was one yeah if you get that and
you like you see the results of the
rewards of your work how can you stop
doing what you're doing right now you
just got to keep going keep spreading
spreading the love yeah now let's switch
over to like let's talk about your dance
pieces and I want to know what is your
favorite piece that you choreographed
and why this is a hard question because
I feel like every week I make like one
that I feel like is the best you know
you want to we don't know no I don't
make one week so I just feel like I'm
constantly training outside of just
teaching progressing to get better
overall as a dancer choreographer and so
every time I create I feel like it's
better than oh my god lion times not not
every single piece but often times I
just feel like okay I I've gone in as a
mover so this new piece is better I
would say like just in terms of one that
means a lot to me is my like a boy piece
because I made it for my
eight yeah it's just that one means a
lot more and I think like it's going to
be hard until I make like another piece
like dedicated for some I guess you
can't compare and yeah so yeah yeah
better what's not better and then other
than that I just feel like I'm trying
not to do myself all the time and also
like once you put like I feel like once
I create something with like or I got
something above it and then like two
months later you're adding back yeah I
love house videos every week when I
created I'm like this is the best like
this is my best work and then a couple
weeks later I'm like okay I'm over and
right you just keep moving for your
growth yeah it's like when you go and
you get danube you like insight fresher
insight like more informed right then
you're like I like okay I love it um do
you have a favorite quote oh this is so
hard for my love clothes
I'll pick one this oh gosh I love quotes
so much so hard okay
I think one is I don't even remember who
this is by but it's when I stand for God
at the end of my life I would hope I
can't even recite this verbatim but
basically it's like when you get to the
end of your life like you would hope to
say that like you used every bit of the
talent you were given like nothing went
to waste
yes and I like it not for necessarily
spiritual like religious is like aspects
of it but all but for just lack to this
idea that like you are given
opportunities you're given talents
you're giving gifts and thoughts and all
these like really nice awesome things
and I think it is our responsibility to
make the most out of it in like a
positive way so I think that that one is
I love that yeah that's because that
aligns with what I believe in like you
should use everything that you have all
your gifts and your life experience and
all like nothing's wasted it's not like
licking it and I just like want to ask
because I think I can complain about
being at a disadvantage to like other
successful people who had all these
hookups and like money and blah blah
blah but
I still have so much that I can work
with yeah and because of that like I
have responsibilities
exactly and you have the responsibility
to do it in your own way
right so this every voice is unique and
when every voice is necessary
yeah or it adds to the you know it's
bringing something to the table yes I
just read something about that I was
like it's another quote about how like
dimming someone's light does it make you
better it just makes the world darker
yeah I love that like yeah everyone
there's like everyone should contribute
everyone had poor each other and bring
each other up because it's not a race
night it's also differing everyone
everyone feel different and yeah needs
to like I think that took a few years
for me to learn though when I was in
college I would like compare myself to
other people you know I mean I render
like competitive but the older you get
the more you realize like you're in your
own path no need to compare even harder
with girls
yeah it is our less girls at the top and
so it gives females this idea that like
those only X amount of spots for girls
to thrive in whatever industry and
because as a result you need to compete
with like the next set but and I fall
into that trap like in the beginning you
know and wanting to be like the best and
the only and then I just realized like
man when you're the only girl and I'm
like for me like what I'm traveling with
like ten dudes and the only girl stuck
like I wish there were more coldly I
noticed that you're always guys and they
are the girls that yeah and I really
felt like she was like women are bad and
so that I want to travel more girl so
like I once I realized that I was like I
can't try to feed the best like I mean I
can try to be the best like myself but
like I need to bring other girls up yeah
and that's like what we should be doing
for any other like you're I what happens
often times which is you know turn ya
down because we want to get up but you
know if you're you know in a leadership
position like it should be a
responsibility to like bring others up
not be the only girl up there you know
yeah
we love it so last questions you have
any advice for aspiring dancers or
artist people who want to be like you oh
god both of you first of all you don't
want to be like me cuz I'm weirdo um I
think for I'll try I'll start with
really narrow with dancers and
choreographers I think you have to find
who you are like big ears back out like
really hard like figure that out very
hard I think how would you do that I
think it's just I mean I've had so many
different periods of like patches of
like life crises and soul-searching and
I think everyone has a different way of
like discovering who they are but I
don't know doing things that makes you
happy and like engaging yourself in
areas that you're passionate about no
matter how trivial or small or random
they seem like if it's fishing go
fishing I don't know like I thought
sounds so silly but just like to invest
yourself in areas that you that resonate
with you I guess is how I would wear it
and having really awesome talks with
friends like that's always really like
eye-opening and just I think it's the
reason why I say this you have to know
who you are is because if you don't know
you are like or at least what you like
or have a general idea of that it's
really hard to be your own artist
because I think like art is such a
reflection of like the soul and when is
written like mentality or whatever so I
think like that's why you see a lot of
younger dancers like and choreographers
they come out with pieces that just look
like other existing choreography and
it's because they haven't fully
developed like their own way of moving
and their own interpretation of music
and like things like that and I think
that comes from Ford and specifically
like you can you train a lot with a lot
of like the people either the people you
really like like the style that you
really like or with everyone to figure
out what you like and how you like to
move and then just commit to that no
matter how weird it is or how unpopular
it is
because that's how you're going to
figure out who you are and then if you
know who you are as a mover and you
really are in tune with that then you're
going to be able to create things that
reflect that and reflect you because I
think that's the biggest thing that's
like lacking is a lot of like engineers
like other ability original voices that
are looking you it's not even a couple
of times cut it up and down and say nice
it takes so much time again I'm like
always like like people want things to
be so I think you sound like a clicking
point where you're like this is me
I was it when you started or a few years
in I like I've always hit hard like I
say I'm like my not it's never been like
an effort thing it's always just in like
I just have always interpretive dance
yeah like that and that's just the way
that that's when I feel empowered is
like one against like that and I think
when I was first transitioning into
professionally pursuing dance a lot of
teachers like would mention like oh
don't hit so hard by more if you're at
like you're a woman like you didn't have
like a woman whatever saying yes I wish
basically means like move your hips and
like do body rolls you know like so I
mean it doesn't mean more than that but
for me I was just like so confused
that's like but I like dancing like this
like this is me and the longest time I
was really confused like at people are
telling me that like what I'm doing is
wrong but I feel like it's mediums right
and then one day I think I was just like
f it I don't know like I was like oh I
just had like a just like an epiphany
and I was like I this is me like I don't
care like you can't first of all you
can't even confine like gender roles and
norms are so like prehistoric now like
1990 whatever but it's like I get there
are differences you know and that there
are beautiful feminine qualities and
beautiful masculine qualities of
whatever like yes I agree
all of those exist them and I just
realized I'm going to be me I'm going to
dance like me I'm going to strengthen me
but I'm also going to learn all because
day yeah so that like when people are
like oh that's like a like when people
are like jobs like woman I'll be like I
think fine yeah but then I'm going to
always go back to like what I what I
love
now it's true to me so I think once I
realize like hey like I understand all
the vocabulary and the terms and the
variations that and I respect all of it
but you have to just do what you do yeah
just look look so I expand your
vocabulary go out and learn everything
by the end of the day you saw yeah I
think appreciate it's like my ways not
the best way and I know that but it's my
way you know it's like the way that I
like like to move and once I just
realize like it's okay to learn up you
know exactly learn everything else and
have an appreciation for everything else
an understanding of everything else and
it actually helps you because you kind
of like surveys the field it's like
alright well I've tried this but this is
like this is what feels best for me you
know and then just sticking with that
yeah I think that can apply to not just
dance but like all other places life
yeah everything alright that's all for
today you're going farming and yo are
the amazing things you do in life you
still I'll be following along
you're like the most guilty person I
know ya know like sometimes I'm just
like I don't know how to do this I don't
know how to do this
