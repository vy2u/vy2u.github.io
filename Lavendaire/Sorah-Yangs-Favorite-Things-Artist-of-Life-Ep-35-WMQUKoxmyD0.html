international teaching trip abroad it
was to st. Petersburg Russia and the
organizer just gave it to me because he
said it was cute and I sleep with him
every night now and I I like it and I he
means a lot to me because it's like the
first time someone believed in I felt
like someone believed in me enough to
like bring me out overseas and that's
now what I do consistently and it was
before a lot of people knew who I was
internationally so every night I'm like
someone believes in me and this is like
the guy little dude I sleep with and
next I will go to this this is
catchphrase it's one of my favorite
board games are not board game but just
games ever I don't like going to like
large social events and parties but I
like weren't playing board games at home
so anytime there's like a gathering of
friends I'm always like you guys want to
play catch phrase and then no one
responds but it's really fun and I love
it and I love Scrabble and taboo and all
those things so you want to play board
games with me
that's what I'm usually doing let's talk
about my notebooks so I am always
carrying around 500 notebooks for
different reasons these two I use for
locking which means like when you're
staging and creating formations for
dance I just make a lot of like X's and
O's and I just like write a lot in here
for staging purposes this is my planner
which I'm upgrading soon but obviously I
like to plan out my days really
intensely so yeah this one says start
something wonderful and this is kind of
like my project slash brainstorming
slash idea notebook so any time I have
an idea of something I want to create or
launch or anything like that I'll write
ideas
about it in this one and in this one I'm
not currently using it's inactive but
it's pretty and I got it in Thailand so
I just want to bring it but yeah these
ones I'm always carrying around with me
so my bags always really happy cool so I
grew up playing basketball I started in
fifth grade and I'm from the bay so the
Warriors are my team and Jason
Richardson is my favorite player of all
time so I have actually three of his
jerseys I have an orange one too but I
don't know where it is so yeah it's like
I still watch all the Warriors games
today even though I don't play anymore
but I love the Warriors and it's just
like a sentimental thing for me and
lastly this is a sign or just like a
printed I don't know what to call this a
frame of like printed calligraphy but I
I got it from a student in Singapore and
it says remember why you started and I
remember we were shopping I was shopping
with this student and we walked by a
store and I just pointed out and I said
I love that so much but I didn't buy it
and then the day that I left she had
given me a box and I opened it and it
was this so now I hang it in my room
like right inside of my door so every
time I leave my room it's I'm just like
reminded of this message and it's just
really like grounding just to keep
myself positive and yeah those are
different some of my favorite things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
