follow me to Taipei
so our first stop was to get Taiwanese
breakfasts at this very popular spot
called foon Hondo Chow as you can see
the line was super long but we just
tried to see what the hike was all about
here's a guy making their famous green
onion pancakes with this one of my
favourite food so Carvey and so good
after breakfast we walked to the chiang
kai-shek Memorial Hall Chiang kai-shek
was the former president of the Republic
of China so this place is one of the
grandest monuments in the city
here we are at masa in 1914 creative
park this place is an old winery it
transformed into a cluster of art
galleries shops cafes and event spaces I
loved it so much here
watch my friends down perform and
the restaurant where you eat seafood
with your hands it's really Betty
I'm hungry
I love Taiwan
after dinner I met up with my friend
Brandon whom I met in Italy and haven't
seen in three years Brandon and his
friends were so lovely and welcoming if
we had so much fun I'm so thankful for a
wonderful first day in Taipei I got to
explore the city I met up with two old
friends and meet some new ones this is
only the beginning make sure you
subscribe to see my next vlog coming out
this Friday love you guys and see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
