out the Taipei 101 building and the
areas around it which turned out to be a
lot of shopping and eating
super popular and we came and she told
us it was a 40-minute wait and then she
asked my phone number but I was like I
don't have a phone cause I'm still using
my number
if you guys don't know what line is it's
a messaging app that has turned into
this huge empire of just cute characters
and stuff I used to play lion play and
apparently in Taiwan it's all the rage
because the store just opened we have
dinner with Brandon and a few of his
friends and then karaoke time karaoke is
Taiwan's favorite pastime they call the
KTV
I mean we just had such a blast you know
singing with new friends personally I
love the sing and so I'm always down for
karaoke I think we stayed out pretty
late that night
Oh
before I go on and make a quick shoutout
to Monica hi Monica you're so awesome if
you guys notice I have a question in the
description box and incommensurate in
the comments then it'll make a shout-out
to you in my next video so check that
out watch my previous vlog if you
