Welcome back to Lavendaire.
It's Aileen.
Today is our next episode in our Dream Life Series.
We're talking about taking action.
So this is one of the most crucial parts of
creating your dream life
because nothing happens without taking action,
without putting in some effort and some work.
So once you have your dreams clarified,
you can't just leave your dreams there and expect them to come true.
You really have to put in the work.
The power is in the doing.
Today we're going to be talking about how
you can create an action plan for your dream life.
And I'm going to share two worksheets 
in the email series.
One is how to break down your goals into smaller,
actionable steps,
starting with what you can do today.
And also a consistency tracker to keep you accountable and help you stay on track with your goals.
I really have to emphasize consistency 
with taking action.
It doesn't matter what your big dreams and goals are.
It really all comes down to the little action
steps that you take on a consistent basis,
whether it's daily or weekly.
You have to make sure you're moving 
at a consistent pace.
It's so much better to move consistently,
instead of working a lot in one day
then taking a break for two or three weeks
and then picking it back up again,
and then taking a break for another two months.
When you're consistent with taking small actions,
you make it a habit and you make it a part
of your routines,
so you're actually more likely to succeed
that way vs. sprinting on and off.
And being consistent, it's easier to grow exponentially.
A book that's really break on this topic is
called &quot;The Slight Edge&quot; by Jeff Olson.
He just has so many stories and stats
to prove that consistent action steps will really help you grow really fast.
Another tip for taking action is: If you're
in the beginning of your journey,
you're going to have to accept that you're
not going to be very good.
You're probably going to suck, so you have
to be willing to suck
and willing to be bad at whatever it is you're trying to do.
Don't have such high expectations for yourself
because some people overwhelm themselves with high expectations
or they feel discouraged because their work
is not as good as what they want it to be.
So you really have to fight through those
early stages of not being very good,
until you get practice and get better.
That's just part of every journey:
In the beginning, you're just not going to be good and you have to accept that and still keep going.
Lastly, if this is truly your dream, then
you will have nothing to lose and everything
to gain by starting to take action now,
because a year from now you'll wish you started today.
So don't push it back any longer, don't procrastinate.
I mean, the previous video, I hope you learned
to release everything holding you back
so that now you can really really start to take action and learn to be consistent with that.
So if you're multipassionate and you're still
now sure which direction to take action in
because you're interested in so many things,
then your action is going to be to go out
and explore all those curiosities.
You have to give time to each thing that you
think could be the right path.
You have to actually take action in it, whether it's to try it out or talk to someone doing it.
Just learn whatever you can.
This is your time to learn and explore until
you feel your intuition telling you,
&quot;This is the right path.&quot;
One of the things I did when I was still lost
and trying to figure out which direction to
take my life in, was to take a bunch of online classes.
I took classes in writing, music production,
in design â€“ like UI, UX design â€“ and also coding.
So I really kind of dabbled in a bunch of
different topics, topics I was curious about,
just to see if any of them would stick.
And even after taking all those random classes,
I would say nothing is ever wasted.
Learning is always beneficial, so even if
I'm not pursuing a path in coding or design,
everything that I've learned still applies
to what I do now.
And that's how it will be for you.
If you're still unsure, just go out there
and learn new things because it will all apply
and help your future path.
One of my favorite places for taking online
classes is Skillshare, so I'm really happy
they decided to sponsor this video.
Skillshare is an online learning platform with thousands of classes in design, photo, business, and more.
So it's really a great place to explore your
curiosities in different fields, and also
improve your skills in different areas.
My favorite class that has been the most useful in my career
is the Adobe InDesign Essentials Training class.
I use that class to learn how to use Adobe InDesign which is the program I use
to create all of the worksheets for the Dream Life Series, as well as other things like
my workbook and other design products.
It's been so helpful.
Literally, before taking that Skillshare class,
I did not know how to use InDesign at all.
I was using Pages on Apple.
But now I feel like my skills have leveled
up and I really have all the resources and
tools to create anything I can dream of.
A premium membership gives you unlimited access
to all of the high quality classes on Skillshare,
and an annual subscription costs 
less than $10 a month.
So if you're interested in checking out Skillshare, you can check that link in the description box below.
The first 500 people will get a free two-month
trial to Skillshare Premium.
Alright, now let's take about how to break down your big dreams and goals into actionable steps.
I have this worksheet right here.
It's basically an upside down triangle.
Up here is your big goals and dreams,
and what I find is easier is to break it down
into what you want to accomplish in the next 90 days.
So it's important to see your target, your end goal,
but you know, you can't really plan that far
ahead, so focus on that first.
In the next section, break down all of the
to-do's you can think of to reach that 90-day goal.
So this is kind of where you brainstorm all
the different tasks that you have to complete
in order to reach that goal.
And don't worry, it doesn't have to be in order.
After you're done listing out all those tasks, star the three most important steps that you should take next.
These are the three most important things
that you should focus on now, the immediate priorities.
Alright, so now that you've decided those three most important tasks to take,
schedule those in your calendar.
Set a due date for each of those tasks
and make sure that you complete them within the next two weeks.
Finally, decide what is one action step that you can take today to move closer towards that goal.
It doesn't have to be a big step, it could
be a tiny, tiny step.
All that matters is that you're taking a baby
step forward.
It could be opening up a new Word document to plan your goals.
Or it could be Googling something to do a
little research.
Whatever it is, decide to start something
now and do it ASAP.
By taking action today, you're starting that momentum
and getting into that habit of being consistent
with taking actions towards your goals.
That brings me to the next worksheet, which
is all about tracking your consistent actions.
This is a good way to keep track and make
sure that you are being consistent.
I think taking actions weekly is better than
skipping weeks,
so it's important to at least do something
once or twice a week.
This worksheet will help you keep track of
your consistent action,
making sure that you're making progress towards
your goal each week
so that you're not slacking off and forgetting
to do something one week or the other.
I kind of left the space open because some
people might want to track their actions daily
or they might want to write a review of how
this week went towards your goals,
so it's kind of up to you.
But what matters most is you are checking
off your actions every single week,
being consistent with your actions towards your goals.
Alright, so at this point you should have
all of the tools you need to start taking
action towards your goals.
And I just want to note that once you start
taking action, you will feel that momentum building.
It's hard in the beginning because you have
to push yourself,
but once you get into that consistent habit
of it, it will feel easier and you're just
gonna keep going and going.
And then the more that you take action, I notice,
the more the universe kind of meets you and helps you, gives you opportunities in your life.
So stay tuned for the next video in the series
which will be about manifesting and trust.
In the meantime, if you have any questions
for me about anything in the Dream Life Series,
leave them down below because I'm going to collect them for a future Dream Life Series Q&amp;amp;A.
And that's it for today.
Love you guys so much!
Have a beautiful day.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
