week so far today I have a quick tip
that I want to share with you guys on
how I've been more productive and more
focused and it's super simple basically
I have turned off all push notifications
on my phone for social media mostly
Facebook Twitter and Instagram are where
I would get super distracted I used to
have notifications for just about
everything when I get a new like or new
follower on Instagram when someone
tweets something or even like if I got
invited to a Facebook event and a lot of
those are just not super important and
it would get me distracted because every
time I got a notification it would make
me want to swipe and open the app even
though I already knew what it was I
still had to check it and I realized
that I'm wasting so much time getting
distracted throughout the day that I am
NOT able to focus consistently on my
work or what I have to do so I've turned
off all notifications
I even turn off notifications for
Facebook Messenger so it feels really
good not to get that alert when someone
messages me I like the power of opening
the app myself and then answering
messages when I want to so when you turn
off all of these notifications you're
basically shifting the power from the
app and the phone back to yourself and I
feel like you would gain a lot of the
control on how you spend your time and
where your attention goes and that's so
important for being productive and being
focused so with this pool system you can
decide when you want to spend time on
social media and you can also be more
aware of how much time you spend so
instead of checking Facebook Twitter
Instagram whenever you get a
notification now you can open it
whenever you want and you can also be
aware like say okay I'm only going to
check this for 10 minutes and
that's it so the lesson of the day is to
simply be aware of how you spend your
time and where your attention goes
throughout the day know that you can
take back control of your life how you
spend your time and where you focus your
attention you can decide to focus on
what's important instead of what's not
important like social media and
distractions because what you focus on
is what's going to grow in your life so
you want to focus on what matters and
what you care about right so try it out
turn off notifications for a week you'll
notice the world becomes much quieter
much more peaceful which I love and you
get to actually listen to yourself and
you can hear your brain or your mind or
your thoughts so um yeah focus on
yourself do what's best for you live
your life love you guys
thanks guys for watching I'll be back
with a new video next Wednesday please
subscribe or comment if you have any
thoughts and I will see you guys next
week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
