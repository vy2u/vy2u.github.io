dairy today I want to talk about
something that I am very passionate
about its how to be a student for life
and why it should be a student for life
so I am a strong believer that everyone
should be a lifelong learner so learning
doesn't only end when school ends you
can learn forever into life and it's so
important to do that because first of
all there's so much knowledge and
information out there that it would be
such a waste if you just stopped
learning right when school ended because
there's so much more to life you know
when you learn something new it enriches
your view of the world it adds to your
character it adds to who you are and it
could really help you in your career in
your relationships in all areas of your
life more importantly I want you all to
have that skill of being a student for
life I want you also be able to learn on
your own and teach yourself things on
your own
so that skill is also a mindset and it's
so empowering it's so helpful for
example if you're going about life and
you come across an obstacle or a
challenge where you're like stuck
because you don't know how to do
something having that mindset that
you're a student for life you're like
you know what it's fun because I can
always learn how to do it I can always
figure it out by the way I'm doing a
giveaway at the end of this video so
make sure you stick around to the end to
find out all about that so first let's
talk about ways to continue learning
outside of school you can learn by
reading books on your own you can learn
by a podcast audio books online classes
YouTube tutorials find local community
classes or just talk to people talk to
your friends family or strangers to
learn new things about things you really
had no idea about
honestly we're so blessed in this
digital age that whatever it is you're
curious about whatever you want to learn
there's probably an online class or some
resource on the internet just waiting
for you to discover so I owe my entire
career to learning on my own through the
internet because everything that I do
everything that I know right now I
learned on
line I went to school for business so
yes I did learn some like marketing and
basic business skills in school but I
paid a lot of money for college but most
of the stuff that I use for my career
now I learned it for free online so
that's the internet for you so things
that I learned online I learned how to
use a camera how to edit videos how to
use Photoshop how to do coding like HTML
and CSS for my blog I chose music
production classes and songwriting
classes for free so I could learn how to
write songs and make music make my own
album I've learned so much from YouTube
tutorials like how to watercolor how to
sew how to mix music I've even taken
classes on like starting a business and
using Pinterest for vlogging literally
so many things that I've learned thanks
to the Internet one of my favorite
resources to learn is called Skillshare
and I love Skillshare because they have
such a wide variety of classes you can
learn whatever you want on that website
so personally I like the creative
classes and the ones geared towards like
how to be a better content creator or
how to do marketing for business online
things like that that will help me in my
career but also like fuel my creativity
so it's funny because I actually
discovered Skillshare like way back in
like 2012 ish and there was a free class
one of the first classes I took on
Skillshare was called visual
storytelling and this is like before I
started my youtube channel I took that
class to learn how to be a better visual
storyteller through making videos so I
had to like make a video project for
that class and something not only my
Instagram followers with know through my
stories is that lately I've been getting
really into like flowers like learning
how to garden and do flower arranging so
there was a night where I was like I
really want to take a flower arranging
class and I was looking online for like
local classes I could take but none of
the shops around here were offering
classes like around this time and the
only thing I found was like an actual
florist College where people go there to
learn how to be a florist and their
tuition was like over a thousand dollars
and I was like
and then it popped in my mind like I
should check Skillshare so I went on
Skillshare and looked up flower
arranging and there were like a good
handful of classes I took the first one
that was called modern flowers arranging
of stunning centerpiece and oh my god
guys I loved that class so much so it
was like a 45-minute class it's broken
down into like a bunch of mini videos
it's gorgeous
like that class taught me so much I
spaced out that class in two days and
you guys saw me posted all over
Instagram because I was obsessed it was
so beautiful and like the next day I was
inspired to like go in my garden clip
out some flowers and just put them on my
desk which is something that I never
ever did before so yeah if you're
anything like me you love learning new
things or exploring new passions and
definitely check out Skillshare I'll

life
keep learning keep exploring I hope you
never lose your zest for life because
honestly there's so much out there in
the world there's just so much beauty so
much to be learned and discovered so on
please before you learn the more
interesting the world's going to be to

going to be as a person so it's always
worth it to continue learning alright
