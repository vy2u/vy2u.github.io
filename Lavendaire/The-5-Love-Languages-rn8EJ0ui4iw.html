the five love languages this is based on
the wildly popular book by dr. Gary
Chapman if you haven't heard it the
concept is that we each have a love
language for giving and receiving love
and it's possible for couples to truly
love each other but to feel unloved
because they don't speak the same love
languages first you have to understand
your own primary love language then you
have to seek to understand the love
language of your loved ones so that you
can treat them accordingly and make sure
that they feel truly loved this applies
not only to couples but also to
relationships with all your loved ones
including your parents siblings and
friends the first love language is words
of affirmation sometimes words can speak
louder than actions if this is your love
language than compliments words of
encouragement and appreciation mean the
world to you hearing the words I love
you are so important as well as hearing
the reasons behind that love on the
flipside insults criticism and demanding
words are especially hurtful to these
types tip if your loved one speaks the
language of words of affirmation then
make it a point to give them more
compliments words of appreciation and
encouragement each and every day love
language number two acts of service in
this case actions speak louder than
words
people who speak this love language
express their love by doing things for
their loved ones and they feel the most
loved when their loved ones do things
for them examples of access service
could be anything from washing the
dishes to walking the dog cooking a meal
running errands whatever that helps them
get their to-do list off their back
laziness broken commitments and making
more work for them are huge no no's for
these people tip if your loved one
speaks the language of acts of service
then do something that you think he or
she would want you to do help them out
with something love language number
three receiving gifts for some people
receiving gifts is their primary love
language not to be mistaken for
materialism these people thrive on the
thoughtfulness
of an effort behind each gift if this is
your love language then the perfect gift
or gesture means that you are cared for
and prized above whatever was sacrificed
to bring the gift to you on the flip
side a missed birthday anniversary or a
thoughtless gift would be a disaster for
these people tip if your loved one
speaks the language of receiving gifts
then keep a gift idea notebook anytime
you hear them say they like something
write it down love language number for
quality time these people feel the most
loved when you are fully present and
engaged with each other they associate
love with your full and undivided
attention being there for these people
is so important but really being there
without any phones TV or any
distractions is important to make them
feel truly loved on the flipside
distractions postpone dates or the
failure to listen can be especially
hurtful to these types tip if your loved
one speaks the language of quality time
ask them what activity would they enjoy
doing with you
then make it a date and make sure you
turn all your phones off and avoid any
distractions so that you can fully enjoy
your quality time together love language
number five physical touch a person
whose language is physical touch is
naturally very touchy physical contact
is the most important to these types
even in simple acts so hugs kisses or
simple touches on the arm shoulder or
face can be ways to show that you really
love these people on the flip side
neglect and abuse are unforgivable and
destructive to these people tip if your
loved one speaks the language of
physical touch try touching their arm
while you're talking or putting your
hands on their lap while you're sitting
next to each other all right so what is
your primary love language if you still
don't know after watching this video
then you can take a quiz to find out
I'll post the link to the quiz in my
blog post below personally I'm a total
words of affirmation person I think
words are so powerful and I will just
light up if you give me words of love
and reach
all right I hope this insight really
helps you understand yourself better and
