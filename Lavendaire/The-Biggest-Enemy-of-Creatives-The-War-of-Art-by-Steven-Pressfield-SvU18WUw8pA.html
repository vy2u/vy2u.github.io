resistance you may have noticed I
haven't uploaded an official vlog in a
couple of weeks and that is my first
kind of slip-up because I was uploading
two videos a week I have no excuse I
have to hold myself accountable for this
I was a victim of resistance so I
finished reading this book called the
war of arts not to be confused with the
art of war so the war of art is focused
on writers and why writers have writer's
block and they just don't want to write
but the book really applies to everybody
who ever wanted to start something or do
something or be someone which is
everybody in the world resistance is
what keeps us from doing our work anyone
who's ever started a workout regimen or
has gone to school has experienced
resistance resistance is what keeps us
from becoming the people that we want to
be from doing the work that we are
supposed to be doing Steven Pressfield
says the hard part is not the actual
writing the hard part is sitting down to
write resistance is the force that loves
immediate gratification it wants the
comfort right now because it feels safe
right there resistance comes in a lot of
forms the most common of those forms is
procrastination and I'm sure everybody
is familiar with that it's always easy
to say okay well I I want to do this but
I'm going to do it tomorrow or I'm going
to do it next week and we just keep
pushing things further and further back
just because we are scared to do it or
there's just some weird force that keeps
us from sitting down and doing our work
sometimes resistance takes the form of
external factors and it's easy for us to
blame other things than ourselves for
not doing our work we blame our social
life our job school
when you don't want to be doing
something you can find a million other
ways to distract yourself Facebook
Instagram blogs everything is a
distraction from us doing the work that
we are supposed to be doing staying
comfortable and watching Netflix all
night
that's resistance Netflix is resistance
you can find a million excuses for not
doing your work but at the end of the
day the only way you are going to
improve yourself hone your craft and
grow is to work it's just to work on it
when we are trying to grow and progress
to the next level and create and be
productive resistance is the force that
keeps us from doing that resistance
loves comfort and resistance is fueled
by fear and it's up to us to beat
resistance it's up to us to fight the
war and it's a new battle every day you
have to wake up and be aware of
resistance and the distractions and the
excuses that you're making for yourself
learn to face them learn to beat them
it's not easy but it's learning to be
miserable and it's learning to delay
gratification because you know that once
you get your work done it leads to
success and it leads to you growing as a
better person you can decide to start
working on whatever it is you want to be
working on or you could just get back in
that zone in that flow where you are
working hard and concentrating and just
losing yourself in the work the goal
every day is to just sit down and beat
resistance as long as you sit down and
deliver your part then you have done
what you need to do for the day
regardless of the quality of your work
whether you like it or not that's not
the point the point is to sit down and
be productive
to make something beat resistance for
the day sit down and work do your thing
so all the power to you guys I hope that
you are winning the battle in your life
against resistance thanks guys for
watching I will see you again very soon
and if I don't then you better get mad
at me and tell me the beat resistance
and make more vlogs more frequently and
stuff okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
