all before but I know it's easier said
than done people are generally afraid to
ask for things why because we are afraid
to look needy we don't want to look dumb
and we're just afraid to get rejected I
like this too so learning to ask and
being shameless about it is something
that I want to work on and it's
something that I think could help a lot
of people out there the reality is when
you're too afraid to ask then you're
already determining the outcome it's
gonna be a no if you do ask then there's
at least some chance that this person is
going to say yes and help you out what
we don't realize is that most people are
actually willing to help if others ask
for it it's funny because we like to
assume that nobody wants to help us when
people generally like to help so instead
of wasting time speculating what this
person may say or think the only way we
can really find out is to simply ask the
following are some tips taken from the
book the success principles on how to
ask for what you want number one ask as
if you expect to get it ask with a
positive expectation because positive
vibes lead to more positive vibes if you
ask as if the answer is going to be a
yes then that's what's most likely going
to happen number two assume that you can
get it don't start with the assumption
that you can't get it you have to
believe and be confident that you can
get what you want number three ask
someone who can give it to you make sure
this person is qualified to give you
what you want you don't want to waste
your time asking the wrong person
so go straight to the source number four
be clear and specific about what you
want it's so important that your
requests are as specific as possible
because vague requests equals vague
results give specific amounts give the
specific date or time that you want is
just make sure that you're both on the
same page number five asked repeatedly
person
since really is key someone may turn you
down but it could be because they had
other priorities or they were busy
whatever it is it is not a reflection of
you keep asking because somebody else or
maybe even that same person on a
different day or in a better mood will
eventually say yes my point is you have
nothing to lose and everything to gain
by asking so simply start asking make a
list of the things that you want but
we're afraid to ask for at home work or
school ask yourself what is your fear
that stops you from asking and also ask
yourself what is the cost of you not
asking generally the benefits will far
outweigh the risk and the cost that it
takes to ask good luck everybody I
really hope this encouraged you to
simply ask for what you want just give
it a try because you might just get what
you asked for
thanks guys see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
