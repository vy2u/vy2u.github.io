does that sound crazy to you sure we
experience the effects of time we
witness the Sun rising and setting the
seasons changing and the signs of aging
but do we ever really know what time
itself is Albert Einstein said the
distinction between the past present and
future is only a stubbornly persistent
illusion the past and the future are
nothing but projections in our minds
really the only moment that exists is
now the eternal present moment think
about it there is never a time when you
are living in anything other than this
current moment once we understand this
we can start to see time as a tool and
not let the concepts of past and future
affect our current state of mind this is
the distinction between living with
psychological time versus clock time
psychological time is the time that we
experience in our minds as memories of
our past and projections for our future
if we're not aware of it we can get
stuck living in psychological time
living in the past creates feelings of
guilt regret resentment grievances
sadness and
Ernest which are all forms of non
forgiveness living in the future creates
feelings of unease anxiety tension
stress and worry which are all forms of
fear I used to be so anxious about the
future I just wanted it to come sooner
when you're in that state you dismiss
the present moment because you think
that the future will bring you more
happiness you just want to get to the
end already so you miss everything
that's happening right now
clock time is a time that flows through
every moment it holds no emotional
charge it's just a tool that we can use
for practical purposes being practical
with your time means living fully in the
now and utilizing clock time as a tool
to create the life that you want you can
be practical with your time by making
appointments planning ahead setting
goals and working towards them or
learning from the past so that you don't
repeat the same mistakes over and over
the key here is to be aware of where you
want to go but honor and give your
fullest attention to the step that you
are taking at this moment realize that
all actions can only be taken now any
planning or working towards a goal is
done now any lesson you've learned from
the past can only be applied
so how do you live with less stress
worry fear and negativity just relax and
handle the present moment that's right
in front of you be practical with your
time use it as a tool to get things done
don't get stuck in your head dwelling on
the past or the future because the
moment before you is calling
we will act immediately on the more
troubling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
