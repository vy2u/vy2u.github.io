podcast on lifestyle design for
millenials I'm Eileen and I'm here to
guide you to become a master artist of
life every Sunday you'll get new insight
and inspiration on how to create your
dreams life after the episode the
conversation continues in our lavender
lifestyle Facebook group so I can't wait
to see you there
life is an art make it your masterpiece
hello everyone welcome back to the
lavender lifestyle it's Eileen your host
and I'm super excited to be here because
it's our start of our second season of
this podcast so on to season 2 I think
the first season I was just getting my
feet wet into this podcasting world and
I really had no idea what the heck I was
doing with this podcast but moving
forward I just want to let you guys know
that my intention for the podcast is to
bring on guests who are either artists
of life who are creating their dream
lives or who can offer some sort of
value and teach you something specific
in the journey of creating your dream
life so there will be more interviews
this season than like my solo episodes
like this one and I hope you guys will
like that because I like doing
interviews more than like just listening
to myself talk because who wants that
great so today I want to talk about the
success mindset basically all the
components to a mindset that will enable
you to succeed in life and before I go
into that I do want to start off this
episode with gratitude because I am just
so so thankful that you guys are here
that you chose to listen to the lab and
dare at lifestyle when you have a
billion other choices of other options
you could do with your life at this very
moment so honestly I just to have you
here listening is an honor and it's such
a blessing and I don't take it for
granted that you chose to listen to me
like me anyway the reason I bring that
up is because literally today is
Saturday March 4th and
and this episode is supposed to go up on
Sunday March 5th so I am a
procrastinator and it took me a long
time to get up to record this episode I
tried two weeks ago and I couldn't
finish it so here I am doing it again
and there's a lot that goes behind the
scenes you know even after like a whole
season of a podcast I still get nervous
I still have that resistance whenever I
have to create something
I still feel uncomfortable so this is my
uncomfortable zone that have to put
myself in because that's the place you
grow right so I was asking myself why am
I so uncomfortable why do I resist to
like show up to work and basically what
I had to do to get up here today is
reframe my way of thinking and instead
of looking at it as like I have to do
this it's so scary it's so uncomfortable
I think about you guys I think wow I'm
at a point where people actually like my
podcast people look forward to the
podcast coming back how lucky am I to
have that you know because I've always
been so used to grinding on YouTube and
making videos with the idea that nobody
cares about what I'm doing and nobody
really wants to watch it and I did it
for myself I think at this point there's
another level of pressure but also like
in a good way because I'm not just doing
it for myself anymore
but basically what I'm trying to say is
I realized that I have a platform and I
can't waste it I want to use it for good
so that was my long rant of telling you
that I am so grateful that you're here
listening and yeah alright now let's
talk about the success mindset so the
reason I want to bring this up as the
first topic of the season is because
it's so important to know the foundation
and to have that foundation ingrained in
you that mindset to succeed so I want to
break it down and kind of show parts of
where this mindset can come from it's
definitely not all because
you know I still have so much more to
learn in life but definitely there is
something that sets successful people
apart from people who just settle I just
think that on the way to building your
dream life you know you're on that path
to creating that career and that
lifestyle the relationships that you
want there are so many obstacles that
come in between that and there's so many
spots where people can get stuck and
where people might stay stuck and you
know it might be your fears or yourself
limiting beliefs or some sort of
societal peer pressure that gets you
down whatever it is there are people who
try but get stuck in a certain area and
there are people who push through and so
I think the success mindset is me
breaking down what parts of that mindset
help people push through all of those
obstacles that come in the way when
you're trying to build your dream life
you know I think everyone can agree that
when you look at the most successful
people in the world the grapes they're
not necessarily the most talented or the
most intelligent or even the ones who
are born with the most resources at hand
you know a lot of people they started
out with nothing and they made it all
the way to the top and other people who
are blessed to start with more than
those like maybe they might have gotten
stuck or just I'm saying that there's no
like one defining factor on successful
people there's no one baby that's born
and you're like this baby is a
successful baby it's not really genetic
like that it really is in the mindset
and the character that you develop in
your life that keeps you going to get
there I think so much of it is stamina
to like stay in the game to believe in
yourself and nobody else does and just
see your dreams through to the end so
today I'm going to break it down into
eight parts the success mindset into
eight parts so here is like the overview
of the eight parts of the success
mindset that I'd love if you all could
just ingrained in your brain and in your
character and it's something that we
should all work on day to day but if you
can work on this and strengthen all of
these eight parts then definitely you'll
have
stronger mindset for success and trust
me it will make all the difference so
number one is unwavering belief in
yourself
number two commitment commitment to
whatever goal or task at hand
number three patience because all things
take time and you have to develop a
strong patience number four perseverance
you have to have the stamina to not give
up no matter what number five
consistent action so always valuing
action over everything
taking consistent action number six
continuous improvement constantly
steering and tinkering getting feedback
and learning number seven self
forgiveness learning to forgive yourself
as fast as possible and lastly number
eight is gratitude always always always
have that mindset of gratitude with you
and honestly all of these components are
easier said than done and listening to
this podcast you might be telling
yourself like yeah yeah yeah I know all
of this but are you really implementing
all of these in your life do you really
know it deep down all right let's start
with the first one which is believe in
yourself you have to have unwavering
belief in yourself believe that you can
do it because the journey is mostly
mental and I don't know if you
understand how much power your mentality
has over the reality of your life if you
don't believe you can do something then
you're going to physically and mentally
be weaker than if you believed that you
can do it I don't know if you've ever
like arm wrestled someone but if you arm
wrestle someone with the belief that you
will lose and you won't likely be able
to beat the other person subconsciously
you're not going to try as hard and
you're going to be more willing to lose
but if you believe that you can do it
something clicks in your brain and your
subconscious that kind of gives your
physical body and everything else out
extra little boost so it really starts
with a belief in your
self self-belief comes from a place of
self-confidence and I know that not
everybody is born with confidence so
it's something that must be learned and
developed an exercise you can do to
build the self confidence and self
belief is to take out a notebook and
write down all of your small wins all of
the little victories that you've had in
your life think about all the things
that you have accomplished and it's even
better if you can write down things that
you accomplished already that you didn't
believe you can accomplish before so for
example one thing that I've done in the
past that I would have thought was crazy
like I'd never thought that it was
possible is I got together with a group
of friends and we had the idea to shoot
a short film in Taiwan and we had just
an idea and we're like okay how are we
going to fund that trip how are we going
to pay for this like crew and all of
this and when we met to like talk about
the idea it really felt like fluff it
really felt like a lofty dream that was
never going to happen but two years
later like I can tell you that we made
it happen we got like our flights and
hotel sponsored like we just made it
work and it happened and so that's like
a victory I can write down in my list of
something that I didn't believe could
happen but happened something that we
made happen so if you can come up with
things like that on your list that would
be amazing and it's just a reminder of
how much potential you have and how much
more you can probably accomplish in your
life things that you would never believe
you can do the second component of the
success mindset is commitment you have
to decide that you're going to do
something and that you will absolutely
not back out it's something that once
you've made that decision it's done
you're going to do it there is no try
there's only do so you have to have that
strong level of commitment to whatever
your goal or your dream is because if
you're not committed and you have that
like wishy-washy vibe like I could do it
or I don't have to like then you're not
going to make it
and it's not going to work it's only
going to work if you commit 100% to
whatever task is at hand
so commitment means that you make space
for what you plan to do if you are
committing to like a new diet plan then
you have to arrange your schedule and
make space to meal prep or do whatever
it takes to see that through so I think
a lot of people look over that they say
like oh I want to do this but they don't
make the actual changes in their
lifestyle to support that decision so
commitment means you prepare everything
that needs to be done all the
circumstances you make it perfect to
support your commitment there's a quote
that I read in the success principles by
Jack Canfield that once I read it I like
put it on my phone and I would read it
to myself every night especially during
those tough times in the beginning no
matter how hard it is or how bad it gets
I'm going to make it so once you've made
that decision to commit there is no
turning back
you're going to do it it is there you
know so you have to have that level of
commitment to succeed in anything the
third component is patience so with any
journey you have to have a lot of
patience because everything always takes
like twice as long as you expect it to
take I'm saying most cases some people
are the exception some people get lucky
but most times things take much longer
than expected so nothing happens in an
instant building your dream life takes
so much time so much effort and for a
long time things are going to be
uncertain so you have to be patient and
learn to get comfortable in that area of
uncertainty that area that's space where
you're not sure if this is even going to
go anywhere you're not sure if it's
going to work out stay patient because
there are so many stories of like people
who stuck through for a long period of
time and then they hit jackpot whatever
that is to them so most people are
impatient most people do
I have the patience to work at a dream
for so long with no pay no reward no
nothing most people are like after two
years and I oh my god it's been two
years and still nothing and then they
give up or maybe they work for three or
four years and they're like still
nothing and then they give up so I'm
already like going into my fourth
component which is perseverance not
giving up and just pushing through
because I think that patience and
perseverance go hand in hand
you have to stay patient because your
dream will take a lot of time and at the
same time you have to persevere no
matter what no matter what obstacles
come your way no matter how long or how
frustrating or you know however long you
feel like nothing is going right you
still have to push through if you want
to succeed because if you stop that
means you failed and I always believed
that if you don't stop then you will
eventually succeed you will eventually
have something as so as long as you keep
going I think the proper quote is more
like you only fail when you stop trying
I'm sure a lot of you know who marie
forleo is if you don't know who she is
she is a businesswoman and online
personality she's honestly like one of
my idols and she's built a
multimillion-dollar online business and
she was talking about her journey she
was working on her business for seven
years before it finally popped and it
finally started to see some sort of
traction so at seven years was a long
time and she was saying like imagine she
got to year four and decided to give up
or imagine if she went to year five or
year six and then was like oh well I've
tried it for five or six years it hasn't
worked so it's not for me but that's not
what happened she kept pushing and she
stayed patient she kept persevering and
year seven was her year where it finally
took off and so you never know when it's
going to start looking up from here
honestly and it really is about that
scam and how long can you stay in the
game how long can you last without
wanting to quit because there are so
many obstacles so many moments in every
path where you're going to want to quit
where you're going to want to give up
it's in those moments where you have to
remind yourself like yes it's okay to
have setbacks it's okay to fail it's
okay to like even take some time to like
relax and not go so hard it's okay to
rest
okay resting is not failure but if you
stop trying completely if you give up at
that moment then it's over you know then
all your work is wasted then what's the
point why you know so it's okay to rest
and it's okay to acknowledge those
obstacles and the struggles but the
point is to pick yourself back up and
keep going
after that it's who can push herself
further and whoever can stay in the game
longer whoever has the patience and the
perseverance to last that's the person
who's going to succeed all right so I've
covered the first floor which was belief
in yourself commitment patience and
perseverance and honestly those four
were what kept me going in those early
stages of my career when I was starting
to make videos no one was watching for
like a year and a half and really like
developing that character to keep going
no matter what to stay patient to stay
committed and believe in yourself when
nobody else seems to believe in you
moving on to the next four components of
the success mindset consistent action so
people who are successful always value
action always prioritize taking action
because so much time is wasted just
sitting there wondering should I do this
or should I do that or just living in
your head basically where all things
come from action basically you will
never know if this step is right for you
unless you actually try it and see for
yourself
you know it's all about like trying
things if it doesn't work then well now
you know one way that doesn't work so
try something else all about taking
action and utilizing this present moment
to move yourself forward so I have a
post-it note right in front of my desk
that says the action is here and I put
that there to remind me that the present
moment is all
I have and the present moment is where I
have the power to do any sort of action
to bring myself forward so instead of
like sitting around thinking about what
if that post-it note reminds me to take
action and to utilize the present moment
in my favor also what I mean by
consistent action is that slow and
steady wins the race basically create a
system for yourself a daily or weekly
system where you're working towards your
goal at a manageable consistent pace so
rather than like going on intense like
little bursts like you work for like 10
hours on your book and then you wait a
couple months and then work on another
10 hours it's so much better to create a
system for yourself where you make it
into a habit you kind of turn it into
this like machine that turns on its own
so once you develop a habit to work
consistently and put in consistent
action then you'll keep that momentum
going rather than having to like
motivate yourself every once in a while
to work on something so so much better
to be consistent in your actions than to
be inconsistent and work in like intense
little bursts here and there
alright so consistent action is the
component that relates to hard work so
whenever you hear people say like if you
want to be successful you have to work
hard and you have to put in the work
hard work is what I mean by consistent
action you have to put in the work on a
consistent basis in order to turn out
results but that's not it success is not
all just hard work and I think not a lot
of people acknowledge that but most
people will know it so the next
component is continuous improvement and
this will be the component that relates
to when people say you have to work
smart so like I said a big part of
success is not just hard work but it's
also in how you work it's also in you
know using your brain and learning from
your mistakes and learning from
everything in order to do better in the
future
so I think that's what sets a lot of
people apart a lot of people they have
the working hard part in but they don't
really evaluate their work they don't
really look at
what they've done and asked themselves
how can I improve upon this so this is
why you see a lot of people who say like
oh I work so hard but I haven't moved
forward it's because maybe they're not
working smart they're not continually
improving evaluating and accessing their
work so continuous improvement is all
about growing constantly learning
constantly is all about getting feedback
from what you've done in the past
whether the feedback is feedback from
people that you trust or like mistakes
you've made in the past that you've
learned how to correct I think honestly
if you want to succeed in anything you
have to be a student for life you have
to always be open to reading new books
exploring new topics talking to new
people traveling to different places so
that you can get all of these new
experiences and incorporate it into what
you do because you learn something new
every time you're exposed to something
new this is something that I kind of
picked up in business school I was
learning about the Japanese strategy of
Kaizen when they were working on like
their auto mobile factories so Kaizen is
ka ize and feel free to look it up but
all that that means is making constant
micro improvements in what you do so
constantly re-evaluating what you're
doing getting feedback and then applying
what you've learned little by little so
if you can constantly improve little by
little each day it will add up and
become a huge improvement and give you a
huge advantage in the future an exercise
you can do to apply this is to track
your growth so depending on what area
you care about growing or working on you
track that area because where you direct
your focus to matters where ever you
focus on it grows so I like to track
five areas of my life I track my health
relationships career personal growth and
happiness what's important is you track
your progress in those areas track how
well you've done and ask yourself how
can I improve for the future so
constantly be improving making small
little improvements and small little
changes and track that growth it will
really be helpful to track it and
actually see for yourself how you've
changed
all right the seventh component of the
success mindset is self forgiveness so
on this road to creating your dream life
you are going to hit rough patches you
are going to make mistakes you are going
to fall and you might even fall hard
so just acknowledge that yes there's no
like running away from it you it's going
to happen so failure is inevitable if
you're trying your best they say like if
you don't fail that means you haven't
tried and it's true if you go out there
and you test things and you try putting
out work like not everything is going to
be an ultimate success so you're going
to have your good times and your dad
times and in those bad times it's so
important to develop a gentleness with
yourself and learn to forgive yourself
as fast as possible forgiving yourself
is really learning to like let yourself
go let all that pressure let all of
those burdens that you put on yourself
release those as soon as you can because
it's normal everybody fails everybody
makes mistakes and it's actually good
because when you make a mistake then you
learn something from that experience to
enable you to do better in the future
so do not waste time feeling bad about
yourself just don't let yourself sink in
that spot for too long I know sometimes
you need like one night with a bunch of
ice cream and chocolate okay whatever
I'm not the one to tell you not to do
that because I can be guilty too
but what I'm saying is bounce back
forgive yourself as soon as you can
basically the sooner you can forgive
yourself the sooner you can pick
yourself back up and keep going on your
road to your dreams so don't let
yourself get stuck in your head don't
let yourself get into that like wonky
space for too long because why put
yourself down why feel bad over
something that happened in the past you
know at that point it's already over
just forgive yourself for it and let it
go okay and the last component of the
success mindset is gratitude so I was
literally just listening to like a Tony
Robbins podcast interview with Tim
Ferriss
and I think Tony Robbins
this success without gratitude is the
biggest failure of all there are so many
people who only focus on the success and
achieving part of life that they forget
about the appreciating part they forget
about the part that makes life
meaningful and full because if you only
focus on the success and achievements
then your life is always going to be in
some state of anxiety I don't know if
you've ever like lived in the future for
too long like you you're just you can't
wait to get to the future point you're
very anxious like it's not a full life
it's not a beautiful life if you're only
depending on success and achievement to
give you that fulfillment it's not
enough you really have to have yes the
achieving part but also that immense
gratitude for everything that you have
in your life and gratitude is just so
important because you and I were all
blessed we're all blessed in so many
different ways and if you don't realize
where you're blessed in your life if you
take everything for granted and you
think that the world owes you everything
then you're not going to be happy and I
think so much of success is being happy
if being in love with your life it's
being in love with where you are and if
you want to get there then gratitude is
like 50 percent of that game I'm telling
you now it does not matter where you are
if you start to become grateful for
everything you have today you're going
to feel like your life is amazing you're
going to feel fine you have everything
that you need right now we're not
lacking in any area yes we can always
improve but you're not missing anything
from your life you really have
everything that you need and a lot of
things to be grateful for so I know that
on this journey to living your dream
life you're going to get frustrated
you're going to get impatient and
sometimes you're going to feel like
you're not moving fast enough and I say
that because I totally relate sometimes
I can get into too much of that
achieving mindset and I'm like oh my god
I'm not there yet and not there yet I
want to be there and like I said it's
anxious so in those moments just step
back and give yourself space to look
around open your eyes and see how many
you can be grateful for in your life you
have so many things to be grateful for
so always remember that with success you
have to bring 50% gratitude along with
it in order to feel completely full and
happy and satisfied and meaningful with
your life all right
those were the eight parts of the
success mindset that I'd love if you all
could just ingrain in your brain and in
your character so that we can all be
stronger in building our dream lives so
let's just recap the first was believe
in yourself you have to have a strong
belief in yourself number two commitment
number three patience for perseverance
five consistent action six continuous
improvement seven self forgiveness and
lastly number eight gratitude so if you
have a goal or a dream that you're ready
to commit to and to go for then honestly
keep these eight components in your
notes read them daily and remind
yourself every day and ask yourself how
can I improve in these areas how can I
grow how can I get stronger in all of
these values and principles because
trust me it works
alright I'd love to know what you think
about today's episode and also if you
have any ideas of what you would add to
the success mindset because like I said
it's not just made up of these eight
things I just put them together but I'm
sure there's so many more parts to the
success mindset so you can connect with
