going to be about the way to greatness
obviously there are tons of factors that
go into being great but I'd say this is
a good start number one in order to be
great you have to be willing to suck
everybody's got to start somewhere you
have to get through that awkward phase
of not being so great and making a lot
of mistakes and making a fool of
yourself even in order to be great it
sucks and it's frustrating but you have
to get over those hurdles in order to
build up to something better what's
important is that you cannot be afraid
of failure you can't be afraid of being
embarrassed or any of that because it's
going to happen and you have to get
through it because that's how you grow
and you learn if you were to fear
anything I would say fear not trying
because that's not even giving yourself
a chance at greatness as long as you're
trying then you are already ahead of
everybody who isn't number to quantity
leads to quality what I mean by this is
you need to put in countless hours of
repetition and practice in whatever it
is you want to be great at the more you
practice the more experience you have
and the more opportunities you have to
fail make mistakes learn and just grow
from doing what's important is that you
actually measure your practice and keep
track of your performance so that you
can see if you are actually growing and
improving and making sure that you are
better today than you were yesterday
there's a famous speaker named Tony
Robbins who was talking about when he
was starting out there was a successful
speaker that he looked up to and that
speaker was doing three talks a week so
what Tony Robbins did is he started
giving three talks a day
and with three talks a day you are
giving 21 talks in one week so that's 21
experiences and chances to practice in a
week and with a guy who is doing three
talks a day that it would take him seven
weeks to get the same amount of
experience so you can imagine that when
Tony Robbins continued to do three talks
a day for countless weeks and he
eventually met and surpassed that guy
who is doing just three times a week so
it's kind of sheer numbers in that sense
the more practice you get the more
experience you get the faster you can
grow and learn number three patience and
perseverance are key it takes a lot of
time and a lot of will in order to be
great it doesn't happen overnight you
have to see it as a marathon and not
burn yourself out in the beginning like
it's a sprint what separates the grapes
from the not-so greats are the fact that
they just simply did not give up in the
face of obstacles frustrations and lots
of failures they kept going and they
kept working at it I strongly believe
that if you don't stop trying then you
haven't failed because you're still
working towards it and you're still
making your way and making progress
towards greatness if you stop trying and
you give up then you failed because you
just cut off your progress so as long as
you just keep moving then you're good
just realize that it takes a lot of
patience a lot of time you have to
persevere no matter what
lastly support is so important you want
to surround yourself with people who
believe in you and who believe you're
great
these are people who empower you inspire
you and just people whom you admire
surrounding yourself with these kinds of
people just creates this positive aura
around you and if they strengthen your
belief in yourself because they expect
you to be great and when people expect
you to be great then that cultivates
greatness within you and it inspires you
and motive
you two become better every day so this
is a start I know there are tons of
other ways to greatness if you have any
super important things that you think I
missed then leave them in the comments
below also if you're very interested in
being more inspired on this topic then I
highly recommend you listen to this
NPR's Ted Radio Hour on success my
friend Marc showed this to me and it's
just really good just listen to it so
that's it for today go out there be
great do your thing
just keep working at it and I will see
you guys on Sunday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
