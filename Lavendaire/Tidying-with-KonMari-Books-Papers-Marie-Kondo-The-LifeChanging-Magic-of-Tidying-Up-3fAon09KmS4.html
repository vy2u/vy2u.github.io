my second video in my personal tidying
journey series where I'm showing you how
I'm actually going about and tidying my
life the calamari way
so after clothes the next categories are
books and papers and if you guys haven't
checked out my tidying categories cheat
sheet you can check it out PDF link is
below
so the first step when tidying books is
you have to take off all of the books
off of the bookshelf or wherever they
are and put them all on the floor and so
what I did was I use this dolly to kind
of load all my books into so I can move
it into the central livingroom area so
that I can sort them out there so this
dolly made it super convenient to
transport books I think without it I
would have been a lot more tired in this
process here's my bookshelf before I
started tidying so I haven't really
organized this bookshelf in years and on
the bottom I have a bunch of children's
books that I just kept from my childhood
and we had no reason to throw it away
until now I also keep photos and
mementos on my bookshelf so I had to
sort out the mementos and keep them for
tidying later and just focus on the
books do not get distracted here's my
dolly and I also have this box for
recycling whatever I find the dolly
wasn't big enough for all of my books so
I had to make multiple trips to collect
all of my books also I made sure to
check all around the house for any
random books lying around because we
keep books in separate areas so I made
sure to gather all of the books from the
different areas of the house onto the
living room here are all the books that
I've laid out on the floor after sorting
for a few hours I came up with three
piles of books in the end the first pile
is a pile for the books that I'm going
to discard and recycle and the second
pile are books that are in better
condition and I'm going to try to donate
to a local library and the final pile
are the books that spark joy and that
I'm going to put back on my
bookshelf books that I like reference
and some other books I like um some
yearbooks and books that remind me of
childhood and alright moving on the next
category is papers and I think I tidied
papers about a week after I tidied my
books papers was an interesting one for
me because I am sentimental about things
and I like to keep my old notebooks and
things from high school and college so
here's my bunch of papers most of them
are from high school college internships
studying abroad and miscellaneous so the
process begins by picking one up and
asking does this spark joy obviously I
have to look inside to see what it is
and every time I look inside I kind of
get lost and if it sparks joy I know
immediately because the notebook brings
back good memories and if it doesn't I
know that is I can easily let it go that
I found blocking for my dance team which
makes me really happy so I'm going to
keep Chicago with all this blocking what
was really helpful for organizing loose
papers was getting this accordion file
folder and it also helps me limit the
amount of papers that I could keep
because there were only so many tabs in
the end here is my recycle and discard
pile
and here are the papers folders and
notebooks that I'm going to keep because
they spark joy and make me happy alright
I hope that video was helpful you get to
see my process in tidying books and
papers to be honest closed was probably
the most difficult category for me
because I had so many clothes and I just
don't like to discard my personal things
clothes feel very personal to me but
books and papers were easier to get
through I feel like the rest of the
categories are a little bit easier until
you get to mementos at the end so
hopefully by mementos your intuition is
strong enough that you know what you
want to keep and what you don't want to
keep I will let you know when I get
there
so next video will be on the
miscellaneous category
I've already started tidying
miscellaneous so I will keep you guys
updated on when I finish it and post the
video so in the meantime happy tidying
good luck and I will see you guys in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
