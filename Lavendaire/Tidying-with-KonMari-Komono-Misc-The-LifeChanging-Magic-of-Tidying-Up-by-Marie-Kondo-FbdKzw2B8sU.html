since I've updated you on my tidying
journey today I'm going to talk about
the huge category of miscellaneous stuff
aka kimono so if you guys are new and
you have no idea what the heck I'm
talking about you can check out my
entire con Mari playlist right here I
have so many videos on tidying your life
the clone Mari way so the miscellaneous
category was huge and I did get stuck a
couple of times throughout the process I
will explain why and how I got stuck
later on in the video but first I just
want to jump in because I have a lot of
footage to show you guys so I started
off with my CD collection in my room I
have this CD rack that doubles as a room
light and I've had this for over ten
years it's stuffed with the CDs that
I've bought in my lifetime and it just
brings back a lot of good memories I
also have the stack of random burned CDs
from back in the day this is pre iPod
days so the first step is to take
everything off the racks and onto the
floor as I was going through some old
mixtapes I realized this category could
be considered mementos but I just
decided to group it in the miscellaneous
category anyway so as I was tidying I
decided to look up some of these songs
on Spotify just so I could save them
digitally because that's how I listen to
my music now
afterward I put back two CDs on the rack
organized by category and there was
plenty of room to spare next up was
tackling my beauty products so
everything in my restroom my makeup hair
product skincare random miscellaneous
stuff I knew I had a lot of old makeup
and trash to go through so I just dumped
everything onto the floor and started
going one by one I didn't even bother to
film that much of it because I was so
into just getting rid of the things that
I didn't want the things that didn't
make me happy I went on like this
tidying small categories whenever I
found pockets of time I realized that
tidying really brings me joy and it
makes me feel very relaxed so whatever I
was feeling frustrated or off about
anything I would just make myself tidy a
small category and I would feel better
after that okay here's my electronics
drawer after tidying I have my DSM phone
cases external hard drive I do like to
keep my boxes for precious electronics
so camera lens iPad iPhone headphones my
old mic some cords are in here this is
another lens this pouch is all for
camera stuff mini tripods chargers
blends whatever this is the electronic
waste box we're going to recycle all of
these pagers music stuff is broken
laptop chargers that are broken camera
cetera et cetera also I found a lot of
coins while tidying so it's a good idea
to have a bucket to keep all your coins
in and you can exchange them later later
on I got to my piano area which was hard
because everything is sentimental to me
so I kept a good amount of stuff I could
tell that we're getting closer and
closer to mementos which is the last and
final category in the khawarij system
and flashcards to recycle this is my old
piano bag it makes me very happy and
some books honestly I can't get myself
to throw away any of these they all mean
so much to me this is my favorite book
of music the shock pen is my favorite
composer all of these songs are fire and
here's a list of scales I had to
practice every single day
so this old metronome brings back a lot
of memories but it does not bring me joy
to be honest I wasn't really planning on
making this video I got stuck in the
middle of tidying miscellaneous and I
almost did not tidy for two months so
the reason is because I finished tidying
my own miscellaneous stuff but a lot of
the things on that list are like shared
items and I do live at home where I
share a lot of stuff with my mom and my
brother has a lot of stuff at home that
he left here so throughout my tidying
process my mom was like okay do your
thing don't touch my stuff don't touch
Elvis's stuff so I wanted to respect
their space and their things and just
let it be so I think because I kind of
got into the middle of the category and
stopped
I just didn't bother finishing and going
on to mementos so I just stopped hiding
completely for a while but recently
we're moving homes so now we're packing
and cleaning and I get to help my mom
and my brother tidy so I think if you
want to help someone else tidy that
person has to be there because they are
the only ones who know what things bring
them joy and what things don't so I was
helping my brother clean out his toys
and if it were up to me I would just
throw out a lot of those things but he
would be like oh this has so many good
memories and so many things made him
happy and I didn't realize that so I'm
happy that I waited for him to come home
to be able to go through his stuff same
with my mom she's kind of a hoarder and
so many things make her happy so I
really had to go through the process
with her all right that's it for this
category stay tuned because I'm going to
be posting my mementos video very soon
I'm gonna shoot that video after this so
see you guys then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
