on my tidying journey this video is on
the last category of the con Mario
method
mementos so mementos are items that you
treasure items that bring back great
memories for you and they're just things
that you want to keep because you're a
sentimental person like me so I thought
this category would be really tough
because I'm very sentimental but
actually the miscellaneous category was
huge and overwhelming and once I
conquered that I felt like I could
conquer anything so I decided to spend a
night in and tidy my mementos it took
about three and a half hours to go
through everything I'm going to show you
the clips I took during that process
you're going to learn a lot about me
because a lot of stuff is super personal
but I think it's fun to share pick up
photos photo albums and stuff concert oh
my gosh wicked these photos from friends
when we were young before Instagram okay
for example this go out trash as Panama
will come at this to my places list
wicked definitely wicked after to my
places this body rock oh yeah keep it
Clippers performed out of Clippers game
one time that's
on to the next box this is when I did a
pageant and okay that is this there I
used to make these bears for people at a
hospice he's volunteering in high school
this is how I learned how to sew with a
machine warp tour was my first concert
and I went to this in a cast because I
broke my thumb and I crowd-surfed with
my cast on good file so I was always
loved planners these are from elementary
school high school college planners and
after college planners okay this is
pretty cool I have climbed the Great
Wall in 2001 when I was 11 years old
okay here's a snapshot of my room as I
am tidying recycle trash stuff that I
want to keep categorize yes I'm very
sentimental I was all to put these
photos into a scrapbook right now I'm
picking my favorite photos from
different eras of life to put into the
scrapbook so childhood studio photos Q
photos high school memories school
dances
more school memories and still sorting
it out I'm just keeping it super plain
but I mean it does the job showing my
memories at a glance this is my trash
bag that's also a box of trash this box
is all recycling okay okay this is what
I'm keeping a box of memories a box for
my planners box for my places my photos
and lastly my scrapbook Oh photos and
stuff
alright guys that concludes my tidying
journey I can't believe I finished the
calamari system through all the
categories of clothes books papers
miscellaneous and mementos just so you
guys know I started this in the spring
and now it's been almost half a year so
it took that long to get through all of
the khawarij categories I did take two
months off but I mean just letting you
guys know it's possible to get through
all the categories just push through it
just don't stop you may get off the
wagon but just get back on whenever
you're ready I definitely feel that I'm
going to continue tidying as I go on
because I have this new Kumari mindset
but I know that I'm not going to be
following the rules so strictly I am a
person who just does what she feels and
so a lot of the times you guys are
asking about like very specific rules
how do I fold this or what happens if
this happens I don't know it's all up to
your discretion it's up to what you want
to do at the end of the day do what
brings you joy what I like to do is I
like to learn about these systems and
learn how other people do things and
take just what I like from that one
thing that I do want to say at the
conclusion of this tidying journey
because I know a lot of you guys came
from my tidying videos is that I'm not
an expert at this I'm not a minimalist
expert I don't call myself a minimalist
I'm just somebody who's interested in
these ideas and I like to explore them I
like how to see I like to see how they
can fit my life and make my life better
I felt a lot of pressure when a lot of
people were looking at my closet or
video and they were like you have so
many clothes oh my god how can you call
yourself a minimalist when you have so
many things and I'm just like I'm just a
person who discovered this method and
I'm just starting this journey - tidying
my life I'm just starting to embrace
minimalism so yeah maybe I don't want to
call myself a minimalist if you're gonna
put me to that standard and I just want
to be myself and I want to do things my
way and I want to do what makes me happy
so don't put me up there
the minimalist expert I do not know what
I'm talking about I'm just a normal
person just learning about new things
sharing the things that I'm excited
about and whether you like it or not
whether helps you or not that's it's
great it's cool it's all good all right
on that note I just want to encourage
you guys all to do your thing if this
inspires you to tidy your life then tie
to your life and if you want to stay the
same just do you at the end of the day
don't feel like you have to stick to any
strict standards just do what works for
you and do it at your own pace all right
I love you guys so much thank you for
watching and I will see you in my next
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
