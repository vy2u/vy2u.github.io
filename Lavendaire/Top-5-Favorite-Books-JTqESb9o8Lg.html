today I'm going to be sharing my top 5
favorite books of all time so far and
I'm going to be going in chronological
order from the oldest to the newest
books that I've read so oldest meaning
books that I've read a long time ago
till the books that I've recently read
so the first book is Eat Pray Love by
Elizabeth Gilbert and I read this around
2010 when I read Eat Pray Love I was in
college and I didn't really do that much
reading for fun I just did reading for
school and so when I picked up this book
it was the first novel that I really got
to get into and it made me think about
my life and what I should do with my
life because Elizabeth Gilbert was kind
of soul searching around the world in
this story and it made me think about
that you know this whole soul-searching
journey and I guess after reading that
book I decided that I had to go out and
find myself and it's because of this
book that I chose to study abroad in
Italy because I loved how she described
eating pizza and Naples and just
travelling basically Elizabeth Gilbert
influenced me to study abroad in Italy
and have my own adventures
soul-searching abroad
all right my next favorite book is The
Alchemist and this book is another very
popular one and if you haven't read it
you definitely should I feel like
everybody should read this book it's a
simple story but it makes you think
about your life as well as you guys can
tell I like this theme of finding
yourself and personal growth I think
when I read The Alchemist was when I was
really really lost in life and I just
didn't know how to get to where I want
to be I felt like I was at ground zero
and I felt completely lost confused and
reading The Alchemist helped me start
taking the baby steps to kind of get my
life back on track and to kind of set
out to achieve my goal
my third favorite book is The Four
Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz this book
is one that I reference a lot in my
videos because The Four Agreements are
just principles that you learn once but
it takes a lifetime to kind of
understand and master once you know and
can master The Four Agreements then you
can live such a better life and you can
impact people for the better you're just
more positive as a person and I guess in
the book he talks about how we have
negative agreements and all these
limitations and stories that we tell
ourselves about our our life from our
past experience and it's possible to
change our agreements by just replacing
it with a new one I don't know if this
makes sense to you guys but definitely
read the book because it's a very
powerful one and it's one that will last
you for a lifetime alright my next
favorite book is the slight edge by Jeff
Olsen
this one is more business II but it's
still definitely personal growth related
the slight edge is a really good book
that helps you put everything that you
learn into a concrete method that will
work for you in your life I feel like
once you get the concept of the slight
edge it's so empowering because you see
the long haul kind of like you see the
long term vision for how to make things
happen the book teaches you to be
patient and persevere and I mean there's
just a lot of good stuff in that book
my sister book is a return to love by
Marianne Williamson I just read this
book earlier this year and this book is
kind of like another one that has
shifted my mind again in a more positive
light and it just kind of reminded me
how important love is and how love is
everywhere in the world and how to kind
of embrace it and bring it back into
your environment I also made a video
after reading a return to love you can
watch it here but a return to love just
kind of brought warmth back into my life
and it made me open my heart even more
so if you guys feel kind of stuck or
just not in tune with yourself within
then maybe a return to love is something
that you should read so you can check
out all of my favorite books so far on
my digital bookshelf on my website the
link is also in the description below
alright thank you so much for watching
guys and I will see you in the next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
