hey guys it's Eileen so I thought it'd
be cool to share five of my favorite
YouTube channels to watch these five
people are people who inspire me in life
and in YouTube so they pushed me to be
better at my craft and what I do but
they also just enrich my life in various
ways so I thought it'd be cool to just
introduce them to you in case you
haven't heard of any of these channels
I'm pretty sure you probably have heard
of most of these but here we go my
current favorite channel is classy by
Karlie Kloss if you guys don't know who
she is Carly class is a supermodel and
so much more please just Wikipedia her
because she's just got too much on her
resume I love watching her channel
because it really shows that she has
such a great personality she's down to
earth and she has a beautiful heart and
she's just an amazing human being
overall she's beautiful inside and out
and even though she's been modeling for
most of her life she still pursues
learning on the side you know she's
learned to code and she's even started a
scholarship for young women who loved to
code called code for Carly she chooses
to do all these great things for the
world and through her blog you can see
that she's still really humble and
really grateful for everything that she
has in her life which is awesome
my next favorite channel is marie forleo
i feel like a lot of you guys would
watch her already but if you don't know
who she is please go check out her
channel and subscribe right now because
she's just amazing her channel is either
a Q&amp;amp;A Tuesday video where she answers a
question from her people about life or
business or she's either interviewing
someone who is an author or doing
something really amazing in life I am
just so inspired by Marie Forleo I
honestly feel like most of my knowledge
wisdom and inspiration comes from her
channel she just has so much to give and
she has so much knowledge and wisdom
within her it probably comes from her 10
plus years in business in life coaching
personal development I feel like she is
the Oprah of the personal development
world she did appear on Oprah's show
super soul Sunday as a thought leader
for the next generation so I don't think
that Marie has been working really hard
at her craft and her business for a
really long time and I her business is
booming but I think she has so much more
potential to grow on YouTube
especially with like the younger
generations so if you don't know who she
is please check her out you will just
thank me for it your life will be
another thing you will move to the next
stage in life after watching Marie
Forleo videos
my next favorite channel is hey Claire
bye Claire Marshall I'm pretty sure that
most of you guys would know who she is
because she's really big on YouTube I
just love watching her channel because I
feel like Claire is a very cool girl but
she has a great down-to-earth
personality that I can really connect
with I feel like I would be her friend
if I knew her in real life and I just
liked her editing style I think I get
really inspired watching her edited
videos because she's really creative I
think each video she tries to up the
level and tries to just create better
content and that's just something that I
watch and get inspired by so she is one
of my main YouTube editing inspirations
to watch my next favorite channel is
also another amazing editor who inspires
me it's I am Karen Oh Karen has a
fashion channel and I just think she's
so original I love that her channel is
very vibrant and colorful and it's very
unique I haven't seen anyone with that
exact style that she has just because
she's just original and I really respect
her for owning her style and for playing
with her style so much she is someone
who just inspires you to be your true
self and not feel like you have to
follow the norm I think that every time
she makes a video she's also trying to
upgrade her level of editing and visuals
and that's what I am inspired to do as
well just be a better creative work on
my craft create more stunning visuals
Karen is just someone who is so cool and
so original I'm so proud of her it makes
me really happy to see her gross
so fast my last favorite channel is
wengie the wonderful world of wengie I
feel like you guys would already know
who she is because she's just doing so
well on YouTube but I really enjoy
watching her Channel and her channel is
one that I recently started getting more
into because I like her personality I
think the way that she speaks is really
fun bubbly and engaging and she just
makes you want to listen to her voice it
might be her Australian accent I don't
know but also I really enjoy looking at
her channel and breaking it down because
I feel like she is just a great overall
youtuber like she probably works really
hard on figuring out what her titles
would be or how her thumbnails look or
even the topics that she picks because
if you notice her video she picks really
interesting topics and she crafts her
titles and thumbnails in a way that
makes you really want to click it just
makes you curious like I have to see
this so she probably does the YouTube
thing the best in my eyes right now yeah
there's just something about her
personality that makes her really
personable and really relatable so she's
just very fun to watch alright so those
are my five current favourite YouTube
channels to watch I think it probably
does fluctuate over time and it will
change over time so maybe I'll update
you guys later but for now I will list
all my current favourite channels on my
blog post down below in the description
box I'm also very curious to know what
you guys watch on YouTube since I'm
always open to discovering new people
and new things so please comment with
three of your favorite youtube channels
to watch down below and I'll be sure to
check them out also I'm planning to do
another Q&amp;amp;A video pretty soon so if you
