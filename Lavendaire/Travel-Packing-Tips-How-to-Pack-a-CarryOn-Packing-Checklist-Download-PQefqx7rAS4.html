today I wanted to share my best tips for
packing for travel specifically packing
for a carry-on and your backpack
whatever you're going to bring on the
plane with you so I normally only like
to pack a carry-on for my trips this is
going to be a 10 day trip throughout
London and Amsterdam
and last time I went on a two-week trip
in Europe I also packed a carry-on as
well if you haven't seen my previous
packing videos you can check it out here
and here or you should click the card in
the upper right corner to watch those
videos but today I'm just going to go
into specifics unlike my method of
packing so my first kiss is definitely
fold things vertically the khawarij way
so I have a lot of videos on how to fold
a coin where you ways I want to check
those out they're also linked below but
basically fold them to the height of
your suitcase so that when you put your
clothes in everything will fit like
right here to the rim and you can see
all of your clothes at a glance this is
a game-changer for when you're traveling
living out of a suitcase and you don't
want to take things out I always keep
everything in my suitcase I only unpack
what I need to for that day so this is
my closet this is what the closet looks
like
and I just like being able to choose my
outfits this way because I could see
mostly everything I did make an
exception to sign some things I packed
horizontally because they're just so
like flimsy it's a student work as well
vertically but yeah for the flimsy
leggings and random stuff I will pack
normally but my main outfits I will pack
vertically tip number two have pouches
for everything I am a pouch girl sounds
weird is that weird but I literally love
to have pouches to hold everything I
like to stay organized and categorize
everything so this is my pouch for socks
and underwear
I also fold them vertically like this I
just got my Nero because I didn't want
to take break so yeah I have underwear
here and socks here I always pack extra
because you never know I have a pouch
for makeup a pouch for random tech
accessories so there's like chargers
adapters and stuff in here and then I
have like my toiletry pouch also in my
backpack I have like this pouch that I
love where I keep like my iPad my
harddrive and check this out I have a
bunch of face masks and we're in the
airplane so pouches for everything helps
you stay super organized and I just
can't do it any other way
my next tip is to transfer all of your
large products into smaller containers
so I always like to save my little
bottles from skincare or beauty products
because I know I'm going to use them
again so these are from like previous
skincare things that I've used out but I
can't read my matrix essence which is
this big one into this small one here
and then here because I think my
foundation is a little too beige I can
spread my foundation into the smaller
container so I think it's such a
game-changer plus like I got to mix
another foundation in here so that it
was better match my color so yeah my
next tip is to save up all your sample
size products or your travel size
products for when you travel so I don't
usually use these little samples on the
regular I just bring them when I travel
because they're tiny and I get to try
new products and why not you know so I
have like a couple primers here and then
these are like some oils for my face
that are sample size of my favorite
products my next tip is to use these
toothbrush covers to bring your favorite
toothbrush with you I don't like to use
travel toothbrushes because they're just
like not good quality so yeah these
covers I got from Daiso and come in a
pack of like six or eight so yeah I love
them it's just really hygienic I think
and I really like it
my next tip is kind of obvious but I
know not everyone does this so honestly
guys put your shoes in a plastic bag
when you travel so that's the germs and
the dirt don't get everywhere else in
your luggage
I also like to bring a couple extra
plastic bags to put all my dirty clothes
in after I wear them so the way I do it
is I fold them up into little triangles
but when I'm in the hotel or Airbnb when
I have like dirty clothes I will put
them like on top of the plastic bag kind
of let them air out for a little bit and
then when I'm about to like pack up
everything I put everything in the
plastic bag seal it up and then go
because I feel like if you immediately
put it in the plastic while you're like
still staying in a room it just gets
musty musky without it was a smell more
if you like seal it up and leave it
there without like letting it air out a
little bit that's just how I'm thinking
in my head another tip I have when
traveling is to scatter your cache
throughout your bags because you don't
want to keep all your money in one place
because what if you get pickpocketed or
something gets stolen you just want to
have some backups so the way I do it is
I always like hide cache in different
pouches and different areas just in case
you never know okay moving on to my
backpack so my next tip is to make sure
that if you want to get something while
you're on the plane to put it in your
purse or in the backpack that you'll
have right next to you don't put things
in your carry-on luggage that will go in
the overhead bin because if you want to
get something it's really annoying to
like ask people to help you open it and
whatever so if I need to do something
for example I'm planning to work and
edit on the plane so I brought my laptop
in my backpack with me so that I could
just have that easy access my next tip
is make sure you have a name tag on all
of your bags just because you don't know
what's going to happen what if your bag
gets lost even if it's a carry-on you
never know so I think it's always safe
to have your name your number email
address or whatever on your bags so
something I'm going to try this time it
because I've seen other people do it is
to bring up face masks with me on the
airplane so that I could do some
in-flight skincare because it gets
really dry up there I think this will be
just really fun I'm actually looking
forward to doing this another thing I'd
recommend is to bring some cough drops
with you or in my case I have this like
Chinese throat syrup it's basically
called loquats syrup and it
it's like a honey texture where I would
just eat it straight from the package
its Suzie er throat so I'm saying like
in case you have a cough on the plane
because it's really dry up there like I
hate to be that person who's coughing
non-stop on the plane so just in case
another tip is to keep your phone
charger with you at all times in your
bag and also get an external charger
because it will save your life so most
airports and some airplanes will have
outlets so that you can charge your
phone so it's always nice to have your
charger with you I've been that person
where I've seen an outlet and I like to
get myself out of battery but my charger
is like up there or somewhere that's not
on hand my next tip is to always wear
the biggest and the heaviest items of
clothing with you on the plane that way
you don't have to pack like you're big
and bulky item for example this time I'm
taking this giant blanket scarf which is
huge and takes up a lot of space but
it's going to be my blanket on the
airplane and I'm also going to take my
big coat with me as well if you're a
frequent traveler and you always end up
with like extra coins and extra money
from all the different places you travel
to make sure you save them and organize
them in pouches so I've saved these
euros and pounds from my last trip to
Europe and I just keep them organized
separately I have like all my different
currencies in different little pouches
so that whenever I go back to that place
and I could just bring that currency
back my last tip is it's always good to
bring an empty water bottle with you in
your carry-on so that you can refill it
at the airport or on the airplane
because it's like really dehydrating to
fly sometimes I forget to bring an empty
water bottle so I'll just buy a water in
the airport after security and
everything because I need to have like a
bottle of water while I'm on the plane
because the water that they give is like
just never enough so I like to have my
own stash my own a thing of water
alright I hope you liked today's tips on
how to pack for travel I've actually
made a packing checklist that you can
download the link is below just to help
you out and just for me to use for every
time I travel because it's annoying to
make a new list each and every time so
this is going to save you a lot of time
so I'm also going to make another video
where I'm sharing
my travel cameras gear so my camera gear
for travel vlogging and taking Instagram
photos if you want to watch that the
link is below and in the upper right
corner I'll see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
