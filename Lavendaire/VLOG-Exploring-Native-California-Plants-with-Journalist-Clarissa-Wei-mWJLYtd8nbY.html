on here in the States already just no
one knew because we came or the
Americans came from such a European
thing I talk about a lot is the concept
of super food so one meaning super foods
like what do you think acai berry
berries yeah it's always things that are
not from here but we have super foods
like here we just don't know about no
yeah I've been we've colonized this land
exactly it's not yeah we continue to
colonize right and and to the result
it's creating this weird thing where
like people in China are now they want a
site berry and things from you know
Brazil and Latin America and they're not
prioritizing their own superfood and the
de colonized in the food system really
means looking at what's at your land and
what grows there and how you can eat it
and a lot of these times I'm going to
show you today they've evolved here for
thousands and thousands of years so they
have a lot of nutrition and the Native
Americans who lived here tended to the
wild so they've bred them for the
optimal like eating purposes whenever
I'm with Native people around the world
their message that they want me to tell
the world is like we are here we exist
stop talking about us like we are the
past right and yeah so there's tons of
books I continue to the links if you're
interested it's so fascinating
hi everyone I'm Clarissa I'm a freelance
journalist and I spend a lot of time
here in the mountains here in this in
gable Valley this area is mostly
chaparral and oak coast shrub and
there's a lot of great edible plants so
I'm gonna take you guys up and show you
guys some of these plants okay so this
is wild buckwheat and when it's like not
ready it's the white flower so you don't
want to eat that but right now these
like dark brown maroon colors just puck
it off and then this all of this you can
just mix it with one part pancake mix in
one part buckwheat and you have
buckwheat pancakes so this is buckwheat
yeah you can make like noodles
I'm the same type as Japanese one so
it's nuttier and just not gluten okay
but it has the same like it's a very
similar like nutty taste and you can
make biscuits with this I like to do
pancakes and then just like adds more
nutrition to your pancakes or as a nutty
flavor right cool yeah if you want to
make cookies now is the time to harvest
when the one is going around yeah this
color so what I do is I will just take a
little ziplock bag of this and then I'll
mix it with a Trader Joe's pancake mix
so you'll go on a hype and you'll learn
the plant and then you'll forget mm-hmm
then you just keep on going and then I
do sometimes the same trail over and
over again and then you can see how they
change right and the cool thing is like
the plants are to become your friends
but it's like oh now you're brown oh
yeah like do you find yourself talking
to them yeah I do I do about with
flowers looks like a sea urchin this is
a wild cucumber and it grows on those
vines that you see that are dead on that
tree and what you do and I'll make this
for you and you can take it home
you take off the spikes and it becomes a
loofah
or the natural yeah that's cool
yeah and so loofah is made out of
Sukhois which is like a Chinese cord and
it's the same thing but the thing is
like if you use it long enough it
harbors bacteria but people are too like
clingy to throw it away right but this
look how many there's like there's one
there this one there you can just like
take home a bunch of loofah I use this
to just like wash my feet right is then
I can throw it away and I feel bad about
it it comes from this dead vine and so
summer is the time that you come out and
harvest you should bring like a bunch of
girls you can deep fry it like zucchini
blossoms okay this one yucca yeah okay
yeah bright white you can just deep fry
them like tempura
nice and it tastes like zucchini
blossoms okay those smell this how I can
smell my hand okay oh it smells good
cowboy Cologne ooh it's Artemisia
californica it's um california sagebrush
and yeah I actually put it in our water
today that we're going to drink thanks
grow one at home and it's just it smells
really good um it's like it has
antiseptic properties but it's also like
a medicine you can use it as sage and
burn it and it's like and it's a very
versatile plant so it's an herb mm-hmm
it's an herb but you can another popular
use is you can dehydrate it it's already
so nice kind of minty yeah you can
dehydrate it and like put it with salt
and you can like it's kind of like
rosemary right so you're right all your
meats with this right like everyone
sticks to the same old herbs and spices
wonderfully this is what I mean by to
colonising about yeah I'm so glad you
see it cuz this is our home right like
this is Los Angeles and these are our
neighbors right so easily grown yeah
said we're here to see being efficient
yeah we're using like spices from
faraway places
these things right oh it's whiteness age
okay this is sage hipsters burn or the
haze so it's good for like D top like
clearing the air okay mosquito repellent
okay I like it for its lemony sense
right you can make salad dressing out of
it you can put in your lemonade I like
to make a smoothie with it oh nice like
the most common use for it is to dry it
and then you will burn it and then I'll
create the scent in your room like
incense is right until like as Chinese
people we insist it's a part of our
culture but Native Americans incense was
also part of their culture and this was
the maintenance at night for California
nice way to eat and it like clears the
energy clears the air and so if you're
moving into a new place or if you're
feeling stressed out and you want to
just like your space or before any
ceremony you burn this okay so you
basically will like peel it like this
this one's not ready yet
anyways you peel it and then there's
this part inside right mm-hm and then
you'll mush it and then you'll pour
boiling water on it so let me show you
cuz there's toxins and okay and then it
becomes a flower and you can make bread
oh so they're flour came from acorns the
carbs and this is a season now and I
don't know I read stories and like I
always cry when I read these stories too
cuz it's like the women they gather and
they spend all day like gathering the
acorns and then they like store it in a
bucket and then they'll make the flour
and then they'll heat it on they
obviously didn't have stoves in so they
heat up hot rocks mhm and then they make
the a corn flour on it and then they put
that bread and just cold water and then
it turns into a bread okay yeah cuz the
cold water that shock between hot right
it turns it into a bread and that's
people and there's this whole leg just
imagine of
of ladies working sitting before me all
gnashing them yeah yeah community
working with your hand and it's this
wonderful tree that we ignore now like
me other people still using it our only
thing still using it are squirrels so
you take a picture of it and it'll tell
you yeah no technology is amazing right
oh my gosh this is better than like
translating on the spot because its
nature yeah and then if you look at a
map you'll see other people's logs of
the area it's called what I need sure I
natural eye naturalism if I want to see
this plant or something like this it's
everywhere yeah this is the pond that
will save your life you're stuck so I
make bracelets I don't know but it's
also a soap which i think is cool
because I don't I just add water
yeah I'll do it and then I'll show you
just like suds come out there's a gold
like this admins okay it doesn't have
antiseptic properties but if you put
like the sagebrush I showed you mhm you
mix it with this you basically can give
yourself a very clean shower yeah I want
to be able to take a shower in the
wilderness you can't if you know which
one is it called yucca yeah it's called
Yakka so the flower is on the bowl the
roots so the flowers grow out of this
when it does grows so it can be a soap
just add water if you like braid it you
have a soap stick so it's really handy
to have around when you're like hiking
or look I like camping right yeah well
not everyone just soap on my hand but
yeah Wow I made soap out of nothing
and we will nature beauty DIY oh my gosh
this could be a real video I'm gonna
make this like mind-blowing people but
this if you break it out fine enough you
have fibers okay right and then if you
have signs your hand make I've made
bracelets out of it if you're stranded
you can make a rope you can again make
you can make shoes okay
yeah and shoes just by like driving a
lot of using it so it would be like this
like you would do this look how strong
that is right right
how I see I can see yeah she looks like
baskets and stuff yeah I thought that
and like it's super strong right and it
just comes from this marvelous plant and
you can use this to poke people or you
can use it to sew things like I think
they use this as a sewing needle like
really okay I assure they also used it
to people
mhm
I'm gonna go there but have like a topic
I'm really interested in right and unite
it's gonna be mushroom so everything I'm
gonna do is gonna revolve around oh cool
so yeah I think if you like travel to a
place with the intention of wanting to
learn about a specific topic then you
get further right that's true instead of
just like going there and walking around
yeah I mean something with some
mountains right if you're just like
you're just like dead yeah plants a tree
right like I've never gone hiking and
really looked at the plants I hated
nature I was like a city girl yeah I
like hated getting dirty and sweaty no
you seems like the New York Josh lives
and I was like raising the San Gabriel
Valley yeah but then once you realize
like this is a pancake then it's like
it's like shopping and I think it like
hits some of those like chemicals in
your brain that yeah you're in the mall
and you think you just want to browse
like I feel like that oh my God we're
like window shopping for food live food
and like the cool thing is like
sometimes you'll see something that's
really cool but you don't know what it
is but it looks familiar and so you just
take out your life yeah yeah you totally
have a journalist mind like you're just
so curious and you go out and you find
out what you're curious about I'm sure
you can relate to find new content yeah
I have to like put yourself out true you
have to constantly be learning because
exactly cuz if you're a stagnant and
you're just like with the same people in
the same places and you're not learning
then you're just eventually you're gonna
hit a wall that's so true I've said that
before in my videos too like I
constantly feel like I have to be
meeting people reading books yeah or
else I just won't have anything to talk
about
exactly yeah so like take a risk so I
was reading this book called one star
evolution by this like revolutionary
farmer huh and I like read the foreword
and I like googled who wrote the
foreword and I found out here to
workshop in Spain so I went to Spain
that's cool the workshop and then you
just meet more people and you go into
this extreme rabbit hole when you're
just constantly learning
and then you're not a normal person
anymore person you don't know how to
communicate this to the world what's
that you're so cute
okay just stay there to enjoy your acorn
so the lighting is so nice here is this
the pancakes again they're so red here
yeah you see it surrounded by raisins
right and cactus there's so much food
everywhere people I'm not advocating for
people to come and like pick things on
mass but it's like cool to like having
knowledge yeah and just like appreciate
so we have sagebrush which is the cowboy
Cologne white sage mint passionfruit and
so the passionfruit passionfruit leaf
which helps you sleep and then the other
three things that I named I grow in my
garden and this is lemon no most of
these are you know from this area from
Los Angeles Thank You Liz from Los
Angeles native teas yeah native tea
native iced tea
once you have one message you want to
everyone to leave with here it's
possible for everyone to interact with
nature even if you know nothing about it
just go out there and look at a plant
and if you want to know more about it
just take a photo and look it up online
and I think if you just start from one
plant you can go from there
think of it as like collecting your
friends or collecting a treasure trove
full of intimate objects that you care
about mm-hmm yeah thank you yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
