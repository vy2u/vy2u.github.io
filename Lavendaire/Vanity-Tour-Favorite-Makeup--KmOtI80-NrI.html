Welcome back to Lavendaire.
So my apartment is almost fully decorated and done, so I'm super excited to start to show you guys.
Today I want to just show you my vanity/makeup area, just because it's my little nook that makes me happy.
This is where I sit down and get ready for videos.
Disclaimer: A perk of my job is I get sent
a lot of makeup from a lot of brands and it's
quite overwhelming at times.
It's just a lot of stuff.
And each time I do try to declutter what I want to keep, what I want to try vs. what I don't want.
This is after decluttering and yeah, I know it's still a lot of stuff.
Just saying: I know this is a lot of makeup but you won't believe how much I decluttered
and donated away, gave to friends and everything else.
Also, if you're interested, I'll have links down below for where I found some of these
items for my vanity area.
Alright, so welcome to my vanity.
On the left, I have a mirror I got from Ikea.
I love sitting up and close to the mirror
so I can see all the details.
And this is an artwork I got from Society6.
The frame is from Target.
I love that it's so feminine and minimal.
It really fits the aesthetic here.
And the organizer is from Amazon.
It just holds my brushes, some primers, a foundation.
Lately, I've been enjoying using this brand, Vapour.
They're an organic, all-natural beauty brand,
so really love their stuff in general.
On the right, I have this Lancome macaron blush set.
It's super aesthetic, looks like a little box of macarons.
And I put it there because it just reminds me of spring.
But the blushes are really, really soft, velvety, and so cute.
In the first drawer are my eye products, but
in the corner I keep my daily makeup pouch.
In this pouch are just the daily essential
makeup that I will use every day.
So the simple stuff like my favorite bronzer, blush, eyelash curler, eyeliners, mascara, concealer.
This is just everything I need to create my
basic makeup look, and usually I'll take this
pouch with me when I go on short trips.
At the bottom, I also have some emergency
bobby pins and hair ties.
So this is kind of just everything that I basically need.
Then I have a lot of eyeshadow palettes to play with.
Here are two of the palettes that I used for today's look.
And later I think I'll share some of my current favorite makeup products, so stay tuned for that.
And here I have more eyeshadow palettes, eyeliners,
some of which are brand new and I haven't
opened and tried just yet.
In the second drawer, I have lip products and highlighters.
So I have a ton of lipsticks.
A lot of them are from the brand Flower because
they sent me every single color and I quite
like their formula.
I have some lip glosses, liquid lipsticks.
And on the right is a box of highlighters
and various sparkly things.
Under the nightstand, I just put the bottom of the acrylic organizer because I felt
it looked a little too bulky on top.
So here, I just have some assorted beauty and hair products.
And in the second drawer I have all my concealers
and a foundation.
And on bottom, I have my stick blushes and nail products.
Alright, so now I want to share some of my
favorite current makeup products at the moment.
The first one is this Pixi x Weylie eyeshadow palette.
I've talked about this before, but it's just
so neutral and versatile.
I'm really leaning towards the reddish tones at the moment.
Also really loving the Sweet Peach palette by Too Faced.
Again, loving the peachy warm tones for spring.
I feel like it really matches my skin tone.
This one's a super cute one by Lancome.
It's called the Eye Sugar Palette and the
colors are so springtime vibes, right?
I used this a lot for Coachella.
And another one that I used for Coachella
was this Too Faced Life's a Festival palette.
This one's perfect for festivals, obviously.
It's so pretty.
The colors are really ethereal and it's just so fun to play with.
My favorite liquid lipstick is this one by
Flower in the color Scarlet Letter.
It's like the perfect bold red.
It's super bold.
I feel so powerful and chic when I'm wearing this color.
I've worn it in a video before and I got tons of compliments on it, so yeah, everyone needs a good red.
This one's also another favorite.
I wear this almost every day because it looks so natural
and it goes on really sheer, so it's really
easy to wear with everything.
Like I mentioned earlier, I really love the
formula of Flower lipsticks.
So this one is in the color Coral Crush and
it's just the perfect pop of orange-y coral on your lips.
Lastly, my favorite highlighter of the moment is this one by Colourpop in the color Strobe Globe.
It's just like a bright goldish sheen that's really pretty.
Alright, I hope you liked this tour of my vanity area.
It's my little happy place.
So now I want to do a surprise giveaway!
