Welcome to Lavendaire.
Today I'm gonna do a What I Eat in a Day video.
This is just one of those highly requested
topics, so I thought I'd take you around my
day and show you what I eat.
It switches up every single day, but this
week I found myself in a groove that I quite
like, so I wanted to share that.
So here we go!
First, I'm making my morning tea.
What it really is, is just hot water, some
lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and honey.
I feel like this is a great way to have something
warm in the morning, warm up my digestive
system, and also the lemon and apple cider vinegar have tons of benefits and detoxing properties.
While I'm enjoying my tea, I'm gonna go warm
up some congee, which is rice porridge.
I feel like an Asian grandma cooking this,
but as I get older, I really appreciate simple
warm dishes like this, especially for breakfast.
If it gets too thick, you could always add more water.
Congee does take a while to make, so what
I did was I made a huge batch of this a couple
days ago so that I could just have it every
morning as a quick breakfast, you know?
Okay, I am back and I am hungry.
It is the late afternoon and this is about
the time that I'm gonna make my fruit bowl,
so let me show you how I do it.
So I got some sliced bananas and then I'm
gonna add blueberries.
Usually I just add bananas and whatever other fruit
that I have with me.
Yesterday I had mangos, today it's blueberries.
And then I'm gonna add some granola crumbs
that came from Aimee Song's raw bars.
I made this raw bar.
It didn't end up as a bar - it fell apart.
But I found out granola is really good as
a topping with fruit.
So in this granola is oats, chia seeds, flaxseed,
dates, walnuts.
If I don't have this granola, usually I'll
just add chia seed, flax seed, and some almond slices.
Maybe a little honey on top.
Mm, so good.
Always so satisfying to have fruit with some granola.
Just such a good combo.
Give you an example of what I bite looks like.
There's some banana, blueberries, dates, walnuts,
oats, and all those things.
Mm!
Alright, now it's time for dinner and I pulled out a few ingredients that I think I'll cook with today.
So I have some noodles and I have mushrooms
that I want to saute.
I also have some greens and a tofu, but this
is like a soft tofu so I'm not sure if it's
gonna work for what I'm trying to do.
We'll see how this goes.
Ooh, I can put some cucumber in it too.
Noodles are almost done boiling.
I'm just gonna make a base sauce for the noodles that's gonna go in the bowl
and then the noodles will go in the bowl and then the mushrooms and all the tofu and stuff go on top.
And I just mix it all together and eat that.
I don't know what I'm gonna put in it.
For sure I'm gonna put a little bit of this
chili oil.
It's like really bad for you, chili oil, but it tastes really good.
Some rice vinegar.
Some sesame oil.
And then I'll just add dashes of soy sauce
and black vinegar, depending on the taste.
Mm, I love sesame oil.
I could just eat it straight.
Sesame oil with rice, noodles, anything.
Some brown sugar is needed.
Ooh, that's good.
So there's just a little bit of sauce at the
bottom and there's gonna be a lot of noodles,
so it will dilute the sauce anyway.
Okay, I don't know about you, but I am quite
proud of my dinner that I made tonight.
I never made this before but it looks really good.
It has all the good ingredients that I like:
a lot of noodles, mushrooms, tofu, and then cucumbers
to freshen everything up.
I saved another half for Wilson because he'll come home soon.
Mm, mm.
That's good.
So there you have it.
This is what I eat in a day.
Generally, I love Asian food.
I love carbs, as you can tell.
It's not necessarily healthy, but I try to stick with vegetarian meals.
I only eat not vegetarian sometimes when I'm
out with friends or family.
But every time I cook for myself, it's always vegetarian.
But yeah, hope you enjoyed this and I'm just gonna eat this -
Oh! I'm gonna take Insta photos and then eat it.
Have a great day.
Bye!
Update, I'm like halfway through and I'm kinda full.
I made too much noodles.
It's okay, I can save it for Wilson when he comes home.
Wilson's making his sauce.
I think you put too much sauce.
Ooh, so this is Wilson's one.
I wonder if it tastes better than mine.
Wilson: Try it yet?
Aileen: Mhm!
- What do you think?
- It's good.
Last thing I'm eating today is a bit of Wilson's smoothie.
Wilson: It's good?
Aileen: Uh huh.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
