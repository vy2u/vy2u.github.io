there is Eileen so today I want to share
what's in my travel bag so if you don't
know I've been traveling for the past
three weeks I went on a road trip in
Europe with my family so basically every
day I carry this backpack with me it's a
pretty big backpack and today I'm just
going to unpack it and show you exactly
what I have in here and I basically made
like a replica of how I would pack it
every day for my travel so let's get to
it alright so here is my backpack this I
mentioned in my July favorites that I
got it at a random stand at a Chinese
supermarket so I don't know where you
can find this online so I'm sorry but
yeah so when I open it this is what it
would look like ok so this is the little
sleeve where I would put my phone for
easy access I'll take that out and this
is a jacket so this is like a really
light jacket that I got from forever 21
so basically this is like a sporty
jacket that's super super thin it's like
not exactly waterproof but it has a hood
and I use this whenever it was kind of
cold or when it was raining I would just
put this on top of whatever I was
wearing so I love that it's just so
light I could literally just roll it up
and it'll fit in any bag
obviously if it was like super hot I
wouldn't bring my jackets but most of
the days when I was traveling in Europe
were pretty gloomy and rainy so I
definitely had this in my purse for most
of the trip alright next I'm going to
take out the star object the object that
I revolve this whole bag around my
camera so let me open this up this is my
sony camera that i take with me for my
travel and honestly the reason i got
this bag was because i wanted a bag that
was big enough to fit this camera so
this is 2470 lens it's a zoom lens
perfect for travel photography and
videography so this is like just my
sidekick
literally I take this with me everywhere
and I love this camera it's my best
friend
next I always need to carry a bottle of
water when I'm traveling so this is not
the bottle I was traveling with I was
like using a bunch of European water
brands but I threw them away this is
just like a demo water just to show you
that hydration is important yeah totally
especially when you're traveling it's so
important to stay hydrated because
you're like walking every day so what I
do is I always keep this regular-sized
water bottle in my purse but what I
actually do is I buy like those big
water bottles I'll keep those in the
hotel room or the bus and then whenever
this one buns low I fill it up with like
the bigger water bottles next most
important thing is in this pouch in here
these are my external chargers basically
this is for charging your phone I don't
leave without this especially when I'm
traveling the worst fear is like having
a dead phone having your phone run out
of battery so this is like super
important I'm always charging this every
night at the hotel next up I have this
other pouch and this pouch carries my
camera accessories right now I have my
tube extra batteries for my Sony camera
and an extra SD card so because I'm like
a camera video junkie I need these
accessories it's totally unnecessary for
people who don't take that many photos
or videos when they travel but for me
this is important as you can tell I love
pouches because they keep everything
nicely organized I can't get enough
pouches so yeah next I have this thing
in this little pocket in the front yet
another pouch this one carry is my
earbuds for listening to music
audiobooks my meditation music while I'm
in the bus we were on a road trip so we
had a lot of time on the road actually
we were on the road for like five or
more hours every day so I definitely use
this a lot lastly I have the zipper in
the back of the purse and this is where
I keep my wallet this is the pouch that
I use as a wallet I like using these
pouches because they're minimal they're
flat so they don't take up so much space
and all I do is put some
cash my coins and a couple cards in
there here are the things I'll keep in
the front pouch of my backpack it's
pretty simple I have my lip balm which
is most important and have a hair tie
just in case I have a panty liner
usually have multiple of these because
it's just you need to stay refreshed
when you're traveling I have this which
is like a throat syrup it's a Chinese I
think it's low cloth and honey and this
is just in case I have like an itchy
throat I have a coughs you know this is
good and I have lipstick to go these are
just some random mementos that I got I
think I got this from the EU office this
is when I went up the mountain so yeah
if I ever like go to important places
and I need to put my tickets somewhere
I'll just put the ticket right in the
front pouch to have easy access that's
about it I also have this extra
compartment in the back where I stash my
receipts so I was traveling with a big
group of family and most of the times we
would pay for each other just because it
was faster or easier so even though we
wrote down all the expenses on our
phones I just wanted to keep the
receipts just as a second backup you
know because it's always good to have
your receipts just in case alright
that's it for today's video I hope you
liked it so if you are interested in
more packing or travel videos then I'll
post the links to those playlists in the
description I also have a packing
checklist for you guys to download if
you're going on a trip soon and you want
like just an easy checklist of
everything to pack that's also in the
description let me know if you guys want
to see a travel vlog of my trip I have a
ton of footage I'm not sure if I want to
make it like one big blog or section it
off into little vlogs if I make little
vlogs I might just put them on my vlog
channel so that I don't clutter this
channel with it so the link to my blog
channel is down below
I don't update often but I mean when I
have a vlog I put it there alright have
a beautiful day and I'll see you next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
