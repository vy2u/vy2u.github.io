today I'm gonna do a simple video that's
actually highly requested it's what's on
my iPhone so I have the iPhone 10 I know
I personally like to call it the iPhone
X I know it's technically called iPhone
10 but whatever forgive me if I call it
the iPhone X but um I'm gonna do a
little screen recording so if you guys
don't know first a quick tip is you can
record your iPhone screen from here all
you have to do is go into control center
I'll show you right now you go into
control center and then customize
controls and then you see I've selected
the screen recording right here alright
so first I'll show you my home page this
image I got from Pinterest I was looking
up like apartment decor inspiration and
this pink couch and the greenery really
spoke to me so I decided to put that as
my background to kind of envision my
ideal apartment since I'm planning to
move in a month or so so pretty exciting
before I open the phone I know a lot of
people will ask me about my phone case
so this is a super super-thin case that
I got off Amazon I think I just looked
up like thin iPhone X case I'll post a
link to where I got my case down below
but I know a lot of people ask questions
about it like even my brother he came
home from Seattle the other day he has
the same phone but he had like the Apple
case which is like pretty bulky and he
saw mine and he was like I hate you and
he immediately like purchased my case
and copied me so our phones like
identical alright so here is what's in
my iPhone just a quick glance at all my
apps I have three pages and you notice
that I don't like to put things on the
bottom row I kind of like to leave space
just because I don't want too many apps
on my front screen and I also really
care about like filling up most of the
apps like the last page I have one empty
space but preferably I like to fill it
out so the rows are even and I turn off
all badges I hate badges okay exception
is for like messages and just important
very urgent things
even for like email I turn off badges so
I don't know how many unread emails I
have unless I open the app and look at
it I just hate notifications and I hate
badges so that's how I just like to stay
sane because I don't like notifications
popping on my feed all the time so
obviously with a lot of apps I think I'm
just gonna walk you guys through my most
used apps as you can see the front page
layout I think my most used app is
probably Instagram Instagram is just
where I spend a lot of time too much
time actually that I want to spend less
time on Instagram in 2018 but yeah
follow me on lab and dairy if you don't
already and that's about it let's not
talk too much about the apps on my front
page I also like to keep the apps that I
use while I'm in the car because I don't
want to have to be swiping to find the
apps that I need so Spotify is like
right here on the bottom right I use
that all the time and audible I listen
to in the car I love listening to all
these books and then podcasts is also on
the front page but to be honest guys
even though I have a podcast of my own I
listen to audible more than I listen to
podcasts and that's just because I feel
more productive when I'm listening to a
book like an entire finished piece
versus like random episodes of podcast
because I feel podcasts are like a hit
or miss sometimes you'll really like an
episode and other times you feel like oh
that was it like I don't know I also
keep a lot of my social media on the
front page for easy access so YouTube I
go on a lot snapchat I use that to
connect with like friends and family
more than like my social stuff one of my
favorite apps is called day one I've
talked about this so many times this is
my journaling app and in a way that I
just use this to document my actual life
and bullet point the things I do every
day and as you can see I have like an
entry for every day and I've literally
had this for years I can go back to
let's say I think I got this app in 2011
November 2011 was when I started this
app of course I didn't post so much but
starting in 2012 no I think it was
2013-14 that's when I started to post
like almost every day and more recently
day one allows you to add multiple
pictures per post so I
love adding photos every day of my life
just so I can visually look back at my
life it's like my favorite way of like
keeping my memories in one digital place
and what's great is you can export your
entries into a PDF you can sync it to
your Dropbox which is what I do so I
make sure that there's no way I can like
lose this content so moving on I think
you guys are interested in my
photography apps so I mainly use vsco
and pict app go for editing photos I
have a whole video on how I edit
Instagram photos it obviously has
changed a little bit since then because
I bought a subscription to visco X and
what that is is you pay $20 a year and
you get like all of visco filters plus
like a new filter every month and you
get to filter videos which is what I
love so I love to like filter my videos
and then put them on Instagram stories I
don't know I think that's pretty fun and
I think the $20 a year is definitely
worth it and on the bottom wunderlist is
my favorite to-do list app even though
they're not continuing on I think
Microsoft bought them out but I don't
care the app is still functional and I'm
using it now next a wonder list is n
friend which is my favorite meditation
app I've talked about this a lot on my
channel as well
Unum this one's fun I've mentioned this
in my Instagram video but this is the
app that I use to plan my Instagram feed
so I love that you can just like switch
photos around alright moving on to the
second page which is more like work
slash business related apps these are
apps I don't use as often as the ones on
the front page but still ones that I
want easier access to than like the last
page I just try to organize them by
frequency of use and a little bit by
category even though sometimes it's not
super organized exactly by category on
the top right I have mint which is my
favorite money tracking app I love that
it shows you trends on how much you
spend every month how much you make
every month and you can see the trends
for your year like how much you're
spending whether it stays the same or
you're spending more or spending less I
just really like using that for like
visually seeing where my money is and
where it's going another app that you
guys might be interested in is
called moments this is an app that
tracks how much time you're spending on
your phone it tracks it by how much time
your phone is left on so sometimes if
you're not even on your phone but your
phone is on it is really interesting
just subtract how much time you're
actually spending looking at your screen
because you want to reduce that amount
of time and actually live in the real
world another thing you might notice is
I have two email apps one is Gmail on
the second page and one is inbox that's
on the bottom so inbox is linked to my
personal email accounts and then my
Gmail is linked to my lab and dere
business accounts so I keep the Gmail on
the second page because I don't want to
constantly be thinking about work and
business-related
emails I like to keep my personal and
business email separate and it's just
nice to have on the second page I just
left it that way and it doesn't bother
me so yeah so Trello is another
productivity app that I like to use to
organize like my plans and my project so
for example I have a Trello board for my
workbook like everything I had to do
related to the workbook and then I have
like content ideas so I have like a
whole Trello for like ideas that I like
to keep and organize all right my last
page is for like everything else I have
just Apple related apps that I don't
like and I don't use so I just keep them
in its own Apple folder and then media
this is just really just like random
shopping sites like as you can see I'm
not the categories are not exact
here I have travel related apps I know
some of these are like bank and money
apps but I just wanted to throw it in
there because I don't want to make a new
folder for them but yeah
uber lyft Airbnb this is a cool app
underground is an app that I found out
through Sara deechi it's just a weather
app that gives you more information more
data than like your standard weather app
on your iPhone so when you're traveling
it's really helpful to look up where you
are and see the weather by the hour
because you want to know whether it
starts raining later in the day or
whatever Wow look at this air quality
index unhealthy for sensitive groups is
that crazy you see it gets real detailed
I also have some control apps that are
related to controlling things in my
house
then I have venmo Shazam sign now TV
time is a cool app that I use to track
the episodes of the TV shows that I
watch because sometimes I lose track and
it's fun because it's like also has a
social element so when I was really into
watching Tara's house after you watched
the episode you can go onto the app and
see what other people are saying about
the TV show and like comment and just
laugh at like the gifts that people post
about it so that's fun and then here I
just have to like media streaming apps
that I personally don't use it's just
cuz my boyfriend downloaded it to watch
movies and shows on my phone so face app
is actually just a really funny app that
I found that I feel is a really nice
icebreaker with your friends cuz you
take a picture of your face and then you
could transform it into like young old
movie star man
like you could turn males into females
and females into males and it's just
really funny because I don't know it's
entertaining to show people like this is
what you look like when you're old this
is you as a guy and so I'll show you
I'll do like a quick little okay so
we'll wait for it to process oh what's
also weird oh I'm so awkward in that
photo
it can make you fake smile look at this
yeah and then me when I'm old ding are
you guys seeing this
me when I'm young it's the same but the
skin is like a little smoother okay and
lastly me as a male and you just think
it's so funny it's so entertaining like
look at this oh my gosh okay so I found
that sometimes you're in like a social
situation where maybe you don't have
anything to talk about you'd be like oh
my god I have to show you this app and
so that's why I keep this app on my
phone
