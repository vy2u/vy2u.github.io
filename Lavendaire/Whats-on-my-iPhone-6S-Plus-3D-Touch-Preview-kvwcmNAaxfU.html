today I'm going to show you what is on
my iPhone 6s plus this is a new phone
and I'm just going to show you the cool
features on the 6s plus and my favorite
apps alright here's my lockscreen I
really like it because this phone has
the fourth touch or 3d touch and when
you touch it harder smoke moves like
that so it really is just a fun cool
effect also I want to show you more on
the force touch in 6s plus for example
you've probably seen the camera you can
tap harder to take a selfie or do
anything else
look there's there's you guys in the
camera and that's me that's me alright
going back you can also do this to
Instagram so you tap Instagram harder
you could go a new post view activity
search direct so let's go to view
activity and yeah some cool activity
going on so in Instagram you can just
force touch a photo to peek at it and
you can also swipe up if you want to
like comment or send a message or
anything which i think is pretty cool so
as I'm scrolling my homepage I can
totally be like oh I'm interested in
this person so you get a preview of
their profile and you can swipe up to
just see more I know that the 3d touch
is really new so I can't wait for other
apps to incorporate it for me it's just
really fun to just like touch hard just
to get a preview of someone's profile
without clicking into it if you want to
click into it I think you just touch it
harder and you go in so yeah so on my
front page I have safari calendar
Instagram camera photos youtube wave' is
my favorite GPS app this is the app that
gets you through traffic Google Maps
facebook Messenger Twitter snapchat yo I
love to use Yelp to like look for food
and stuff day one is my favorite app I
use this everyday to journal and
calendar so you can see that everything
that's blue means that I have an entry
so I've tried to make an entry at least
once a day
and I try to put a photo with each entry
so you can also see your entries in a
timeline form it's a really great way
for me to keep track of my memories and
also just to make sure that I'm doing
something productive each day Simplenote
is the app that I like to use for taking
notes
SoundCloud for music obviously
wunderlist is my favorite list app so
you can categorize your list I just
really like to make lists and categorize
my stuff because that's how I keep track
of things I can't remember things on my
own
here I have my bucket list so I have a
list of the books that I've read and I
usually try to date them when I finish
them and here's my reading list list of
books that I want to read and I also
have a watch list for things I want to
watch and places that I'd like to go for
adventures and random stuff wordsmith is
an app I used to put down song notes so
this is like really great if you like to
write and have ideas and projects and
stuff alright so under my daily category
I have Zen friend which is my favorite
meditation app Neil lager whenever I eat
a healthy meal or make a smoothie I
would take a photo actually I actually
haven't used this in a while but
basically I just like to keep track of
the green smoothies I make I don't know
why coach me is an app to kind of check
off the habits that you do for the day
so for example if I meditate go to the
gym or write morning pages I can just
check it off for the day I haven't
updated this in a while but if you guys
are interested in keeping track of your
habits that's a really good app coach me
clue is a great period tracking app I
highly recommend that and then I just
dumped the notes and reminders in there
social I have my socials WeChat whatsapp
full screen app pages Facebook FaceTime
I put Facebook in this little folder so
that I don't check it as often as I
check other things I just don't want to
get too distracted alright on page two I
just have some generic Apple stuff I
have mint which is the app that I use to
keep track of my finances and money
stuff in photography visco is probably
my most used filtering app and it's
super popular I'm sure you guys heard of
it I don't really use everything else
that often
most of the stuff are miscellaneous apps
that I do need podcast I listen to some
podcasts this is a new app that came
with this phone so I'm just going to
check it out
bitly I use this to shorten my links
Google Translate does come in handy
quite often because I travel a lot and
sometimes I just have to translate
Chinese stuff Amazon photo is my
favorite app to just upload my photos to
the cloud really once you open it it
will automatically upload your stuff
through Wi-Fi right now I guess I'm not
on Wi-Fi but when I am on Wi-Fi it
uploads and I can keep track of
everything online so the last page I
rarely go to on the first row are Apple
apps that are pretty cool to use iBooks
I usually read on my iPad but if I do
not have my iPad with me I can just read
on my iPhone and this is big enough that
is comfortable to read on Garageband is
really fun I've played with that I
haven't played with the rest yet and
these are just necessary apps uber venmo
PayPal Google Drive I work off Google
Drive everything is on that most
importantly my dock at the bottom these
are the apps that I use most often so
phone obviously inboxes my mail app this
is inbox by Google and I really like
this app because it keeps your inbox
really clean and it's just a really cool
interface and you can also swipe to
archives emails and swipe to snooze
emails as well and I really like that
messages for texting and my favorite app
of ever Spotify because this is where
all my music comes from and this is
where all my life comes from but yeah
you guys feel free to follow me on
instagram at lavender also on twitter
and snapchat lavender alright I hope you
enjoyed that little tour if you guys
have any favorite apps that you'd like
to recommend definitely comment them

apps thanks for watching and I will see
you guys next time
