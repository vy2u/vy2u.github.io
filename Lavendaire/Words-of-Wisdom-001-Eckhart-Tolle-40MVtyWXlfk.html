start a new series on my channel called
words of wisdom and in this series I'm
going to be sharing just a quote or
little tidbits of wisdom that has
inspired me and helped me in my journey
so that maybe it could inspire you in
some way as well so for the past two to
three years I've been collecting wisdom
on this notes document on my phone every
time I read something that inspires me
or moves me whether it's online or in a
book I put it in this document and I'm
pretty picky about what I put because I
only put the things that I make sure I
want to remember and live by forever
today I'm sharing the most recent quote
from my wisdom collection and it comes
from the book that I'm reading right now
called the power of now by Eckhart Tolle
whatever your situation accept it fully
if you don't like something take action
to change it leave the situation or
surrender and accept it all else is
madness what this quote is saying is
that you have to learn to fully accept
the current moment that is right in
front of you either you accept it for
what it is or you accept that you have
to do something about it whether that is
to change the situation or to leave the
situation so many times we have these
negative feelings about our current
situation where either unhappy we're
angry were frustrated at our life
situation but all of that negativity
comes from resistance of really
accepting the current moment we don't
want to accept this current moment as
true for us and so that's what creates
all of those negative feelings once you
accept that this is your life in front
of you then you can start to take
positive action from there there's no
point in being unhappy or angry at your
situation and not doing anything about
it that is just madness as he calls it
because you're creating the suffering
for yourself so much of our suffering so
much of our neck
emotions are self-created and it's we
just realize that we can let go of those
feelings just like that then life can be
so much easier you can let go of being
unhappy you're frustrated angry whatever
and except the moment or start doing
something about it and once you're doing
something about it then you're not in
that stuck stick anymore and you're
actually looking forward to what else
you're creating and in that moment you
become empowered because now you're
actively creating what you want in your
life I'm going to repeat it again
whatever your situation accept it fully
if you don't like something take action
to change it leave the situation or
surrender and accept it all else is
madness
let me know what you guys think this
quote means in the comments and let me
know what kind of insights you are
getting from this as well I also created
a forum that you guys can use to submit
your words of wisdom for future videos
in this series and that link is below
let me know what you think of words of
wisdom as a series and I'll see you guys
in the next one bye
