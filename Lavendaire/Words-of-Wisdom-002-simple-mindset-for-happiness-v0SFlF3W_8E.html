the second installment of my series
words of wisdom where I'm going to be
sharing a little tidbit of wisdom that
I've collected something that's really
resonated with me and impacted my life
so today's words of wisdom is a simple
one-liner and the funny thing is I don't
even remember where I got this from but
I do remember the story that surrounds
this quote so the story is there was a
highly respected spiritual teacher on
stage and he asked the audience do you
know what my secret to happiness is and
then he said I don't mind what happens I
don't mind what happens so if you guys
have followed me for a while you know
that I mentioned this in a really old
video but I think it's worth mentioning
again because it's a simple line it's a
simple concept but it's it has so much
power to it so to live with the state of
I don't mind what happens means that you
don't care about the result of whatever
happens you don't really you're you
detach yourself from the outcome so life
is really a balance between what you can
control and what you can't control so
there are things that are in your
control like your actions your words and
your thoughts basically you can control
what you put in you can control what you
give but you can't control what comes
out you can't really control the outcome
because there are so many factors that
are out of your control that if you for
example if you cling on to a specific
outcome and you really really want
something to happen if it doesn't happen
you're gonna get disappointed you're
gonna blame yourself you might blame
others and just a lot of negativity
around that event but if you can let go
from the outcome just put your best foot
forward whatever you can in then
whatever happens happens and it doesn't
bother you I recently read this audio
book called the seven spiritual laws of
success by Deepak Chopra and in that
book two of his laws are the law of
intention and law of detachment so the
law of intention states that you have to
have an intention you have to kind of
know what you want decide what you want
and boom it's like a thought it's like
that message sent out to the universe
after you set your intention you have to
detach yourself from the results you
have to just detach and let it go and
that really is having the mindset of I
don't mind what happens because there
are so many factors so many moving parts
to this world that you have no idea
what's in store for you and you really
can't control what happens to you in
your life you have some control you have
like this much control but there's so
much that you can't control that if you
really can't cling to a specific outcome
or you might get hurt you might get
disappointed even if you end up in an
unfavorable position where you feel like
you failed or something wrong happened
that might be like something that leads
you to something better like you have no
idea what that means in your life so
don't get attached to a specific result
don't get attached to whether this event
will go well or not well or whatever
just live with a mindset I don't mind
what happens do your best work
do your part control what you can
control and let go of everything that
you can't control alright I hope you
liked today's words of wisdom please
write in the comments what your thoughts
are if you have any of your own
interpretations your own inspirations
let me know I'd love to know and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
