to words of wisdom my series where i
share pieces of wisdom that has impacted
me over the years so today i'm gonna
share a quote from Oprah's book what I
know for sure and it's a quote that I
wrote down in my journal when I was
reading this book last August so I read
it again last night and it really
resonated with me and how I've been
feeling it's just kind of put me in
check so the quote is this sometimes we
get so focused on the difficulty of our
climb that we lose sight of being
grateful for simply having a mountain to
climb so this quote really just like
resonated with me last night because I
feel like it brought me back and check
with myself I feel like lately I've been
kind of stressed or anxious about work
and just kind of putting this pressure
on myself to like grow and grow and like
improve what I'm doing I'm always trying
to like get better at my work at
creating videos and podcast and I'm
always doing research and looking at
what other people are doing and it could
be a lot of pressure and it just feels
so like unn insecure basically it feels
like I'm unstable when I focus on the
difficulty of the climb but I mean I am
so lucky to be doing what I'm doing I'm
so grateful to just simply have a
mountain to climb I mean obviously it's
a blessing to be a content creator and
try to make it work as a living I mean
it's hard trying to make it work as a
living like as a career but it's also a
blessing to be even able to pursue it in
the first place so I think that I'm just
grateful to have a life that I
absolutely love I could totally be in
other places and other jobs where I hate
my life and I'm not motivated every day
but I'm at a place where I'm super
motivated every day because I'm my own
boss and I have to keep myself
accountable and I have to be my own like
motivator I have to push myself
sometimes I could push myself a little
bit too hard and so at times like these
it's
to remember to just be grateful that I
have a mountain to climb a mountain that
I love a mountain that I would not give
up for anything in the world so maybe
you guys are going through tough times
in your life in your career your
relationships I'm not sure but just to
remember that it's a blessing to even
have a mountain to climb whatever if
you're working towards like making a
relationship work it's a blessing to
have a relationship or if you're working
to just make life work out it's a
blessing to be alive it's a blessing to
just be healthy if you're healthy oh my
god you're so lucky because you have
everything you need to walk and to go
about life and do the things that you
want to do it's just a blessing to be
here in the first place on earth as
humans you know you could have been a
plant or an animal or something else but
you're a human right now and that's
awesome that's SuperDuper awesome and
this quote also makes me think back on
the times where I was super lost in life
where I was stuck I did not know what to
do I was like a young fresh grad I had
so many like hopes and dreams but I was
frustrated because I didn't know what
mountain to climb
so now that I figured my life out a
little bit more I have like a goal I
have like a target now I'm grateful to
be able to have found that because a lot
of people might not have found that yet
but if you do have a mountain to climb
right now be grateful be grateful for
what you have alright I hope you guys

mountain are you climbing right now what
are you grateful for and just what other
