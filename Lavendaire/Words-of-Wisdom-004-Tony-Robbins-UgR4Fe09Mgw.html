wisdom so if any of you are new here
words of wisdom is a series where i
share quotes and words that have
inspired me and shaped my life or my
mindset in some positive way so today's
words of wisdom comes from Tony Robbins
and it's not really an exact quote but
more of an idea and it comes from his
documentary I am NOT your guru so in
that documentary he says your problems
are your gifts and that is a concept
that once I heard it I was like whoa
that's so true basically a problem that
most humans have is we think we
shouldn't have problems and we don't
want problems where we try to avoid
problems as much as possible or we just
think that we shouldn't have them we're
like I have this problem or this issue
and I you know you think a perfect life
is a life without problems but actually
your problems are there for a purpose
and there for a reason your problems are
actually your gifts and you should start
to look at your problems from that angle
that your problem is a blessing because
every problem that you have shapes you
in some way every problem that you have
every struggle that you go through makes
you a stronger person in some way so
we're not meant to live life without
problems problems and struggles and
challenges are going to happen and
they're there to teach us something to
help us grow to help us be stronger and
I think that's just like a really fresh
way to look at it don't try to avoid
your problems don't act like you don't
have problems and don't act like you
don't want to have problems in the
future because you're gonna have
problems you're gonna have challenges
you're gonna have hard times and you
should instead be grateful for them see
those problems as a blessing as hard as
it can be to just see it as like
something to help push you to be a
better person
in any shape way or form whatever it may
be so I think in the documentary the
example that he explained it with was
this girl who didn't have a good
relationship with her father and that
kind of fueled a lot of her anger and
her insecurities inside and she just was
so passionate about doing something good
in the world they're doing something
with her life she's like a very
passionate ambitious woman with a lot of
fire inside and she was angry at her
father angry at her father for being a
drug addict for abandoning her or just
whatever it may be
so Tony Robbins was like you need to
thank him thank your father for what
he's done to you instead of hate him or
be angry at him for what he's done to
you thank him because everything that
he's done fueled your fire and made you
into this strong beautiful woman that
you are and I think most of us should
start to see our problems more in that
sense that you know we're throwing
things in life not because like we're
not lucky or were kind of like not loved
that you know all these problems come
our way it's not to do with that but our
problems are really there to teach us a
lesson to push us to become more of the
person that we're capable of becoming
and I'm sure there will be a lot of
devil's advocates to this this idea or
this concept but I don't know I really
like seeing it in this fresh way that
your problems are your gifts and you
should learn to be thankful for them and
appreciate all your problems like
appreciate everything in your life the
good and the bad so I hope you guys like
today's words of wisdom let me know what
you think about this quote your problems
are your gifts and just yeah post your
thoughts in the comments I'd love to
hear them and I'd love to just like it
get some conversation and discussion
going thank you guys so much for being
here and I will see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
