today I'm so excited to bring back my
series words of wisdom so thank you guys
for requesting me to bring it back I
thought that nobody liked it but
apparently you guys do so thank you for
that so if you're new here words of
wisdom is a series where I share my
favorite quotes or pieces of wisdom that
have impacted my life in a positive way
so today I'm sharing a quote that I
heard off the magic lessons podcast with
Elizabeth Gilbert which is amazing check
it out if you don't know it already but
the quote is this just as we know the
ocean because it always tastes of salt
we can recognize enlightenment because
it always tastes of freedom I love this
quote and it just makes me feel so like
so refreshed and nice and peaceful
because they were talking about it in
the podcast that don't try just allow if
you're trying too hard that's not the
right state of mind you should just sit
back and relax and enlightenment feels
like freedom basically lately I've
noticed that I always come back to the
word freedom as one of my core words and
I realized that it's because all of my
goals are basically in pursuit of
freedom you know I want to have the
freedom to live the life that I want to
live I want to have the freedom to do
what I want to do to create what I want
to create I want to have financial
freedom I want to be able to take care
of myself and my family and not have to
worry or stress about money ever I want
to have freedom of time have the space
to you know pursue fun hobbies on the
side freedom to spend time with the
people that I want to spend it with
freedom is awesome and if you can think
of all the moments where you felt truly
free those were the moments where you
were 100% where you're meant to be where
you're being 100% yourself and that
feeling of freedom that relaxation that
peace is enlightenment in some shape or
form so it's a beautiful thing and this
quote just reminds me that moving
forward with my life
if ever I find myself like in a
stressful time or I'm trying too hard
maybe I need to take a step back because
I'm doing it wrong maybe I just need to
sit back and be present really see
what's in front of me maybe you know I'm
being too stubborn in an area maybe I
can find another way that flows better
with my life who knows but I just really
like this quote and I'm going to keep
going back to it whenever I feel like
I'm not free you know because
enlightenment feels like freedom and
anything that doesn't feel like freedom
is not your path so I hope you guys like
today's words of wisdom let me know what
you think in the comments and what I'd
love to know post a time where you felt
truly free and I think that will be
really really beautiful to read alright
thank you so much I will see you guys
next time
I post on Wednesdays and Sundays so come
back and watch my videos and have a
beautiful day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
