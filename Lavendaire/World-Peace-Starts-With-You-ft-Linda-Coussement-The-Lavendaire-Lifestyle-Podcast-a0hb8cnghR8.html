we're back with a new guest for the show

at how it is to be eucom hi Linda
hi there how are you I'm really good
good and you're calling from Amsterdam
am i right yes you're right
all right so Linda I want to hear about
your story so you said you used to be a
business consultant and now you're a
world peace warrior what where did that
come from what happened well I guess
I've gone through a struggle my entire
life something that I've been writing
about and talking about is that I've
always felt like I was missing a manual
to life everybody got it except for me
which is rather annoying interested
always smells like I like the outside
looking in and which is obviously not
very comfortable but I figured well
let's just try to be as normal as
possible and go through high school go
to university study business have to
prepare and have the car and the house
and everything and at a certain point I
have everything
and I realized that I wasn't quite happy
and that something didn't feel quite
right and that it was something missing
in my life something that was more
meaningful even though I didn't I wasn't
able to express that at that time and it
was also around the time that I started
doing yoga and I moved to Amsterdam and
I met a lot of people in the spiritual
scene and it sort of developed from
there but I've always kept the business
consulting and the spiritual part of my
life separate there were two different
streams in my life and at a certain
point I just felt like I just doesn't
make any sense anymore and the business
thing isn't making me happy it doesn't
give me the energy that I want to so I
decided to simply rent out my house and
pack my car and go travel through Europe
for a year and all sorts of people to
question how easy to be you so without a
plan or an agenda or anything just out
of curiosity and what made you come up
with that question well that goes back
to that manual of life a certain point I
felt that I might be able to write that
and then half an hour later I realized
okay I might not be the perfect person
to write it because I'm just one person
in seven billion but I could figure out
how it is to be someone else how people
experience life how they experience
emotions what they struggle with and
that's where the question came from so
you wanted to collect experiences the
human experience yeah that and I really
wanted to consciously connect with other
people without any judgment or really
going beyond my judgments okay so go on
after you started asking people to
question what happened well I was doing
that and I was traveling throughout
Europe living in Berlin and Budapest and
all sorts of really great cases and it
was rounded time where the Paris attacks
happened so there was the winter of 2015
where I realized that even though it was
great what I was doing I felt it needed
to be bigger still and that that dream
or ambition around world peace that that
was something that I really needed to
pursue I realized that world peace was
something that I wanted to actively work
on and that's when I decided to write
the everyday guide to world peace which
was really difficult because it started
as I mean how where do you even start
thinking of how to get to world peace so
in the one hand it is or the problem was
how to get there how to voice it in a
way that it makes sense to people that
it is something relatable and something
that people might want to get behind and
on the other hand there was this very
personal struggle and insecurity of me
being just me or these that's how it
felt
I'm just a Dutch girl I haven't studied
anything in that area I haven't worked
for any NGO I haven't experienced war or
trauma or anything so itself yeah I was
out of place in tackling this topic so I
have to overcome that first as well yeah
I mean once you wrote it can you tell us
a little bit about what's in it yeah of
course well even though World Peace
sounds giant and it is and I I really
doubt that we'll ever get there or at
least in our generation but the point is
is that it's our
with us that we can experience peace
within ourselves within our lives in the
relationships that we have with the
people close to us with the cashier in
the supermarket with people driving good
bus if we experience peace there and if
we live happy lives
it will become easier to let that
happiness overflow and spread and that
we can inspire other people to be happy
and peaceful through I agree yeah so
that that's basically the foundation and
the question how is it to be you is also
fundamental because I really think that
asking yourself this question how is it
to being me on a regular basis will give
you insights in yourself that you might
otherwise not get and asking this
question to other people will help you
understand people better and it will
help you realize that you're not the
only one who feels that way every now
and then and I I've experienced that
it's amazing that everybody just as
human as I am as everybody is and it
really helped me tell you our unique
differences instead of fearing them or
judging them and that's how I think we
can actually get to patience yeah can
you give some examples of answers that
people would say to how it is to be you
I'm just curious
it's very broad some people immediately
go through yes it's great to be me
because I love my family I love that I'm
able to take care of my family and that
I have friends who I can talk to and
they're very content with who they are
and then there's a friend of mine I
curtiss question she was one of the
first people I asked and she said well
it's really not that great to be me at
all but that's not what people want to
hear
so yeah in general it is okay and if you
really wanted to move into this positive
version of yourself whereas that wasn't
the truth so it really it really differs
and but all in all the conversations I
have on this question are incredibly
in-depth and insightful and rather
vulnerable as well there are many people
who struggle with insecurities and fears
and not being able to make the most out
of life and yeah apparently that's
something that we all do yeah I agree I
think if we all could like sit down at a
table if if you sit down at a table with
someone with my completely different
views from you I think if you can talk
it out and share your experiences at the
end of the day you can still be friends
like everyone will can still connect on
a human level you know because I yes
yeah I thought what I believe if you
truly share your authentic self and your
struggles whatever you're going through
anyone can relate yeah definitely but
it's also very scary
it's it's incredibly scary to be
vulnerable because it could very well be
that even though did you try to be open
and go beyond your own judgments that
other people might judge you and hurt
you yeah exactly so there is weird
disconnected we're all looking for this
human connection that's so open and so
role and so vulnerable and so meaningful
and yet we're afraid of it as well
I mean we're afraid cuz we're afraid to
get hurt because when you open up your
heart there is a possibility to get hurt
yeah definitely but it doesn't mean that
you
shouldn't do it know my motto or it's
not really my mother but if something
that I say a lot is that I at least for
myself will not let the things that
scare me stop me though in my business I
blog and I try to talk about very open
and personal things though I don't
always succeed but I want to vlog as
well so go on videos and when I do
interviews online on video that's
perfectly fine because I'm relating to
someone else and answering someone's
questions but I've been having so much
trouble of just getting beyond that
camera on my own and let my conscience
free flow around a certain topic
it feels jus too close to me so that's
that's an example of the vulnerability
that's so hard to to show and to share
even though this is obviously what I do
and what I what I try to inspire in
other people as well yeah I mean I'm
sure you've come like far in your
journey in the beginning you weren't
ready to share anything and then now
you're sharing a lot online so do you
have tips for people who want to become
more vulnerable and share online for me
it really helped to start with people I
trust and maybe not immediately go
online but have conversations and take a
personal growth type workshop or or two
or three first so that you learn how to
share yourself in front of someone else
in front of the group and that you
experience the the joy and the safety
and the energy you get from that how how
that experience is worth so much more
than not doing it once you've
experienced that it will become easier
and easy because you know what you've
got to win so you focus on what you have
to gain from sharing yourself
instead of what you have to lose or what
you have to fear and so that's one the
other thing is to just do it and that's
what I did with blogging and it's still
hard and sometimes I still think oh this
might be too much or I get stuck in
myself and I can't really share myself
which frustrates me to hell but it's
just a matter of trying and keep going
out there all right before we go on I
have to tell you about our sponsor fresh
books so if you're a freelancer or small
business owner fresh books is an easy
accounting software that's the simplest
way to be more organized and productive
with your day-to-day paperwork so with
fresh books you can send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds set up online payments
to get paid up to 4 days faster and more
even if you're not a freelancer you can
still use fresh books to keep track of
your expenses so my favorite part is
that you can take a photo of your
receipts with your phone and upload it
straight to this fresh book app as an
expense so it's super fast super easy
fresh books is offering a 30-day
unrestricted free trial to my listeners
so if you want to claim that just go to
fresh books calm slash lifestyle and
enter the lavender lifestyle in there
how did you hear about a section so that
fresh book calm slash lifestyle all
right that's for the interview I love it
so just to recap for our listeners you
first said that start with sharing with
a small group of people that you trust
with or and possibly take workshops gets
get your practice because the games that
you get from sharing your vulnerability
is so much better than not sharing right
and then secondly just do it which I
love yeah pretty much yeah yeah one of
the things that I am working on now is
developing a peace workshop and I've
done obviously a lot of workshops in the
business world but also in the personal
growth world and I know that I'm good in
front of a group and that I can
facilitate like the best of them but I
also know that one of the things that I
sometimes do is that I get into this
rational mode where I sort of think oh
this needs to be done and this needs to
be done and then it's me in my heels and
my my pencil skirt just organizing
everything just like I used to do as a
business consultant but in these piece
workshops it's all about vulnerability
like that has to be the core of it and
I'm designing an entire program but I
already know that that can change
immediately if the energy or the group
asks for something else or just
something else is necessary to get that
vulnerability out there and that can
only happen when I'm as for nura Balazs
possible which of course is assets carry
so what I'm planning now is a test
workshop with close friends who I trust
and who I know I can share myself with
but of whom I also know that they'll be
not so much critical but very
constructive in their feedback that
they're not afraid to tell me like it is
but in a very loving way so that's
that's that's um something that I do and
that very very much helps me as well and
move forward and go deeper into sharing
myself with the rest of the world
because I do feel that that's a
necessary thing that's wonderful I am
curious because especially today in our
culture I mean the inauguration of the
US president just happened like there's
all of the stuff that's changing and
there's a lot of tension a lot of just
uncertainty and I want to ask you what
is your best advice for people like us
normal regular people what can we do to
be peace warriors how can we improve the
state of things I guess you can go to
directions
surface which is what we've seen last
weekend which was amazing just go out
into the streets and express your
frustrations and your anger in a
peaceful way
and but one of the things that I've been
wondering myself obviously as well.they
yes of course is systems need to change
and the structures need to need to
change and there's the economy and
education system and well the political
minefield that obviously needs through
alter in a way that that makes much more
sense to everyone but I've got no clue
where to begin and I don't think anyone
does or where there are some people who
think they do but it's rather doubtful
that that they know everything or are
able to do everything so instead of
focusing on those things that you can't
really change and instead of pointing
fingers out of frustrations to people
who are way out of reach and who are not
willing to listen to you take the
responsibility for your own peace and
your own happiness and your own life
into your own hands and start reflecting
on yourself on that what makes you
unhappy what you can do to make yourself
happy and joyful and peaceful and I know
that's that's not always easy especially
when you're when you don't have a job or
when you're you're not living in a
country or an area that has an
infrastructure that's very supportive
but especially for us in the West the
the lucky ones
I guess we have the luxury to be able to
do that and we have the luxury to change
your lives and and redirect our lives in
such a way that it does bring us
happiness that we don't do what society
asks us to do or that we don't do what
our families have told us to do but that
we can do what we love to do what makes
our eyes shine and what makes our hearts
swell up each and every day because when
that happens you will instantly inspire
other people to do the same and it will
be very slowly
but that is the way that that we can
spread peace around in a more effective
and ultimately structural and
constructive way I love it I think you
answer the question perfectly because
peace really starts from within it
starts with yourself if you want to help
create world peace you have to make sure
that you have inner peace first and if
you are living happy peaceful life then
you're going to affect your community
around you which slowly trickles into
the rest of society it's not easy so if
it starts with like every individual
trickling into their own communities
then eventually we'll be at a better
State and I think that's it's beautiful
it's always good to remember to keep
peace and love first rather than getting
all caught up in the conflict and the
craziness and what's going on in the
world yes and also your happiness should
always come first
yeah I know how I mean my heart goes out
to to anyone suffering I mean I can't I
mean if I think about that too much or
if I if I open myself up to to death too
much I wouldn't be able to get out of
bed and because I want to help everyone
and I can't and I just don't even have
the space in myself to do so so I really
have to learn that my happiness comes
first because only when I feel happy in
myself when I feel good in my life when
I'm strong and healthy and I have my own
clarity that's when I can actually help
and that's something that a lot of
people especially women tend to forget
we tend to help other people first but
it's like you know in an airplane when
the oxygen masks come down you first
have to put your own oxygen mask on
before you can put it onto your your
child or whoever sits next to you and
that's really how this piece thing works
as well yeah I agree completely you have
to help yourself before you can help
others and I agree your your own
happiness is first yes yes okay I have a
couple last questions in there short
ones so I'm curious you have a current
favorite book or resource whether it's
like a podcast or blog that you love I
am a giant fan of ash amber J and she
runs the middle finger project book org
and she's really all about fields and
marketing and building business for
online entrepreneurs and but she does it
in a way that is so authentic and so
real and so human that her blogs are
just a joy to read because she's so open
and she really hits the stops between
humanity or being human and being a
business woman or men as well and then
it's it's incredible she's one of the
most authentic people out there that
I've discovered so far on the infinite
was great okay I'm going to ask you for
that link and I'll post the link to her
pH in the in the blog post of this
podcast awesome and then do you have a
favorite quote I think the first one
that springs to mind is used a lot but
it remains a good one plus I'm a big fan
of Star Wars so that would be do or
doing up there is no try
from Yoda nice nice all right and then
lastly where can our listeners find you
