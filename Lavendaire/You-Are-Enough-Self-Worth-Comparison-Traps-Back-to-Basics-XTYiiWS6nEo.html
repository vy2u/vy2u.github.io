to lavender
today is the fourth video in our back to
basics series and I just want to share a
little reminder today that you are
enough you are enough as you are you
don't even need to try you don't need to
do anything else you don't need to
change yourself you don't need to do
more you are enough you are good enough
as you are you are beautiful as you are
and you are whole so yes we are human
everyone has weaknesses and flaws but
you can still be enough even when you
have those weaknesses and flaws you are
still whole no matter what because I'm
referring to your soul your soul is
perfect your soul is beautiful there's
nothing wrong with you you are not
lacking in any area you are whole and
you are enough so this is like an
affirmation you can write it down you
can write down I am enough and meditate
on that statement repeat it to yourself
every day because it's such a
foundational way of thinking that can
set the stage to live a full and
beautiful life and the reason is because
you have to believe and know that you
are whole in order to feel at peace and
feel happier in life and I know it might
sound a little like lofty to some people
but maybe another way to say it is your
self-worth or your self-confidence or
your self-love but it's not the exact
same as self-love but it's related but I
just want you guys to ingrain this idea
in your head I am enough I don't need to
do more I don't need to try and do this
I don't need to change myself I am
enough and I am beautiful and perfect as
I am once we can truly believe this and
really ingrain it in your mindset then
you'll feel that your confidence grows
and you'll really feel strong and solid
in your self-worth you know that even if
you make mistakes in life or bad things
happen to you you fail you still know
your Worth and you still feel like
you are enough and you can do anything
you can take the next step and you can
still move forward enjoy your life live
a beautiful happy full life so there are
a few strategies that you can use to
remind yourself of yourself worth and
also cultivate a strong self-love which
I've mentioned in previous videos I'll
link myself like videos below for you to
dig deeper but one that I want to share
today is related to that comparison trap
so you know how sometimes on social
media we'll see other people's lives and
either you really admire this person or
you feel a little envious because you're
like oh man I don't feel like I'm as
good as this person or I'm as blank as
this person whether it's I'm as pretty
I'm as smart
I'm as whatever anything so I know that
that's something that a lot of us can
fall into but let me try to like flip
the script on this thing that we do so
next time you find yourself admiring
someone else or feeling envious of
someone else ask yourself what exactly
is the quality that you like or admire
or are envious in that person so why
does this person intrigue you why are
you attracted to this person maybe
you're inspired by them so I find myself
inspired by certain people or I kind of
like hang on to certain people's
Instagram like I take more time on it
for some reason I'm like drawn to them
whether I just admire them for some
reason right so dig deep on the
qualities of why you feel yourself
attracted to this person what is it
about this person that attracts you so
the interesting thing here is human
beings perceive the world in a way that
relates back to ourselves so you might
not realize it but everything that you
see in the world is a mirror of yourself
for example with your music taste you
know if you like a specific song it's
because you feel connected to that song
you feel like it relates to you in some
way like you see your own personality in
that song and vice versa even if it's
subconscious so you might notice like
calm and nice people like calm and nice
music and more adventurous people like
or like upbeat type music and you're a
positive or optimistic person then
you'll see one situation in a positive
optimistic light you'll mirror that with
your personality versus if you're
negative person or someone who doesn't
trust and others you might see that same
situation in a negative light so
everything you perceive as a mirror of
who you are so let's go back to that
comparison thing where you're digging
into that quality what are the qualities
that make yourself attracted or envious
or admiring of this person write those
down try to pinpoint what those are and
the reality is what you see in others
what you admire in others is what you
have within so instead of letting that
comparison trap get you down and make
you feel insecure and make you feel like
you're not good enough realize that what
you're seeing in those people you admire
in your idols is that you have those
same qualities within you that are
asking for you to bring them out they
want to come out that's why so for
example like if I'm looking at someone's
fashion Instagram and I'm like ding I
really like this girl's fashion like I
really like hooked on it that is a sign
that I have that fashion sense within me
and that quality in myself is asking to
come out more it's kind of like it's a
sign for you to maybe bring that quality
out because you have that within
yourself otherwise you why would you be
hooked on this person's like account so
I do this exercise with myself about a
month ago where I asked myself why am i
specifically attracted to these certain
people or why am I especially inspired
by these people that I constantly go
back to you know I'm always browsing
their YouTube or Instagram or whatever
and I was myself what are the qualities
in them that I really admired that I
really liked and I boiled it down to
things like this and I wrote it down on
my phone I wrote confidence style and
aesthetic I admired people who had wit
humor or were really fun also kindness
and good-heartedness so I realized that
I was really attract
to people with those qualities and when
I wrote those qualities down I realized
that hey maybe that just means that I
have those qualities within me and I
should just bring those out even more
and play with those even more so just
recognizing that everything is a mirror
and not letting that comparison trap
make you feel insecure but rather let
that empower you so let me know how this
goes this is just something that I was
playing around with a month ago it's not
something I learned from a book but I'd
love to hear your feedback on what you
think because I'm not even sure this
makes sense to people but if it makes
sense to you let me know I just want you
to know that you are enough you are
beautiful and you don't even need to try
you were perfect perfectly imperfect
forever lastly I want to share a quick
tool that can help you boost your
self-confidence and self-worth
it's called shine the shine is a text
messaging service that's free basically
you sign up and then you start getting
daily motivational inspirational text
messages that can just boost your day so
I've been signed up for about a month
now and just getting those like text
messages in the morning really puts my
day off to a good start it's really
uplifting and it's fun and like and so I
think it's really helpful to have that
external positive message to help
kick-start your own positive self-talk
so just continue reminding yourself I am
enough I am beautiful
whatever affirmation floats your boat
feel free to join the link to that is
