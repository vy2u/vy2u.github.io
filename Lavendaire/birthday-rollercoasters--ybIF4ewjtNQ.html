ride roller coasters because I actually
love roller coasters I just haven't been
on one in years I wanted to feel that
thrill and exhilaration that you don't
get anywhere else I wanted to scream and
laugh and nudge myself to the edge of
that comfort zone I wanted to celebrate
my youth to feel alive I'm grateful to
have spent this day with people I love
and adore my cousins who were my first
friends in life and my boyfriend we
picked a weekday to go so it wouldn't be
crowded and I appreciate how everyone
made space in their schedule to make it
happen one of my favorite feelings is
going to a theme park with no lines
that's like every kid's dream to have
the whole park to yourself and just roam
free
as I cross this intangible boundary into
my next year in life I think about what
matters most to me now all I want to do
is create and share things that bring me
joy and inspiration to live a life
that's healthy balanced and free
creative dreamy and meaningful a life
that's vivid vibrant and bursting with
love that is the life that called out to
me I gotta say life does get better with
age each year brings more joy more
opportunity and more abundance into my
life and I know I know that I'm so
blessed to be living truly living</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
