so today I'm here with a foundation
review I have not done a foundation
review I feel like in years like I
haven't done a video like this in
forever and I really go inspired because
at the beginning of this year I tried a
foundation and it honestly surprised me
so much I just knew I had to talk to you
guys about it I wore it in this video
right here because you'll watch this
video if you haven't already seen it but
I wore it and I didn't tell you guys
what it was and so many of you guys were
asking me what the foundation I was
wearing so I knew I was going to talk
about in a video but now I know for sure
that I had to do a video just on it I
would love to do more foundation reviews
in the future because I really want to
go into depth in different foundations
as you guys know my skin right now isn't
at its best and I really like to utilize
that the best I can to show you guys the
coverage of products to really show you
guys how it reacts on my skin so let me
know if you like this format of video
let me know how I can improve it down
below I'm trying to you know just like
up my game on my youtube channel as much
as possible so be sure to let me know
the kind of content you want to see even
me a thumbs up really lets me know that
you guys are enjoying it and if you can
leave me a comment down below as well
because that also helps a lot pretty
sure that's all I have to say for now
let's get on into this video so let me
tell you guys how I basically try this
foundation I was going out in the
evening and I was just wanted to really
quickly apply foundation I wanted it to
look matte because my skin was not
looking good that day I felt like no
foundations apart from the Fenty Beauty
profile to foundation that was the only
foundation that was working for me had a
couple of comments from you guys on my
channel letting me know that you have
broken out from the Fen TV foundation so
I wanted to try and cut that foundation
out because I just really wasn't sure if
that could be contributing to already my
bad skin so when it came to trying a
foundation for that night I saw this one
in my drawer and I decided to give it a
go and I was so surprised if a
foundation surprises me I just feel like
I have to tell you guys about it because
finding a good base for me is so
important and I just knew that I really
wanted to talk to you guys about this
foundation foundation I'm going to be
talking about today is the body shop
Matt clay skin clarifying found
I just want you guys to know although I
have worked with the body shop in the
past this video is not sponsored the
body shop does not know I'm making this
video all the opinions always even if a
video is sponsored that always my own I
just wanted to let you guys know that
studio isn't sponsored before I get a
comment but once I apply this foundation
I was pleasantly surprised and I was
like okay this looks really smooth it
actually reminded me a lot of the same
finish that I get from the Fanta beauty
purfles a foundation it really don't
remind me of it it's not a dupe or
anything but it is the closest I've
found in my collection that's quite a
liquidy formula it's not like whipped or
clay feeling even though it says clay in
the title I think that's what initially
put me off this foundation is the fact
that it said clay I was worried that it
was gonna be too thick and that's my
asshole it blends and really smoothly it
applies so flawlessly and I applied it
all over without saying it and I was
like okay first of all let me tell you
guys a little bit about this foundation
now it is actually mattifying clay with
purifying tea tree now when I initially
saw that it actually put me off because
I was worried that it was going to
affect my skin in some way and actually
did the opposite and break me out I
usually stay away from foundations that
have too much going on in them so what I
heard that I was like once giving it a
try I was so pleasantly surprised
because I actually noticed after using
this after a couple of days my skin
actually felt like it was improving
slightly now I'm not saying that this is
enough to cure my acne but I really did
feel like it could help aid in the
process whilst like I do the other
things in my routine to help clear up my
acne is 100% vegan which is amazing
related without petroleum and mineral
oil I almost always stay away from
mineral oil because it's like the worst
thing possible to someone that suffers
with acne is enriched with community why
can't I talk to them it's enriched with
community trade tea tree suitable for
sensitive skin forever against animal
testing
Matt's high coverage 24 hour long way 24
hours shine control breathable we're
pretty mote sclera looking skin and it
is not a pore clogging now I have to say
something about this after trying this
for a little while I can honestly say
that almost everything that they say is
true the only thing that I would say
that I never
agree with with any foundation is the
whole 24-hour thing I don't believe
anyone should ever have foundation on
for 24 hours 12 hours is my limit and if
it goes above that it just means I can't
take it off before then I know some
people work long hours but I always try
and take my makeup off as soon as I get
in just allow my skin to breathe
especially if you suffer with acne did
not supply any color corrector on to my
acne and I did that on purpose that you
guys could see the coverage of this
foundation one full layer was enough to
cover it but then I did go over a little
bit more just on the areas that I needed
it because I definitely feel like my
skin needs color correction just because
the redness can get pretty bad but
considering I never skip a color
correction just because I always feel
like I really really need it definitely
would say that it's actually quite
gentle on sensitive skin I do get
dryness on my skin as well just because
I have acne and I get oily doesn't mean
I don't get dry as well and on the
little dry areas I can sometimes fill
the tea tree um a little bit on it like
almost not reacting in a bad way but I
can feel it on the dry skin but that
goes away in like 30 seconds and I feel
like we're all good I would definitely
say if you are sensitive really really
sensitive always do a patch test because
it's not worth your whole face blowing
up if you try something on your skin if
that doesn't work out then definitely
didn't break out from this and I
definitely found that my skin looked
better after a couple of days I stopped
wearing this and I felt like my acne
kind of didn't get worse but I felt like
whatever the tea tree and the
ingredients within this we're doing
definitely did something for someone
that wears makeup a lot it's like I
don't give my skin that much time to
breathe daily but this is almost like
allowing my skin to breathe and be
treated whilst wearing makeup and whilst
having that high coverage and it is kind
of like a saving grace for me because
when I want full coverage I feel like
I'm almost hurting my acne and I'm like
hurting my skin instead of giving it
time to breathe whereas with this
foundation I don't feel like it's
affecting my skin whatsoever I would say
that my skin does still get oily
throughout the day although it's matte I
definitely still feel like it needs to
be set into place I still feel like it's
not matte to the point where it's like
you apply it and then it's just like
done it's kind of like I still feel like
if you've got really
should still set it and I would still
need to be topped up throughout the day
just because I do have a really oily
t-zone especially my nose I get really
oily but the best part about this
foundation is that it's only ten pounds
which i think is really inexpensive both
drugstore foundations are more expensive
than that nowadays they go above ten
pounds so it's really inexpensive the
pros of this foundation most certainly
outweigh the cons but let's just weigh
them up now just to see what this
foundation offers something I would
definitely say as a huge pro is the fact
that it is a really really good
foundation I believe for people with
acne I do think that if you do have acne
that you should take everything with a
pinch of salt what works for one person
may not necessarily work for another so
it may react to your skin another Pro is
that it is vegan and against animal
testing another thing that I absolutely
love about this foundation is just the
way that it looks it honestly looks
amazing it's so flawless I'm wearing it
today and my skin is actually having a
pretty bad day today but looking at it
you wouldn't know I honestly think it
looks like food a nice full coverage
foundation it's definitely more full
coverage than I wouldn't usually WAB
definitely say the biggest con and the
only one that I can really think of with
this foundation is just the shade range
there definitely isn't enough shade
ranges for deeper skin tones I think
there are at least eight shades of this
it's just the deeper skin tones that
there's not enough undertones in my
opinion so that's the con I would
probably say but if you are able to find
your shade I would definitely recommend
you guys trying this foundation I was
just so impressed with the formula of
this foundation I knew I had to
recommend it to you but I want to give
you guys the whole picture the PIRs of
this foundation which I definitely think
outweigh the bad but I do think that
it's a big con to not have a full shade
range and I do hope that the body shop
does eventually extend it definitely
recommend you guys giving it a try it's
only ten pounds and it honestly is one
of my new favourite foundation if you
like this format of video and you want
to see this with other foundations in
the future then be sure to give this
video a thumbs up and comment down below
any foundations you want me to do this
with I am all for trying new foundations
I honestly love trying base products
because of the way that my skin is and I
will be the guinea pig guys I honestly
don't mind doing it I will leave a link
to this foundation and down
if you want to purchase it anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I will
see you all in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
