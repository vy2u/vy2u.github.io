myself just so that you can get to know
me a little bit more another I've hit
5,000 of you I just feel like it's owed
that you guys get to know a little bit
about me I haven't really done any
personal videos so I thought I would
just do the first and tell you a little
bit of crucial things about myself so
the first thing that you guys ought to
know about me is my age I'm 19 years old
people never think I am I don't really
act my age to be honest and I'll explain
a little bit more about that later on in
the video but yeah I'm 19 I'm still
pretty young the second fact about me is
that I am a turkish cypriots that's my
origin that means that I originate from
people that went from Turkey the country
Turkey and then moved to Cyprus so I'm
technically from Cyprus but of the
Turkish origin and I have lived in
London my whole life I was born here
it's just one of my parents was born in
Cyprus and then the other one was also
born here but both both of my parents
are actually Cypriot so I am full
Turkish Cypriot the next fact about me
is that I am a professional makeup
artist people sometimes ask me if I've
actually trained for it and if this is
actually my job yes it is my job at this
moment in time I am that Matt cosmetic
still by I'm also a freelance artist as
well so that means that I work for
myself so when you hear me referring to
my freelance kit that means I am talking
about the private work that I do and for
the makeup that I use on my clients so
yeah I do both of them I've been doing
makeup for about two years now
professionally and yeah I've basically
been doing it since I was 17 so I
started young I did trained for it but I
was practically self-taught myself told
myself and then I went to college to get
and that's your qualification the next
fact about me is that I have a boyfriend
his name is Josh we are literally like
best friends we've been together for
four and a half years now and I
literally met him when I was 14 years
old and yeah we were highschool
sweethearts
we've been through a lot in our short
time together but he's an amazing person
and he's just behind a lot of the
encouragement
that has taken me to come as far as I am
and I'm so grateful for him I don't
really talk about him much in my videos
but he is one of the main reasons that I
am doing what I'm doing and I still have
the confidence to do I do the fifth
little fact about me is that I am a huge
nerd you would not think so but I
actually am the biggest nerd ever I
absolutely love games of the biggest
game burger I cannot wait for new game
releases it's the biggest nerd ever
trust me the next fact about me is that
I am a very homey person nothing sounds
better to me than going home and
relaxing it's not what I'm lazy but if I
ever have free time where I'm not doing
anything it's just I love relaxing in my
room or at home or just chilling in and
watching a movie that sounds so much
better to me then going out and going to
a party or something like that
number seven is that I absolutely love
animals I'm the hugest
animal lover I love every single animal
I have a cat and a dog my cat's name is
boo this is boo this is my cat and my
dog's name this storm
my dog is a husky I will try and find a
pit channel and set it here but he is
just the cutest thing and I love them
both so much and if I could I would have
my own animal shelter and have every
animal from orangutangs
to parrots - I just love animals and
there's not one animal that I do not
love the next fact about me is that I
literally watch Netflix every day
without fail I am addicted there are so
many series that I have absolutely been
loving at the moment some of them are on
Netflix some of them are some of my
favorites are pretty little liars I've
been absolutely loving that at the
moment Game of Thrones is one of my
absolute favorites that's my nerdy side
that comes out with the Dragons and
stuff I also watched The Walking Dead
and I'm really integrating that having
at the moment I just literally watched
them one after the other after the other
after the other when I do my makeup
before I go to work I have an addiction
and I'm proud like I said before I have
one brother and
you're really close he's my only sibling
we used to fight so much but we actually
are really close now so I'm so thankful
to have him in my life we actually have
so much in common number ten is that I
love candles absolutely love candles all
my family and friends know how much I
love them and I literally have a whole
drawer full of them because I absolutely
love lighting them especially this time
of year is walk number 11 is that I
wanted to be a microbiologist when I was
young I used to really love science I
used to love chemistry and biology the
most and I was actually really gifted in
that subject I'm really really good at
it I used to learn science for fun I
used to learn the periodic table off by
heart I could probably still recite it
to you but make ups my thing now if you
haven't been able to tell I am
absolutely the laziest person when it
comes to my hair I have really curly
frizzy hair so when I cannot be bothered
I cannot be bothered and I will
literally either chuck it up in a bun
chuck it up in this hairstyle or just
leave it frizzy and everything sometimes
it looks nice but when it gets to that
point where I really can't deal with it
it just has to grow up in a bun
I love having nice-looking hair I love
curling it and straightening it but I am
just so lazy I will most probably only
do it twice to three times a year that
needs to change I think I think I need
to do more often but yeah I do love
curly hair I think it's nice and easy
and it's nice to have a natural as well
I can be a pretty fussy when it comes to
certain meals but when I have something
that I like I could literally eat
throughout the whole day like I will
keep eating it's like a bottomless pit
everyone that knows me knows that I can
be a little bit up and down with my
appetite but when I'm in the moves where
I'm hungry there will be no food left at
this house like I said before I do not
act my age I act about twice my age
all my friends always tell me that I
give them relationship advice and it
gives them a life advice and they're
like am I actually taking life advice
from a 19 year old
suddenly act about twice my age I do not
act 19 at all kind of girl that goes
home sits around touched her feet up
with slippers on mix of tea
it's Grey's Anatomy and that is the
highlight of her day guys literally the
highlight of my day I have always been
creative in many different ways
especially writing I
Sunil of creative writing used to write
all the time when I was younger and I've
always actually wanted to write in book
books are something that is a bit up and
down with me I will read a book but it
has to be a really good one when it
comes to writing books I have always
wanted to write one number 16 is a
little bit of a personal one I am a
Christian I am a really strong believer
in God are gonna say really I don't want
people to start arguing about what they
believe but that's just personally what
I believe I really really do believe in
my faith and I am proud of it and it's a
huge part of who I am so if you want to
know me then that is definitely a big
fact about me I am a huge lover of
shopping if I am honestly shopping is
just one of them things that I feel is
definitely a therapy for me whenever I
feel like there's something going wrong
I'm like I need to show up I need to buy
something and it's always tends to be
makeup or clothes or skincare or
something I absolutely love it I feel
like material possessions don't give me
meaning but they just cheer me up one of
my dreams is to travel I would love to
travel with my boyfriend and to go and
see a lot of the world I believe that we
live in such a gorgeous world and
there's so little of it that I've seen
and I would just love to go and
experience this beautiful planet and I
would definitely definitely love to go
see America and do a road trip around
there I would love to see South America
Indonesia Thailand Fiji but if you're
basically the whole world I really want
to go everywhere and it just really
excites me knowing that the world is so
big and I just want to see it this is
the second last fact about me and this
is gonna be a bit of a random one but
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about
some of my favorite foods and the things
I like to drink if you know me Reese's
Pieces or the Reese's butter cups of
best things ever and I could eat a whole
bag plus a million in a row like I
absolutely love them I could eat them
over and over again
plus the M&amp;amp;Ms that have the peanut
butter in the middle oh my god they're
amazing I think the song about peanut
butter and chocolate together that just
it just really goes well with me also I
love apple juice I could drink apple
juice just apple juice I could drink
apple juice over and over again for
every day for the rest of my life
way over orange juice I'd rather
apple juice in the morning rather than
orange juice I love tea and coffee like
those are like my evening drinks I love
to drink a coffee and a tea in the
evening while I'm relaxing my mom makes
the best coffee ever another fact about
me is I am pretty lazy when it comes to
exercise my boyfriend is a personal
trainer so he's always trying to
influence me to go train with him which
I think I should I feel like I need to
just boost everything up a little bit
but yeah I'm pretty lazy so I'm still
getting around to it so hopefully I'm
gonna have a fitness regime soon bye so
lazy it's ridiculous
the last fact about me is that I
absolutely am so thankful for you guys

that the boring stuff is
/ I'm gonna show you what you guys could
possibly be gained there was just one
prize I didn't bother with doing
runners-up or anything like that it's my
first giveaway so I just wanted to do a
nice big prize and for someone to win so
these are all the prizes that you could
be winning I am going to be going
through them individually now I wanted
to give away to you the best products
possible because I know that you guys
deserve it the two products that you
could win are two mascaras one of the
mascaras is a zoom lash business mascara
by Mac it is in lofty brow I also got
you guys a black mascara as well this is
the Mac Studio sculpt lash in extra
black so you'd also be winning a black
mascara as dwell and that's a great
mascara as well it's really good to
define the lashes you'd also be winning
to Mac nail polishes and the colors are
in the overlock are in the blue tinted
one so this is like a top coat that
makes it like a nice blue sheen and then
this is also a limited edition one from
the Christmas collection and this is in
richly endowed and yep it's got the
Christmas Collection packaging and this
is really nice deep burgundy so it'll be
perfect for the wintertime so you will
be winning April my lip pencil in
fashion boost and this is just this
really nice magenta purple color and
it's a pro longwear one as well so that
means it's extra long lasting also a
fluid eye pencil so this is a I pencil
that comes out fluidly like a liquid and
it's like a twist up one so it's really
really good and it's really handy to
keep in your bag and the color is an
earth sign and this thing nice brown
tint with a bit of a purple and I love
using this around the iron smudging it
out for that smoky look this eyeshadow
quad from Mac as well called golden
hours this is from a limited edition
collection from a little while ago from
earlier this year been saving this on
for a while but it's this really nice
one with it's in mineralized and quad
and it has four different colors in it
that you can use and this is the extra
dimension skin finish in fairly precious
this was highly highly loved it from
this collection it's one of the extra
dimension ones also you could be winning
four pairs of lashes as a part of this
giveaway as well I'm gonna be giving
away three pairs of red cherry and one
Mac pair of lashes so the Mac lashes on
number fours these are one of my
favorites they're one
natural pair of lashes so these are
great and you can reuse them quite a few
times also we've got the number 30 pair
of lashes these are nice and full then
we've got the one one eight flashes by
red cherry and these are really natural
but long and then we have the seventy
six lashes from red cherry and these are
quite full and nice fully smokey eye I'm
also going to be giving away a widening
lightening twin pack of the super
booster whitening pen these retail quite
expensive actually so these are really
good they help to whiten the teeth I
like to put these on before I go to bed
and it just helps to lighten the teeth
slightly so these are really really good
to add to your normal teeth cleaning
routine and also I'm going to be
throwing in two NYX bronzers one is a
normal bronzer and one is a tango
bronzer which means that it has all the
different shades within it so you're
going to get both of those this most
gorgeous pinwheel and it's all very
shimmery so I'm imagine you could use
this as a highlighter rather than an
actual bronze us you'd basically be
getting a bronzer and a highlighter
which is amazing so that's the end of
the list of product in the description
