today I'm going to be doing a 2015
roundup basically just all of my
favorite products that i have just loved
this year now i have a bigger basket
full of stuff so i'm not going to be
going into each product too much because
as always I don't my video to be too
long so it's overwhelming for you guys
you've watched my channel quite a bit
these products will come as no surprise
to you because when I find a product I
really love I kind of just like hold on
to it and just use it so much so I'm not
really going to be explaining too much
about each product I'm just going to be
telling you guys what I love about it
what it does and that's pretty much it
there's gonna be no skin care in here
because I truly don't feel like in 2015
I found any skincare bits that are so
important or I have but feel like
they're worthy of being in this video I
will share my skincare routine once I'm
totally happy with it but right now I'm
still not happy to share any skincare
products because I just don't want to
say I really really love something and
then really that was one of the things
that was causing my breakups to be was
if that makes any sense so firstly i'm
going to be talking to you guys about my
favorite private something main ones is
this one right here this is the natural
radiance primer now this is I think one
of the only Mac products are actually in
here because I used to work for Mac I
definitely feel like since I left my job
at the beginning of 2015 I definitely
feel like once I left I wanted to
venture out and try as many non Mac
products as possible and it has lasted
me probably almost the whole year I have
not republish this once and it still
feels like there's a lot in here I
definitely feel like this really gave me
a lot for what it's worth innocence so I
definitely feel like it's worth there
plus it gives me so much hydration I
honestly feel like my makeup looks so
much better when i use this so this has
definitely been just a must-have for me
this year and then the second primer i
just wanted to mention was this one from
make up forever this is the Make Up For
Ever step 1 smoothing base and I
absolutely love this this is so good to
just smooth out my skin before I apply
any foundation and it definitely does
smooth out any imperfections and I just
feel like I've been using this a lot for
the second half of this year and I just
thought I just haven't been able to put
this down since I'm
corsair hope foundation again I decided
to pick two the first one is the ex1
invisible foundation this will come as
no surprise to people that have been
watching my videos quite a bit I use
this a lot and as you can tell by the
bottle and I use this all the time off
camera and a lot on camera as well I
really love this foundation I have this
in the shade f300 and I just feel like
it's one of the most perfect formulas I
feel like it smooths out my skin
perfectly 2015 I definitely feel like it
was a huge discovery this is the Loreal
infallible 24-hour stay fresh foundation
and I absolutely love this I have this
initiate 260 and this is kind of like my
dupe for the mac studio fix I feel like
it has a really nice full coverage and
makes your skin look flawless it looks
beautiful in pictures and yeah I
definitely feel like this was one of the
highlights of 2015 mainly again towards
the end of the year next I just wanted
to mention one concealer by so many
concealers so I definitely feel like I
have lots and lots to choose from in my
collection but I always end up going
back to one and it always just ends up
being my favorite and that is the
Maybelline fit me concealer as you can
see i'm running dangerously low on this
i absolutely love this concealer it's
very lightweight like you really can't
feel it on your skin it feels really
nice but it brightens the under eyes so
beautifully and I just absolutely love
this this is in the shade 20 and it's a
really nice yellow undertone so we
really highlights those under eyes and
just looks perfect and I feel like once
you set it it doesn't crease either
which I love and now I'm going to tell
you guys about a powder that will come
as no surprise to anyone you have
watched one of my videos i'm pretty sure
i've mentioned in every single video how
much i love this powder this is the soap
&amp;amp; Glory caicos instant retouch pressed
powder is this every single day without
fail unless I'm going to be baking my
skin and apart from that I use it every
single day I just can't seem to step
away from it it blurs my skin
beautifully and I feel like I don't know
what it is it just looks amazing on my
skills is life my best powder I love you
so only have one bronzer to mention
because this one was just the clear
winner for me so I feel like I couldn't
even put another bronzer next to this
one because this is the other bronzer
that I've just
loving now I know I said that the other
mac primal is the only back product but
this is the second Mac product I think
this is the last one is the mac
mineralize skinfinish in dark golden now
this is the most perfect bronzer shade
for my skin tone it just looks
unbelievably beautiful like it looks
golden and it just looks nice and olive
and I thought for olive skin it's
perfect and I definitely feel like for
people with tan skin it just gives a
really nice healthy glow and I love that
as for highlighters I had to pick two
because although i found one halfway
through the year there was also one that
i love to towards the beginning of the
years well the one that kind of stole
the show at the beginning of this year
was becca opal because flying everywhere
they go over was definitely just I don't
know I just used it so much and it was
one of my first like intense highlighted
that I purchased highlight kind of
turned me into a highlight freak because
I loved it so much that all I wanted
after that was just intense gold
highlights and so opal is definitely one
of my favorites as you can see it's been
dug into quite a bit and it's still
going strong the new next one is just my
favorite highlight of all time this is
the law of gala gilded honey illuminator
in gilded honey and I think this is the
Laura Geller baked gelato swell
illuminator and the kulluk gilded honey
now this is definitely my favorite
highlight of all time use this almost on
an everyday basis apart from when I want
to switch things up a little bit but
apart from that when i use another
highlight I just missed this one so much
because it just gives such an intense
golden glow and that is what I really
really liked wanted to mention my brow
products that I found in 2015 and that
will probably be my favorite brow
products for ever and a 15 was the first
time I ever tried her brow products and
I have just not turned back whenever I
use anything else my brows just do not
look the same the brow is is amazing
this is definitely the best brow pencil
I have ever used this is the brow is in
the color dark brown and I just love
everything about this and then this
saved my life this brow Joe is the best
brow gel I've ever used I've used lots
of brow gels in my past from multiple
different companies and nothing's ever
kind of stood out to me like this one
the reason why I love it is because you
apply it and once
that it does not move all day I just
wanted to mention a few eyeshadow
products the first one is the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette now I just wanted
to pick one palette that was my favorite
palette of 2015 formula of these shadows
of beautiful the smell makes me hungry
and I just absolutely love the color
combinations that she faced a pair of
course 2015 was the year that i finally
got to try makeup geek eyeshadows after
months and months of you guys just
telling me layla you need to try them
you need to try them you need to try
them i finally got the chance to and i
am honestly in love with these now at
the bottom of course those aren't makeup
geek eyeshadows that one's a makeup geek
blush but these are all of my must-have
makeup geek eyeshadows of course their
own neutral and because they kind of
must-haves and these are the ones I
would reach for your formula and makeup
geek eyeshadows like no other and I
definitely feel like since i got these i
have not touched mac eyeshadows almost
at all since i got these and i used to
love my mac eyeshadow and unbelievably
into each and every color I just feel
like you can blend two colors that don't
even look the same together and they
just blend perfectly the formula of
these are unbelievable and they are
definitely just one of the main
highlights of 2015 in general gig is for
me the best eyeshadow brand I have tried
especially but how inexpensive each I
should have found it as you guys know I
am a huge eyelash freak I want to switch
you guys about to eyelash styles the
first one is the house of lashes iconic
now I must have got these maybe three
months ago maybe less than that maybe
even two months ago one of my favorite
stars of lashes I fell in love with them
instantly and I definitely understand
why so many beauty gurus talk about
these lashes because they are absolutely
unbelievable course I had to include the
ILA 126 lashes because they are
definitely one of the most used lashes I
think I use throughout the whole over
2015 whenever I want to go for something
that's just nice but not too much these
are the lashes I tend to go for and I
just fell in love with these and these
will definitely be just one of my
favorite lifestyles forever and lastly i
have three
lip products I wanted to talk to you
guys about the first one is a lip liner
this is the key code 504 lip liner now
the akiko that violence in general were
my favorite of 2015 but to pick a color
this just definitely has to be my
favorites this is absolutely
unbelievable it's just the most gorgeous
and move color and I just love this and
I've definitely been saving this because
I want it oh my gosh i need another
one's almost waterproof it stays on all
day and it's just so pigmented so i love
this lip liner and i have two liquid
lipsticks the first one is the NYX soft
matte lip cream in Cannes now this was
quite a recent discovery for me but it
is just taken storm of my makeup life
and this goes on top of almost every
single lip I usually ever do its a mix
this with the lip liner that I just
mentioned and it just looks absolutely
gorgeous my last one is the LA splash
liquid lip couture lipstick and this is
in the color innocent vixen and the
reason why I picked this was because
this is just the most perfect nude in
the whole world like can you see this
but this is stunning it's so long
wearing and I just absolutely love the
color of this so yeah I went through
that pretty quickly i'm quite proud of
myself for not babbling on too much i
love these products so much and they
have just been just my must-haves this
whole year but one last thing before you
go I just wanted to say that one of the
biggest highlights of this year has been
the platform we're talking on right now
and that has been YouTube my youtube
channel has just flourished this year I
told me in January 2015 that by the end
of this year I would be on my way to
almost 300,000 subscribers I would have
laughed in your face and been like shut
up no way that's not happening I would
not have believed it I believe that this
was what I wanted to do and that is why
I left my job because I knew this is why
I wanted and I knew that this was what
was going to make me happy but I did not
expect this and I just want to thank
every single person out there I know
