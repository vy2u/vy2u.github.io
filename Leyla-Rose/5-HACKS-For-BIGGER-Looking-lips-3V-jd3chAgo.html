today I want to be showing you five
hacks for bigger looking lips using
makeup I love all of these hacks and
they work really well this video is
actually requested because lots of you
guys wanted to see how I overlined my
lips I know lots of people don't like
the way that over lined lips look so if
you don't like that kind of thing then
this video isn't for you because it does
involve quite a bit of overlining I
personally love the way it looks I love
making my lips look a little bit plumper
and that's just my personal preference
it doesn't necessarily mean I don't like
the way I look with nothing on my lips I
just like having fun with makeup and
that's what I think makeup is all about
just having a little bit fun and
switching things up so yeah just want to
say that just because I like the way
pomf political myself doesn't mean I
think that big lips are the only way to
go big lip small lips wild lips it
doesn't matter all people with all that
shapes are beautiful that goes for every
feature so with that aside let's get
straight onto the hacks so hack number
one is going to be contouring and
highlighting around the mouth area there
are quite a few ways to do this but the
way I personally like to do it is first
of all highlight your Cupid's bow so I
just go along the two lines that come
just down from the nostrils and then
also just go on the top lip as well just
to highlight and bring this area forward
this will of course make your top lip
look a little bit more stand out ish
which therefore makes it look a little
bit fuller and then I do ICU contour in
between the Cupid's bow and also on my
bottom lip as well doing it just
underneath the bottom lip will make the
lip look like it's hanging down a little
bit more making it their full plumper
and then I'm also just contouring in
between the Cupid's bow as well just in
that little dip to really make that keep
his bow that stand out a lot more and
you can skip this if you already have
quite defined Cupid's bow but personally
I don't so I like to keep this hack I
used a cream for contouring but you can
use a powder or whatever you feel most
comfortable with hack number two is a
little bit of an obvious one and this
one is to over line but the real hack
with this is to only over line in the
center now this is roughly a guide to go
along I mean everyone's lip shape is
different but this is something that
tends to work on the majority of lip
shapes it makes the lip look plumper and
more pouty err to the center of the lip
so is the same with the top and the
bottom on the bottom I just over lined
on the very center and then joined up
with the rest of my lip afterwards and
then it's the same with the top as well
you do want to just over line that very
center
like that and then you're gonna join up
the rest of the lip and that way it
looks a little bit more natural if your
lips are like me and you have a very
sort of defined tip of the lip on the
upper lip you can see the shadow very
obviously the next hack is going to show
you how to cover that so the hack number
three this is gonna help if you find
that personally when you over line it
just looks too obvious especially on the
upper lip what I find personally helps
is to go around the outer part of the
lips with a darker lip pencil so I've
already filled in all of my lips and now
I'm just going across the outer part of
my lips with this darker lip liner this
one is cork from Mac and I'm just going
across the very edge of the new lip line
we've created and I also just covered up
that Cupid's bow area where you could
really see that my lips were over lined
and this really helped you do want to
make sure that you are going across the
outer part of your lip very lightly
using a light hand and then you want to
make sure that you blend it very well as
well so I do like to go on the outer
corners of my lip to really make sure
this color looks natural coinciding with
the color we apply it all over the lips
and also I like to blend it with my
finger too hack number four is to use a
lighter lipstick on the center of your
lips now this works really well
especially if you like to go for a matte
lip I know that a lot of people don't
like to go for a gloss so this just adds
a little bit of dimension to the lips
this gives the illusion that the lips
are actually really really plump when in
reality then not actually as plump as
what it makes it look like it makes it
look like the center is standing out a
lot more than the outer parts and this
in turn makes everything look a lot more
plump and I really like this especially
if I'm going for a matte lip and my last
hack that I have for you is to gloss it
up I am not kidding once you apply all
of these hacks and you make sure that
you kind of over lined your lips quite a
little bit going on with a super shiny
gloss makes the lips look so much more
voluptuous it makes it look shiny and
just it really adds a lot of dimension
to the lips and this really really helps
so as you can see I'm even going on top
of where we over lined and personally I
think this makes my lips look super
super full and I love love the way it
looks so I really hope you guys enjoyed
