today I'm going to be sharing with you
my top 5 lip combinations that I love to
use and I'm first going to be showing
you my very favorite one the top one is
my nude combo which you guys see me do
all the time it's using a cream a spy's
lip liner from Mac and honey love
lipstick from Mac also this is my
favorite lip combination because it is
just the most stunning nude it just
emphasizes the lips just enough while
still looking quite natural as well and
the lip liner is really good because you
can sort of over draw the lips a little
bit so if you do want to make your
lipstick a little bit fuller you can do
that and I'm just applying the koomer
spice lip liner all over the line and I
don't tend to go on the actual lips so
much but you can do if you want to and
then once I'm done with that I just tend
to go in with my honey love lipstick and
just to go on top of that and then
usually what I tend to do is just blend
it out with my finger or I'll go back
into the lip liner and just sort of draw
on the line a little bit more and that
will just make it a little bit more
defined but my opinion this nude is just
the most gorgeous nude it just
complements my particular skin tone
really really well and no joke guys the
cream stick lip liners from Mac are
incredible so there are definitely one
of my favorite types of lip liners and
as you can see it can just go with any
eye look and I just absolutely love it
the next one that I'm going to be
showing you is my usual pink lip that I
tend to use and this is using a salt lip
pencil and NYX soft matte lip cream in
Istanbul I believe and this is one of my
favorite Pink's to use because it's dark
enough that it doesn't look too Barbie
pink but it also does look really
feminine and pretty at the same time and
it's just amazing I really really like
it and I do tend to over draw my lips a
little bit obviously that is up to you
if you would like to do that I just feel
that it emphasizes my lips a little bit
more than what my lip shape back
naturally gives me and so I just tend to
fill in my lips all over with the lip
pencil and then I tend to go over with
the soft matte lip cream on top of it
just because it gives it that a little
bit extra of a boost so I just used the
applicator that it actually has and I
apply it to the center of my bottom lip
and then the center of my top lip as
well so this is what it looks like with
it all on and as you can see again it
does go with any eye look it is really
pretty it still looks like a natural lip
color but it still has a nice essence of
pink as well
the next one is a cool tone nude using
Mac blankety lipstick and Mac's tone lip
liner this one won't be for everyone but
for all you ladies that are feeling the
nineties vibe you'll love this one stone
is a like grey nude brown lip pencil it
does look very gray on me on some people
it does look more brown but on me it
does look very very gray so I just like
to apply this all over the lip line and
this just creates the most gorgeous
effect it just really resembles how the
ladies in the 90s used to wear a nude
lip and is just absolutely stunning so I
just sort of go over the lips with the
blankety lipstick and I just blend it in
with my finger and just make sure that
it blends in really well with the lip
liner and it just creates this really
edgy looking nude and obviously yes it's
not for everyone but it is a really
stunning lip combination if you are
going for that grungy sort of lip color
so I think it's stunning
the next lip combination is one of my
favorite plums that I like to use it is
using the NYX the retractable lip liner
in plum and Mac rebel lipstick the
retractable lip liners from NYX are an
absolute dupe for the Mac cream stick
liners
unfortunately Mac don't have a huge
selection in the cream stick liners even
though they are my favorite formula and
the next ones are just amazing they are
very very waterproof and they just last
forever so what I like to do is just
line my lips and then I like to fill in
the whole of my lips using the lip liner
as well because this color is just
perfect on its own the only thing is
that it is that it does feel very drying
so if you're not a fan of that super
matte finish you can do what I do and go
over it with the rebel and what the
rebel does is just give it a little bit
of that moisture and just create this
lightest ombre effect just to make your
lips look a little bit fuller
so I just go in the center on my top lip
and on the center on my bottom lip and
it just looks really well fit together
and it just creates the most perfect
plum and although I don't use these
colors that much because I'm addicted to
my news if I ever do tend to go for a
plum it will be this one because it's
just absolutely stunning so this is how
it looks with a full face of makeup and
as you can see again it will go with a
dark eye
obviously it will go with a lighter eye
and it's just so pretty and it would
suit a majority of different skin tones
and the next slip combination is a dark
burgundy lip combo this is using Gerard
cosmetics cherry cordial and a V no lip
liner from Mac the first thing that I
like to do is just line my lips with V
no I don't usually like to fill it in so
much but you can do if you want filling
in the lips with this color will just
create a much more intense look so if
you do want it to be a lot darker and a
lot vampire like to fill in the lips
with the lipstick and this cherry
cordial by Gerard cosmetics I do have a
discount code for their website so if
you do want to get some money off their
website definitely check the description
bar and I'll also put the code here for
use this is how it looks for the full
face again it just suits in majority of
skin tones it's a stunning stunning
burgundy red and this is just one of my
favorite lip combinations are absolutely
love it
