today i'm going to be showing you 9 tips
for more full of voluptuous looking lips
and the first step is going to be
moisturizing and exfoliating our lips
and this is just going to make sure that
we remove any dead skin and the lips
look nice and hydrated and this is
ultimately going to make the lips
obviously look more fuller because they
look more healthy and i'm using my
carmex which is an amazing lip balm that
just helps to hydrate the lips fully and
i also use my lush exfoliator and that
just removes all the dead skin and as
you can see already there looking a lot
more full next I'm going to be using a
lip plumper on my lips just to make my
lips look a little bit fuller this is
the full lips enhancer and I love this
product it's really good for applying
more pressure onto the lips just to make
the lips look more full then I'm going
to be taking some concealer and just
applying it all over the lips just to
even out the tone and just to take away
any tone that's in the natural lip and
that way we can use whatever colors we
want onto the lip I'm just going to be
slightly over drawing my lip you can
take this as little or as far as you
want I know that some people don't like
to overdraw the lip but I just like to
slightly over draw my top lip because I
just feel that it makes it look a lot
more full and I don't take it too far so
it's extremely obvious but it does just
helped to create a more fuller lip shape
and then I just sort of draw the outer
corners as well just to create more
dimension and make the outer corners
look a little bit more sunk in words
then I like to apply some lines in a
diagonal motion on the center of the lip
and this just creates the effect of a
more pouty look so it almost makes the
lip looks like it's more kind of sucked
in words and makes it look more pouty
then I'm going to be applying a lighter
lipstick into the center of my lip any
darker lip stick onto the outer corners
and this just creates a little bit more
definition and makes the lips it look
more rounded and what I like to do is
just Pat it on a rather than rub because
we want to make sure that we can very
faintly see those lines that we drew
underneath it so I'm just taking a
slightly lighter color of lipstick and
just patting it on top of what we drew
I'm just very lightly patting that and
applying that one to the inner part of
my lip
then I'm going to be taking that darker
lip pencil again and applying that into
the outer corners of my lip and again
this creates more dimension and makes
the lips look more sunken in to the
outer corner and it brings the inner
part of our lip more forward to create a
more pouty look and this just makes the
lips look a little bit fuller again
these are just little tips that you can
use you don't have to use all the tips
together but I find that they really
work so yeah this is a really nice tip
and I just like to run that lip liner on
the outside of the lip as well just to
add a little more dimension then I'm
taking a powder highlight on a fluffy
brush and applying it on to the highest
points of my lips so I start to apply on
the inner corner of my top lip and two
little parts of the bottom lip as well
and it makes the lip look a lot more
full and then lastly i'm just applying
some clear gloss onto the lip and i'm
only applying it to the inner part of my
lip just to create more dimension so as
you can see guys that is the finished
look I hope these tips helped you and
obviously they are only just little tips
that you can use but I hope you guys
find it helpful I hope you have an
amazing day guys don't forget to comment
like and subscribe and i will see you on
my next one bye
