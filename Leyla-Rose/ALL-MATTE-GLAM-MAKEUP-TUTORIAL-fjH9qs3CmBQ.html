so today I'm going to be showing you how
to achieve this look that I'm wearing
now in a chatty tutorial sort of I'm
kind of doing like a little bit less
voiceover because I know you guys like
me to switch up so I basically chat with
you as I do my makeup I mean it's not
really a get ready with me because all I
talk about is how to do this look but
instead of doing voiceover I talk to you
guys lost I do it basically this makeup
look is actually like an all matte look
everything isn't that I'm not even
wearing highlight so it's very soft
almost flat looking but I really like it
and I wanted to switch it up because I
usually love glowy everything especially
lately I've been loving the sparkle and
glowy and everything like that but I
decided to go for something all matte
today so that's the look that we went
for but it's super simple really easy to
achieve and it's actually not get it's
not all that hard
if you guys love makeup tutorials like
this and be sure to give this video a
big thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already for more
videos like this and out so would you
let's get on into this tutorial let's go
okay so I've actually side off with
absolutely nothing on my skin as usual
but what we're doing today which is a
bit different is taking a mask I'm going
to be applying this mask before I apply
my makeup I'm using the bodyshop
Ethiopian honey deep nourishing mask you
guys already know this if you follow my
raw channel but I'm a massive fan of
this mask green which is why I teamed up
with the body shop I'm going to talk to
you guys whilst I applied it I took part
in a photo shoot with the body shop with
another four girls it was with coastal
Beauty Helen Anderson Joann Liscombe and
also Tasha green as well and we all did
a photo shoot together for these masks
or you guys may or may not see me in the
stores of the body shop all across the
UK which is so exciting you see my face
or any of the other girls in the body
shop take a selfie with it have me on
Instagram or Twitter or anything like
that just let me know that you've seen
me I would love to see it so much you're
going to be part of the group meetup at
Westfield Stratford so let me check the
date one set meet up with me and the
other girls is going to be at the
Westfield Stratford store between 6:00
and 8:00 so if you guys are around
definitely come down and see us all over
amazing to meet you of her so many
people asked me to do a London
meet-and-greet and I rarely do them so
I'm going to be in London where so
Stratford on that day and it will be
amazing to meet you so John in your
Diaries because that will be amazing and
yeah I'm so excited to be a part of this
because genuinely I love this mask range
especially the one that I'm using now
just because it's just perfect for my
skin type I love to use this before
makeup and also like the night before I
do makeup because I just feel like it
makes my skin look so glowy and healthy
and also it really hydrates as well I'm
just gonna let this sit on my skin for a
little bit so it can absorb all the
goodness so my skin can be nice and
moisturized and nourished and then
afterwards I'll wash it off come back
and sit with you guys and we will do our
makeup so I brushed it off my skin and
now I'm just going to moisturize and I'm
actually going to do my eyes fast
because I'm going to be cleaning up the
side and this is pretty much like the
last of that moisturizer that's the body
shop bitten anyone and I love it for my
favorites I've just moved a little bit
closer so we can start my eyes I'm going
to be taking some of the Maybelline fit
me concealer and just applying some of
this onto my lips chap as a primer and
I'm just setting that using some powder
okay so for my eyes today I'm going to
be taking the other decay naked original
palette and this is just this is the og
palette this is the first proper
eyeshadow palette I ever owned so when
we're taking the color naked which is
this one here and I'm just taking this
on a blending brush and I'm just going
to be kind of putting it almost all over
the lid it's a really natural light
brown shade and I'm just popping that on
the lid and then sort of buffing it into
the crease a little bit and I'm just
making sure to extend this outwards a
little bit don't worry about underneath
it because we are going to be cleaning
that up with a makeup wipe I'm just
building this color up so next I'm going
to be taking some of the color back I'm
just going to be taking that on a little
paddle brush like this I'm just going to
be patting this close to the lash line
to kind of create a smoked out
so just kind of pushing this near here
almost crew in like a little wing using
this and it doesn't have to be super
neat because like I said we're going to
clean it up we just want to make sure
that it blends really well above using
loads of tiny little like patting and
swiping motions just to make sure that
it doesn't look really harsh now taking
a bit of black out from the Urban Decay
Naked 2 palette resting this onto the
lash line and again we're going to want
this to blend in really seamlessly with
that Brown to create something really
soft but something that will really
emphasize the eyes as well and I'm just
being sure to go back into that box
shades with a pencil brush just to blend
out the edges of that so this is pretty
much the eye look that I'm going for
super super simple but something that's
really Slattery and it will look so much
nicer as well with lashes on so for my
primer I'm taking the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer and this is super
hydrating I mean my skin is already so
hydrated from the masks and the
moisturizer but I just love my skin
being glowy and moisturized and
everything before I apply like any
makeup to my skin there for my
foundation I'm mixing together two I'm
taking the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless and the Urban Decay all nighter
we're mixing these together because
they're both matte that this one is
super matte so this will just give it a
little bit more full coverage so going
to use a damp Beauty blender to blend
this into my skin forgot to color
correct I've been doing that lately a
lot this foundation should be full
coverage so fukui we should be okay way
because when I'm looking on camera this
looks like it's lighter than my skin but
I don't think it is I think it looks the
same I'm taking some of the Maybelline
fit me concealer and I'm just going to
take
this under the eyes to really brighten
up that area and I'm just kind of doing
it in an underneath triangle motion sort
of I don't want to go too crazy with
concealer under the eyes but I like to
do a nice shape where it really lifts my
face
I have not gone for a full on full
coverage base in such a long time
usually I go for medium coverage and
then on a daily basis I kind of go for
like a light coverage but this is just
so full coverage and I love it I miss it
so much
every time again it's just nice to play
around a little bit and I'm just going
to set my base using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder and which is
going to be pretty much sitting
everywhere because we want everywhere to
be quite maps because that's the whole
purpose of this look this is a really
super matte I love that and I'm going to
be taking the hoola by benefit bronze up
and I'm just going to be taking that and
using it to bronze my skin but also to
give myself a bit of contour as you guys
know I'm not like the most massive side
of proper proper contouring just because
I feel like sometimes it can look a
little bit much but let's see just first
of all bronzing the size of my forehead
and then I'm just going to be bronzing
underneath my cheekbones and then also
underneath my jawline as well I feel
weird without highlight but I'm sticking
to the whole map thing I'll probably
apply highlight later but sort of thing
of this look of everything being matte
let's just stick with no highlighter
today I know like Who am I so I'm going
to do my eyebrows off camera because
I've shown you guys how to do my
eyebrows that a thousand times I'll link
my eyebrow routine in the eye just there
I think it's this side frames that is
the size okay guys so my eyebrows are
now on I'm going to be doing my
eyelashes now I'm going to be taking the
certified lashes in the start Callisto
they're really pretty wind out style and
I think I'll be really nice for this
look so just going to apply some glue
onto them and stick them to my lashes
and then I'm just taking some mascara
and using that on my top lashes to
really make them blend in with the false
ones and then applying a little bit of
that mascara on the bottom lash line
before I apply some nude eyeliner to the
waterline
I just love how the lashes just
transform it and because they're so
flattery is just like it just blends in
with the smoky lash line and I love it
is so simple what's so effective in La
Ben I just love how net everything is
then finally for my lips I'm going to go
for something simple but also matte I'm
taking the urban decay right on pencil
in 1993 and then I'm topping it with the
Weisse lipstick in a carnal which is a
concept map also so guys this is the
finished look I really hope you enjoyed
