channel so today we are going to be
testing another makeup hack I saw this
on youtube I can't exactly remember the
girl's name that I saw this one but I'm
going to link her video down below
because I saw this video in my suggested
feed and it is really interested me so
basically what we're going to be doing
today is testing out putting powder
underneath any liquid makeup and that to
me it just goes against everything I
believe in and makeup I never do that
the only time I ever do is when I do
cream contour I'll set my whole face and
then do my cream contour but I don't
mind doing that it's going to be really
strange
I've actually prime my skin already so
we're pretty much good to go actually
let's test it let's see if this makeup
pack actually works and then we're going
to check in towards the end of the day
and see if it gave me any lasting power
while I give it actually like I just I'm
genuinely interested I have low hopes to
this side I don't think it's going to
work but we'll see before we get into
the actual video don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already and
give this video a thumbs up so I know
that you enjoy the you'd like this
comment down below and makeup pack you
guys want me to try out next if there's
anything that you see in it think it
just I'm sure you want to test it then
be sure to comment it down below in the
comment section and I think that's all I
want to say they're good for my vlog
channel and also in my social media all
of that will be down below and yes I'm
not babbling let's get on into the video
so the power that I've decided to use
today is the RCM a no color powder and
the reason why I decided to use this one
is because it's really fine and I want
to go to something that's a little bit
like a slightly thinner powder compared
to me like the Laura Mercier because
that is really really thick and heavy on
my skin and I don't really use it that
much anymore anyway so I thought if I'm
going to use a loose powder to apply all
over my skin and I thought I would use
this one so I'm really nervous actually
but this kind of freaked me out I'm just
going to pop oh okay I'm going
everywhere great kind of just putting
some powder in this little tub so I can
just pick you out straight from that I
just got powder everywhere so I'm just
picking up some powder and putting on my
skin this feels so weird just to like
just to powder my skin with nothing
being on it
we're on the area that I want to avoid
it's just my under-eye area because I do
get kind of dry under that so I don't
want to make it look super super dry
over lift a whole couple my videos end
up being so messy I swear like I just
ended up meeting a shower every time
after I felt my skin just feels really
really mad really mad
it doesn't feel dry because obviously
like I moisturize my skin beforehand by
it feels very very much so I don't know
I mean can you tell like my face looks
so flat like the foundation of exercises
used today spot on top of this is the
Makeup Forever HD foundation I'm using
this in the shade one side sorry I think
this is the Ultra HD one so it's the
newer version and I love this foundation
but the only thing about it is that it
does need to be set so I thought it'd be
interesting to see what this looks like
on the top of powder rather than
underneath the powder and we'll just see
if it needs to be farthest at because I
didn't want to use a super matte
foundation that would be matte on its
own I want to see what it would be
applying a foundation that's just like a
normal consistency not super matte one I
don't really know like at the moment it
just it looks like it's applying really
really smoothly like really smoothly now
that seemed like what my face can take
I'm just going to apply little dots into
my skin because I feel like it's
applying just fine I was a bit worried
so I just wanted to apply it really
gradually but it looks like it's fine so
I'm just going to apply this everywhere
and we're just going to buff it in and
just see how it looks something I do
have to say is that the difference now
is that because overseas are underneath
of the skin is so much it's like the
foundation doesn't like melt into the
skin as much so I feel like it kind of
has to be pushed in I wouldn't do this
unless I was doing something I wanted to
be full coverage because I mean it looks
very flawless I've got to say like very
very smooth
okay so around my nose the foundation is
separating a little bit yeah it looks
dry on my nose dan was going so well I
don't actually have dry patches on my
nose I think the part is just making you
look a little drier than it is the only
area to me that looks a little dry is
the nose literally just the nose so
everywhere else looks really smooth the
forehead in the cheeks tends to be the
area where I get the most texture and
for some reason is just colored like it
looks super smooth down my base apart
from what we see like contour and
highlight and stuff and it looks super
smooth very matte as you can see on my
Facebook so flat so I need to apply
light or something and but when I did my
under eyes I set them and then I kind of
just went over this area and honestly
I'm going to do a close-up now it looks
really smooth on camera and like from
far away but when you get close you can
see a bit of dryness I'm going to go and
probably finish off my makeup off camera
and just come back to you guys a little
bit later one eternity later ok guys so
this is what it looks like after about
12 hours so a really long time so ready
to go to bed now so I'm so excited to
take all of this off I just always come
back and show you guys what it looks
like after a long day my overall
thoughts about this is it doesn't work
with dry skin a lot of my skin
especially around my nose and my under
eye area has just separated it doesn't
look that great and I did not really
like the overall effect that I have
throughout the day if photographed
really nicely to be fair like it looked
really full-coverage and really nice it
kind of reminded me a bit of when I did
the gem sue technique right dip to my
face into the water it kind of reminded
me of that but it looks more dry now in
my opinion so I think the skin type this
was was really good for is pure oily
skin just look if it does make things a
little less oily compared to normal
because obviously this foundation
usually would get greasy quite quickly
this is a no from me like for today I'm
just a bit not happy with it so I've
decided probably I'm not going
doing this again I would rather do
giving my face in water rather than
doing this like thank personally even
though it did seem like it was going to
work and it went on really smoothly just
the way that it's worn it's just not the
best so yes that's the way that it
turned out let me know down in the
comments if you going to be trying this
technique and if you have then how it
works for you let me know if there are
any more that you do want me to try out
and subscribe if you haven't already I'm
going there now with them so try it I
look so rough please don't judge me and
I will see you guys in my next video
bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
