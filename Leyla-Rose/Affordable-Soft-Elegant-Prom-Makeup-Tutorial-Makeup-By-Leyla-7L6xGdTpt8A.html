down
I put the flame out you can't get to me
throw your sticks and your stone's go
break all of my bones you won't eat my
soul he can't get to me
hey guys and welcome back today's
tutorial is a soft and elegant prom
makeup look using only affordable
products so to get started we're gonna
be applying an eye cream onto our lids
just to make sure that our eyelids are
nice and moisturized before we apply
anything else we're gonna be taking this
concealer and using it as an eye base
and just applying it all the way from
the brow bone to the lid to make sure
that our eyes are nice and corrected of
color and everything stays on a really
long time then we're gonna take the
revolution ultimate eyeshadow collection
and taking this matte beige color and
applying it all over the lid just to
make sure that the concealer is set and
that nothing will move then I'm going to
take this matte Brown II beige color and
start to apply this into our crease with
a fluffy crease brush and I'm gonna be
concentrating it on the outer V and then
begin to take it into the crease and
we're gonna do a kind of spotlight
effect on the eye today because we want
to make the eyes look nice and rounded
and large you want to kind of create a
halo effect around the eye to make the
eyes look rounder and more large and I'm
also gonna be taking that color onto the
inner corner to give us that halo effect
and then taking that brush that we first
started off with we're just gonna be
using this brush to blend the color
outwards to make sure that it looks nice
and diffused
then I'm just gonna be going back into
that color to try and make sure that it
looks nice and intense and that the
color is nice and pigmented in the
crease next I'm going to be taking this
darker warm brown color and start to
apply this in the outer V and the crease
just to create more definition and to
make sure that it's starting to look a
little bit more like a soft smokey eye
for this I'm using a petite crease brush
and just using it to create more
definition in the areas that we want to
look deeper I'm also going back into
that original brush and just making sure
to blend everything out to make sure
that it diffuses into one another
next we're taking this off black color
and start to apply it into our crease
this is completely optional this just
gives a little bit more definition and
starts to change the look of your eye
shape of course if you want to go for
something softer then you can leave this
step but I just wanted to go for it
because I wanted to make sure that my
eyes looked nice and defined and I'm
just doing the same step as we did with
the other colors but just using the
black and making sure this is nice and
blended out and we just applied it in
the inner and outer corner and just join
the two inner and outer corner on the
crease so it just kind of joins all
together then I'm going to take a q-tip
with a little bit of makeup remover and
just clean up then I'm going to be
taking a retractable black pencil from
next and just apply this onto my outer
corner just to create a little bit more
definition on the outer corner then I
want to be taking our lid color this is
this really light shimmery color and
just be applying this onto our lid this
is gonna make the eyelid a lot more
rounded and the focus on the eye is
going to be on the center of the lid
then I'm taking that same pencil brush
we used for the black and just use this
to blend out that pencil that we apply
before
first time I apply some mascara and then
I'm going to apply our false lashes this
is again of course optional if you want
to use your natural lashes then of
course that's fine but I wanted to wear
false lashes just because I know that it
gives my eyes so much more definition
then I'm gonna get slide onto my skin
I'm using my moisturizer and then going
in with the L'Oreal Dream Lumi primer
and I'm just applying this all over my
face before we begin our foundation I'm
gonna be mixing two foundations together
and mixing the Bourjois healthy mix and
the dream sat in touch a foundation from
Maybelline and I'm just applying this
all over my skin and blending in with
the Real Techniques miracle sponge
miracle complexion sponge I think is
good and just basically buffing it into
my skin and this just gives me a really
nice flawless coverage go with whatever
foundation you know is gonna last well
on your skin and you know what
foundation is going to look the most
flawless so it comes out really flawless
in photos so create the coverage that
you desire I wanted to go for more of a
full coverage so I'm just booting up a
little bit more coverage on the areas
that I need it
I've already done my eyebrows off camera
but the tutorial is in the description
box if you do want to know how I do my
eyebrows then please check the
description box after the link will be
there next I'm gonna be highlighting
under my eyes with some concealer I'm
using the Maybelline fit me concealer
and this is one of the best concealers
to highlight the under eyes and then I'm
going in with the Maybelline Dream Lumi
touch concealer stick in ivory and this
just gives me a little bit more of that
light under-eye and it's just gonna
highlight the other areas of the face
that I want to bring forward just going
in with the same sponge from Real
Techniques and just using bouncing
motions to make sure that's nice and
bounced into the skin and everything
just goes into one another and there's
no harsh lines
next I'm going to be applying some
White's eyeliner into the waterline of
my eye I'm using the NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and I also use a little bit of
eyeshadow under my eyes but my camera
decided to go out of focus so I
apologize for that once I've done that
I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my
bottom lashes and this just creates more
definition and just balances the top
from the bottom and now our eyes are
looking nice and open and they just look
really nice and rounded so this is just
really pretty open eyed look then I'm
gonna be using some bronze I'm using the
revolution baked bronzer and just
applying this onto my cheeks and I'm
just gonna go around the perimeter of my
face just to give us that really
gorgeous and bronzed to glow then I'm
gonna apply a NYX blusher in angel and
just apply this to the apples of my
cheeks and just roll it back to create a
nice lifted cheekbone then I'm gonna
apply the revolution baked highlighter
I'm just going to apply this onto my
cheek then for the lips I'm gonna be
using a NYX retractable lip liner in
natural and just going around my lip
line and just creating a really soft
nude color and then I'm gonna be taking
a slightly darker version of this color
it's just I think the one down from it
and just go around the lip just to
create a little bit more definition just
because I want my lips to look a little
bit fuller this is of course optional
and I'm just gonna be blending that in
with my finger just so that it doesn't
look like a really harsh line around my
lips then I'm using the Maybelline nude
lipstick in tantalizingly taupe I think
it's called and just applying this all
over my lips
we'll go on top of that with a nude
gloss from NYX this is one of their
butter glosses
