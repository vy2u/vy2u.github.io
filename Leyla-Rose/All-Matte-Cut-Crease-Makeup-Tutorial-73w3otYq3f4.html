gonna be showing you how to achieve this
wool Matins cut crease makeup learn tip
again I'm gonna be priming my eyes with
some concealer this is the Maybelline
age rewind concealer and I'm just
applying it all over my lid and just
making sure it's all blended in and then
I'm taking the zoeva
warmth spectrum palette and taking this
nice warm brown color I'm gonna be
applying this into the crease this is
gonna be the main transition color
that's gonna make all the other colors
blend out as perfectly as we need them
to be and I'm just taking that on a big
fluffy brush and we're just gonna be
concentrating that as much as we can
into the crease and making it as dark as
we can and I'm also just pulling it out
towards the tail of my brow to really
get that extended eye next taking this
darker warm brown I'm gonna be taking
this and applying that with the same
brush but in the deeper part of our
crease to start to build up some of that
depth and I'm first starting out with
this brush just to create a little bit
of a shadow and then we're gonna be
going into a smaller brush to really add
on that definition right into that deep
part of the crease and again we're
really pulling it out towards the tail
of our brow to get that really nice
extended eye towards the outer corner
don't have to drag out as much as I am
but I'm really dragging it almost to the
point of the tail of my brow and then I
am gonna be making sure to blend out all
the harsh lines with that previous Brown
we applied in the crease just to make
sure that it looks like a nice shadow
and there are no harsh lines
next we're going to be creating our cut
crease this is one of my favorite ways
to create a cut crease and definitely
one of the most easiest I'm taking a
cream concealer and a small flat brush
and we're just gonna be very gradually
creating the cut crease shape I
personally find this a lot easier than
mapping out where your cut crease is
gonna go before you apply any of your
eyeshadow starting off the cut crease
near to my crease and then as I
gradually make it bigger
I just slightly go above and above and
above my crease that way I can see what
shape I'm going for slowly and that way
I don't create a shape that I'm not
happy with too quickly and I'm just
basically filling the whole lid with
concealer and then setting it with a
cream toned matte eyeshadow you can go
for a shimmery eyeshadow but today I
wanted to keep everything super matte
and you could create a totally different
cut crease shape if you'd like I decided
to go for a shape that went all the way
out towards the tail of my brow but you
could totally kind of curve inward so
that it doesn't come out all the way
it's totally up to you and then I'm also
just taking this matte black eyeshadow
and just taking it with a pencil brush
and just lining along the very bottom of
the cut crease and just creating a
little bit more definition now you can
do this before the concealer but I just
decided to do it after just to soften up
the line a little bit and I will show
you guys that you can clean up if you
mess up a little bit after so I've just
lined a little bit of black eyeshadow
and then going back into that previous
blending brush we used to apply that
dark brown and just smudging out all the
lines so that looks a little bit less
harsh
don't worry if you do mess up because
you can clean out with a little bit of
concealer and just go ahead and cover it
all up and just make it look nice and
sharp again next I'm just gonna be
applying some makeup remover onto a
cotton pad and just basically swiping
the side of my eye to make it look nice
and sharp
and then we're gonna be doing our
eyeliner for this I'm taking the soap &amp;amp;
Glory super cat eyeliner and just
creating a fairly thick wing but I don't
want it to come out too long so that it
joins up to the tip of our eyeshadow I
want it to stop but this is just the
style I wanted to do personally you can
go with whatever style of eyeliner you
like so it's quite a thick wing but it
doesn't go up too much it's quite
straight outwards and it doesn't go all
the way to the tail of my brow like I
usually do my eyeliner next I'm just
gonna be applying some force lashes
these are the noir fairy lashes from
house of lashes I wanted to go for quite
a volume as pair that want to
overpowering and would take over the
look for a look like this you really
want it to be all about the cut crease
so I just went for something short but
volumous and I'm also just applying some
mascara to my natural lashes to make
them blend in a little bit better for my
skin I'm gonna be priming it with my
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
I'm just spraying it all over my skin to
give myself a little bit of hydration
and then I'm also gonna be taking my
L'Oreal infallible foundation mixed in
with the new Smashbox primer oil I don't
know if this is super new but it's new
to me and I really like it think I've
mentioned before that I've been
suffering with quite a bit of dry skin
lately and this just makes my foundation
gone a little bit smoother and I really
really like it I just applied my
foundation with this morphe kabuki brush
and I'm also just applying some
concealer onto the center part of my
forehead my chin and of course
underneath my eyes just to give myself a
little more of a brightened effect and
also conceal those dark circles
and again I'm just going to be blending
that in with the same brush we use to
blend in our foundation
next I'm just going to be setting all
the areas where we applied that
concealer and just make sure that it's
all nice and set into place and to do
that I'm using my favorite powder ever
and I'm also just gonna be applying my
eyebrows off-camera so I will leave the
link down in the description box while
my bronzer I wanted to give something
supernatural so I went for this bronze
booster from Physicians Formula and I
just applied it all across the outer
perimeter of my skin didn't want to go
for any contouring today because I
wanted it to be all about the cut crease
and I decided to apply this bronze glow
highlight from Bobbi Brown and to finish
off the eyes I decided to keep it nice
and simple and just applied a black kohl
pencil in the waterline and just really
made sure that it was nice and black and
just applied some mascara onto the
bottom lash line again like I said you
can go for you know some eye shadow on
the bottom lash line you can really jazz
this up however you like but I decided
to go for just a mascara and finally to
finish off the look I decided to go for
a nice matte lip I'm lining my lips with
this new pencil for me I've never tried
this this is the Charlotte Tilbury lip
pencil and I just applied that all over
the lips and then I decided to finish
off with one of her lip sticks as well
and this is I believe not a matte
lipstick because it was a little bit
shiny I went ahead and applied a little
bit of translucent powder on top to make
it super than that so this is the
finished look guys I really hope you
enjoyed this makeup look I am obsessed
with this cut crease and it's made me
just fall in love with cut creases all
over again so guys if you did enjoy then
