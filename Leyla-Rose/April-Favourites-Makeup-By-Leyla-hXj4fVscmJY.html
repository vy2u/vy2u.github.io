today I'm going to be showing you guys
my favorites for this month this is my
April favorites and I haven't done any
favorites video since last year i think
because I just wasn't really into it
that much I just didn't really feel like
I was having that many different
favorites but this month so many things
have changed for me I feel like my skin
is really changed and I've just been
kind of like diving into a lot of
different products so I have lots of new
like foundation favorites and stuff like
that so I really wanted to chat to you
guys about what I've been loving this
month so without any further ado let's
just jump straight into the video so I
have a ton of new like skin favorites
that I've been absolutely loving and
I'll start with a skincare product that
you guys have most likely see me use a
lot in my videos recently is the body
shop vitamin e eye cream and this helps
to reduce the appearance of fine lines
puffiness and dark circles and it is
suitable for all skin types recently my
eye area has been kind of like puffy and
dry and there's something I'm really not
used to unusually my eye area is really
smooth and I've never had to kind of
deal with puffy and dry eyes so when it
did happen i was a bit like or do i do
this has saved my life like my eyes are
just so much to me though I feel like
it's gone completely back to normal they
don't feel dehydrated everything just
smooths on beautifully and it just
prevents it from looking like it's
really tired and drawn out and it just
looks amazing so this has been a huge
savior for me since one of my favorite
foundations ran out I decided that I'd
start using a lot more of the
foundations I already have of course as
you guys know if you've seen my makeup
collection you would know that I have a
ton of foundations and makeup that I
most likely don't use as much as like
the favorite products that i like to use
so i was thinking to myself I need to
try and use some of these products just
a little sit there and go to waste so
I've been trying a couple of my old kind
of foundations that I kind of set aside
and I've just fallen in love with them
all over again the first one would be no
surprise if you've been watching my most
recent videos that is the sill cream
foundation from lorimer
cialis is just amazing I forgot how
amazing this actually is like to use
this on its own or to share it down a
little bit I like to mix it with my mia
flora argan oil the argan oil is amazing
it just kind of shares everything out
and makes the product moisturizing and
it just goes on so smoothly this is such
a good coverage and I've just been going
through it like anything and it's very
thick a little bit does go a long way
but I use is sand beige and this kind of
matches my tanned body self like why am
now so I was slightly lighter color
which is cashew beige and that's a
little bit more when I love a paler oh
but I have just been lovingly also to
foundations that I've been loving to mix
together I know I'm so extra with mixing
stuff together but I just feel like I
can get so much more of a customized
finish if i mix things together I've
been loving to mix the dream shattered
liquid from Maybelline and the Bourjois
healthy mix these are of course both
drugstore foundations one is in a darker
color and one is in a lighter color and
I was in between the two colors and I
was thinking one day why don't I just
mix them together and I have just fallen
in love with how they look together it
just gives a really gorgeous and juhi
skin is very very very jewy it's not
suitable if you have very very oily skin
unless you want a really powder well oh
my god I've just been absolutely loving
it it gives you just the most gorgeous
glow from within really like kind of
dope into the foundations that I haven't
used in a really long time and just foot
it in love all over again another
product that i have been loving is the
dream pur BB 8 in 1 BB cream for oily
skin i did a first impression on this
and i have just fallen in love and since
this color is a little bit light for me
when I am this shade I have been loving
to mix this with my face and body
foundation in a darker shade and it just
creates a really gorgeous everyday wet
well I just want to apply a little bit
of a coverage on my face just to cover
some redness just to cover a little bit
of my acne scars I've just been loving
applying this onto my skin for daily
wear because it's just the perfect
amount of coverage it really does stay
on the skin well it doesn't good greasy
which is great I've just been loving
this this month since I discovered it
for one of my first impressions and
also no surprise when my favorite
concealers but this month I picked it up
again and I have just pulled in love all
over again again I've almost got through
it this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the 20 you guys used to see
me use this all the time and then I
stopped using it and then I've really
used it this month and I've just fallen
in love again this is amazing it is just
the most gorgeous under-eye concealer it
brightens it highlights it covers it
makes you just look like you're glowing
angel even on my drier areas this just
smooth on beautifully so I have been
loving this as well speaking of
concealer I've been loving to set my
concealer with the Mac prep and prime CC
powder in neutralized be kind of set
your under eyes so smoothly and it just
makes you look compelling Paulus no
lines nothing it's great for baking your
under eyes if you are aware of what
baking is it's when you use powder to
kind of set the concealer and you leave
it on there for about five minutes or so
and it just allows it to sit on the
concealer and honestly it is amazing and
the slight yellow tone helps to
highlight the under eyes but it's not
too thick it's not as thick as the Ben
Nye banana powder which I do I might
never really reach for because it's so
thick this has a lighter more fluffier
texture to it whereas the other one does
feel thick this one almost has a veil of
powder that will just go under your eyes
and it will increase or act too heavy
under the eyes so I just love this and
it just highlights just enough for me so
whenever I'm going for a really kind of
dramatic highlight and contour like this
is what I go for if you guys haven't
been able to tell I have been absolutely
battering my Real Techniques sponge
recently because this is just the best
way to apply foundation I can't believe
I never used to use this that much but
now I have found the foundations that I
love I love using this I need
to try the beauty blender I've never
actually tried it I don't know why
please don't scream at me for never
using yeah I really do need to try I've
just never got around to buying one I
just been loving this method of applying
my foundation so this is a huge favor
for me it is on its way our will be
honest with you I have really pushed it
to its limit you can see that it's kind
of crumbling a little bit now so we do
need to buy a new one of these but
that's what's great about this sponge it
doesn't even matter because it actually
is really affordable and I just love the
kind of feel oh my god and I'm just in
love with it also i recently got the
sigma 3d HD precision and kabuki brushes
these are amazing in particular the
concealer brush is amazing for someone
like me that likes to apply their eye
makeup first and then go in with their
concealer and their foundation
afterwards this is amazing for just
getting under there you guys know I like
a nice straight line when it comes to
cleaning up my eye shadow and it's just
amazing to kind of just get in there and
to just really clean up get into the
inner corner pyramid shape really helps
to be able to get into any little
crevice or you know any little area that
you need to get into for example at the
corner of the nose any area that you
find would be really hard is really easy
with these two brushes I think it's
great for anyone that once their makeup
to be really precise teens are just
amazing and I just had to mention these
another also for brushes you guys have
seen me use these incredible rose gold
brushes in a lot of my videos and these
are these array of our rose gold I that
look at this look at the color of this
look how amazing they are these are no
joke one of my favorite set of brushes
to use on my eyes the actual brush
itself is amazing that you really really
have a brush for every single job and I
just love the way that it works every
single brush i have found useful and I
just absolutely love them they're like
half the price of map brushes but of the
same quality and I just love them and
i've been using them like crazy if you
haven't been able to tell as for lip
products this month you're going to be
like what are you doing
with your life I unknown I'm notorious
for not being able to get away from my
needs I love my nudes and unfortunately
they're all news this month and funnily
enough that all gloss is I never thought
I would be more of a gloss person but
this spring glosses have just been like
my life I've just been loving them the
ones that I have been loving is the draw
cosmetics nude and lip gloss I have been
loving this ever since I ever received
it and it is just the most gorgeous nude
this is just the most gorgeous nude with
no pink undertones it's great for any
skin tone have that kind of whitish
undertone it just has a beige undertone
which is great and that is just here
just this really gorgeous and beige nude
that's just these two here and I've been
loving these because they have again
more of the nude tones to them because
I've just been loving nude and then the
last one is the Sigma lip vex in slip I
have found the perfect nude this is a
peachy nude with a gold undertone I know
I didn't even know it existed it's quite
light so you do want to put a lip liner
underneath this but this has the feel of
a lip paint rather than a gloss it does
have a gloss texture to it but it is so
pigmented that it's more like a little
pain so i'm also going to talk to you
guys about a couple of non makeup
favorites at this necklace that got sent
to me from happiness boutique and i wore
it in one of my previous videos i think
it was the teal one and they have the
best jewelry as you can hear me like
shaking this necklace at the most
gorgeous aztec inspired statement
necklace with little pops of like teal
and blue on it this is just the most
gorgeous necklace I'm loving statement
jewelry recently just because jewelry
can just like um up like any look if
that makes sense you can just add it to
any makeup look any fashion look and I
just feel like these are just so in for
the spring and summer and this is great
for stuff like festival season if you're
going to festivals and you just want to
why something really comfortable and
really easy and you just want to pop on
a nice statement necklace then this is
perfect just been absolutely loving
this necklace also i have been loving
the fuji green tea body scrub from the
body shop oh my god I can't even explain
it just smells so refreshing I mean I
call really smell green tea does green
tea even really have a distinct as well
it's not really that strong but it just
smells so gorgeous and lemony and why me
I've just been loving this this is an
exfoliating scrub that I've been using
on my body and oh my god I just love the
way this makes me smell every now and
then I'll just like move and I'm scarce
wifted like citrus I've just been loving
this you guys know I'm obsessed with the
body shop skin scrubs and the face stuff
and everything I just love the boy shop
so I've just been loving this and I've
been using this so much this past month
and then the last beauty product is the
st. Tropez gradual tan as I mentioned
you probably may have noticed I have
like gone up a skin tone me because i
have been using this this is what I my
favorite tanning products ever entropy
is one of my favorite tanning brands
just because it really suits my
particular skin tone there are a couple
of skin tones that maybe you wouldn't
suit but this just really gives that
olive skin tone which I find this hard
to lose a lot of gradual and fake tans
give that really orangie warm kind of
look whereas this still gives me that
effect of a cool or live tone this is
the gradual tan in the medium to dark
shade and I could keep layering this and
could make myself really tanned not to
mention that it is really really really
moisturizing I just applying one layer
of this after I gout the barf so just
from straight exfoliating my skin and
having a bath I just apply this straight
on top I just kind of let it sit in
until I can't really feel it on my skin
anymore then i apply clothes and that
just prevents it from looking streaky
favorite but i have just been loving
Game of Thrones at the moment who
