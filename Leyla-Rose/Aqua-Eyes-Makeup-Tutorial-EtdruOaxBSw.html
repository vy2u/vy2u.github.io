today I'm going to be showing you an eye
tutorial and it's how to achieve this
aqua makeup look this is just going to
be focusing on the eyes but I did use
the brand new Alice in Wonderland
palette from Urban Decay it is so
stunning and the colors in it are so
gorgeous so I got really inspired to do
this kind of look for summer so if your
do want to see how I achieved this
makeup look then just keep on watching
so before I apply any eye shadow I'm
just going to be priming my eyes using
the up decay primer potion and I haven't
used this primer in ages and I didn't
actually used to like it that much but
now I actually really like it it's very
soft and it's quite nice if you have
quite dry eyelids this is just the
original one so it doesn't have any tint
to it but they do have ones that have a
tint to it as well so that would be also
very good of course I'll be taking the
Urban Decay alice-in-wonderland through
the looking-glass palette the packaging
is insane and I love just the palette in
itself it has a little almost draw where
the eyeshadows come out and the first
shade I'm going to be taking is the
shade reflection which is a really
pretty matte
peach shade and that's going to be our
first transition color so I'm just going
to be taking that into my crease using a
blending brush and just going back and
forth building up this color and just
really blending this into the crease
because we're going to be using such
vibrant colors today I really wanted to
use a neutral color in the crease to
really help that bright color blend out
into our natural skin tone next I'm
going to be taking the color dorm house
and this is a little bit more of a
darker warm Brown it has a little bit of
shimmer to it but I'm still using it in
the crease I'm taking this with a little
bit more of a detailed blending brush
and just popping this into the crease
just to deepen that area and again help
us to blend that blue out into a more
natural color because I didn't really
want to apply too much blue in my crease
prior to applying our aqua color onto
our lid I'm going to be taking the NYX
jumbo pencil in milk and just applying
this onto my lid applying a white base
underneath any eyeshadow is going to
make it look a lot more vibrant so
applying this underneath the Aqua is
going to make it apply a lot more true
to color I really want it to look
exactly how it looks in the pan so this
just really helps with that
I'm taking my finger and just kind of
pushing this into my lid a little bit I
don't want to move this around too much
and sort of get it in the crease color I
want to keep this mainly on my lid and
then of course taking our star of the
show the color is called heads will roll
and I'm taking this on a flat shader
brush and I'm just going to be passing
this onto the lid
I love this color has a little bit of
shimmer to it and I just love it this
color kind of inspired the whole look as
soon as I saw the color I was like and
we need to do an app quad mini cobbler
because it's just so stunning so I'm
just packing this all over the lid and
just making sure to really cover all
that white you don't see any white
coming through and then taking the color
metamorphosis I'm going to be taking
this and applying it on the outer half
of my eye just to give it a little bit
of a twist giving it a little bit of
another shade of blue and this gives it
a little bit more dimension as well and
just makes it look a little bit
different and then gonna be taking the
shade
Bandersnatch I love the names of this
palette over Duke I always come up with
the best names I'm just going to be
taking this with that more detailed
blending brush again and I'm going to be
popping this into the outer V and also a
little bit into that crease just to act
as almost a transition from the blue to
the brown they're two very different
colors so I just wanted to pop this into
the crease to act as a little bit of a
transition between the two so it looks a
little bit more blended
so for my eyeliner I decided I wanted to
go for something a little bit different
today because why not we're going for
all different things I'm taking the
makeup geek black eyeliner this is a
pencil liner just running this along my
lash line and creating a wing shape by
I'm going to be smudging this out with
some black eyeshadow and a detailing
brush just to make a look a little bit
more smoldering I feel like it goes
really well with the color and although
you could go for a normal wing I just
wanted to do something a little bit
different today so I'm taking just a
little bit of matte black eyeshadow and
just smudging the edges to make it look
a little bit more smoldering for my fake
eyelashes I'm going to be taking the
hood of beauty common false lashes and
these are my first time trying huda
beauty lashes and to be honest with you
like I don't know I feel like everyone
goes crazy over them but the ones I
tried they were very very stiff I don't
know if it's because maybe I didn't bend
the lash band a lot it may have even
been just the style but I chose it just
happened to have quite a stiff lash band
let me know down below your favorite
style of whoo DBT lashes if you have
tried them because I really want to love
them I just think maybe it's the style I
pick that maybe it just has a super
stiff lash band I don't know
I'm also just gonna be popping some of
the scar on my natural lashes as always
and then later on I will be finishing
off the bottom lash line with some a
scar too I'm just going to be for now
applying some more of that pencil onto
my waterline and also onto my bottom
lash line and I decided just to kind of
messily smoke out because I just wanted
it to look smoldering and not me if that
makes sense so I'm just taking a brush
and just kind of moving it about and
just making it look a little bit smoky
like I said to finish everything off I'm
going to be taking some mascara and just
popping it on my bottom lashes to finish
the look off so guys that is the end of
this eye makeup look please let me know
if you enjoyed this I haven't dive into
color for the longest time it's
definitely out of my comfort zone but I
did really enjoy doing something a
little bit more creative so let me know
if you like to see more colorful looks
or if you prefer neutral ones personally
I'm a neutral girl but you know I like
to do it every now and again also let me
know if you like kind of more I
dedicated tutorials I always feel a
little bit weird uploading these because
I always do my full face but I think
it's nice to switch things up as well if
you did enjoy this video then don't
forget to like it and subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already I love
