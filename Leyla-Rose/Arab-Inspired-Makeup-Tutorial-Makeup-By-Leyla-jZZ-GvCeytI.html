Channel today I'm going to be doing a
makeup tutorial on how to achieve this
makeup look that I'm wearing right now
today I'm going to be collaborating with
Michelle from her channel
Ready Set glamour she is such a gorgeous
girl she has such an amazing personality
I could just watch her for hours I found
her not too long ago and I just have
been obsessed with her channel ever
since she has such amazing videos she
does really like informative videos on
dupes and drugstore products and just
really good product recommendation
always go to her Channel when I'm in the
mood to shop and I just love her we both
created these arrogance by makeup looks
so if you're not subscribed to her go
and subscribe I will link her channel
down below and link her video down below
too also if you would like to see how I
achieved my version of this arab makeup
look then just keep on watching so to
get started today I'm going to be
starting off by applying my primer and
my foundation for my primer and taking
the makeup forever step 1 smoothing
primer and then for my foundation I am
taking the ex1 invisi wet foundation and
applying it with a sigma f84 brush so
I'm just applying it all over my face
and just blending it all over
I actually am going to be going for a
super dramatic eye today as you guys are
probably already seen so if you guys are
going to be following along this makeup
look I definitely recommend doing the
eyes first
I realized afterwards and I was kind of
like I should have just done my face
afterwards I usually do but I wanted to
get my base done so if you just want to
avoid all the mess then do your eyes
first and your base after
I'm going to be moving on to my eyes now
and I'm taking the Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot and applying this quite thickly onto
the lid just because I do really want to
conceal any sort of pigmentation on my
lid and also we want a nice even base so
we can create a super dramatic eye
shadow look we really want it to be
totally clear of any marks then taking
makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow
we're going to be using this as our
first transition color I'm taking this
on a really soft blending brush a nice
fluffy one so we can blend this out
really softly and this will just help
all of the harsh colors to blend evenly
after it and then taking desert sands
eyeshadow from makeup geek also I'm
going to be applying this also into the
crease and kind of applying it in the
same area but just very gradually
applying it into the crease and just
blending it upwards and outwards towards
the tail of my brow and as you can see
I'm just kind of pushing it outwards
then taking makeup geek Coco bear I'm
going to be taking this on a separate
blending brush and I'm going to be
focusing this more into the out of the
area this will really give us that Arab
inspired eye and it just looks super
sultry and it really directs the eyes
outwards
and then also taking marker from makeup
geek I'm going to be applying this with
a pencil brush and this is just going to
help sort of prepare for the black we're
going to be applying and it will just
make the black a lot easier to blend out
then taking corrupt from makeup geek
also this is a super dramatic matte
black I'm just going to be applying this
with a Mac two one seven brush into the
outer corner and I'm gonna be kind of
pushing this into the crease but keeping
this mainly on the outer V area so we
don't take it too much into the crease
we really want to focus this on the
outer corner so we can really drag our
eyes outwards and to give ourselves that
cat eye effect I am going back and forth
in between brushes to ensure that that
shadow is nice and blended out and then
also to make the black in the outer
corner super pigmented and to add a lot
of drama I am taking a black kohl pencil
and I'm going to be applying some black
eyeshadow on top of this and blending it
out this will just make the eye shadow
pop and the outer corner will look a lot
more dramatic so I'm just going back and
forth between brushes and just making
sure that's nice and blended also
now I'm just gonna be wiping the sides
of my eye to give a super harsh edge
this is definitely going to give us that
really nice Arab inspired look because
the outer corner is always nice and
harsh but you can totally have applied
some tape beforehand just because it
does make life a lot easier I'm then
going to be taking this makeup geek
pigment and just applying it all over
the lid this is like a nice dark gold
bronze shade and I didn't want the lid
to be too much so I'm just going to be
applying that on the lid and also a
lighter pigment on the inner corner just
to really brighten that inner corner
area
next we're gonna get started on the
lineup I decided to just go for a thick
line on the eye and to connect it to the
black on the outer corner we almost
don't want to see any harsh lines we
just want to draw a line and for it's
almost connect to the black on the outer
corner you can go for a wing if you like
but because the black on the outer
corner of my eye is so dark you wouldn't
really be able to see a wing for me so
it kind of just all blends together and
then I'm just applying some lashes and
some mascara definitely recommend lashes
for this look because it really just
makes everything pop and it just changes
the way everything looks and just makes
it look even more dramatic so I
definitely recommend applying some
falsies next I'm just going to be
highlighting my under eyes I decided to
go for some nice bright concealer to
give us that nice bright under eye look
you can just go for a normal shade but
this one is significantly lighter than
my skin so I'm just applying it on all
the areas I would like to bring it
forward and then I'm blending the end
with the same brush I used to blend in
my foundation and I'm also going to be
using my finger to just blend in the
rest of the concealer around my eye area
too
next I'm just going to be setting and
baking my undereyes using the laura
mercier translucent setting powder and
just using my Beauty Blender to apply
this powder to my under eyes I'm going
to leave this to sit as I do my eyebrow
so just leave it for a couple of minutes
maybe five to ten minutes and I'm going
to do my brows off-camera because you
guys have seen me do it a million times
but I will leave a tutorial down in the
description box for you after my brows
are done I'm just dusting away the
excess powder and just making sure to
really dust it well because we don't any
excess powder that's sitting on our skin
so I'm just doing that using a big brush
from Sigma next we're going to apply
something black on the waterline I feel
like the black on the waterline and the
bottom lash line really pulls the look
together so you want to take a really
dark gel liner and just apply it to the
waterline and I am also going to be
taking that same gel liner and I'm going
to be drawing a really thick line on the
bottom lash line the key of this is that
you don't want it to look blended we
really want it to look harsh and just
really super bold so I'm just taking the
eye liner and joining the outer corner
of my eye and just drawing a very thick
line on the bottom lash line as it gets
to the inner corner we're going to be
creating a inner Fleck in a sense from
the inner tear-duct we are going to
create a tiny little triangle and just
connect it to the line and this will
give us that really nice Arab eye for my
skin I'm just going to be bronzing and
contouring using shade step out from
Matt I'm first of all taking it on a big
fluffy brush and then I'm going to be
taking it on a smaller brush to
concentrate this in the contour areas
and then going to be taking this makeup
revolution blushing hearts blush and I'm
just going to be applying this on the
apple of my cheek and just brushing it
up to my cheekbone this will just give
the tiniest pop of color without being
too harsh and this is optional I don't
usually wear lots of blusher but you can
apply some if you like and then I'm
gonna be applying some highlighter to
the tops of my cheekbones and also to
the tip of my nose just to bring these
areas forward and just to give us a
little bit of a glow and then for the
lips today I decided I wanted to go for
more just a light
movie pink lip I wanted to go for
something quite natural so that all of
the attention could be on the eyes so
I'm taking this automatic precision at
lip liner from Kiko and I'm just
applying this around the lip line and
I'm also going to be filling in my lips
with this as well and I was going to
leave it like this but I did want to
lighten it a little bit because I did
feel like the lip liner alone was a
little dark so I decided to take this
soft matte lip cream from NYX and this
is in the color Cairo I'm just using my
finger to Pat this in and to blend them
all together so guys that is the end of
this makeup tutorial I hope that you
