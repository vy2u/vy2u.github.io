today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to achieve this ariana grande inspired
makeup look this video has been
requested so much on my channel so I
definitely knew I had to do it
I loved Ariana's makeup so much and I
decided to go for this movie I shadow
look with a moping clip she does usually
tend to alternate between MO and warm
colors on the eyes so if you guys do
want to see how I achieve this I earn a
grande inspired makeup look then just
keep on watching
prior to filming I applied my primer and
this is the makeup forever step one
smoothing primer and moving on to
foundation I am taking me Mac Studio Fix
fluid foundation today and I'm gonna be
applying this all over my skin at using
my Real Techniques sponge I decided to
go for this foundation today because
it's a really nice full coverage and it
does dry matte and I do notice that
Ariana's base always looks nice and
matte and flawless so I decided to go
for this foundation today I'm just
applying a nice even layer all over my
skin just to cancel out all of my skin's
natural color and to give myself a more
flawless finish moving on to my eyes I
am taking the soft ochre Paint Pot from
Mac and I'm just applying a thin layer
of this onto my lid just to cancel out
my eyes and natural colors and also just
to prep it for eyeshadow next getting
started on eyeshadow I'm gonna be taking
the makeup revolution Naked chocolate
palette and taking this move brown shade
it's very light I'm going to use this as
my first transition shade and just
blending this with a big fluffy brush
into the crease you can go for some
warmer colors I have noticed that Ariana
tends to go from really warm colors and
also like pinky tone and move tones on
her lid and so I decided to go for more
pink tones and just taking this deeper
shade of this chocolate brown taking
this on a Mac t17 and just applying this
into the crease you really want to build
up some depth into the crease so I'm
just gradually building up this color
and just making sure that it looks nice
and intense and I am focusing this
mostly on the outer V area and making
sure to blend this out next taking this
even darker chocolate shade I'm gonna be
applying this into the outer V as well
just to finally add more definition and
as you can see I'm mainly focusing this
on the outer V area and just not really
dragging this out too much because it's
really gonna change the shape of our
eyes to see I'm just creating a tiny
little V on the outside of my eye and
just applying it just there and that's
the only place I'm really applying it
and this will really turn the eyes
next taking this shimmery gold shade I'm
going to be applying this onto the lid
with a flat shader brush again you can
go for any color you like
the main thing of this look that's
really Ariana liked is the eyeliner so
you can kind of switch up the colors as
much as you like I wanted to go for some
ov and gold tones but you can use
whatever colors you like and then for
the final touch which is definitely the
eyeliner it's definitely the star of the
show I'm going to be taking my BH
Cosmetics eyeliner this is the felt-tip
version and I'm creating a wing and
instead of doing my wing outwards as I
usually would I'm really turning the
wing upwards and this is really gonna
lift the eyes and I noticed that Ariana
has a really angular wing so that's the
kind of wing I wanted to go for next I'm
just applying some wispy lashes onto my
eyes
and then to finish off to make the
lashes blend in a little bit more I'm
taking some mascara and applying them on
my natural lashes to blend into the
false one next I'm just going to be
applying some concealer under my eyes
and also just cleaning up these sides of
that eye shadow we applied I'm applying
my Maybelline fit me concealer you guys
know I have suit ly love this concealer
this is just gonna brighten these areas
and also conceal any dark circles too
I'm also going to be applying this onto
my forehead and my chin just to bring
these areas forward - and then to blend
it all together I'm taking that on the
Real Techniques sponge again just to
blend it into the rest of my skin
and then to make sure that all of the
little areas are nice and blended I'm
taking my Sigma 3d HD precision brush I
absolutely love this brush to get into
all the little areas that are really
hard to reach next I'm just setting my
under eyes with a little bit of the
Laura Mercier setting powder this is the
translucent one and I'm just applying it
with my sponge and I'm not really baking
because I'm just applying it with that
brushing away any of the excess almost
straight away and then applying some of
my soap and glory instant retouch powder
to set the rest of my face
miss applying some bronzer on a big
fluffy brush and just applying it onto
the outer perimeter of my face usually
Arianna doesn't have a lot of color
going on on her cheek so I just decided
to apply some bronzer and then taking
some of the hoola bronzer I'm going to
start to contour
and then using some more of that laura
mercier setting powder I'm just gonna
clean up the bottom of my contour to
really make it stand out and to just
really structure my face next I'm just
gonna be filling in my eyebrows quite
lightly I am gonna be filling in the
shape but I'm not gonna be using a lot
of product just because I don't want to
go for anything too dark and I'm just
using my Anastacio Beverly Hills brow
wiz and also my clear brow gel from uh
Nastasia as well just to put everything
into place and to make everything look
nice and neat and next just dusting away
at that powder underneath the contour
and we're gonna get started on to the
rest of the eyes I'm just taking some
black gel liner and applying it to my
waterline only I've always noticed that
Ariana doesn't really have a lot going
on on the rest of her eyes she doesn't
usually have even mascara on the bottom
just black eyeliner so I wanted to just
keep it nice and authentic and then I'm
just applying some highlights onto the
tip of my nose and also onto my cheek
bone this is Becca opal highlighter and
I'm just applying this with my finger
and just applying a really small amount
of this and just blending it into my
skin and then for the lips I decided to
go for just a moment lip because I do
feel like that's the kind of color that
I would see Ariana in the most and this
is a Kiko retractable lip liner and I'm
just first applying this all over the
lip so I'm gonna make sure I cover my
whole lip with this color and then I'm
gonna go on top of that with a soft
matte lip cream from NYX
next I'm just going to be using the soft
matte lip cream from NYX in Cairo and
I'm just gonna be applying this all over
and blending it in with my finger just a
create a nice pinky motive shade so guys
