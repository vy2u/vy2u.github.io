be showing you this ariana grande
inspired makeup look it's a really nice
winged liner with a really beautiful
berry left so the first step is going to
be applying my foundation I'm applying a
really nice honey tone foundation
because Ariana has really really really
nice and tan skin so I'm just trying to
replicate that I wish I still had my
natural turn but unfortunately I don't
so I'm just applying a slightly darker
foundation to my skin I'm using Studio
Fix fluid in NC 42 and the reason why I
use that foundation is because it has a
really full coverage so that's the kind
of look that I wanted to go for so I'm
just buffing that all over with my Real
Techniques brush and yeah I'm just sort
of buffing it everywhere
next I'm going to be priming my eyelid
with a Paint Pot by Mac this is laying
low and I'm going to be applying this
all over my lid to prep the eyes before
we put eyeshadow or eyeliner on top of
it this is key for a flawless eyeshadow
application next I'm going to be taking
the champagne color from the fil
exposure palette by Smashbox and apply
it to my inner tear ducts unfortunately
it didn't catch it on camera for some
reason so I just applied that to my
inner inner tear duct area next I'm
applying uninterrupted by Mac and
applying that all over my lid this is a
matte brown eyeshadow with a burnt
yellow undertone and I'm just applying
this with a flat brush all over the lid
and then I'm going to be blending it
upwards as well this eyeshadow is so
super easy it looks really really nice
and effective but it's just so easy to
achieve you literally apply the brown
all over the lid and then I'm going to
be blending outputs as well
and that's practically it and it looks
so nice it's such a nice style so it's
really really easy so I'm just going to
be blending that into my crease and then
blending it quite high above as well to
give the effect of deeper set eyes
next I'm going to be doing a winged
liner and my eyeliner was actually
drying out so that's why you'll see me
struggling a little bit and yeah I'm
just going to do the line on the top of
my lid quite thick and then I'm going to
be dragging it outwards towards my brow
like eight eighths or feline flick so
once that line on your lid is thickened
you just want to start dragging that
line outwards and following your bottom
lash line and just flicking it up and
then once you've flicked it up just fill
it all in next I'm going to be applying
some mascara to my top lashes and
applying a gel eyeliner to my waterline
Ariana doesn't have any any sort of
eyeliner on the bottom of her lash line
she only has it on the waterline so I'm
keeping it as genuine as possible and
I'm going to be filling in my eyebrows
as well and I'm trying to keep them
quite fluffy because Ariana's is also
quite fluffy
next I'm going to be brushing through my
hairs to give it a more natural effect
and then I'm just going to be going
underneath to highlight my brow with a
concealer and that's just gonna make the
shape look better as well and just more
shapely next I'm going to be applying my
false eyelashes the names and the
numbers will be down in the description
box below along with everything else
that I've used today so I'm just
applying them onto my lash line and
these are quite fluttery and flirty
lashes and they're quite with speeds
nothing too thick but they look really
really nice with the whole work then I'm
going to be applying some mascara to my
bottom lash line
and I also felt like my crease needed a
slight amount of darkening so I just
went in with a slightly darker Brown and
just applied that above my crease
next I'm going to be highlighting under
my eyes and I'm using the NARS creamy
concealer in custard and I'm just going
to be sculpting out the areas that I
want to bring outwards so I'm doing my
under eye area and just creating a
slight triangle and then I'm going to be
doing my Cupid's bow and the bridge of
my nose just to narrow my nose slightly
as well and I'm going to be blending
that with a zoeva brush I don't know the
name of this but I will put that down
below as well but this brush is amazing
it's like a really nice rounded small
brush and I absolutely love it for
blending in concealer and highlighter
and stuff like that so I'm just blending
that all into my foundation just to make
sure that it looks nice and seamless we
don't want to be able to see any lines
we want it to just sit on our skin
really really naturally
next I'm going to be setting that
highlights with emphasized powder by Mac
and this is a highlighting powder so
this reflects the light and it's just
gonna help us highlight them areas even
more and it also sets that concealer in
place as well so it just looks amazing
and I'm going to be taking this contour
powder by Mac as well I always forget
the name of this one that it will be
down in the description and I'm going to
be contouring my face with that and then
I'm just gonna very slowly build this
color up so that it looks nice and
dramatic we want it to look nice and
sculpt it I'm just slowly building that
color up and concentrating it into the
very deepest hollow of my cheek and I'm
just gonna warm that up a little bit
with bronzer this is the Bobbi Brown
bronzer and gold in the light as usual
and then I'm going to highlight my
cheekbones with Becca cosmetics
highlight in opal can you see this
highlight guys like this is unreal it
looks amazing on camera and in real life
and everything it just looks absolutely
amazing so gonna be applying that to my
cheekbones and that just adds to the
whole contouring and highlighting and it
really makes the cheekbones stand out
next I'm going to be lining my lips with
a sort of berry color lip liner and as I
sort of shape my Cupid's bow I want to
make it more rounded like Ariana because
hers is amazing and full and round so
I'm just gonna go slightly above my lip
line and shape it into more of a rounded
shape rather than follow my natural
pointed Cupid's bow
and I'm just gonna line the rest of my
lips as well next I'm going to apply my
lipstick this is a new matte lipstick
and it's from their holiday collection
it's a nice matte berry color and I'm
just gonna apply this all over the lips
but I don't apply it too boldly because
in the video her lips look like a tinted
berry color it doesn't look really bold
so I want to go along with that and just
apply it very lightly and almost Pat it
on my lips instead of rubbing it on
lovely so that's the end of this leg I
hope that you enjoyed another celebrity
inspired makeup look I hope that you've
enjoyed don't forget to give me a thumbs
up if you did enjoy and don't forget to
comment too and I will see you in my
next video bye
so guys I'm back it is now four o'clock
it's been exactly four hours and I can
honestly say that the foundation has
lasted really really well I know my own
skin and I know that nothing ever lasts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
