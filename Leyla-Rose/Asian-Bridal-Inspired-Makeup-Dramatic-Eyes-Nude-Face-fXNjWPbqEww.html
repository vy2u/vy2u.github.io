to be quite a different and dramatic
tutorial today this is a Asian Bridal
inspired makeup and as you can see the
colors and the styles are not different
to anything that I've ever done before
but funnily enough a lot of my looks are
actually inspired by this because Arabic
makeup and Asia makeup was one of the
first kind of makeups that I used to try
because I was I used to love it so much
so yeah that's where my love for makeup
kind of started so yeah a lot of my
looks I do now or kind of relate it to
that in a sense so yeah but obviously
this looks quite difficult but it's more
broken it down as much as I can it's
just like any other look but just with a
lot more eyeliner pretty much I mean
that's all I can say and brighter colors
so definitely give it a try I hope you'd
enjoy and I will see you again at the
end so guys we're starting off with our
primed eye I've already primed my eyes
and I'm going to be putting a base for
this gold and I'm going to be using the
Maybelline Color tattoo and I'm not
exactly sure on the color number but
it's this bright gold one I think
there's no more than one shade of gold
but it's like the bright bright gold and
it looks a little something like this so
yeah I'm just gonna be taking my sigma
e60
flat shader large shader large shader
and I'm going to be applying this to
just the lid of my eye
so after that gold base is on I'm going
to be taking and the lights by Mac and
it's just this really warm gold color
and it's quite a dark God it's not a
very bright gold but considering we've
put a bright kind of gold base it's
gonna make really make this brighten up
I really like the shade of this because
it's very warm so I'm going to be
putting this just on top of that base
and the brush I'm using is a Mac 239 so
just putting that all over the brush and
I'm going to be putting this on top of
that base and you can just see that the
color is very very warm
so guys the next step that I'm going to
be doing is I'm going to be doing our
crease color and I'm going to be taking
a matte red onto my two-to-four brush
and this is just gonna we're gonna blend
this color into the crease and this is
going to make the look very very warm
and I'm really going to accentuate the
crease with this red color so just
taking this color and blending it in
windshield wiper motions we're gonna
take extra care and extending it as well
because Asian Bridal eyes are very very
accentuated and you will usually see
long winged eyeliner you know really
elongated and cat eye like kind of make
up so that's why we're going to be
extending it
and as you get closer to your brows use
a much lighter hand so that you don't
take too much heavy color too close to
the brows so I'm using a very very light
hand at the moment it's very very gently
just blending this upwards and I'm gonna
stop about there maybe extending it just
just a little bit more but as you can
see it's starting to look very very
colorful and very beautiful so next I'm
going to be taking my Sigma e-40 brush
and this is just like the same as the
macro brush it's pretty much the same
but it's a bit more fluffier in my
opinion so I'm gonna take this to really
blend out them colors and I'm gonna put
no product on this and I'm just gonna
use it just to blend up the color
I just put so we're just gonna try and
make a really really seamless effects
and we don't see any lines literally
just the color blending up so I don't if
you guys can see but this is obviously
very very blended you can't see any
lines and that's exactly what we want so
guys the next step is going to be
creating a nice dark outer V and we're
going to be using black for this and I'm
going to be using the black out by Urban
Decay this is like my favorite black
ever I use it I think every single video
I've ever used and pretty much like
everyday so I love this color and I'm
gonna be using a pencil brush and this
is just the Sigma e30 and I'm going to
just create a V on the outside of the
eye and don't worry about the reds
because we're going to be going over it
afterwards as well so we don't lose that
color
very like I'm just going to be lightly
blending it up and creating the shape
that we want
and don't worry about how fire extending
it I mean I am taking it quite far out
but of course what you're doing is
completely up to you so if you don't
want to take it as far out and you
actually want to wear this salad then
you can obviously keep it a little bit
closer in but I'm going to be extending
it quite a bit and also you can use the
tape method as well you can place a
little bit of tape just there and that's
going to help you create a more straight
line I guess but I suppose I don't maybe
because I'm a bit more precise with the
practice that I've had but if you guys
find a little bit hard to create
straight lines then just place a little
bit of sellotape or medical tape there
and that will help you get started
because I used to do that too
so guys the next step is just going to
be going back with our Mac two to four
blending brush and I'm going to be going
back into that mutts red again I just
remember I didn't show you what color is
and it's just this one right here the
one at the top and it's just a a virgin
matzah red you can find it in probably
any palette and we're just going to be
going over that again blending up the
black that we just applied we want to
make sure that we don't lose this black
and this red sorry because it's kind of
the whole idea of the look because red
is a very significant color when
applying
Asian wedding makeup so it's very
important not to lose that in the look
of course it's your choice if you want
to put its more died down than this but
I'm obviously doing it quite inspired by
it so so just blending this color
upwards and as you can see with the
black it looks a lot more vibrant now it
looks a lot more I don't know I think it
just looks so beautiful
so just blending that art you can see
that the black and the red are starting
to merge together and next I'm going to
take that Sigma brush again with no
collar on it
and I'm just going to be blending this
red now upwards so that we have a nice
seamless effect back with the mutt brush
again just go back and forth to how much
you need it so you're getting nice even
blend
then one last time with the Sigma brush
like that so guys next I'm going to be
darkening my crease one last time just
so that I don't lose that boldness of
the black and the reason why I'm making
is so dramatic is because Asian Bridal
does tend to be quite heavy on the eyes
and that's why I'm just going purely by
what they usually do and what I've done
in the past as well for my Asian Bridal
clients so this is just completely
inspired by it so if you don't want to
do things this way then you don't have
to do you can turn it down a little bit
or you can do it as much as this if you
want to
so just darkening it one last time
making sure we don't lose that black as
well as keeping the red nice my next
step is going to be applying my
highlight and the highlight color I'm
going to be using is kinky from the
smoked palette of Urban Decay and this
is just a very light off-white color and
it's mapped as well I'm just using a
real techniques detailer brush as the
next step is going to be applying wings
liner to the top of my lid and it's
going to be quite thick and wind and I'm
going to be applying the same eyeliner
to my waterline also
finish that we're going to be doing
eyeliner on the bottom now and we're
going to be doing double winged eyeliner
and this is a popular in cultures like
these and they often do makeup like this
so I'm really excited about doing this
because I haven't done a double winged
look for you guys on YouTube yet so I'm
really looking forward to teaching you
guys how to do it so I'm just gonna be
taking the Maybelline where is it called
again
I studio lasting drama in black and I'm
actually using a lip brush which is the
Mac 3 1 6 but I really like it for
creating lines it's really like precise
so I really like doing that and I'm just
going to be warming some of it up on the
back of my hand because I finally
creates a better line this way so I'm
just gonna start by drawing on line
now it's important to make sure that in
between your lashes it's filled in black
because the whole thing is going to be
black so make sure that you try and make
sure that's black so I don't know if you
guys can see properly because of where
the camera is positioned but I'm going
to just line underneath that I'm quite
thick eyeliner so you've got to make
sure that you have quite a steady hand
because we want the line to be quite
fluid so from this point as it gets to
the edge of your eye we don't want to
fill in any more we just want to take in
a nice long line
for the other corner I'm going to create
a nice kind of cat's eye corner and it's
going to be quite like triangular in the
middle and I tend to do this one on my
makeup already so I'm very inspired by
like Asian makeup so I do this anyway
what you're gonna do is just take it
from the inner corner
bring it downwards like that so it's
almost like you followed the top line of
your your upper lid and you've just
completely taken it down and then you're
going to take it from the tip
and connect it to the bottom so it's as
simple as that okay so the final step of
creating this eye look is going to be
applying the jumbo eye pencil in milk
and I'm putting this onto a Mac 266
brush and basically what I'm going to do
is I'm going to draw a line in between
the two wings and it's going to just
create a really really nice effect it
happens a lot
in Asian and Arabic makeup so yeah like
that and the same with the others look
if I'm going to be putting on a lot of
mascara and a nice pair of thick lashes
so guys this is the finished look as you
can see it's very very dramatic like I
said at the beginning but I absolutely
love it I love the color I love
everything about the way they look the
way they dress and I think that it's
absolutely a gorgeous makeup style and
it's inspired a lot of the makeup styles
that aren't actually Asian style makeup
so that go through quickly what I put on
my cheeks and four brothers are because
I don't want to fit it in because my
videos have been too long and because it
takes so long to upload some videos
where I think it's not necessary I'm not
gonna put in my part of my face I'll
just tell you because it's a lot quicker
so I put Bourjois for contouring as the
chocolate bronzer and I'm not sure the
shade but it smells amazing the MUA
shimmer kisses bronzer and it's just I
use this for our highlight it's
absolutely mash up now but I love it I
spray a little bit of Mexican fix+ onto
my brush put it in and it creates a
really pretty highlight and of course my
favorite blush in the world Mac warm saw
and some full lashes that extend to the
end to really accentuate the cat eye
look so I hope you enjoyed watching it
guys please for me give it a try because
it's so fun to do I absolutely love it I
love the colors and you can switch
around the colors as well like instead
of blending out with red you can blend
it out with a green or a blue or or just
keep it neutral do like
nice wind eyeliner and you know I mean
so just try and practice along with it
try as much as you can and I'm sure that
you guys will absolutely love doing it
