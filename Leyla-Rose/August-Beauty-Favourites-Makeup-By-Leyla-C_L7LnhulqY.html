Channel today I'm going to be doing with
you guys my August favorites I don't
usually do favorites consistently after
each month I have things I just really
wanted to talk about and i feel like i
just missed talking about products that
i love with you guys so I'm really
excited to just chat you guys about
products that i have just been loving
this month you guys usually love to hear
these kind of videos and I love doing
favorites videos I love watching
favorites videos so hope you guys enjoy
I probably won't do a favorites video
after this one so I just felt like I
wanted to do it this month so I'm just
gonna jump straight into it so my first
favorite is the only lon makeup favorite
I believe and this is a perfume I've
been absolutely loving the paco rabanne
lady million I've had this for a while I
think I've had this for about a year or
so but I've recently been spraying it
because I don't know what it is about
the smell but it just feels like a
really nice transition sent to go into
the four months I really love about lady
million is that it's not a summer scent
like it reminds me of the wintertime I
don't know why um but it's just really
nice i can smell floral and I can smell
fruit but it's just really feminine
really nice so this I'm absolutely
loving just because I feel like it's a
nice one to transition because I feel
like when do you stop wearing all the
fruity scents and when do start wearing
all of these kinds of sense I also have
one foundation to talk to you guys about
eyeball this a while ago and I just
haven't wanted that much and I wore it
recently and I figure we're in one of my
last tutorials it is the infallible 24
hour Matt L'Oreal foundation this is
just a super map full coverage
foundation that is pretty much like a
creamy formula and it literally dries on
your face completely matte gives you a
really nice flawless finish and what I
really love about this is that it really
does work for oily skin it doesn't sort
of separate on the oily parts of the
skin and I just really like the way this
looks although on my dry skin it really
picks out my dry skin so if you have dry
skin i would recommend this at all it's
literally like just rubbing powder all
over your face otherwise if you have
oily skin this is great so in the times
where it's been Alma I've been loving to
wear this in
evening because I just feel like it's a
really nice foundation and it does stay
on next on my favorites is a blusher I
know right like I don't wear blush is
often but this particular blusher is
probably one of my favorites if you're
like me and you just don't like the
blusher look then you will love this
particular blusher this blusher is naz
luster and this is what it looks like
this is basically like a honey peachy
gold tint to it so it just looks nice
and reflective it's not completely matte
so it doesn't look really flat on the
cheeks I personally like a nice warm
bronze cheek with a nice gold highlight
that's my favorite way to look myself
for my skin tone I just feel like it
complements me the most sometimes I just
feel like my cheeks are missing
something especially when I'm going for
a little bit more of a more natural look
I can feel like my cheeks need a little
something and this will just give it a
little bit extra that bronzer can't give
me I never really find blushes that I
love some of my favorites are warm soul
by Mac if I'm looking for something a
little bit pinky Goldie i also like
trace goal by mac which is basically a
gold blusher which is potentially a
highlighter in a sense but it's just
like a dark gold and so I like that too
but this is probably my favorite peach
blush I and I've really been using this
a lot off camera I don't get the apply
blush a lot on camera I definitely
should and by where this a lot day today
because I just feel like it gives my
skin that little extra bit of color I
feel like bronze I can't give me so
luster is a great one if you feel like
you're not really a blush a person like
me so I absolutely love this everyone
going places where I feel like I need to
take stuff with me I'm not necessarily
um to sleep places but just where I know
I'm not going to be getting ready at
home or if I'm just going to be getting
ready somewhere else or if I just feel
like I want everything to be in one
place this month a huge favor is the Z
palette I have put in so many different
stuff into the Z palette all of my
makeup geek eyeshadows are in here plus
a few of my mac shadows and also three
Mac highlighting and sculpting powders
which come from another palette i have
but these are the ones I use the most so
I just popped them in here he
Pele is an amazing invention they come
in so many sizes I personally like this
one because i feel like i can fit
everything in it and what I really love
about this is that I feel like if I ever
want to Deepak I shadows I have a home
for them another favor which you guys
would have seen me use for a very long
time I don't know if I've spoken about
this in a favorites video I may have I'm
gonna mention it again this is the soap
&amp;amp; Glory instant retouch pressed powder I
absolutely love this powder this might
be my favorite powder at the moment and
this is a drugstore powder guys so yeah
this is basically a yellow toned almost
translucent powder very soft very sheer
sets beautifully doesn't change the feel
of their foundation I feel like a lot of
powders on me make my foundation look k
kia and there's no i want i wanted to
just look smoother and more set and this
is exactly what this does i love this
phone under the eyes this makes sure
that everything doesn't crease I love it
everywhere because it's yellow tone but
it doesn't light in the area so much
that you can't use it for all over I
just love this and I feel like I always
reach back for our i feel like i'm going
to repurchase this a million times next
I have three lippies to share with you
and these are all from Gerard cosmetics
these are all incredible and I'm so in
love with each and every one of these of
them are the hydro matte lipsticks now I
done a review on these a little first
impression and swatches so I will link
that down below for you if you haven't
seen that video already but I did say
that I would follow up on these of how I
felt about them and how long they lasted
and if they will of lasting on the lips
these are honestly some of the best
liquid lipstick formulas I had ever
tried no joke I really am picky when it
comes to a liquid lipstick because i
feel like i love a good matte lip I
don't like it to be so crazy mad that it
just looks so ridiculously drive all you
guys to the perfect matte texture and it
stops and it doesn't feel like it's
drying out your lips it feels really
hydrating hence the name Hydra mat and
it's just amazing the color range they
have so far is only three colors but all
three colors are incredible particular
to that I love or Aphrodite and serenity
one of their newest colors i believe
from drug cosmetics normal lipstick line
is
vintage rose or this in my last tutorial
if you didn't see it was like this dusty
pink makeup look and this lip color is
just so ridiculously perfect it's
amazing and I love this color if you do
want to see what the color looks like in
action go ahead and look at my last
tutorial I will link a little link down
below for you and you can go check out
that tutorial but it's just the most
gorgeous pink it's like I don't even
know how to explain it it's like pink
but it's like a dusty pink where it's
just perfect and next I have a ton of
brushes to show you one of them you're
going to be like why you mentioned in
this again basically last month I said
that I use this to apply my highlights
scrap that use this to apply your
foundation concealer with and you will
never want to use another brush again
just by far my favorite brush ever to
apply my foundation just feel like this
spreads everything onto your face so
beautifully and what I'm not using my
Beauty Blender I am using this this is a
fairly new brush so if you haven't seen
it yet try and find it in the drugstore
try and find it anywhere where you can
find one purchase it because you will
love it and you will thank me later so
quick and easy if you're in a rush in
the morning literally has the best angle
to just get straight onto your eyes i
purchased the tapered blending a 35 and
the diffused crease ether t8 both of
these brushes are amazing i use them on
my eyes today and they just blend things
so flawlessly I've tried loads of Sigma
high brushes before and I've loved them
all but I used to have definitely just
changed the game for me because I just
honestly love them I love using this
little black one here for applying the
dark color into the crease and kind of
just blending it and I love this one for
applying my first in second transition
shades and they are just so soft and
amazing I feel like they've really
improved their brushes a ton since I
last purchased from them and then
another two brushes I wanted to show you
our another two sigma brushes because I
also purchased these at the same time
these are the f 25 and the f-35 this is
the tapered face brush and this one is
the tapered highlighter brush so I
particularly loved both of these or
setting my
I think this would be really great to
bronze with two if you really want to
get precise bronzing I've just been
using this cheap at phone powder on the
areas of my face where I feel like I
need it and this one I like to use to
set my under eyes if you guys enjoyed
