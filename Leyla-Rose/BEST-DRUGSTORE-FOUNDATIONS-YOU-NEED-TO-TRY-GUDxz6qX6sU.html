channel why do I always clap why right
so today's video is going to be a little
bit different what I usually do I was
thinking about the kind of videos that I
make and I thought Romans are awesome
actually just sat down and spoke about
products that I genuinely love unless I
use products in makeup tutorials you
guys are going to get to see the
products I really really really love and
is there going to do favorites videos
monthly so I thought it would be nice to
maybe do like my favorite products in
group so today is obviously my favorite
drugstore foundations I thought I picked
this off because I get this question all
the time what's your favorite drugstore
foundations where I thought I would get
all of this off with this particular
video today you guys liked this kind of
video you want to see me do it on more
different categories as makeup then
comment down below and you know what
categories will we do next so my top 5
favorite highlights my top 5 favorite
concealers and one significant to follow
me on Instagram and my other social
media because I do put like the products
that I'm wearing and like clothes I went
on to my Instagram to make sure you
follow that because I've just been
loving Instagram lately my Instagram
snapchat and my clicker are all makeup
by later so I'm running you need to find
like this video and subscribe to my
channel if you have it already and we're
going to stock all the self promo and
actually get into the video let's go
okay so the first one is a bit of a
cheek now you can't find this in a
drugstore I have to mention it because I
know that when I mentioned my high end
foundation this particular foundation is
going to fall in the high-end category
it kind of sits in the middle this is
the ex1 invisi wear foundation and if
you guys watch my videos I don't think
this will come and surprise to you but
if you are new to my channel and you
don't know about this foundation then
you need to know about it this is a
really good foundation if you have an
ordered skin tone like me right in the
back and I actually paid 12 pounds 50
for this in thing I thought is like I'm
at so I don't know how much it costs
usually I think it's around the 15
pounds mark so it is a little bit
pricier compared to drugstore
foundations but it doesn't quite fit in
to the high-end mark so if you guys
don't mind spending a little bit extra
this is an
foundation I think I have gone through
three bowls of this already
now this one is in the shade s 200 I'm
use the shade s 300 like you have a
slightly lighter shade just in case I'm
not turned and I'm not wearing this one
today but I'm obsessed with it and
honestly are use it in so many ways of
tutorials you guys can see how it
finishes out in momentum tutorials I use
it so often it's just really light it
children light on the skin and its
really feel like you're wearing anything
I'd say it looks relatively juhi I think
the finish looks a lot better when you
set it with powder so well let's go over
the powder I just think it looks
unbelievable and I'm just so this is all
my favorite foundations I just feel like
it complements my skin perfectly it
gives me a nice medium to full coverage
without looking too over-the-top and
cakey and it just one this is a
no-brainer to me whenever I'm not sure
what foundation to use and I just almost
give some flawless this is the one that
I go for so you've never tried this
before then definitely give it a try I
love it and I just wanted to sneak this
in as a part of the vivacious I
mentioned today because I know I'm not
going to mention it in the high end
video that I do so I have to mention
this I know you guys might be tired of
seeing this foundation but I think you
guys know this isn't in a particular
order the ex1 foundation I just
mentioned in one of my favorites but the
rest of this just isn't in a particular
wall out I'm just mentioning my five
favorites I own the next one is the
Rimmel wake me up foundation now I think
with hardsub line that this foundation
actually isn't available in the US /
Canada I'm not too sure if this isn't
available then if you ever take a trip
down to Europe and try and get your
hands on this because I really really
love this foundation this is a really
nice everyday foundation we're going to
just feel like it makes your skin look
brighter and raw more like your skin but
better it's a light to medium coverage
and I feel like it still covers
everything you need
what is that all about what is that it's
Candace brightening which it definitely
does that
it has bituminous tea in it with an SPF
of 15 and I have it in the color 200
soft beige I think it was a little bit
much for me right now but the one up is
a little too dark
I'm going in the middle I always have to
mix but that's fine more excuse to buy
makeup wise
it's a really lightweight on the skin
applause it's really easy to get as a
drugstore where either anyway so it's
just really lovely and I just love the
way to this look
I don't use this as often as some of the
other foundations I'm going to mention
but it is a really nice one when I feel
like I want to wear something I don't
feel like I'm wearing much and I want it
to look natural and glowy and this is
definitely one of those foundations of
all of our babies I'm going to mention
today I think I use this one the least
but it's still one of my favorites and
this one is the blue to our healthy mix
serum this is not the healthy mix
foundation it's the healthy mix serum
foundation now I would like to miss more
so to the coverage and feel of a CD
cream before the hard one to explain the
texture and the just the overall feeling
of this foundation is very different to
anything else I own it's a gel
foundation and it doesn't last for 16
hours but I do have oily skin I would
say it lost that law on me but what we
liked about this that is very very
hydrating even though my skin it does
tend to get oily throughout the day my
skin does have a tendency to get dry
also and there's a great foundation for
my skin is feeling drier and just want
to put something on or with a BB cream I
fit in my version of the BB cream I do
love the way to miss feels it makes my
skin feel amazing so this definitely is
good one I don't need this much like
shows I'll definitely wear it more in
the summertime the next drugstore
foundation I have to mention is
something that isn't available in the UK
yet and I'm still confused as to why
this is been available and this is at
some point because it is one of my
favorite drugstore foundations of course
otherwise it wasn't this video is the
L'Oreal Paris 24 hour and fallible glow
now I first tried this I think I tried
this in a first impression I can't
remember I wasn't crazy about it but
since I tried it more and more and more
this is one of my close to foundations I
absolutely love it
I reach for this probably over a lot of
my Gloria high-end foundations as well
in the fact that it's radiant 24-hour
medium coverage and the texture is and
like I feel like you can get almost a
full coverage with this if you build it
up and I just love the way that this
look is honestly stunning and I really
do so it has a nice glow to it the
infallible
change does tend to have a lot of full
coverage map products I really happy
they put this out and I guess why this
when I was in the States so I don't
believe is available you can get what
I'm sure it will be available soon if
you don't already own them I thought
like if your foundation has dimension
and it has blurriness to it you can
still make your look relatively natural
considering that it's not a natural
foundation if that make sense so that's
definitely my go-to when I want to cover
but look glowy and it's just stunning
and it's just one of the best foundation
the lasting power is quite good
considering that it is a glow foundation
so I want to say is 24-hour but I think
it's really really good considering it's
not on that foundation the finally the
last foundation I have to mention is the
enabling to fit me matte and poreless
the reason I'm going up to is because
this is other packaging lives in the UK
and this is how it looks in the u.s.
actually bought this first a year ago
when I was in LA and I fell in love with
it and they actually made it available
in the UK which is where I got all of my
other bottles from I'm wearing this one
today my skin is looking pretty blurry
but I went from really highlighted look
even though this is matte and poreless
it doesn't look super super matte on me
I would call it a dabbing map on me I
don't feel like it looks powdery mass
like other foundations I have owned in
the past and really does make my skin
look cooler have a little bit more
wiggle room as to what foundations I can
use now that my skin is cleared up so
much but when my skin was problem at
date this foundation was my go-to thing
you don't have to have it to looking
totally matte you can manipulate it to
look glowy and I've obviously done that
with a lot of Sainsbury and also
highlighting products as well like I
said I'm a modest makeup look I really
want to actually create this makeup look
on camera for you guys probably one of
the most poreless foundation Python
obviously I take care of my paws with
priming and prepping it but this
foundation just it does such as a job
honestly if you've never tried the
foundation before definitely going give
it a try whenever people ask me like
what foundation to go for when they're
in the drugstore unless they have
absolutely super dry skin I will
recommend this one 75% of the time
because even if you've got dry skin and
still feel like you can really
moisturize underneath this
nation and instill love in this so
smooth it's just an amazing foundation
and I definitely like that one is one of
my favorites out of all of them so that
was the end of my top five drugstore
foundations that you guys definitely
need to try I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
you didn't forget to smash a big thumbs
up and like I said comment down below

tutorial or just like a general let's
get ready with me this is kind of a very
simple look so I could do like a
chitchat get ready to move this work and
also let me know down in the comments
what selection appro actual with you
next I'm thinking high-end foundations I
think I might also do concealers as well
and highlight or there's just so many I
