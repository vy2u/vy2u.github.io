channel so today I have a super highly
requested video I am gonna be showing
you all how I achieve my curly hair and
oh my goodness this video has been just
requested for so long especially since
I've had my hair color change the last
one was quite a while ago so if you want
to know all the products I use and just
how I get it to look exactly as I do now
then just keep on watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for more
videos like this and without further
adieu let's get on into this tutorial
okay guys so obviously I have started
off with hair that needs to be washed
gonna go ahead and do that I'm not gonna
show you one camera because it's pretty
standard but I am gonna quickly go do
that off camera because if only it was
this easy I used the red can Diamond oil
shampoo and conditioner it's just been
the ones that I have been loving lately
since I have had my hair lightened and
it's obviously been bleached and I've
also been loving the red can extreme
anti snap serum so I just apply a lip of
that through and also the L'Oreal L
leave extraordinary oil and I just kind
of scrunch it through my hair just kind
of like a mixture of those two serums
just because I really like to take care
of my hair especially because my hair
tends to be quite you know that kind of
dry curly texture so I want to make sure
that it's nice and hydrated and then I
go in with some of the foxy curls by bed
head and this is their contour cream now
you guys are gonna see I'd use quite a
lot of hair product in my hair and
that's just because I have a very
natural frizzy coarse hair texture so I
need to apply quite a bit of product in
it just to take care of every little bit
of my hair needs so this specific
product really helps just my hair to
pick up a little bit more definition and
to reduce frizz so I really like using
this product before I apply anything
else and what I like to do is just take
a hairdryer and hold it pretty close I
use it on a low blow setting but a high
heat setting and I know you guys are
thinking I'm not using a diffuser plus
I'm holding the hairdryer pretty close
I've been doing this for years my hair
is not in bad condition whatsoever I
just find that this is what particularly
works for me and also like I said it's
not a high heat setting but this
particular hairdryer isn't very powerful
just because it's it's just it's not
super amazing hairdryer so I just go
through my hair and I scrunch it as I
blow dryer
sometimes I will allow my hair to air
dry but generally because I'm impatient
I will use a blow dryer
so at this point generally I would feel
like the hair product that I applied
before is started to dry so I have
probably been blow-drying my hair for
about two minutes at this point so I
like to go in with the on the rebound by
Bed Head as well I've been using this
product 40 years and I just find that
this really helps to define the curls so
this is where I thought that my hair
really starts to take more shape it is
quite a heavy cream so I wouldn't apply
too too much of this but generally
because my hair is so frizzy I find that
I really need this to reduce that frizz
and I'm kind of just like scrunching
through the hair again and kind of just
separating my fingers through the hair
and again just doing the same thing I
like to scrunch my hair as I blow dryer
on that low blow setting I don't like to
apply too much air at this points
otherwise it'll go frizzy too quickly
and I wouldn't use a diffuser if I cared
a lot about the definition of my curls
but generally I don't I don't care about
them being super ringlets II I just want
it to frame my face nicely and this is
what I don't really do I just honestly
it's just quick and easy for me so
obviously it will depends on your hair
texture this is just kind of what
happens when I naturally blow dry my
hair and apply hair put up to it but if
your hair is a little bit less curly or
more curly you're gonna see a different
call pattern in every single different
type of hair obviously so once I had
blow-dried it a little bit I turn my
head upwards just because I find that
when I do upside down it really helps my
head not to look flat like if I have my
head upwards too much throughout it it
ends up really losing a lot of volume at
the top so I like to flip my head upside
down come back up put my head I was lied
down I don't know it's just what I do
and I find that it really helps so now
I've got my head upwards and I'm kind of
just scrunching the hair again honestly
my hair dries pretty quickly when I do
this so I would probably have been
blow-drying my hair for about four
minutes at this point and as you can see
the curls are really starting to take
more place as they dry and to finish off
the calls I go in with this spray now
this spray does dry hard so a little bit
of that kind of dry mousse feeling so I
wouldn't apply this when my hair is wet
only when I feel that it's semi dry to
dry just cuz if I apply when is to wet
your hair isn't gonna call it's kind of
just gonna stay hard and wet looking so
I like to do this as my hair starts to
dry so now it's about semi dry I find
that applying this
at this point works perfectly for me and
as you can see I've gone a little bit
more crazy with the blow setting I've
gone to a higher blue setting just so
that I separate all the coals so the
coals don't stick together like I said I
personally prefer my hair to look more
volumous rather than it to be super
ringlets because my hair can go really
really Ringley if I wanted it to but
that's not what I care about personally
so at this point as you can see my hair
is picking up the volume and I really
like it to look like that but at the top
of my head for some reason I just lose
volume at the very top crown part of my
head so I applied this volumizing cream
from bedhead as well and I find that
this just really helps that top part of
my head actually love this product it
works so well I use this one I have my
hair straight as well just any point
where you lose volume at the top part of
your head I love it and this is an
additional step that you can do if
you're feeling extra I don't always do
this but I just thought I'd show you
guys just because I do sometimes
especially when I'm taking pictures and
also I like to do this when I'm
refreshing my hair after a couple of
days as well and that's to go in with a
really small color and just go over a
couple of the straighter looking pieces
like I said the way that I kind of dry
my hair and everything
I'm not crazy on it being super ringlets
see if I really wanted to I've used a
diffuser and use slightly different
methods as I would do it but generally
this is the way that I personally prefer
to do my hair because I like it to look
more volume s so when I do the curls I
don't keep on for too long I hold it for
a couple of seconds and then just
release so that it looks like the rest
of my calls that kind of like small coal
but they're a little bit looser than a
super ringlets if that makes sense so
guys this is the end of my hair video
honestly this was so highly requested I
have shown you guys before in the past
it has changed a little bit but
generally I like to keep my hair looking
this way when I have it curly just
because I feel like it suits me the best
if you would like to me to show you how
to make your hair as curly as possible
