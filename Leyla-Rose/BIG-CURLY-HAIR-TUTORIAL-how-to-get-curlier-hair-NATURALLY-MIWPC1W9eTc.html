Channel today I have a big curly hair
tutorial this was highly requested
considering I have recently changed the
way that I do this and my curls have
definitely improved quite a bit
a couple of weeks ago or around a month
ago my calls had totally lost their
definition so I'm also gonna be showing
you guys how to make your hair look
Carly at naturally as well just give you
guys all of my tips and tricks if you
love color videos let me sure to give
this video a thumbs up subscribe and
turn post notifications on and let's get
on into the video okay guys so the
number one tip that I would say that has
really helped to bring my cars back is
to wash my hair as little as possible as
you guys can see my hair is looking
pretty crazy right now so I'm gonna go
and wash it I actually don't have any
shampoos right now that I'm obsessing
with but I tried to use sulfate free
shampoos and leave-in conditioner has
been a massive tip as well that has
really really changed my hair game using
and leave-in conditioner every single
time I wash my hair and leaving it in
for at least 20 minutes to half an hour
each time I wash has really helped to
hydrate my hair and a little tip that I
like to do is put a plastic bag you can
use a shower cap if you have one on my
hair and then I want to wrap it up and
leave it in so that it can soak up all
the goodness I use the banana hair mask
from the body shop and honestly it's my
current favorite it smells like a banana
milkshake and I'm just obsessed so I'll
leave the end up for 30 minutes and that
will really allow my hair to hydrate and
I'll wash it out and then I will scrunch
up my hair with a microfiber towel that
is also something that I've switched up
and that has really really helped to
reduce frizz and also reduce breakages
as well a microfiber towel doesn't have
as much of I guess a coarse rough
texture to it so I really like to
scrunch up my hair once it's really wet
and as you can see already my curls or
forming and I just found that this has
really helped and changed a lot so I'll
just do this until my hair has got the
majority of the water out I like to flip
my hair around and just make sure that
everywhere is evenly kind of just like
got all the water out obviously it's not
gonna be dry and next we're gonna be
applying product into my hair I cannot
tell you guys how important it is to
apply the correct products into your
hair I'm first of all using this
Moroccan styling cream
and this just okay the smells amazing
just got to say and it's really
inexpensive so I don't mind using too
much of this I've gotta say maintaining
curly hair is definitely more expensive
than maintaining like straight hair the
products can get really pricey but this
one's really inexpensive so I do the
same thing as I used to do in my older
videos I just like to scrunch this
product through my hair but I can
definitely say that me changing up the
products that I use has really helped as
well because the products I use now are
a lot more hydrating and my curls are a
lot softer rather than hard and crunchy
I personally prefer and it just makes it
easier to maintain on the days to come
as well because you can repeat this
process over and over and your hair
doesn't feel hard so once I've applied a
good amount of that product into my hair
and it's applied all evenly I will go in
with another cold cream and this one
instead is from a brand called diva curl
and honestly this brand is so so good
for curly hair honestly it's a little
bit more pricey I get mine off Amazon
but it really has helped a lot so I
apply this into my hair as well before I
go in with my hair dry out with a
diffuser now a diffuser is really good
because it helps to dry your hair but it
doesn't blow too much air I guess and
then it prevents frizz and I really like
using a diffuser now I started using a
diffuser again a couple of months ago
and I still found that even using a
diffuser but not using the right
products and haircare I guess routine it
wasn't really doing much for my hair and
my hair still wasn't curling so it
definitely goes hand-in-hand a diffuser
alone isn't enough you really need to
take care and really hydrate your hair
if you want to see a difference in your
curls now when I say that you can get
curly hair naturally obviously it does
help to have texture in your hair anyway
I'm just saying that whatever your hair
texture is if you follow this kind of
routine you're definitely gonna see a
lot more wave or curl to your hair
unless you have dead pin straight hair
this should allow your hair to look like
it's got more texture obviously
everyone's car pattern is different and
if you do have a really straight hair
texture then this might not be the hair
video for you it's just if you have some
type of car or wave so what I like to do
next is pop my hair roughly in the
middle doesn't need to be actually but I
like my hair to kind of be even on both
sides
and I go in with the red can curvaceous
cream I used to use this years ago and I
forgot how much I loved it and when I
started using it I really noticed such a
difference this is the last product that
I like to put in my hair before it's
totally dry and I just find that it
really helps to define the calls so this
is great to do when my hair is getting
into that semi dry phase so I want to
just scrunch it through my hair whilst
my head is upright and I will scrunch it
and then I will go back in with my
diffuser and also something else to know
I just want to let you guys know is that
using less heat on my hair has
definitely helped as well if you don't
follow my vlog channel or my social
media you wouldn't know that I've
actually been on a heat band for a whole
month
so I basically didn't use any heat on my
hair apart from the lowest setting on my
hair dryer so it's super low it feels
like literally lukewarm air so it's not
enough to I guess damage your hair it's
really really low if you really wanted
to go on a total heat band you could
even cut that out but I just found that
cold air wasn't doing anything for me so
I used but I guess lukewarm so yeah
using less heat has really helped my
calls to come back as well and my calls
to look some of the best it's ever been
which is amazing and I don't go in with
a color anymore to just I guess to find
random pieces because I didn't want to
go in and I guess we're in my natural
carpet and I just want my hair to be
naturally how it's meant to be so then I
will take off the diffuser and I will
just use the hairdryer on the roots of
my hair to give my hair more volume and
I kind of just prefer it to be more
volumized rather than just super curly
and I would kind of just like pull up
our little cows and just mess around
with my hair and that is pretty much
what I do it's a lot more simpler as far
as the actual drying routine but as you
can see the cow pattern is just looking
insanely better to what it did a month
ago here's what my hair looked like a
month ago and as you guys can see it
looks a million times better and I'm
just so happy I guess with the results
of me using less heat and also just this
whole routine on my hair I really hope
you guys found this helpful if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up let
me know it down below any tips you have
for anyone with curly hair or anyone
that's trying to make their hair look as
curly as possible if their hair might
not be the coleus to texture there's
definitely ways and following this kind
of routine can help you even if it
doesn't end up looking exactly like mine
I'm gonna help anyway guys I love you
Center much and I will see you all in my
next month bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
