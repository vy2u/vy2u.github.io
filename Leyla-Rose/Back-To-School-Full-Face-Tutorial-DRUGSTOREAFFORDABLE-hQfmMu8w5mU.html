today's makeup tutorial is going to be
on this back to school full drugstore
makeup look if you aren't going back to
school like me this look will be perfect
if you want to look glamorous for work
it won't be too much makeup where it
looks really obvious but it's also quite
glamorous at the same time where you
feel like you're wearing something now
if you are going back to school I'm
pretty sure you want to kind of
transform yourself and look nice on the
first day so this look is going to be on
how to transform and make yourself feel
really nice and beautiful to enhance
your features without it being too crazy
and in-your-face see if you guys do want
to see the makeup tutorial on how to
achieve this look that I'm wearing now
and please just keep on watching
so to get started we're gonna be
moisturizing our skin and this is just
gonna make sure that our skin looks nice
and moisturized and smooth underneath
our foundation that way our foundation
will go on a lot smoother and this is
the body shop and vitamin E intense
moisture cream I highly recommend this
one as it's really good very hydrating
and it's not too expensive either then
I'm gonna be taking the maybelline baby
skin primer and this is just gonna fill
in all of those pores and just make sure
that our skin is protected and it makes
sure that none of the foundation seeps
into the pores and it just looks really
smooth and nice and for foundation today
we're gonna be using the l'oreal true
match and this one is a really great
foundation at for normal to oily skin
I'd say I think you can make it work
with dry skin but it does dry to a matte
finish so I'd highly recommend using a
more moisturizing primer if you do have
drier skin or just using another
drugstore foundation I wanted to use
this one because I feel like it has a
really nice long way especially for
school and it does have a very watery
consistency so you can really pick how
heavy you want this to be so for me I
wanted to cover up all of my blemishes
so I'm doing one light layer first and
then I'm also gonna be using this as my
spot concealer as well so you don't need
to go out and buy another concealer to
sort of hide your spots you can use the
same foundation and just apply it a
little bit more and build up in coverage
so what I'm doing right now is just
applying some more of that foundation on
any areas where the foundation didn't
cover then just sort of dotting it on
and patting it in with my brush you kind
of want to work in patting motions if
you want to build up more coverage
rather than rubbing just because you can
kind of rub away the coverage and it
kind of defeats the purpose a little bit
next I'm taking a Kiko concealer and
just applying this all over my eyelids
just because I really want to cancel out
all of that dark colouring of my eyes
this will also act as an eyeshadow
primer because we are gonna be setting
this with a powder
and then for my undereyes I'm using the
Maybelline fit me concealer this is a
great concealer especially if you're
going to school or work it's very light
if you set it it doesn't crease and it's
also really easy to blend in so if
you're in a rush in the morning this is
a really great one because I feel like
you can't really go wrong with it and
I'm just using the same brush I used to
apply my foundation and just blending
that into the rest of my complexion to
make sure that it looks nice and smooth
and it will kind of highlight and make
us look more awake and then to set that
and using my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder and just using that to
set my under eyes and also my lids this
will just make sure that all of that
concealer is nice and set and it won't
crease
and then using that same powder on a
larger powder brush we're just gonna be
dusting this all over the skin to make
sure that the rest of our face does not
move either and then for my bronzer
today I'm using this revolution vivid
baked bronzer and just applying a really
small amount of it underneath my
cheekbones just to kind of shape our
cheeks without having to contour them
that way you kind of get a bit of shape
and color at the same time so I'm just
kind of dusting it on my cheek bone and
then dusting it up to my temples also
and just making sure not to apply too
much of this then I'm taking my Milani
baked blush in Luminoso I'm just
applying it a little bit of this to my
cheekbones and just kind of dusting it
upwards in an upwards motion this will
just kind of lift our face a little bit
and then I'm taking my revolution baked
highlighter and with a small fan brush
I'm just applying it right to the tops
of my cheekbones just to give us a nice
healthy glow and also just to make us
look like we are still have the summer
within us I know that school has started
but we want to make sure that people
know we had a great summer for our
eyebrows I'm gonna be using the soap &amp;amp;
Glory brow archery pencil this is great
and a really great dupe for the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is I
absolutely love this pencil it's really
great it's decently priced and it works
pretty much almost the same way as the
brow is
I'm just gonna be applying this through
my brows just kind of defining my arch
and just any sparse areas extending the
tail and just kind of creating the brow
shape that I want and making sure to
brush through that with the spoolie side
just to make sure that it looks nice and
even and that it doesn't look too heavy
so you want to go to something fairly
natural and then I'm just gonna be going
underneath that with some concealer just
to clean it up and to also highlight our
brow bone as well and to make our
eyebrows butts nice and lifted
next I'm going to be taking an eyeshadow
base just to our lids to apply a nice
amount of shimmer when you apply a cream
it just makes sure that it stays on a
lot longer rather than just a powder
alone so this is really great for
something like school just because it's
really easy to apply and you can kind of
skip the powder eyeshadow on top of it
as well you can kind of just go with
this that's what you like then I'm gonna
be taking this L'Oreal eyeshadow and
just patting this on top this will just
make sure that that is set in place and
it just kind of gives it a little bit of
extra shimmer as well you can totally
skip this step if you are short for time
then I'm taking this sleek palette and
taking this peach matte color and I'm
gonna be applying this into the crease
and just blending this thoroughly if you
want to stop at this step you totally
can I just wanted to show you guys a
little bit more of a glam version of it
back to school work just in case you
wanted to go all out for the first day
of school
then I'm just taking this darker brown
and just applying it in the outer corner
just to enhance our eyes and to lift
them upwards and this will just kind of
give the appearance that you have made a
lot more effort than you actually have
just apply a little bit and make sure
it's really well blended and that's kind
of the end of the whole eyes shadow
effect it just looks really nice and it
looks like you've made lots of effort
when really it didn't take that long
which is great then I'm taking a brown
eyeliner and just applying it with a
smudger brush onto the outer corner of
my eye this will give us that lifted by
effect again without having to apply a
thick line of winged liner as much as I
love a wing I feel like it can be a
little bit too much for school it
totally depends on what kind of school
you go to so I'm gonna be taking this
matte white shade and just applying it
into the inner corner to make us look
nice and awake
it'll kind of just brighten that area
and it's gonna prepare it for the
highlight shade we're going to be
applying there later on
next I'm gonna be applying some mascara
this is the jordana best lash extreme
mascara this is so inexpensive even if
you're in the UK
then I'm just gonna be applying some of
that brown eyeshadow onto the bottom
lash line just to smoke out the look a
little bit just to make us look like we
have made lots and lots of effort really
as you can see it does not take long at
all
then I'm just applying some mascara to
the bottom lash line and I'm also gonna
be applying a nude eyeliner into the
waterline this will just make us look
more awake and it will kind of take away
from that tired red-eye effect it just
makes us look nice and awake and then
I'm taking some more of that a
highlighter I applied onto my cheekbone
and just applying it onto the inner
corner this will again open up the eyes
and it also make our inner corner look
nice and bright also and you also want
to apply a little bit of this onto the
brow bone - and then for the lips today
I'm taking a Kiko lip pencil and just
lining around my lips this is a really
nice nude peachy color
I wanted to go for a lip color that
wouldn't move throughout the whole day
and these retractable lip liners from
Kiko do not move they are amazing to
just go around your lips with this color
and then we're gonna be going into a
Kate Moss nude lipstick from the new
nude collection from Rimmel and I'm just
gonna be applying this all over the lips
this is a gorgeous color but it's not
that long wearing so I'm also gonna be
going on top of that with a Kiko long
wear lipstick and that will just lock
everything in so guys that is the end of
this makeup look I know that this is
quite a bit of makeup for school but
it's just if you want to make a little
bit extra effort there's no lashes
involved and not a lot of eyeliner it's
mainly just eyeshadow which looks nice
and soft and it's really good for anyone
that wants to make a bit of effort if
you are not going back to school this
will be perfect for work or any sort of
occasion where you just want to look
natural but that you've made effort I
love this look and if you do want to see
a really natural no makeup makeup look I
