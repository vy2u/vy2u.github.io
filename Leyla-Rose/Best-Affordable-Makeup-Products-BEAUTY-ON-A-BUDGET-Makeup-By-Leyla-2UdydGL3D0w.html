channel today I'm going to be sharing
with you guys my top beauty products
that are more on the affordable side so
I'm going to be sharing with you some
drugstore products and then some other
really affordable products from other
places as well so to start off the list
is my baby skin instant pore eraser
lightweight primer this is an amazing
primer that helps to smooth out the look
the pores because of its silicone
formula it helps you smooth and prevent
oiliness next is my l'oreal true match
foundation this is an amazing foundation
that helps to blend to the look of your
skin tone and also to your skin texture
is the well loved foundation and for me
it just tops the rest of drugstore
foundations it has such a high-quality
feel and it's definitely worth trying
and this one ranges around $9.99 next on
the list is my maybelline fitme
concealer this is an amazing concealer
to apply under the eyes as it reflects
light so perfectly particular concealer
ranges from around $5.99 and I love the
applicator because it just surprised so
easily and also because of the products
formula it blends easily for a perfect
highlight if you're a fan of the Mac
Studio Fix powder your going to love
this one the L'Oreal True Match powder
has an amazing finely milled texture and
because of that it just goes onto the
skin so beautifully and it blends very
easily it ranges from about 8 pounds and
it has an amazing range of colors not
only does the bourgeois chocolate
bronzer smell and look amazing
it also applies beautifully too it has
an amazing brown tone to it with no
orange undertones at all which is
absolutely amazing
it looks absolutely gorgeous on the skin
and it's smells incredible sleek contour
kit is an amazing addition to anyone's
makeup kit it just blends so easily the
colors never look patchy and it also
comes with a highlighting and a
contouring shade what more could you
need the 6:49
when I want a soft wash of color I
always go for my Milani baked blush ah
and these are unfortunately not stopped
in the UK so I have to get mine from
Amazon which ended up being a little bit
more pricey I mean look at the color
though it's so worth it the best
highlighter I've found is the revolution
of vivid baked highlighter this goes for
three pounds which is absolutely
ridiculous pigmentation of this is
absolutely amazing it definitely has a
high-end feel to it and it's just so
pigmented it has a gold reflect which
you can't really see in the photo but it
is just so stunning and it looks exactly
like NARS albatross my favorite primer
or eyeshadow cream for the eyes is the
Maybelline Color tattoos these are
amazing and they absolutely are so worth
the price they are $4.99 these are just
exactly like the Paint Pots from Mac
apart from the fact they don't have as
many colors but these just come out so
gorgeous and they are just so
long-lasting my favorite eyeshadow has
to be the L'Oreal mano eyeshadows these
are the more shimmery ones these ones
are a great price and they are just so
creamy and pigmented they come in a
great amount of colors and as you can
see for a soft wash of color it is just
so perfect and really great for the
price
my favorite kind of Pigman is the fine
glitter dust by Barry M these are my
favorites and you guys know that you see
me using them in my videos all the time
these work great wet or dry and they are
just so pigmented and very comparable to
Mak pigments next my favorite liquid
eyeliner is the perfect slim super liner
by L'Oreal this just works so perfectly
and it's amazing for beginners because
of the super fine nib it just makes it
so easy to create whatever kind of wing
that you want my favorite gel eyeliner
is the Maybelline eye studio lasting
drama this is comparable to the Inglot
gel eyeliner it just lost for such a
long time my favorite mascara is again
one that we cannot find in drugstores in
the UK is the Jordana best lash extreme
it's an amazing mascara but it's only
359 on Amazon so if you are in the UK go
get it also from Amazon you can get the
red cherry lashes which are so worth it
they range from about 2 pound 40 and
they just come in so many different
styles the next retractable lip liners
are my absolute favorites and you guys
must have seen me using these these are
4 pounds 50 each and they are just so
easy to use a very creamy and extremely
pigmented I get these off the NYX
website
when it comes to drugstore my favorite
has to be the Maybelline Color
sensational lipsticks there are so many
textures and colors to choose from that
you just can't go wrong and also they
have a very high-end feel last but not
least my favorite lip gloss has to be
the buck glosses again I get these off
the NYX website and these are just the
most amazing quality and they smell
incredible these are just so worth there
I love the applicator and the texture
and they are just so worth the money so
