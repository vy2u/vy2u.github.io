going to be showing you a curly hair
tutorial this has been so highly
requested for the longest time and I
just really wanted to do it for ages I'm
gonna be showing you guys some of my
favorite hair products I like to use in
my hair and also how I achieve my big
curly hair from start to finish so if
you would like to see how I do it and
just keep on watching so I'd like to
start out first of all by of course
washing my hair I decided I wanted to
show you guys the actual washing process
because I didn't show you this in my
last curly hair tutorial so first of all
I just like to wet my hair all over with
warm water and then go in with my Herbal
Essences hello hydration shampoo and
conditioner I like to do two rounds of
shampoo so first of all I just do one
shampoo and go in and scrub that in the
scalp and make sure it's nice and clean
and the reason why I do two shampoos is
because I only wash my hair once a week
so I do like to make sure that when I
wash it I get it real clean that way it
lasts the full week and it doesn't get
too greasy throughout the week next I'm
gonna be doing my conditioner I'm just
applying this into the ends of my hair
basically just everywhere apart from my
scalp just because this does make my
hair a little bit too greasy if I apply
it anywhere near my scalp and I just
like to brush my hair out using my
tangle teezer
love this thing it really does make sure
there are no knots and then I just rinse
that out make sure you rinse out really
really well and then I wring out my hair
get out all of the water and also at
this point I do like to kind of ruffle
up my hair a little bit and scrunch it
up to really get the curls going and
then I just put my hair in a towel for
five minutes just because I do like the
towel to absorb as much water as
possible before we start blow drying
otherwise my hair can be a little bit
too heavy and the curls don't bounce up
as much next I'm just going to be
applying some hair serum this is the
botanical shine nourishing hair oil
formulas all and I like to apply this
onto the ends of my hair to just give
them a little bit of hydration and this
just prevents the ends from getting dry
and breaking off so I really like to
apply this when my hair is curly or
straight okay so now I'm gonna go
straight in with the blow-dryer I know
that you are going to say why don't you
use a diffuser I personally feel like
when I use a diffuser it makes my curls
super super curly yes but it makes my
hair look flat so I like my hair to look
more voluminous so when I'm blow-drying
my hair what I like to do is stop ever
couple of minutes and apply some product
because I personally feel like this
prevents frizziness but it helps
everything to look more volumous which
is exactly what i want the product i
like to apply which is a cream formula
is the bedhead on the rebound curl cream
I've used this before in other videos
and I will link everything down below so
you can find it I'm just blow-drying my
hair on the low setting of the hair
dryer and just ruffling it in my hair
whilst scrunching it at the same time
and I do like to start off with my head
upside down and then I will turn my head
up normal ways scrunch a little bit with
a little bit more product and then start
blow-drying again I do apply product in
my hair like three or four times just
because I really want my hair to stay
like hydrated whilst I'm doing it it's
really hard to explain but yeah it's
kind of self-explanatory and you guys
can kind of see what I'm doing I do like
to make sure that my head is kind of
getting dried all over so I will flip my
hair in different directions and that
way I feel like the curls do more volume
us as well which is another way I really
like to do it so I'm kind of just
blow-drying the back of my head flipping
it over and just blow drying it in every
area and then switching it on to the
higher blow setting and this is
obviously going to blow out more air and
this is going to make my hair a little
bit puffier which is exactly why one I
like my hair to look fluffy but also the
cold be defined at the same time so this
is just personally what works for my
head next I'm just going to be taking
some of the Bed Head
foxy curls hi-def Calvary and I was
suffering some real trouble getting this
out like I think the nozzles broken but
it was kind of going everywhere so I
just like to apply this in my hair when
I'm finishing off and my hair is almost
dry and then I just go over and finish
it off and get my head to be totally dry
whilst this is in my hair this spray
does dry a little bit kind of hard so I
don't recommend using this at the
beginning of blow-drying your hair
that's why I like to use a cream this
just finishes off and keeps the curls
nice and defined so at this point I just
kind of like to play with my hair a
little bit before I go ahead and fix
some parts of it with a curling iron
this part is totally optional you do not
have to do this especially if your hair
is kind of naturally curly and you feel
like all the curls look naturally
defined if you feel like sometimes you
have a few pieces that don't call this
is a really good step I'm using the
Bellamy six in one Carla and I'm using
the smallest barrel to create some tiny
little curls just to make my hair look a
little bit more perfectly curly and I
love
doing this but I don't like to keep my
hat on this for too long because there
is product in my hair I know that my
hair can take this and that it would
break or damage my hair is very healthy
at the moment so there's you know no
damage of anything like that I just hold
it on for about five seconds just to
give my hair a little bit more shape but
if you feel like your hair is a lot
finer then do not do this do it whilst
your hair is clean so have a few little
straggling bits that don't look as curly
as the rest of my hair I'm just taking
the Carling iron and doing some towards
my face and curling some away from my
face just so it looks more natural
because the way my hair naturally is
there is no one direction that my hair
likes to curl in and this does make my
hair look a lot more perfect and curly
so guys that is the end of this hair
