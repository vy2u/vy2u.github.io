today I'm going to be sharing with you
guys a halt I haven't done the whole
like this before so I hope you guys like
it this is a birthday haul so it was my
birthday on Saturday the 18th of july I
wouldn't usually do a fool like this if
I didn't get things that I thought you
guys would be interested in but I
actually wrote in this style of a little
cheat sheet for my family to use I wrote
all the products on my want list and
they could basically pick from that
thank you for all of your birthday
wishes I had an amazing day and I'm so
blessed because my family and my
boyfriend they really took care of me
and really spoke me like a princess so I
had an amazing day and i thought i would
share with you guys the things that i
got for my birthday and i already showed
it up sneak peek of that on my snapchat
if you guys are follow me on snapchat i
definitely recommend you go follow me
because i am posting on there a lot more
now my name on there is makeup by layla
as well as all other social media I'm
makeup by layla on twitter facebook
instagram and also snapchat so i got
lots of different makeup products and
then I've also got sent a package from
sigma as well not for my birthday it was
just from the new color pop collection
so I decided to include that as well so
i will show that little collection fast
and then get into the birthday stuff i
just wanted to show you guys why I got
send because i love all the stuff I got
sent and I just thought because this was
a hall and may as well show you guys so
Sigma were kind enough to send me some
of their color pop collection and they
have the most gorgeous bright colors
they didn't send me all of the
collection but they did send me a good
majority of the collection I just wanted
to show you guys they sent me these
glitters and lose shimmers and they're
in such unique colors so the first one
is blaze glitter and this is just a
really nice orange fiery looking glitter
this is really pretty looking and I
really am excited for that i also got
sent Open Sesame blue shimmer and this
is like a hot pink blue shimmer so this
could be used on the eyes or if you want
to Pat it on the lips on top of the
lipstick this is really nice because
it's a nice hot pink metallic color and
then i also got sent bewitch glitter and
nicollet out of this is almost like an
iridescent white but it kind of has a
shimmer
green with in it so I think Green is
quite a common color running through
this collection to set me new spot light
powder and this is called sweet thing I
believe a spotlight pile dirt from Sigma
is like a highway but this is too dark
and pink for me to be a highlight so why
would like to use this as a blush it's
actually really nice and it has a really
nice amount of shimmer running through
it it's very pretty and I'm very excited
to try this it looks very interesting
nothing like I've already which is fab
which means i can use it in tutorials
and show you guys something a little bit
different why I actually have and then
also they send me this eyeshadow duo in
wink and sprout I absolutely love the
green color in this and also the white
again at the White is like an iridescent
to time white to green it's weird it's
got like a really slight green tinge and
then this is an ultra matte sprout
school to buy up sprout green eyeshadow
I have absolutely nothing like this
color and you guys know I am a huge
color freak I love colors so I'm really
excited to try this I'm going to be
using this new tutorial soon to show you
guys how you could use these kind of
green tones in a more bearable way
without it being too crazy extremely
pigmented I don't know if you guys can
see they are extremely pigmented and I
really love this white shade because it
really has a really nice a two-tone
effect and it's just really pretty and
you can see that for a matte shadow that
green is really really popping out and
the color is very bright it also sent me
this halo dust would probably like a
dazzle dust kind of thing and this is
called squeaky green this is just a
really pretty mint green which looks
like it has a shimmer which is really
nice they also sent me to lip products
one of them is this lip gloss in its go
and you guys going to be like what I was
a bit confused when i saw this too this
is a green shimmery lip gloss is very
interesting i'm not sure how I'm gonna
wear this I'll be honest by am excited
to see how I can make this what and
lastly they sent me the slip base in
love this is the thing I'm the most
excited about it's in a jumbo pencil
form it's an extremely
creamy lip product and it's very bright
this kind of has a satin finish and you
can see there's very pigmented very
bright and I really like the color
because this color is perfect for summer
it also send me the extended wear
eyeliner in balance and this is just a
really nice shiny brown pencil it's
absolutely gorgeous very nice and
shimmery I really like a nice brown
pencil because it's really nice on a day
when you don't go crazy to the playa
lobe of this on the lash line and it
kind of just defines ear without looking
too crazy so I really like stuff like
this that is all that Sigma sent me now
it's into my birthday presents I'm
really excited to show you this I've got
so many things i'm so excited to try out
a couple of them i did try on the day of
my birthday because i just couldn't wait
I pop them back in the box is because I
wanted you guys to experience it with me
by only use them once just because I
couldn't wait and I'm so excited about
them so I'm gonna start with non makeup
related bits fast just because there's
only a few and the rest are all makeup
so i will show you them first my amazing
boyfriend got me these beautiful rose
gold earrings box is all the way on the
other side of the rim by will write the
brand of these in the bottom bar below
the leaves are the most gorgeous rose
gold earrings with little rose gold
studs he knows that I love little hoops
and these are definitely not too large
and they are just absolutely gorgeous he
knows I love rose gold and he also
bought rose gold for me because he
bought me another rose gold item which
I'm so excited about I've never had a
designer watch before I'm just
completely like not used to this kind of
stuff so when he bought this for me I
was like oh my god this is a michael
kors watch i will write the model and
the name of the wash down below if you
guys want to know which one actually is
everything to be quite simple in a sense
and then I like to dress things up so
this watch is absolutely perfect it has
a complete black base and then
everything else is rose gold so I really
like how simple it is it's not covered
in rhinestones and for a watch that you
can wear for you know going out you can
wear it you know as an everyday kind of
thing this is just the most perfect
watch I could have asked for and I'm
very grateful of this as well as he is
just the most perfect man on the planet
I need to get the watry size because I
have the tiniest little wrists ever so I
need to get it resized so that's why I'm
not wearing it but I can't wait to start
wearing this watch I'm very excited I've
never really been a huge watch person
but i think i will end up turning into a
watch person my brother and my mom
bought me this amazing camera that i
have wanted for so long you may have
seen some of the youtubers and bloggers
talking about this this is the sony a 5
100 or the alpha 5 150 100 out of there
again link that down below on amazon for
you and this is one of the best cameras
to capture makeup so I'm just kind of
getting used to it I haven't actually
taken that many pictures yet and I
haven't put them on social media yet
there's also one other thing about this
that makes it different to the camera
that I film with it is small which means
someone is going to start blogging very
soon which is going to be very exciting
so whenever I'm doing stuff that you
guys want to know I'm doing I know have
a vlogging camera so if you guys want to
see vlogs from me I have no excuse now
so if you want to see blogs then comment
down below and like this video for me I
am very excited and I am very blessed
and I'm just so overwhelmed by how
generous my family have been ok so now
on to the makeup goodies this gift bag
is full of makeups if you guys follow me
on snapchat like I said you probably
would have seen in a lot of these
products already so the first one is
this Too Faced chocolate bar palette I
think it was about time I had a
two-faced product I have never owned
anything to face which is pretty crazy
to be honest it is the most amazing
palette I'm sure you've seen it before
on other people's channel I'm just late
to join the party unfortunately as
always improve much always late but the
colors in this palette are absolutely
gorgeous it's definitely a layer palette
and the smell of this made from cocoa
powder smells incredible the colors are
amazing they're very warm there's lots
of golds and bronzes there's also pops
of purples and you know cocky colors I'm
in love with it there's so many
different tones that I am in love with
and I just can't wait to get stuck into
this i'm going to be doing what
tutorials with this palette if you have
any suggestions of what kind of looks
you like to see with this palette then
let me know down in the comments my
boyfriend the sweetheart bought me the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I
can't believe I own an Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour kit now I actually haven't
used this all i have used is the banana
powder and a bit perform but i was in a
rush on my birthday I actually wasn't
too well so I didn't actually go up
completely so I don't even have a review
of this dear all I know is is that from
the swatches that I've used they are
amazingly smooth I cannot wait to get
stuck into this the shades are perfect
for my skin tone so I just got the
ready-made one but i do believe they
have different fills for you to pick
your colors one more thing that has been
such a long time coming and you guys
have been like Layla why do you not earn
a Beauty Blender I get asked over and
over and over again I don't know why it
took me so long to jump on the bandwagon
I was really content with my Real
Techniques one I only used this once and
I put it back in the packet I love it so
far I really really really do I'm really
excited to see what it's like the
different foundations I can't wait to
try it with my concealer I didn't get to
try it properly so when I have tried
this I will definitely do a comparison
or review on the Real Techniques one and
this one like I said I've always the
last one to join the party whenever it
comes to this kind of stuff my amazing
mother also bought me the Laura Geller
faked gelato swallow illuminator and
gilded honey you guys must have seen
that people speak about this this is
been highly raved about on social media
for a good couple of months now and
since this has been known to be a dupe
for the whisper of guilt I letter from
Mac that was limited edition I have used
this once and it's so small sort of
dawning use it but it is absolutely
amazing it came with this brush that I
haven't used yet I probably won't be
using this brush for this but i will use
it most likely for something else this
is absolutely gorgeous the pigmentation
of this is incredible I don't if you can
see that reflection but as you can
imagine this on the face is gorgeous so
I'm really excited to get started
playing this all over my face you guys
know I love my backup opal so I have to
which one I prefer as well as the beauty
vendor my boyfriend also picked me up
some anastasia beverly hills a brow
products you guys know I love my brows
to be on point so I'm really excited to
start using these words that he bought
me it was the clear brow gel I have
wanted to try this for so long I've used
this once and it does keep your brows in
place so you're going to be seeing it
uses a lot and he also bought me the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is and this
is in the color dark brown you see you
guys have seen this you've seen this
probably everywhere it's double sided
it's purely on one side and then the
pencil and the other this is amazing
this is the best brow pen so I've ever
tried and I've only used it once it's so
true when people are raving about her I
was obviously thinking I can it really
be that good it is honestly that good
guys he also bought me the brow powder
duo and this is in the color dark brown
also and this is really nice because it
comes with two different shades and I'm
really excited to start using this as
well because I don't always use a pencil
the last product I have to show today
the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
and that also came with this little
brush I've used this once and
unfortunately this actually did it work
for me then might I used it my skin has
been really weird recently it has been
going really well and then it just
suddenly breaks out for a day and then
it goes down and then it suddenly breaks
out and I use this on a bad skin day so
I'm going to wait and use it again but
it did still crease on me so has anyone
tried this and is there any way to move
ready to stop creasing because I sit and
everything and it just still creased so
I'm not sure maybe I need to bake with
this because I didn't bake but yeah
