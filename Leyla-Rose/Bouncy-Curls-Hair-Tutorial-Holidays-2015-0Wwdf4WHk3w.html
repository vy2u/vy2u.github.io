today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to curl your hair to get these beautiful
bouncy curls I think this look will be
so perfect for the holiday season for
Thanksgiving for anyone that's
celebrating or Christmastime or New
Year's it's just a really nice bouncy
curl and it's super easy tip you guys do
you wanna see how I achieve this hair
look then just keep on watching so you
get started I'm gonna be applying some
extensions into my hair to give my hair
some body and also to give it some
length as well these are the Bellamy
Lily hair extensions in the color off
black I'm first just gonna be sectioning
my hair around my earlobes and I'm gonna
apply it one track of extensions there
and then I'm gonna be sectioning my hair
and in my temples as well and applying
an extra track there I feel like two
tracks is enough because it gave me
enough volume and I do feel like because
of the length of them as well to give me
a really nice amount of length and I
just feel like two is enough but you can
totally add as much as you feel you need
to for your hair type
so once my extensions are in I'm gonna
begin to curl my hair I'm gonna be using
small sections about an inch and a half
section so color I'm gonna be using is
the Bellamy six in one color and the
barrel I'm using is the 19 millimeter
barrel so this is quite a small barrel
so it is gonna give us really tight
curls I'm just first of all taking small
sections like I said about an inch and a
half sections and I'm gonna be curling
my hair for about 15 seconds and just
holding it and spraying it with some
hairspray and I'm just gonna do this all
over my hair main thing with this look
is that you do want to curl away from
the face so I'm just curling away from
the face on this side and then when it
gets to the other side I switch and I do
again curl away from my face I feel like
going outwards really giving you body
and really makes your hair look nice and
volumous
I really didn't want this video to be
too long that's all so I'm just going to
be speeding through this it's the truth
the same on every single car is nothing
special to this look at all I'm just
doing the same thing all around my head
so as you can see I'm going to be
speeding through it but I'm just going
around the barrel keeping it there for
15 seconds every single car I do allow
it to cool and spray it with some
hairspray that way you can really make
sure that it stays curly and it does
look nice and bouncy
and then as it gets to the front it's
exactly the same the only difference
that I do hold the color a slight bit
different and I don't hold it as close
to my scalp that way it has a little bit
more void and it doesn't look kind of
too tight to a good top of the head I'm
just spraying my hair with some
hairspray and you can leave it like this
if you want to but I like to brush it
through just so that it looks a little
bit more natural personally I like to
really play with my cars and I play with
it for absolutely ages I like them to
drop a little bit as well so I'm just
playing around with their and after that
that's pretty much the end of this look
