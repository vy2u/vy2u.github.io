and welcome back to my channel today's
makeup tutorial is going to be on this
bronze goddess look which has lots of
turquoise shades which means it's going
to be absolutely perfect for them summer
nights
so as always I'm gonna be starting off
by priming my lids just to make sure
that all the eyeshadows blend and stick
to my lid perfectly this will also just
make sure that all the colors appear a
lot more pigmented and it just looks a
lot more brighter I'm gonna be taking a
Peach Smoothie eyeshadow from makeup
geek and just be applying this into the
crease as my transition shade this is a
very natural transition color and this
is just gonna be a really nice color
just to make everything come together
really really nicely then I'm taking a
makeup geek Coco bear and I'm gonna
start to apply that into the deeper part
of my crease this is just gonna prepare
the look for the black that we're gonna
apply and it's just gonna make the black
a lot easier to smoke outwards not to
mention it's gonna warm up the look as
well because this is quite a reddish
brown and I'm just using quite a few
different blending brushes just to
ensure that that is quite blended
outwards because we want to make sure
that it blends really really seamlessly
go back and forth into that brown as
many times as you need to to make sure
that it's nice and pigmented
next I'm just gonna be cleaning up the
side of my eye just to give us a clear
shape of where we want to apply the
black and then I'm going in with makeup
geek corrupt eyeshadow and this is just
one of the blackest blacks I've ever
used and I'm just using this on a pencil
brush and then blending it out with a
blending brush and just going back and
forth in between the brown and the black
just to make sure this black blends out
very seamlessly go in between the two
colors and the brushes as many times as
you need to to make this look look nice
and blended you want to make sure that
you're going back and forth between
brushes and just making sure that
everything looks absolutely seamless
again I'm just cleaning up that side
just so that we can have a nice clean
shape for where we apply our eyeliner
next time when are we taking a makeup
geek pigment in pokerface and this is
just a really gorgeous gold bronze color
and I'm just gonna be applying this all
over my lid and this just ties the whole
look together because this just gives it
that really amazing summery feel and
then I'm also gonna be taking makeup
geeks shimmer shimmer and oh my god this
is the best highlight shade ever it's
just the most gorgeous in a corner
highlight and I'm just making sure to
pack that on so that it looks nice and
vibrant next I'm going to be taking my
soap &amp;amp; Glory super cat eye liner and
just thought to do a really nice wing
you can of course go for a normal wing
of eyeliner if that's what you'd like
but I really wanted to take advantage of
the whole cat eye effect within this
look and I really wanted to just go with
a really nice wing of eyeliner that
looks very feline like so completely go
for any eyeliner style that you like and
I do also have a tutorial on how I do my
eyeliner so I will pop that in the
description box for you if you guys
wanna check out that video then I'm just
applying my false lashes
X I'm just taking my foundation mixed in
with the jar cosmetics bb+ illumination
cream this will just give us that really
nice will just glow within the
foundation even though this foundation
is matte it will give us that gorgeous
glow just coming through our skin I'm
just blending the end with my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
next I'm just going to be applying my
concealer I'm using two concealers today
I'm taking the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in custard and just applying
that directly under my eyes and then I'm
taking Mac's highlighter pen in light
boost I'm just taking that and applying
it onto the other high points of my face
I'm applying that onto my forehead the
bridge of my nose under my eyes and also
on my chin
then I'm just gonna be taking that same
sponge and just be blending that into
the rest of my complexion
next I'm going to be taking my Sigma 3d
HD presenting brush which you guys see
me use in every single tutorial is just
the best brush to get right up until it
the lines just so that you can clean
everything up with the concealer and
then I'm taking my soap &amp;amp; Glory kick-ass
powder and just applying it on top of
the concealer we just applied with that
same sponge
next I'm just gonna be filling in my
eyebrows you guys have seen me do my
eyebrows multiple times so I will also
leave my eyebrow video down below in the
description box also
next I'm going to be taking sugar pills
darling pigment and we're gonna start to
apply this onto our bottom lash line
that this will just create the most
gorgeous pop of color onto the bottom
lash line and I'm just taking a little
bit more of that corrupt eyeshadow which
is the black from makeup geek and
applying a tiny little bit as close to
the lash line as possible next I'm just
taking max power glide under current
pencil and applying that to my waterline
and I'm also just applying some more of
that shimmer shimmer to my inner corner
also i'ma doing a little bit of a cat
eye eyeliner on the inner corner and
apply my bottom mascara and the eyes are
complete
so to finish off the skin I'm going in
with a really light bronze I'm using the
Mac mineralize skinfinish in dark golden
I'm just using a little bit on a large
brush just to disperse the product
really evenly and then I'm taking a
slightly smaller brush and just applying
that same product onto the very hollows
of my cheeks just to give our face a
little bit more structure and then I'm
also applying my Becca opal highlighter
and just applying it to my cheekbones
and also onto the bridge of mine
and then to finish off the look I'm
applying a some boldly bare lip pencil
from Mac to my lips and I'm just
covering my whole lips with that and
just making sure my lips look nice and
peachy and then I'm taking Mac peach
soft lipstick and applying that all over
and just blending that in
and then she finished off to give that
gorgeous glossy wet look effect I'm
taking max clear lip gloss and just
applying that all over with my finger
