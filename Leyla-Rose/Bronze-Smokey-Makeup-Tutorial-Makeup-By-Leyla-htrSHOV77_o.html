today I'm gonna be showing you all how
to achieve this bronze smokey makeup
look
so I have already primed my eyes with
some concealer and I'm gonna go straight
into eyeshadow today I'm going to be
taking the two-faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and I'm first of
all just gonna be taking this a beige
brown color and applying it into the
crease I'm gonna be taking this on a
fluffy morphe brush and I'm just gonna
be using this to blend this color
outwards because this is really gonna
help all of the other colors we apply to
just blend so much more seamless and I
do want to build this color up quite a
bit so that it does darken up the crease
next taking this orange brown shade
which is definitely my favorite shade in
the whole palette I'm gonna be taking
this and applying this right on top and
close it into the crease to really warm
up this eye it really gives it a really
nice bronzy oranjee tint and it
complements really well with the bronze
shade we apply on the lid so I'm just
taking the onions away of a 2 to 8 brush
and just blending this back and forth to
really warm up that crease
next I'm gonna be taking this dark
chocolate shade and I'm gonna be
applying this on the outer corner of my
eye I'm gonna be taking this on a half
of my lid as well and just creating V on
the outer corner and then I'm gonna be
blending that with the same brush we use
to apply that peanut butter shade and
just create a really nice seamless
effect between the brown and the lighter
brown shades we applied
I'm again just building that color up a
little bit more just so it looks a
little bit deeper before we apply
anything darker just like to go back and
forth between colors to really create a
seamless blend I'm also just gonna be
wiping my eye just to make it look a lot
more straight and then I am taking this
black from the palette as well and just
applying it on the outer corner to
really create that smokiness on the
outer V and then just going ahead and
blending with that same brush we used
from before then taking this Goldy
bronze shade I'm gonna be using this on
the lid I'm just applying this on the
inner half of our eye just the most
gorgeous bronze shade
and then I'm going to be doing some
eyeliner I'm just doing a thin line on
the eye and then on the outer corner
taking some more of that black eyeshadow
I'm just going to be smudging the outer
corner of the eye liner just so it looks
a little bit more seamless and a little
bit more smoky I'm finishing off with
some lashes and these are some Eldora
false lashes lashes and I'm just
applying them with some tweezers to my
eye I'm just gonna be taking the vitamin
C moisturizer from the body shop and
just applying this all over my skin and
then taking the bodyshop lightining
drops I'm just gonna be applying some of
this into my makeup forever HD
foundation just to create my shade
because it is a little bit dark for me
right now and I'm just buffing the AM
with this makeup geek stippling brush
then I am taking some of my Maybelline
fit me concealer of course and
discipling its underneath my eyes and
onto all the areas we would like to
bring forward
I'm just blending in that concealer
using the Sigma kabuki brush this is
more of a pointed shape to really get in
there I'm also just gonna be setting
that concealer as well using my instant
retouch powder and I'm just using this
small Sigma f-35 brush just to get on to
all the areas we apply the concealer and
then I am taking a larger brush and just
setting the whole face next I'm just
gonna be bronzing my skin because I am
very fair right now and I just need a
nice amount of bronzing I am taking the
Make Up For Ever Pro bronze fusion and
just taking this on a real techniques
round brush and I just used it all over
my skin and also highlighted with Becca
opal onto the high points of my cheeks
and also unto my nose I'm just gonna go
ahead and do my eyebrows off-camera and
now I'm just going in with a little bit
of some Kohl pencil and just applying it
to my waterline so just going to be
applying it onto my bottom lash line to
to smudge that out I'm first of all just
going to take a smaller brush and then
taking a larger brush with a bit of that
brown eyeshadow to really smoke out that
black
then to finish everything off I'm just
gonna be taking some mascara and
applying a nice thick coat of it onto my
bottom lashes to really balance the top
and bottom lashes really well for my
lips I'm just gonna be taking this
cappuccino lip liner from Rimmel and
just applying it all along the outer
parts of my lips and then taking this
matte to Kiko lipstick I'm just gonna be
filling in my lips with this and I was
feeling a gloss and I just have been
loving gloss lately I just decided to
take this gloss for a Mac this is my
color
