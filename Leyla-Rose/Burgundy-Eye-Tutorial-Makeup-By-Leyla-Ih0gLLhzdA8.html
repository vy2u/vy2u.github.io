I'm going to be showing you this
burgundy i style tutorial and i'm going
to be priming my eyes first as usual I'm
using my soft ochre Paint Pot I'm just
going to be applying it all over the lid
with my finger and I'm just going to be
using lots of patting and blending
motions just to warm it up with my
fingers to put all over the lid then I'm
going to be taking the Lime Crime Venus
color and I'm going to take this sort of
purpley burgundy color and applying it
onto my lid and I'm using a flat brush
for this because as it is a matte color
you do want to pack on the color as much
as possible using lots of patting
motions instead of dropping so you can
see I am rubbing a little bit but I'm
using mainly patting motions so as you
can see the color just tends to build up
a lot better when you just walk on it
next I'm going to be taking this more
burgundy maroon color and applying it
into the crease area and I'm not going
to neatly with this I'm just going to be
blending it but I'm not worrying too
much if it's neat or not
we are going to be applying quite a
thick wing of eyeliner so it doesn't
really matter if it's too neat or not so
if you're not as confident with
eyeshadow this might be a good look for
you because it's just a couple of colors
and you don't really need to blend it
too much you just have to get the
original placement and just make sure
that you blend it as much as you can and
then I'm just going to be building up a
little bit more of that burgundy color
and just applying it into the crease
area and it's just going to intensify
the look a little bit more and then this
is obviously optional if you want to
intensify the look and make it look a
little bit more smoky you can apply a
little bit of black into the outer V
area and that's what I'm gonna be doing
and I'm not worrying too much about how
it blends because like I said we are
going to be applying a thick wing of
eyeliner so just buff that out as much
as you can but don't worry too much
about it
next I'm going to be doing a nice thick
wing of eyeliner so it's obviously
optional how thick you want the eyeliner
to be you can obviously skip the liner
if you're not as comfortable but the
eyeliner that I'm going to be doing is a
little bit thicker and what I like to do
usually when I'm doing a thicker wing is
I just like to build it up slowly
because you just don't know how thick
you want it to go you want it obviously
match the eyeshadow lerk of the rest of
the look that we're going to be doing so
just take it slow what I like to do
first is just do a line all along the
top lid and then begin to extend
outwards and then I like to sort of join
up the two lines that we just done and
then I like to just slightly thicken it
very very slowly and don't worry too
much if the wing isn't very neat on the
outer corner because we can clean the
arc which is what I'm about to do and as
you can see if you just sort of clean
the bottom tail with a white it just
looks a lot more precise and you don't
have to worry too much about that you
can just worry about getting the rest of
it precise next I'm going to get
applying a pencil into my waterline and
I'm using a black one by NYX and then
I'm going to make sure that I apply some
of it underneath because we want to
create that nice molded look and what
I'm going to do is just make sure that
I'm getting it in between my lashes and
don't worry about it being neat because
we are going to buff out with some eye
shadow in a sec
then I'm going to take that same
eyeshadow we applied onto our lid area
and just use it to buff out that black
and this is just gonna give us a really
nice smoky effect and just look really
nice and smoldering and you want to make
sure that you sort of buff out the wing
a little bit as well because it just
makes it look a lot more even then I'm
going to do a nice Arabic inspired inner
wing and I'm just going to be doing a
nice little triangle on the inner corner
and it just makes it look really nice
but that's obviously optional as well
then I just applied some mascara and my
false lashes these are two full slashes
put together I always put them in the
description box so don't forget to check
all the stuff that I've used in the
description box if you are wondering
next I'm going to apply my foundation
I'm using my Giorgio Armani luminous
silk as usual with the Real Techniques
sponge and I've just been absolutely
loving using a sponge to apply my
foundation recently I just think it
looks so smooth and it's really easy to
build up coverage so I just sort of like
to build up coverage in the areas that I
need it and then I like to use concealer
in the areas that I like to highlight
and I'm just using my Maybelline fit me
concealer which I've absolutely been
loving recently so I'm just using it on
the areas I want to bring forward then
I'm going to take that same sponge and
buff it in to my skin and I'm using lots
of bouncing motions and just pressing it
into the foundation that we applied fast
and I've just been absolutely loving a
sponge because I think it just looks so
airbrushed at the end and I literally
use it to apply everything in this video
so just apply my foundation my concealer
and then I'm also going to use it to
apply my powder as well which is what
you're seeing me do here and this is
just really mattifies the look so if
you've got oily skin it's really good
because you can really press it into the
foundation and fully set it
next I'm going to be filling in my
eyebrows with spiked eyebrow pencil as I
usually like to do and I'm just going to
be defining my arch and I'm going to be
buffing the rest of that pencil to the
middle of my brow using a spoolie
Escarra one thing I'm just going to be
making sure the inner part of my brow
isn't as dark as the outer part of my
brow and I'm just going to be brushing
through with an eyebrow mascara thing
and it's a lighter color so it just
makes my eyebrows a little bit less
harsh then I'm going to be highlighting
under my brow with some concealer and I
just love doing this to perfect the brow
and also lift the brow as well and it
just makes sure that if you have made
any mistakes it just makes the bottom of
the brow look really nice and sharp
next I'm going to be bronzing with my
favorite bronzer of life this is my
Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light and
if you're watching my videos you would
know that I've been through so many of
these I just absolutely love the love
and love this color it just suits
olive-skinned really really well and
it's just the perfect bronzer to contour
and to give you a little bit of color as
well so I've just applied a lot of that
one to my skin
next I'm going to be highlighting my
cheekbones my nose area with Becca opal
highlight next I'm going to be lining my
lips with cream o spice lip liner and
then I'm going to be filling in my lips
with honey love lipstick and you guys
know that honey love is my absolute
favorite it is the best nude in the
whole world and I just absolutely love
it and then I just like to use my finger
just to blend my lipstick into my lip
liner
so guys that is the end of this leg I
hope you enjoyed something that's really
nice and dramatic and it's nice for an
evening look if you're going clubbing or
just generally anything for the evening
