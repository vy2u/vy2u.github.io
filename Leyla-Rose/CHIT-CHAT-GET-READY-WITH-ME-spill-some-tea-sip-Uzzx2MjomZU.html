today I have a basically Q&amp;amp;A whilst I
get ready this isn't so much about the
makeup look because you guys have seen
me do looks like this a thousand times
before I just wanted to do something
whilst I was doing a Q&amp;amp;A so I thought
I'd make it a little bit more
interesting so you guys can watch
something whilst I'm on certain
questions if you guys enjoy videos like
this and don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up if you guys are wondering
why my hair looks the way that it does I
just washed it so it's like still wet a
little bit so if you're wondering that's
why anyway let's get one okay guys so
just chilling on my bed I'm just gonna
answer some questions and do my makeup
as you guys can see my hair is in a wrap
because I actually have a hair mask in
my hair right now and I'm not using the
bodyshop banana nourishing hair mask I
think it's called and it's my new
favourite it's so good honestly you guys
you have to try it if you have curly
hair or just dry hair in general so good
I actually have let me show you a
plastic bag underneath the wrap just so
it can like lock in all the goodness and
then I'm gonna wash it out after and
then obviously do my hair curly what is
easier to take care of straight or curly
hair 100% straight hair I honestly you'd
think having such curly hair that it
would be like long to straighten it but
once it's straight it's done whereas
curly has a lot of maintenance because
of how like I don't have to explain this
but I guess like how much you need to
refresh the cause like once you wash and
like allow your hair to go Carleigh it's
all fun and games but once you go to
sleep you sleep on your cars it flattens
it a majority of curly hair types need a
lot of maintenance okay why I have a
knack to hair mosque in my hair right
now I actually have been doing no heat
for the whole of March and I did it a
little bit before March as well so I've
actually been heatless for about a month
now and I've noticed such a difference
already honestly it's insane the
difference that I've actually noticed in
my hair I'm definitely focusing more on
the Q&amp;amp;A part of this video rather than
the actual makeup
I don't even have tea I have what sighs
I'm really trying to say hi Jerry is
what our three future goals dreams or
ambitions something to do with art like
something with designing my own clothing
I like having my art on clothing
illustrating in a book being an author I
feel like I can't pick three just
anything creative I honestly just want
to create and that's definitely like an
ambition of mine so I guess it's just
accounting that as one just to like
really get into my creativity and to
just like have my art really go some way
massive ambition of mine is to travel
way more than I already do I already do
travel with fair bit for work but I
would love to travel just so much more
to really different places I would love
to feel brave enough to travel on my own
as well like I've never traveled just
like getting on a plane and going
somewhere on my own I've always had
someone I know with me like even if it
be someone that I don't know all that
well then I guess another ambition would
be to have a family
I honestly I'm such a family person I I
would definitely say that I'm like a
month I'm just applying concealer by the
way all the products that I used will be
listed down below just because like I
said this is less about the makeup and
more about the questions cuz yeah but
everything will be listed down below do
you have any siblings yes I have one
older brother he is three and a half
years older than me how can I become
more influential I think the moment that
you realize that no matter who you are
and no matter how many people I guess
you have listening to you you still have
an influence over your own life and at
least a couple of people's lives or
anyone you come into contact with is
that you are already influential it's
all about the way that you use the
things that you have around you the
situations that happen to you how you
deal with them and that is how you can
be an influence to others just by living
how you're gonna live and doing it in a
positive way is how you can be a
positive influence on someone's life are
you feeling okay
and really nice question because I feel
like it's very rare that anyone actually
asks are you okay and they genuinely
care about the answer I'm not going to
lie to you and say that I have been
mentally perfect lately I definitely
have been I've been dealing with a lot
in my mind and is something that I guess
we often can't control but I'm trying to
cope with it I'm doing things that I
believe are the most positive things to
deal with it and to overcome it I really
am doing the best I can and try to be a
light in other people's lives as well
they talk about this way more on my
second channel and some people don't
like to hear it and that's totally fine
I think some people come to YouTube for
an escape but for me I really like to
speak about this kind of stuff on my
second channel so if you don't already
subscribe to me there be sure to I do a
lot more than just talk about stuff I do
a lot of like vlogs and I've got more
stuff coming on that channel a lot to do
with like lifestyle and just like
planning and being organized and just
just like cool videos like that I guess
to answer your question am i doing okay
mentally yes I'm gonna speak positively
and I'm gonna say yes I'm doing okay how
do you handle haters look so gonna get
on my little towel thing it does not
help that meeting such a big brush
honestly the way that I deal with hate
is is to just ignore them like that is
honestly I know it just sounds so cliche
but ignoring haters is my favorite
pastime any success comes people trying
to steal or to kind of destroy that so
it's gonna happen and that's totally
okay locking up the haters those common
comments you get whether it be on social
media or outside definitely say that
it's where are you from
like what nationality are you I have
just had this for so long and people
really like to speculate where I'm from
it's not you quite funny I've just
always had people like argue in the
comments being like she's from here no
she's from here and just all the time
and even in like real life as well
whenever I get into a cab or whatever I
just like
bump into anyone that I guess doesn't
really know me too well they constantly
just always ask what nationality I am
the answer to that question by the way
is I'm British like I was born and I've
lived in the UK my whole life and
background is Cypriot so I come from the
moor island of Cyprus but yeah a lot of
people think I'm from a lot of other
places good I think I don't look
typically like I'm from there I guess I
don't mind being mistaken for other
things do you have any hidden talents
actually I don't know like I don't think
I do um I really like painting and
drawing and stuff like that so I don't
know I guess that's not really hidden
because all of you guys already know
that I love illustration and stuff
though - right I don't know if any of
these are hidden but these are just
things that I really like to do and I'd
like to think that I'm good at does that
make sense do you miss being in a
relationship no on this question
seriously if if this means do I miss my
old relationship then the answer is no
that relationship was for a specific
time in my life and I believe that it's
good that it ended like it needed to end
do I miss being in a relationship with
someone else anyway how do you take such
good selfies honestly angles and
lighting or everything I may do a video
about taking photos but I may do that on
my second channel you're not sure if I
want to upload that video on this
channel just yet I can definitely give
you guys tips on like how to pose like
good angles bear in mind that everyone
has different angles it really is just
about experimenting don't be afraid to
just like stand in front of the mirror
and just experiment take a ton of
pictures and just experiment like the
way that I realized I guess my good
angles the good poses that I guess
worked for me was just literally trial
and error you guys know damn well I'm
not gonna be able to talk when I do my
eyeliner okay
eyeliner is finally done it was a bit
thicker than I expected it to go but
story of my life struggle with my body
and can't seem to find a way to love
myself
do you have any advice self-love is
definitely a journey it really isn't
something that happens overnight and I
struggle also all the time I believe
I've gotten a lot better I have my
moments
but I really really feel so much more
comfortable in my body type now that I
have ever been I know it doesn't
necessarily have to be about your body
specifically it could be about something
on your face it could be about something
about your personality just generally
loving yourself truly is a journey and
it's definitely not something that comes
quickly I have seen so many people
change so many physical things about
themselves and still be broken on the
inside they honestly think that that one
thing that they're gonna change is gonna
fix all their problems but then there
comes more things that they want to
change and there comes more issues and
the real reason that it doesn't really
fix it is because self-love truly needs
to be regardless of the situation
regardless of what you look like
regardless of your weight regardless of
pimples that are on your skin we're got
it needs to be regardless of best there
is nothing on the inside that can be
fixed with anything external I place my
happiness on my my skin is clear versus
when it's not clear then the moment that
I break out again I'm gonna fall into a
pit and I don't want it to be that way I
want to be happy regardless of what's
happening on my skin regardless of my
weight so it's really a journey it's not
something that's gonna happen overnight
and it's something that you have to
constantly affirm yourself that you are
perfect the way that you are you don't
need to change just be healthy just
focus on your mental health obviously
your physical health in a healthy way
and yeah I just believe that you can
overcome this and I guarantee you the
moment that you have that self-love for
yourself you are going to believe and
other people are gonna see this as well
then you have never looked more
beautiful in your entire life because
when that self-love flows from you that
confidence that joy just radiates from
you and it's just
in comparable decided I want to add some
color to this wing so I'm gonna add a
line of this greenish yellow color just
to the top of this wing let's see how
this goes I don't know if this is gonna
flop on off I think now looks pretty
sick note to self do this before the
lashes next time I will literally love
this so much I did like a little bit of
the green on the inner corner as well
this is so spring hey guys I am gonna go
and wash this out of my hair and we're
gonna quickly dry it and make it curly
I'm not gonna show you guys on camera
because I'm planning on doing an updated
curly hair routine so be sure to comment
and thumbs up this video if you want to
see an updated curly hair routine
because my curly hair routine has
changed a lot very little heat is added
to it literally the love is setting on a
hair dryer just to diffuse it but mainly
it's just like basically no heat um my
whole hair care has changed so I'm gonna
do an updated hair care splash curly
hair routine as well I was also asked do
you ever think about doing hair
tutorials sit to answer that question
yes did you guys want to see a collie
hasto video let me know one utility
later still pretty wet but it's kind of
like drawing at the same time so let's
just leave it to do what it needs to
would you rather have a vacation in
Samoa New Zealand or Australia currently
it's between New Zealand and Australia
but I'm gonna have to say off straight
we go
buys the hair is looking pretty crazy
right now
it never really looks right like when I
first do it it kind of means like a
little while to sit but my clothes don't
drop correctly because my hat is so like
all kind of like one layer so it almost
makes the hair look flat so I mean this
is obviously is it flat but you know
what I mean so I hope you guys enjoyed
this Q&amp;amp;A and obviously it was a little
bit more of like I'm doing something Q&amp;amp;A
instead of me just sitting here
obviously it wasn't about the makeup
look
you guys got to watch me do my makeup
anyway guys enjoyed this video and I
will see you all in the next one bye
