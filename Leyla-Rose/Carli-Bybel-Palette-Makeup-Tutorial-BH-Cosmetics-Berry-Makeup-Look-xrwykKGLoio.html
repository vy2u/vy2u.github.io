my channel I know I'm looking pretty
different right now but it's because my
hair is super curly I know and this type
of makeup look is not the kind of makeup
look I usually tend to wet but I thought
I would experiment and go for and kind
of look that I don't usually tend to
wear and this kind of look color
I'm very rarely wear that colors like
this today is a makeup tutorial
dedicated on the amazing Carli bybel
palette from BH Cosmetics I'm so excited
to finally put this you cited this move
and gold eye makeup look it's quite soft
but I decided to go for kind of like
that spotlight eye and then because it
was movi I thought why not pair it with
a berry lip guys do you want to see how
I achieved this makeup like then just
keep on watching
I'm gonna get started off with my skin
so I'm gonna start off with the vitamin
E and moisture serum from the body shop
and I really like this serum because
it's nice and hydrating but it's really
light and it absorbs quickly so for me
it kind of feels like in primer I will
be putting a grandma on top of this just
because I do feel like I need something
that's a little bit stickier just to
stick onto the foundation I'm also gonna
be taking the Mac natural radiance
primer because I'm quite obsessed with
this I've said before in previous videos
that I do want another primer that I can
use as a hydrating base but I just
really like this one so I may need to
repurchase it because I do feel myself
getting quite low my skin has been going
so well and then it literally in the
last day or two my skin is just broken
up again don't know why so annoying
because it's been going so well anyone
that's been watching my vlogs you know
what I'm talking about already
everything up I'm going to be taking the
L'Oreal infallible 24 hour foundation to
be taking this in the shade golden Sun
and I'm just gonna be popping this on to
my skin as evenly as possible I actually
don't want anything too thick today I
know this foundation does get quite
thick but I do want to just put one even
layer of this do blend in my foundation
I'm gonna be using the crown c-45 one
round buffer brush brighten my eyes I'm
gonna be taking the Maybelline age
rewind concealer the reason this is an
eye primer so I'm just gonna use the
applicator and
pop a little bit on to my eyes and I'm
just using my finger to Pat this into my
eye just to make sure that can see that
doesn't crease or budge I'm gonna be
setting it with my normal face powder
and just taking it on a precision
highlighter brush from makeup addiction
I'm just patting it on the eye now we
are going to be moving on to eye shadow
and of course the start of this makeup
tutorial is going to be the Carli bybel
palette from BH Cosmetics let's go I'm
going to be taking is this one right
here I'm going to be popping that into
the crease first of all and the brush
I'm using is the c3 3-0 Pro blending
crease brush from a crown brush and I'm
just gonna be popping this into the
crease I have absolutely been loving
this brush this is like my new going to
brush absolutely love it button this
into the crease but I am bringing up
fairly high as well because there is no
color that is lighter than this in the
palette so this is our color that we're
going to blend all the other colors into
so just make sure this color is nice and
blended as blended as you can make it
I'm gonna be using these two shades as
well starting off with the lighter one
I'm gonna start to pop this into the
crease and I'm also gonna be popping it
into the outer and inner corner too
because we're gonna be creating kind
like a spotlight effect on the eye I'm
taking that on an outer V brush from
makeup geek so I'm just popping this on
the inner corner right here popping it
into the crease just right where where
your eyes open and your eyes crease just
popping it right in there and then also
taking a little bit more than adding it
onto the outer corner as well and this
is just gonna help prepare it for the
next shade we're gonna be applying it
going back into that previous brush you
want to make sure that all harsh lines
and nice and blended so I'm just going
through and just making sure that
everything is nice and seamless Julie I
don't like to move on to the next color
until I feel like everything is nice and
blended so just make sure that you're
working on that one color first of all
before you move on to the next one and
that same brush I'm gonna take the
darkest purple from the palette which is
this one and I'm gonna be just blending
this in the same areas we just applied
the previous color so in the outer
corner inner corner
also in the crease area as well and
again I'm just going back into that
first brush and just making sure that
all the edges are nice and soft and then
I can keep going back and forth into
this color to try and build it up a
little bit typically when you're doing a
spotlight eye you want to keep the
darkest color right there in the crease
and keep going in that rounded motion
you don't really want to take things out
too far this kind of creates more of a
circular effect on the eyes so you can
drag out a little bit but this kind of
circular shape really enhances the eye
we're using this bright gold that's just
there and I'm literally just gonna be
popping it onto my finger and I'm gonna
be using my finger to apply it
she they're just gonna be popping this
right in the center I wanna do a really
nice smoky lash line so I'm gonna take
this Rimmel liner this is these
scandaleyes waterproof liner in black
and I'm just gonna run it along the lash
line and really smudge it I'm just
taking this small little detailing brush
and smudging at the edges to create a
softened effect and now that my liners
were smudged
I'm gonna be applying some lashes I'm
gonna be taking the House of lashes
iconic
just gonna apply some mascara to my
actual lashes to make them blend in a
lot better and this will just make
everything look a lot more seamless you
can't see where your natural lashes are
so now I'm gonna move on to the skin
again just because I do want to make
sure that my skin is nice and down
before I move on to the bottom lash line
I'm gonna be taking the Rimmel wake me
up concealer and just apply it under my
eyes I'm just gonna apply a little bit
of this onto my forehead as well down my
nose and on my chin taking my Sigma
tapered kabuki brush this is the f-86
brush I'm just going to use this to Pat
the concealer into my skin
I'm gonna be setting my face using my
one and only soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder you know this is like my
holy grail of it and I'm running
dangerously low I'm just gonna be
setting all of the areas we put that
concealer what I love about this powder
is that it really smooths the skin which
I definitely need because just generally
my skin it does not have a smooth
texture so I do feel like I don't know
my skin just looks a lot smoother when I
use this powder like as you can see it
just kind of makes the skin look a blood
which I love my brows do have clear brow
Joe in it but I do want to just make
them look a little bit neater and a
little bit fuller I'm using the elf
instant lift brow pencil and I'm just
gonna be taking the pencil side and just
running it very gently through my brows
I don't wanna go for anything she crazy
like I said
just gonna finish off the rest of my
eyes I'm gonna be taking some of the
black coal hang it onto my waterline
and then taking some of this lighter
move shade I'm gonna just run it on the
bottom lashline very softly nothing too
crazy at all I don't go for anything
like too smoky from this very softly on
the bottom lashline just take that first
brush we used again and then just use
that to soften up with the edges so that
it doesn't look messy and it just looks
nice and soft and then I'm just gonna
take some mascara and just finish off
the eyes by applying some mascara on the
bottom lashline under the eyes are done
I'm gonna go ahead and we are going to
do the rest of the face I'm gonna be
bronzing my skin very lightly because
I'm gonna be going for a dark lip and
rethinking my usual bronzer that I love
to use this is the dark golden memorized
skin finish and I'm gonna be taking this
on a real techniques blush brush and I'm
just gonna be dusting this all around
the face a highlight I'm gonna be mixing
at these two highlights shades from the
palette and just popping it on to my
cheekbones and for this I'm using the
Tom Ford number 2 brush it's like I
really wanted to create a deeper bolder
lip so I decided to go for the NYX
retractable lip pencil in plum and I'm
just lining my lips all around once I've
lined my lips I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this a revolution salvation Velvet
falaka in a velvet rebel and I'm just
gonna fill in my whole lips with this
because this is a finished look I
literally feel like I've just stepped
out of the 80s or something then with
this lip and the curly hair so this
doesn't look that I came up with I
absolutely love the palette but the main
thing that I love about is definitely
the highlight I mean it stands out it
glows from a mile away absolutely love
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup look that I created it definitely
