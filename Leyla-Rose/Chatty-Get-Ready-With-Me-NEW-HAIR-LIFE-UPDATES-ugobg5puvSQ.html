so today I have a Q&amp;amp;A life update and
get ready with me at the same time it's
a bit of a different video I don't think
I've ever done anything like this
basically just like do this makeup look
on camera few guys honestly I had too no
idea what I was doing nothing like this
isn't my usual kind of makeup look it's
a bit grungy for me my hair is obviously
very different I have blonde in my hair
now and I'm going to be honest with you
I'm looking on the monitor and my hair
looks really different in person to be
honest I don't know if it's just like
the wig lighting in here but it looks it
is really warm but it looks a little
brown on camera and in real life and in
daylight it looks a lot more blond so
obviously I want to show you guys what
it looks like but I'm really annoyed
give the dollar really look like this in
person it looks so much lighter even
when I look in the mirror and it just
looks really Brown on camera if you're
happy with this at the moment but I
would like to have it slightly lighter I
want to serve you right in the root a
little bit sorry it's a bit messy in the
background but this is pretty much the
actual better representation of how it
looks it's like brown that goes into
this kind of like lighter honey blonde
and I love it and this is just it looks
like when I look at my hair down here
it's pretty much how it looks it looks
even a little bit lighter in real light
and especially in sunlight as well so
with iPhone front camera no filters no
editing this is my hair color not
entirely happy with the way that I was
on camera right now and be honest
but I also a lot of questions in this
video and it's more of just like a get
ready with me rather than me showing you
how to do this makeup look obviously
you'll see everything but I answer a lot
of questions I would have like a
relationship update in this video and
then I do have actual eyes this update
video as well so I'll link that down
below it's on my blog channel so you can
go watch that as well i'll see watch
this one cause i think you want to after
my relationship update i don't think i
have anything else to say i just really
wanted to chat with you guys and update
and show you guys the hair even though
it doesn't look like this in person if
you want to hear some life update and
get ready
at the same time into the lodging okay
so I'm just my questions are and I'm
going to be doing my makeup
kind of like loosely if that makes sense
to be getting ready with you more so
than showing you how I'm doing my makeup
just something that would be nice just
to catch up and everything so if I don't
explain everything it's Morgan's it it's
more of a Q&amp;amp;A while study my makeup does
that make sense we're going to find it
really hard to multitask to be honest
I'm going to try my best try off with
some moisturizer skin is out of the way
okay so the first question is from Helen
and she says if you could eat one thing
for the rest of your life what would it
be oh my goodness I actually don't know
probably be something like hot wings
I have just been loving hot wings lately
I never used to be a spicy person but
I've just really turned into a spicy
person lately I don't know why Oh
salt and vinegar crisps I doubt it is
but when I diet that is just the one
thing that I will make sure there are
space in my macros to eat it so I'm
going to crisp I love them P so next
colour Parker says what means you want
to change your hair because you have
mixed feelings about changing your hair
in the beginning obviously you guys have
already seen in the intro but I am
lighter now it doesn't look like it
because they've left my root quite dark
and it's only the very top of the her
that looks darker my nerves down I think
in normal daylight it looks really light
and especially because my hair is
totally black is a big change for me
under your question what made me want to
change I mean I just have wanted to go
light for so long but people will just
always tell me it was impossible because
my hair was so dark and also because of
my hair texture as well I was always
told that my hair wouldn't take color
well so I don't know I just always got
pop it because I thought I'd lose all my
hair looking for someone that was really
good at doing dark hair and I found my
hair colorist I go to now and his name
is Bernardo he's amazing I leave his
Instagram link down below because he's
just he is amazing if you guys do go to
him if you have dark hair and you're in
London
you should let him know that I sent you
because I think you'd like to know so
Sanji to ask
how do you take in edit your photos your
sense of style is my favorite would love
to see more outfit of the days thank you
as well thank you for being my style is
good I feel like I've gotten way more
into fashion and stuff lately so I would
have been enjoying buying clothes and
just paring things together I would
actually love to very very soon do a
video on how I actually take my
Instagram pictures already on a camera
but then some of them are on my iPhone
as well so I'd love to show you guys how
I edit my pictures and like my tips on
taking them because honestly like I love
a good picture sure to comment down
below if you want to see that video
because I definitely would want to do
that between questions I just want to
mention that this is basically my new
favorite foundation the next total
control can we just take a minute like
it's my new favorite full coverage
foundation and the color that I use is
beige and I'm just obsessed with it like
can we just can we just okay so I'm just
going to take my one heck of a blot
powder and just set it Claire asks a
human Josh still together and the answer
to that is no me and Josh and uh
normally together and I've actually
uploaded most likely at the same time
that this video has uploaded now it
should be up on my second channel an
actual like life update video I would
recommend you guys go watch that because
I explain in more detail to an extent
like I'm not super like juicy about it
but I do explain a little bit more to
the very thousand yeah so I'll leave
that video in the I just there basically
so go and watch that if you guys want to
see it um and yeah that's why I haven't
been on social media March because as
you can imagine it has been affecting me
but I really did like the way I
explained everything in that video I
can't be myself here but I do show a lot
more of my personality on that channel
because it's just it's much easier to so
definitely watch that video if you guys
want the update on my new beginning in
life but to answer your question no
we're not together anymore and yeah yeah
it so I'm just taking this bronzer from
urban decay is this one here and it's
called jawbone
it's from this sort of I'm going to
mispronounce this but it's from the
Urban Decay I'm going to definitely
mispronounce it jean-michel my squat I
hope I said that right if I butchered
that I'm really sorry I feel like I'm
really rubbish at pronouncing anything
French Amina takhmina
I hope I said that right just two really
good questions I'm going to answer two
of her questions because they really
good the first one is what you're going
to do when you hear a million on YouTube
I don't know honestly you guys tell me
what do you think I should do when I
hear million I think like YouTube
related that you think I should do when
I have million be sure to let me know
because I know I'm not too sure I mean
it'd be cool to like react to old videos
or something like that but they've all
been done so let me know if there's
anything that you guys think I should do
and brilliant down below because this is
such a warm bronzer it looks a bit
patchy so I'm just going to go over it
with my sponge and what I'm going to do
is just cool it down and apply a contour
color like right underneath there and
was there the second question that she
asked was what holiday would you like to
go on next and now honestly I have the
struggle of not having anyone to go on
holiday with forever alone find friends
have boyfriends and stuff like that so I
feel like I don't have that many people
that I could actually go travelling with
because it wasn't long ago their
boyfriends and stuff like that I do have
my family but there are two pets there's
not many people that could pets it for
us and I don't know we haven't gone away
all together as a family in ages and I
just wouldn't want my pets to be at home
with no one I really want to go to
either somewhere in Italy or Santorini
someone asks what Bible verse is your
favorite and why does it have
significant meaning to you I have so
many scriptures that I love so it's a
quite a hard question but one
significant scripture stands out to me
and that Psalm 91 I literally love it
and the reason why I love that one is
because it's so it just puts to rest any
fear and I feel like I do stuff with a
lot of fear when I travel when I just am
uncertain about the future a lot of the
stuff I've been going through lately
that is just one of the ones or I just
feel like nothing can touch me I feel
untouchable when I read it so many other
ones involved I thought I can't say that
that one is
specifically like the best of them but I
do really really love that one and add a
really special place in my heart
okay so now I have really crazy because
I'm baking underneath there but now it
looks so much smoother I do like that
runs a lot but it was very warm so it
looked immediate everything but quite
back to you but generally now it looks
okay to me so we're good just going to
take that same palette from MDK and take
that highlight color which is good
now's the time and I'm just going to pop
that on my cheekbones is call it an
absolutely stunning like can we just a
Beauty Blender and just push this into
the skin because it's a very intense
highlight and I just want it to kind of
melt into my skin a little bit better if
I'm going to take this palette from
Urban Decay as well it is again that
jean-michel bus squat oh my gosh I just
know I'm mispronouncing that I'm
annoying myself because I know I'm
mispronouncing a china Graham I think I
name is Bethany says do you ever feel
like you spend too much time worrying
about things if you do how do you handle
it I am such a warrior like I'm just one
of them people that genuinely worries
about everything has ruined a lot of
things for me it can really ruin your
like way of life and just how you treat
things and how you treat certain
situations it makes you stop doing
certain things because you worry about
stuff in many ways I feel like we don't
have a reason to say it but then in a
way I also saw that there is a lot to
fear or worry about in this world
nowadays I would rather just live boldly
knowing that I have was protection over
me and that he's with me always that's
honestly how I like to live my life
rather than just not taking
opportunities saying no to everything
because I'm worried about it all who
want to come to my day-to-day situations
in life I do feel like my faith has
really helped me to not worry so much
then doing it not for sale all in my
word I love warm colors like this so I'm
on well with my eyes I can never talk as
much as I want to and I just feel like
it takes so much concentration I don't
know how but somehow I've run out of so
many of my lashes I feel like I
literally have none left
so Maria asks what my favorite song is
and honestly I am so bad like that I
don't have a favorite song really
there's not one specific song I think oh
it's not my favorite song um I sometimes
like certain songs that were on the
radio and then I won't like them anymore
that make sense so right now I don't
really have a favorite song but honestly
my my go-to favorite song which is a
Christian worship song is oceans and I
just love that song I just think it's
beautiful it's so cute as we rift in and
I just really love the music and just
everything to it but the words obviously
the most important part but I just love
it as a song itself so that is
definitely one of my favorite songs
doing this powder awake getting on my
nerves a little bit
but I've finished off my eyes afterwards
I just want to get my eyebrows done so
that's what I'm doing now
just going to grab another question
quickly and quite a few people have
asked like what camera I use for my
Instagram and because when Instagram
pictures have been quite different to
have I meet my usual ones are quite
obvious that before mine were quite like
iPhone not really that great quality but
my quality is definitely upped quite a
bit and I used the camera that I'm using
to film the camera that I actually used
for that is the Canon 5d Mark 3 and I
loved that cameras so much the lens that
I'm using now and I think the lens I was
using
yeah the lens I was using for those
pictures I had on Instagram was the 85
millimeter lens and love that lens so
much it's so pretty and yeah I love that
camera if you guys watch my Golf Channel
you'd know that I literally love taking
pictures so much it was so nice when I
was away because I was able to take
pictures of like my friends as well so
you if you follow like Roxy and Sabrina
a lot of the pictures that they had up
were taken by me as well which is really
cool oh because my hair is so much
lighter now I feel like I can't fill in
my eyebrows oh stop using a different
brand so I'm using the NYX sculpt and
highlight it and this is in the color
cream Bruna and it's just like a more
mousey Brown I just like it fit with my
hair color a lot better now so it's not
too warm which is really nice popping
some of that warmth around underneath my
eyes I want to really enjoy doing this I
don't usually get the chance to like
answer your questions just like to chat
with you guys so if you guys like this
where I just literally have no idea what
I'm going to do in my makeup just do on
camera until to you guys be sure to let
me know down below for something that
you would want to see more on because I
don't know like it was really fun and
I'm not going anywhere to get ready but
like I might take some Instagram
pictures and stuff like that so it will
be really really nice
to do this more often okay guys so I
actually forgot to film an outro I did
my intro but then I totally forgot so I
applied my lip and that was pretty much
the end of this look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you all really soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
