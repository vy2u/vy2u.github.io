today I'm going to be doing a full face
of dupes and what I'm basically going to
be doing in this video is doing one side
of my face using lots of expensive but
very popular makeup products to create
this look and then I'm going to be
recreating it using as close duplicates
of each product as possible on the other
side of my face the aim of the game for
this look is to basically show you that
you don't need to spend a bomb to create
an amazing makeup look you can find
dupes so one side is very very expensive
and the other side can save up to or
over 200 pounds so if you would like to
see the dupes that I came up with then
just keep on watching so we're going to
get started off with foundation and on
my left side I'm using the Mac Studio
Fix fluid and on the right side I'm
using the Loreal 24-hour infallible
foundation and these two products are
almost exactly the same they feel very
similar I feel like the L'Oreal one
feels a little bit light on the skin
although they both give a really full
coverage and it's totally matte it dries
to a matte finish
also the Mac one the color I have is in
NC 40 and it's just super yellow like
you can just see now as well it has just
a total yellow undertone but apart from
that these are almost identical in
formula and I love them both on the high
end side of my face I am using the NARS
radiant creamy concealer and then on the
other side I'm using Lee Maybelline age
rewind concealer now I was trying
desperately to find a dupe for the NARS
one because it's one of my favorite
concealers and when I was looking
through my drugstore and affordable
concealers I noticed that these almost
have an identical formula the only
difference is in my opinion is that the
nas has a little bit more of a matte
finish although it does say radiant in
the title I just feel that it has a
little bit of a drier consistency not in
a bad way at all but the Maybelline one
has a little bit more radiance to it and
yeah when you blend them in they look
almost the same the colors that I have
are almost the same and blending out
their concealer using the same brush I
use to blend out my foundation and by
the way just wanted to let you know
between sides when I use the same brush
I am wiping off the product just so that
it's a fair
and I don't transfer any product from
the other side to each side basically I
want it to be as even as possible but I
wanted to use the same brushes so that I
could see exactly how the product was
working and I just went ahead and
applied some concealer on my lids as
well and to set my face I am using the
MEK CC neutralized loose powder on the
left side and my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder on the other apart from
the fact that the Mac one is loose
these have almost an identical formula
personally I prefer the instant retouch
powder but they both have a yellow
undertone and a basically translucent
and they set your face flawlessly for my
brows I am using my go-to brow Wiz by uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills and then on the
dupe side I am using the soap &amp;amp; Glory
brow archery pencil now as you can see
me using right now the soap &amp;amp; Glory
pencil it is almost identical to the
brow is the actual shape of the actual
pencil is exactly the same it has a
spoolie on one side and then the pencil
in a retractable form on the other side
and it just fills in the brows exactly
the same the only difference is that the
brow is is a little bit softer in
formula and it's a little bit waxy er
apart from that they look exactly the
same and you wouldn't tell the
difference considering the price
difference next I'm just going to be
using some concealer to carve underneath
my eyebrows and I'm going to be using
the Kiko full coverage concealer first
of all on the dupe side and then the mac
studio finish concealer on the other I
have the studio finish in a palette but
they do come separately and these are
almost exactly the same in formula they
are full coverage they have a matte
finish and they are just exactly the
same I don't have any dupes for my uh
Nastasia clear brow gel is the only
clear brow gel I actually have right now
so I just went ahead and went through my
brows with this moving onto the eyes I'm
going to be using the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette on the
left side and on the dupe side I'm going
to be using the makeup revolution salted
caramel palette there is a dupe for
every single color in the palette and I
love this
Joop and first of all going to be taking
the peanut butter color and applying
that of course to the high-end side in
this test you can really see the
difference between the two palettes how
well each one blends and the just the
differences in
the pigmentation of each palette as well
so obviously on the expensive side the
Too Faced palette is amazing and I would
highly recommend it to anyone but on the
flip side if you are not willing to pay
almost 40 pounds for a palette the other
palette is almost identical it is
amazing the only difference is that some
colors do vary some colors on is
pigmented some colors don't blend as
well
I mean honestly that is going to happen
considering how cheap this palette is
although I would say that the Too Faced
palette blends a lot easier but some
colors in the makeup revolution palette
are actually more pigmented this dark
brown shade actually was really really
hard to blend from the makeup revolution
palette but still it is a matte it's
okay it's only seven pounds 99 which is
incredible I'm next just applying this
butter pecan color from the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and of course
applying it to the left side and then
after this I took the identical color
from the makeup revolution palette and
applied it to the other side
I definitely realized that it made the
Too Faced palette look dull it's very
very strange when I apply it I'm
cleaning my brush of course when I apply
it you can definitely see how much more
pigmented it is I mean personally this
color from the palette I prefer I
actually think in a lot of ways I was
preferring the makeup revolution palette
because it just made my eyes look a lot
more pigmented and but like I said the
Too Faced side definitely blended a lot
easier next for liner I am taking some
Mac black track gel liner on the
high-end side and my dupe is the elf gel
liner now black track is definitely a
favorite for a lot a lot of makeup
artists a lot of makeup artists use it
on other people I love to use this on
other people but in my opinion it's a
really nice soft liner that just glides
but it's not black enough and my opinion
the ELF gel liner is the same as black
track it's just as creamy it dries
almost identically in the fact that it
dries to a matte finish but it is almost
twice as dark it makes the other one
look like an off black so I definitely
prefer the elf one in this case
For Lashes I'm taking my house of lashes
iconic lashes and my Juke for this is
the Coco Goddess lashes now both of
these can't be bought in the UK they
have to people online from a US store
and the difference between the two
lashes is that the iconic lashes are a
lot stiffer and the Koko lashes are a
lot wispier I honestly love these both
they look almost identical but the Koko
lashes feel a lot lighter on the eye
next I'm just going to be filling in my
waterline on the expensive side I'm
using my Mac Pro Longwear pencil and
then on the other side I am using my
Rimmel scandaleyes pencil the Mac one
isn't as black but it lasts a lot longer
and then the scandalize one from Rimmel
is a lot darker as you can see but it
doesn't last as long as the Mac one I'm
also just going ahead and taking this
frosting color from the chocolate bar
palette and applying it to the bottom
lash line and then of course taking the
similar color from the makeup revolution
palette and applying it on the other
side I definitely felt like the Too
Faced color in the palette was a lot
more pigmented and to really apply a lot
from the makeup revolution personally I
use a lot of drugstore mascaras so this
mascara that I'm using now is probably
the only expensive one I have it's from
Mac and then a very similar one to this
is from BH Cosmetics it's the long sexy
lashes mascara and I actually prefer the
BH Cosmetics one because it doesn't
transfer on to my concealer but the Mac
one does now for bronzer I am taking the
Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light and
for my dupe for this I am using the body
shop honey bronzer these two are almost
identical in color but the only
difference is is that the body shop one
isn't as pigmented now when you see me
apply the Bobbi Brown one now you can
see that almost instantly a lot more
pigment does come out but apart from
that considering the price it is
definitely almost identical
for contour I am taking the max sculpt
powder which I love and then I'm taking
the makeup geek infidelity contour pan
now the makeup geek one is a lot more
cooler but it's the closest color that I
think I have to the sculpt one it's a
really nice matte powder that is very
very pigmented and you don't need a lot
of it but as for the Mac one I feel like
it is pigmented but I feel like to get a
really strong contour it's kind of like
you need to build up a little bit more
for blush I am taking Mac warm sole on
the expensive side and then on the
cheaper side I'm taking the makeup
revolution heart the lush and these hot
blushes are actually a huge dupe for the
two-faced ones but I actually don't own
any of those warm Saul is one of my
favorite blushes and it just gives the
most gorgeous glow and I feel like this
particular color that I will have listed
down below is almost identical for
highlight I'm taking one of my favorite
highlights this is the so Hollywood
Anastacio Beverly Hills eliminator and
for the dupe side I'm taking an eye
shadow from Kiko which is a very
well-known one as well as you can see
that a Nastasia one gives an instant
strong glow which I love but the Kiko
one gives the same color it has that
same gorgeous white gold highlight but
you do need to build up a little bit
more apart from that considering the
price I mean you can't go wrong and
finally for lips on the expensive side
I'm taking a cult favorite this is Mac
wall lip pencil and I'm applying it all
over the lips so I'm just lining the
lips and applying it all over and then
my junk for this is actually not a total
dupe like it's slightly different but I
personally prefer the dupe side it's one
of my favorite lip liners I own this is
the Kiko automatic lip pencil in 504 and
it's almost the same mode shade the Mac
one is a little bit pinkier and of
course it's a retractable pencil so it
has a little bit of a different formula
but apart from that it's one of the
closest dupes I've ever had - Wow lip
pencil for the lipstick on the expensive
side I definitely did go very expensive
this is a luxury lipstick this is Tom
Ford blush nude and I think this is one
of the most popular Tom Ford lipsticks
and then to dupe that I am using the
Rimmel Kate nude lipstick in the shade
from t2 and these are almost identical I
think they are just slightly different
and just very very slightly but it's
much exactly the same so guys that is
the end of this video as you can see the
difference from the left to the right is
pretty much you can't really tell the
difference I mean this is the price
difference it's pretty crazy how much
you could actually save by this video
and I loved making this Juke video so
let me know if you want me to make a
version 2 of this because I have a ton
more dupes and I love showing them on
the face instead of just telling you
