today I am going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this look in a more
chitchat get ready with me formats that
video you guys always love when I do
these videos and I really wanted to chat
with you guys today just because and a
few things I wanted to talk to you about
it just because I felt like chatting
whilst getting ready for the day look is
inspired by one of my favorite Instagram
people her name is amra from her page
and resi I'm sure you have heard of her
she is just makeup girls hair girls
fashion goals body goals goals all over
she is just beautiful and I really do
look up to her on so many levels she
really does give me a lot of inspiration
they thought she posted this particular
makeup look I don't know if you guys can
see that I really wanted to recreate
something similar to it it's not exactly
the same I didn't want to go exactly the
same as what she's got I don't even feel
worthy her face being next to mine they
loved the lip color so I tried to mimic
the lip color more so than anything else
and I really wanted to go for nothing on
the bottom lash line so I hope you guys
enjoy this video I would like to see me
achieve this makeup look I'm wearing
right now
and get ready with you guys whilst I do
so then please just keep on watching
this video I already have my brows on I
feel really weird when my browser arm
and nothing else is because I just kind
of feel like what is going on first I
already applied my serum the serum I
applied today was the Ren Omega 3
optimum skin oil serum I'm trying this
out at the moment if it goes well I will
tell you guys about it but so far I'm
liking it I apply this twice a day so
let's just see how this goes this is
really good for combination skin but I
never have like two little strands
coming down I'm not actually has it in
the photo so I try to go with it and I
just feel a little bit weird I feel like
a little Martian prime my skin as I
always do I'm using the Mac prep and
prime natural radiance primer there is
to move my skin a little bit and just
hydrate it a little bit as well for my
foundation today I'm gonna be taking my
ex1 invisi wear foundation few of you
have said I've been using this too much
recently when in reality I only started
using this under a month ago it probably
just seems like you've seen it a lot
because I do upload three times a week
so because you see me
more than you probably do of other
people it's probably like you're seeing
it a lot but I love this foundation I'm
not gonna stop using it because I do
feel like I get a flawless finish with
this more so than any other foundation
so if this gives me the coverage that I
like I'm gonna keep using it if you guys
don't want to see it I could just skip
the foundation pot if it's getting a bit
too you're repetitive but yeah I will
try and use other foundations but I love
this one and if you find a foundation
you love why not use it right I'm a
feeling this might be a little bit dark
for me at the moment but I don't have
another color I think I need to pick
this up in the lightest shade pass that
into my skin I'm gonna take the Real
Techniques sculpting brush and I'm just
gonna be gradually buffing this into my
skin it's something I've been wanting to
talk to you guys about for a while now I
know be doing a video dedicated to this
particular subject just thinking people
don't watch this video I don't want them
to miss out but I just wanted to give
you guys whoever's watching this video
right now a little sneak peek anybody
that lives in the Los Angeles area which
is obviously on the other side of the
pond for me I am going to be going to LA
in January I'm so excited I've already
put 20 kids and where I'm staying it's
roughly beginning mid-january so I'm
gonna get the exact dates yeah to tell
you guys because I wanted to see if
there was anybody that would want to
meet up even if it's just a few of you I
would love to meet some of my American
followers I really don't know how many
people will come probably not many
honestly don't mind it's just because I
don't know when our next be in the
States
I don't know when that will happen again
so I'd love to meet up with even if it's
just a few of you I'd love to see when I
am going IMAX will be going on too so
let me know if you are gonna be going to
LA I'm at I haven't booked my tickets
there either yet but I do really want to
so I just want to know your opinion
either way I'm still definitely coming
to LA so we will try and sort out a
meet-up but yeah let me know down in the
comments or contact me on social media
if you are in the Los Angeles area or
you're gonna be there in January I just
wanted to tell you guys and just see
what your thoughts were if you're gonna
be going to IMATS should I book tickets
like
should I do the know we'll see I'm gonna
be priming my eyes with the Maybelline
age rewind concealer you guys have been
asking why I do this the reason why I
like to use a concealer recently rather
than the Mac Paint Pot I still love the
Paint Pot but it is a very thick formula
very dry eyelids especially in the
winter I feel like my eyelids at the
first place and also around my mouth as
well where the dry areas kind of come in
they just feel really sensitive because
the paint book kind of dries it just
feels like too much so I am looking for
a liked primer with a similar
consistency to this by the way when I do
go to LA I am definitely vlogging like
that is definitely an opportunity to
vlog know you guys want to see more
personal videos and I definitely will I
promise
it's just because my daily life isn't
that interesting and I do feel like I
don't want to bore you straight away I
want you guys to see that I can do
exciting things it's just because my
life kind of revolves around YouTube at
the moment it is pretty much it's
filming and editing and I'm filming and
then editing it's gonna be setting my
eyelids with my instant retouch powder
from sook and glory and as you can see
I've hit pan on this surprise surprise
because I pretty much use this every day
so and I'm taking that powder on a large
fluffy brush from a makeup
addiction I'm gonna be taking latte from
makeup geek and I'm just gonna be
applying this into the crease of my eye
as my first color and just taking this
on a fluffy brush and just going back
and forth just to blend this into the
crease and just make sure this is nice
and blended so I need to ask you guys a
question so I want to know if you guys
want to see Halloween tutorials at first
when it was approaching Halloween I was
like yes I'm so excited and now it's
almost October and I feel totally
unprepared
I will definitely still do some for you
if you guys want to see it I do have a
couple I do want to do and they're all
nice and they're not to special effects
where you really need to have a lot of
skill and a lot of prosthetics and all
that kind of stuff more stuff you can do
with makeup and they look more either on
the pretty side or they're scary ish but
they glam at the same time
I really like the ones I picked yeah I
just want to know if you guys would like
to see that for me because there are so
many amazing body painters like Mikey
and Alex faction and they're so amazing
at body painting and just doing all
these things I just feel like shall I
just leave it to the professionals or do
you guys want to see a later take on
Halloween it's up to you let me know
down below if you guys would like to see
Halloween tutorials because I'd love to
know I think it would be fun but I'll be
honest with you guys I don't have any
wigs and I don't have any contacts
because one I've never put contacts in
my eyes in my life because I'm a bit
like Rachel from friends where I'm weird
with people around my eye like I don't
want people touching my eyes I get weird
when I go to the optician like I can't
let them touch it but the thought of
having a foreign object and my eye just
creeps me out so much so the thought of
putting in contacts for non-medical
reasons and just for Halloween freaks me
out I don't know if anyone's the same as
me but I just get freaked out then I'm
gonna take frappe which is basically a
latte but frappe which is like a darker
version of it gonna take that on the
same brush and just apply it on the
deeper part of my crease just because I
want to use the same brush that we can
keep that nice airbrushed effect but
these two colors were very similar I
just want to add a little bit of extra
depth so I'm gonna be taking cocoa bear
also from makeup geek reddish earthy
brown but it is a lot deeper than the
other two cars it's gonna add a little
bit more of that definition I'm taking
that on a sigma e35 brush absolutely
love doing chitchat get ready with me
like I feel so happy when I do these
because I just feel like I'm actually
chatting with you like I almost imagine
just an audience of you guys but not
150,000 of you but there's a little
group of you guys just sitting in front
of me and like us just chatting and I'm
just like waiting for you guys to
respond what I'm asking you these
questions but I just love it
like I feel like I'm honestly connecting
with you and so I love doing these I'll
probably want to do it get ready with me
a chitchat version at least once every
month just because I feel like we can
just update whatever is going on in life
let me know if you guys would like one
of these videos every month because I
did one last month and I loved it I just
love doing them just make sure it says
blended as you can with this brush but
if you can't blend it fully
then we can go back with that previous
brush that's like my little pack going
back into that first brush to make sure
everything is blended out is life
anything about these chitchat videos is
they end up being so long and I feel
like I have to cut so much of it out so
I don't know how long this will be
hopefully not too long because there's
always complaints that I talk too much
but that's gonna happen on this channel
we really wanted to use this pigma at
the moment I received it this is French
manicure pigment from a makeup addiction
it looks amazing I haven't even opened
us watch this yet but I've seen swatches
online and it looks incredible it's
basically like a rose gold but very
reflective so I'm really excited I'm
going to be popping this all over the
lid I'm just taking some of that pigment
on a sigma e60 brush okay so next I'm
gonna be using a liner using these super
cats the liner from soap &amp;amp; Glory this
can be a little bit shiny and I prefer a
matte finish so I'm gonna use this
because I like the way that I can shape
a wing with this but I don't want the
finish so I'm gonna be going on top of
this with a different line up afterwards
we're gonna go for a nice wing similar
to I'm rezzie's just something that's
gonna lift my eye piece I'm gonna go on
top of this with the balm Schwing liner
and this will just kind of darken up a
little bit and just make it look a
little less shiny because I don't like
the way this awareness finishes I apply
some lashes these are the ILA
1 to 6 lashes as you guys know I have
been absolutely loving these lashes
recently just because I feel like
they're the perfect style and they just
go with any eye look I do I love them
I'm gonna need to repurchase some more
because I just love them so much I'm
just gonna be applying them with some
glue and some tweezers yes I'm just
gonna be taking some mascara and
applying them to my natural lashes to
make them blend in to the false ones
I'm just gonna be taking some of the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer and
applying it to my under eyes I'm not
gonna be mixing this with the Maybelline
fit me concealer and I really want to
create a nice bright under eyes I'm
going to be baking and everything and
I'm just going to be applying this can
neela with this kind of traditional
foundation brush I'm gonna be blending
that in to the rest of my skin using my
finger just because I do feel like this
is such a thick concealer the warmth of
your skin kind of blends into your
foundation a little bit smoother I've
tried it with a brush and I didn't like
the way it looked so it's totally up to
you I think this would look nice with a
beauty blender as well but I really want
to keep this full coverage so I feel
like I want to use my finger way if you
were wondering about my nails they are
from nail ha they're basically a stick
on manicure they're the Clair ones and
then I painted them myself
I painted them a few days ago now and
they're still going strong they haven't
come off I absolutely love them because
they don't damage your nails which I
love if you remove them properly they
are absolutely the best thing for you
and its really good if you can't commit
to acrylics I am one of them people
because I personally can't keep up with
them like they just either break and
then I don't go and get them fixed with
that or they just end up looking really
outgrown and I leave them too long so
that ends up being for me and also I
love to change my nails up a little bit
as well so it's just really cool you can
snap on different ones I'm gonna be
doing a video soon on how I apply them
and paint them and stuff like that so
once that's on I'm gonna be taking some
more of my favorite concealer I'm taking
the Maybelline fit me concealer and just
applying a little bit on top of that so
I could apply a little bit of this just
to brighten things up a little bit more
and also just to neutralize it to look a
little bit more yellow because again is
a very yellow time so I'm just applying
some of that under my eyes you can some
of this and just dotting this on my
forehead in a very weird shape and then
just taking a bit of this down the
bridge of my nose just to narrow it down
a little bit and also
tiny little chin then I'm gonna be
thinking the same brush I used to apply
my foundation and just buff this in and
then when it gets to my under eyes I'm
gonna keep with this brush but I'm gonna
Pat it into the skin instead of buffing
it because on the rest of my face I can
kind of want to buff it into the rest of
my complexion but because I really want
this product to stay in the place that I
want it to be I'm gonna be patting it
just because I do feel like it does give
off a very different effect and a really
nice bright under-eye that will stay in
that position I don't it to protrude too
far down my face I'm just gonna be
patting this into my complexion and then
once it's Teddy blended in I'm gonna go
back in with my finger I definitely got
that in my eye now and just blend that
in and just make sure that it looks nice
and seamless and that we can't see you
or it starts or finishes next I'm going
to be baking my under eyes using the Mac
prep and prime CC neutralized powder and
also this Beauty Blender Joop I'm just
going to be applying this all the way
under my under eyes also okay I look
super crazy very very crazy I don't want
to leave this for too long
I just cut I look so weird in the
viewfinder I wish you look like it's
everywhere but in real life it's
actually not that much but the camera
picks up the sucker is loads so whilst
after that setting I'm going to set the
rest of my face with my normal powder
the instant retouch powder from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I'm just gonna take this on a
big powder brush and just setting those
areas like I said I don't really with
too long so I'm not sure you're gonna
dust it off right now and just pop it oh
my thing
you want to make sure you get it all off
your face everything everything is all
set I'm gonna be moving on to my bronzer
and blusher I'm actually gonna leave the
bottom lash line completely free because
I like the way that Anne Meara has
nothing on her bottom lash line it
really gives her that nice brightened
effect and I feel like contouring now is
gonna really look significant like just
really nice so I'm gonna do that now
they be taking me Mac contour powder in
shade stir on my normal bronzer brush
and disease away about 101 brush and I'm
just gonna be taking this first and
using it as a bronzer just to sculpt my
face but to bronzer and then I'm gonna
be going in with a smaller brush to add
that definition into the face so I'm
just applying it underneath my cheek
bone on my forehead and then just
joining it up on the sides of my head
I'm gonna be taking some of this on a
Mac 168 brush and just popping it
underneath my cheekbone and just really
sculpting out that cheek and then I just
like to go in circular motions to blend
it upwards I'm gonna be taking some of
that loose powder again and just
sharpening up my contour this will just
give me a really nice amount of
definition and it will just really clean
up that contour I wasn't sure if I
wanted to apply any blush it today but
I'm just gonna apply it a tiny bit this
is Mac warm so it's a really nice color
and I just want to apply it a little bit
just to define my cheeks a little bit I
have I'm gonna be taking the Anastasio
Beverly Hills so Hollywood highlighter I
always say her name wrong is Anastasio
Anastasia out of there
it's my English accent people it just
makes me pronounce everything posh
highlight always looks freaking amazing
so I'm just gonna make sure that this
looks on point
I'm also gonna play a little bit of this
on to the tip of my nose totally forgot
to contour my nose I'm just gonna do
that now thinking what my face look
weird I'm just using it some of that
contour powder I'll be used to contour
our face and I'm just using that on a
blending brush and just using this to
contour my nose okay I'm just gonna be
dusting away that powder just to reveal
a nice cleaned up contour also gonna be
taking that highlighter on the inner
corner of my eye and also on my brow
bone line my lips I'm going to be using
sort lip pencil from Mac and then I'm
going to be going into a Gerard
cosmetics lipstick
I'm going to be taking Gerard cosmetics
vintage rose and lipstick and just be
applying it all over my lips
because this is liek finished look I
actually really really love it I love
how there's nothing on the bottom
lashline I love the lip color you can
totally substitute this lip color for
any lip color you want deep vampy color
and what nude tone I just wanted to go
for a pink because that's what amaura
had in her photo and I kind of wanted to
mimic the color cuz I think the lip
color was mainly my favorite part about
it you guys enjoy these kind of videos I
