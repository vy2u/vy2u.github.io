today I'm going to be doing a chit chat
to get ready with me video on how I
achieved basically this makeup look I
just basically do my makeup tell you
guys what I'm doing how I'm doing it but
at the same time having a little round
ball and just chatting with you guys as
I'm getting ready not all my friends so
I would love to just chat with you down
in the comments so don't forget to
comment down below and we will have a
little chit chat together absolutely I
love this makeup look I tried a new
liquid lipstick I haven't tried before
and did this really nice cool toned
winged line of the cool top lip actually
really liked it and if you want to see
what the products I used and how I done
it
chat with me it was I get ready then
just keep on watching did you get
started today I'm gonna be priming my
skin as always I'm using my Mac prep
arrived at natural radiance primer just
because I do feel like this is a really
nice primer specially for this time of
year because I do feel like my skin it
does tend to get quite dry for my
foundation I'm taking one of my favorite
foundations this is the ex1 invisi wet
validation I haven't used this in the
longest time ever just because I have
been a different shape I am a tiny a
little bit more tanned than my face so
I'm gonna go ahead and use this
foundation today I absolutely love this
foundation it just gives the most
beautiful like natural coverage but it
really covers up everything you really
need it too as well thankfully I don't
have that much right now like I don't
really have any blemishes just some
scarring this scarring is pretty much
always there I'm you know hoping it will
go away at some point but to be honest
the majority of my skin stays red after
I've got spots even once they've gone
away I don't know why my skin is like
that so I'm just gonna be applying this
as evenly as possible to my face do Ben
the end I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques sculpting brush and this is
personally the brush that I feel
works the best with this foundation so I
know I've been a little m.i.a the last
few maybe two weeks just because I've
had so
much going on I've been trying to do up
my room hence the new background I have
so much basically that's changing in my
room layout of my room is pretty much
the same but all the decor is pretty
much changing I used to have like silver
and black and purple as the color turns
in here but I've totally changed it all
to more browns and golds and champagnes
and you guys know that if I could pick
any tone to just wear forever it would
be gold champagnes brown and black as
well of course but I moved away more
from the silver I have still silver bits
in my room but it's mainly gold mainly
champagne and browns and there's kind of
colors I think I'll be busy for another
one to two weeks and then after that
things will totally go back to normal
I wanted everything to be perfect for
the Christmas period I didn't want to be
stressing around Christmas I really
wanted to concentrate on Christmas
tutorials and just really nice Christmas
videos I have a few videos that you guys
have been wanting to see for a long time
and I'm really excited to finally get
them done next I'm going to be moving on
to my eyes and to prime my eyes am
taking the collection lasting perfection
ultimate wear concealer as an eye primer
just because sometimes an eye primer can
be a little bit heavy the long wearing
concealer so if I am gonna be wearing
any I should or anything like that it
should last a little bit longer than a
normal concealer if you haven't tried
using a concealer as an eye primer I
would definitely recommend it if you
have dry eyelids just because I feel
like it doesn't highlight dry skin as
much and if you feel like you need to
say it you can go ahead and set it well
next I'm gonna be setting my eyelids and
I will give that you a cookie if you can
guess right now what powder I'm gonna
use to set my eyelids go on yes you're
right it is the kick-ass soap &amp;amp; Glory
against the retouch powder honestly I
need to repurchase because this is
slowly withering away I can't believe
how fast I finished this because I am
one of those people that don't hit pan
on things often if I hit pan on
something it means I really love it I am
taking that on a precision highlighter
brush from makeup addiction it's really
up until this point I have no clue of
what I'm doing on my eyes as you have no
idea what so ever so
in the crease I'm gonna be taking Peach
Smoothie from makeup geek and I'm just
going to be applying this into the
crease as my transition shade I'm taking
this on a blender brush from makeup
addiction and I'm just gonna be pushing
this into the crease so you guys have
wanted to see a filming setup video for
a while you guys want to see basically
how I do my camera and my lighting and
you know the background and all that
kind of stuff I will film that video for
you now I do my room tour in the same
video or shall I put it in a separate
video let me know because I'm not sure
if I want to put it in the same like do
you want a dedicated video to filming
tour or should I just do it all in one I
really don't know comment below for me
next I'm going to be taking a latte from
makeup geek also and I'm gonna be taking
that on the same brush and I'm just
gonna be applying that into the crease
also just because I want to darken that
crease a little bit for my eyelid I'm
gonna be thinking Mac emphasized powder
for my lid I know right breaking the
rules this is actually a face powder I'm
gonna be using it as an eyeshadow just
because it's a really nice light matte
powder but be very like the tiniest
little reflectiveness in it and that's
why I think I want for my lid right now
so I'm just gonna be taking this on a
makeup addiction a classic shader brush
chip deep in my crease the Chinese bear
I am taking a teeny tiny bit of mocha
eyeshadow from makeup geek as well on a
2 to 4 luxe defined crease brush from
zoeva and this is a tiny little brush
that will really get into the crease and
just to find it a little bit I just feel
like there isn't enough compared to how
light my lip color is so I'm just taking
a very small amount of that onto this
brush and I'm just gonna pop it into my
crease and I am kind of dragging
outwards to create a cut berries as well
I'm just going back in with that
previous brush just to blend out any
harsh lines I don't want to create like
a really strong line I want it to be a
very very soft cut crease sculpt out my
liner I am taking some of the BH liquid
eyeliner and
in color black and I'm just gonna use
this to sculpt out my wing I am gonna go
for a fairly large wing today and I want
it to kind of be all about the wing so
it's gonna be a lot of thick
but now that my island matches on either
a I'm going to go ahead and apply some
lashes the lashes I'm gonna go for today
or the Eldora
and one and two lashes pretty much all
my stuff right now is in boxes so I
can't find any tweezers which means I
haven't tweeze my eyebrows I haven't con
use tweezers to put on my lashes what an
absolute stressful situation
okay so now that my lashes are on I am
going to go for some mascara this is
actually an Avon a mascara right like
Avon is not a brand that you hear a lot
on YouTube but mamas you pull this
mascara for me the other day and I used
it and I loved it
today obviously I'm just going to use it
on the false ones and my bottom lashes
and but I actually really like this in
the stars I just let you guys know that
Avon isn't all that bad
like it's not that bad I think that
mascaras are definitely one of their
best products and they are really
affordable as well which is good I'm
gonna be using the Rimmel wake me up
concealer and I've been absolutely
loving this recently it hasn't taken the
spot of my Maybelline fit me but I
really like it for different reasons I
personally love particularly the color
of this this is in the color classic
beige and I just really love how
brightening is it really is nice and
brightening as you can see it's quite a
lot brighter than my actual skin tone
but I do just love the effect it gives I
feel like it really it does brighten and
wake up the under-eye area so I really
do love it and it's not too heavy again
it's quite nice it's like a medium
coverage and it blends out really
smoothly as well so I definitely love
this concealer but not more than my
Maybelline fit me I like it for kind of
different reasons in a way I'm going to
be using these same brush I used to
blend in my foundation and I'm just
gonna be passing this into the skin
next I'm just gonna be going in with my
3d HD precision brush from Sigma I
haven't used this in the loge this time
because I couldn't find it and I found
it again they've come in with this brush
so I am gonna tell you guys a tiny
little teaser about something I am
really excited about you guys always say
that you want to see more into my life
and that you you know like you want to
see more you know more about Layla and I
can promise you guys that is 100% coming
your way within the next month at least
expect a lot more personal videos and
it's just gonna get past the other
wonderfu nice and connected to you guys
so I'm so excited about things some more
of the logs and lots of logs and some
personal videos too and there may be a
separate channel coming along as well
dedicate it to these things you know
this one had a teeny tiny bit more
coverage under my eyes just because I
really wanted to look nice and bright
under there so I'm just taking some of
this Maybelline age rewind concealer and
the color light just right under my eyes
I'm just patting this in again with the
same brush
I think concealers are one of my
absolute favorite things to buy like I
just get so much joy out of buying
concealers I obviously don't know why
but it just makes me so happy just set
my under eyes and my whole face I'm
taking these same powder as I always do
the instant retouch powder from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I'm just gonna be using this
on again the same brush I would use this
is the Sigma f-35 and I'm just putting
this right under my eyes and just making
sure to really set this area to prevent
any creasing and also just to make sure
that it doesn't move and then I'm gonna
take this powder on a larger brush and
just set the rest of my face to fish you
guys have seen me do my eyebrows about a
bajillion times before and I do have a
full tutorial on how I do them I am
going to do off camera and link the
tutorial down below for you so now that
my brows are on I'm gonna move on to
like bronzing and highlighting of my
skin I am not sure what I'm going for
today like I do I still don't know I
know I've gone for wig line if I don't
know who I go for a colored layers just
contour my face I've decided to go for a
contour look so I'm just gonna be
bronzing my skin a little bit with the
dark golden mineralized skinfinish from
Mac this is definitely my favorite
mineralized skinfinish to Brunn's with
I'm not a huge fan of they give me some
one because I personally feel like it's
too orange toned for me I don't usually
like orange tone bronzers I prefer
moving to like the golden yellow tone so
this is much I just prefer more natural
color
give me Sun as a little bit - orange
tone on me taking the shade step powder
from Mac I'm gonna be eating this to
contour and to do that I'm using an elf
contour brush and I'm just taking some
of this powder and just popping it in my
cheek bone
it's lending out like contour using this
one to six lakhs cheek finish brush then
on that same brush I'm taking this Laura
gala gilded honey a highlighter and I'm
just taking this and applying it to the
tops of my cheekbones
to fill in and line my lips I'm taking
cream of ice cream stick liner from Mac
online lipstick I'm taking this la
splash liquid lipstick lip control and
the colored cryptic and I'm just going
to apply this all over that lip liner so
