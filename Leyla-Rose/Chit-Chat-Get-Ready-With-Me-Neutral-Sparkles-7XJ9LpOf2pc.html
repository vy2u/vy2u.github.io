Channel today I'm going to be showing
you guys how to achieve this a makeup
look that I'm wearing right now it's
just a really simple sparkly neutral I
with this nice mo pink lip I really like
this kind of makeup look and scaring me
in the mood for full and I don't really
well at colors like this often but I
really do like it and I think it's just
so gorgeous this is a chitchat get ready
with me so I kind of just tell you guys
what I'm doing as I'm doing it so I'm
just kind of chatting with you guys as
I'm getting ready I know you guys love
that type of video so i wanted to doing
another one and yeah i hope you guys
enjoy this video if you do want to know
how to achieve this and makeup look then
it please just keep on watching gonna
get started off with my skin today so
i'm gonna start with my Mac prep and
prime natural radiance and I'm just
going to be applying two pumps of this
to my face I really love this primer you
guys know that by now it's a really nice
hydrating primer I want to find another
good one I'm probably going to go for
the two-faced hangover primer or the
Make Up For Ever hydrating primer
because I feel like sometimes I need a
skin smoothing one and then sometimes I
need a hydrating one and then sometimes
I need both which i think is today so
know what it is about my skin but one
day my skin can be completely clear and
then the next day it will end up being
like this and there's blemishes I don't
know I feel like every day is different
with me I feel like my skin really does
change on a daily basis unfortunately I
haven't really found something that
clears my skin up completely my skin is
going the best it's ever gone because
there are days where it is clear whereas
that never used to happen so my skin is
going well but I mean I don't really
feel like it's clear every single day
and so to just move my skin out a little
bit i'm going to be taking some of my
makeup from step one smoothing primer I
like this primer a lot lots of you guys
were asking if this primer was the
reason why my paws were clogged I've had
booked pause this is before i started
using it i stopped using it for a while
and it still continues
today for my foundation i'm going to be
taking my ex1 invisible aquidneck
foundation and this is in the color f300
is going to apply this all over I really
like this foundation I've been wearing
at the last couple of days I do really
really like it I'm going to be blending
that into my skin with my Real
Techniques sculpting brush and I just
feel like I prefer applying this into
the skin rather than the Beauty Blender
if you guys watch my first impression of
this foundation you would see that I
didn't really have the best time with
creating a good coverage when i used a
Beauty Blender so if brush definitely
does create a much more full coverage
kind of base when you really want to
build it up I am basically pre-recorded
videos at the moment because I'm not
actually going anywhere I'm going to the
dentist and I'm basically having to have
something done that to my teeth I don't
know exactly what it's called but
there's something wrong with one of my
teeth but it can really make my mouth
quite swollen so I've had to like pre
record videos just in case like I'm
unable to film so once they're sinking
in I'm going to apply it my soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm just going to apply a
very small amount of this to my lid so
today I'm going to be using my makeup
geek eyeshadows and the first color I'm
going to take is peach smoothie that's
this one just here and I really like
this color because it's really good for
the first transition shade just to give
the I a little bit of definition before
we go in with any darker I'm going to be
taking that on a zoeva 228 brush so I'm
just going to be taking this into the
crease first and just kind of lending in
side to side motions and you don't
really want too much of this but can you
see the difference already between the
two eyes it really adds a lot of nice
definition into their next I'm gonna
take creme brulee which is this color
right here this is going to go into my
crease also and I'm applying this on an
e 35 sigma brush
and then I'm just going back into that
previous brush just to make sure it's
nice and bought two together next I'm
going to take latte which is this color
right here I'm just going to be taking
this into the crease even deeper just to
apply this and to really deepen up that
crease without looking too unnatural we
want to keep this quite low to the
crease so when you look forward you
don't wanna take up too high so I'm just
going to kind of keep this in to
decrease and that way our crease will
look defined without looking too heavy
for my lip color today I wanted to go
for something quite sparkly so I'm going
to be going with the nude 20 for l'oreal
paris color reach i shadow and that's
this color right here i'm gonna be
taking it on a sigma e60 brush which is
like a synthetic brush and this will
just spread it over the lid really nice
and evenly imitation of this eyeshadow
is incredible so glittery and gorgeous I
just absolutely love this eyeshadow next
I'm going to be applying some false
lashes to my eye these are the Euler
grand glamour lashes from Vegas nay
these are some of my favorite lashes at
the moment because they are just so
gorgeous and Fluffy's I'm just going to
be applying these straight onto my lash
line I'm just apply some mascara to make
my lashes kind of join in to the full
swans and then I'm also going to tight
line my eyes as well and then I'm going
to apply a little bit of eyeliner just
to make them blend into my eyes a little
bit next time to be applying some can
see that you might under eyes and this
is the Maybelline fit me concealer I
absolutely love this one this is my
favorite concealer in the whole world so
this one never fails me so I'm just
applying it under my eyes and then I'm
going to apply it down the sides of my
nose also
this will just kind of narrow windows
down a little bit also going to apply it
some of this on to my forehead down my
nose and on my chin to to blend all of
the end I'm going to take these same
brush I used for my foundation and I'm
just going to blend this in to the skin
so who is excited for autumn I am so
excited for the ball because i don't
know i just kind of miss all of the dark
vampy colors like you guys know that I
mainly like to wear nude lips and stuff
like that but I do love to experiment
with really dark lips as well then I'm
going to take my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush as always to get into the little
areas that that big rush can't reach to
set my under eyes i'm going to be using
the soap and glory instant retouch
powder and i'm also going to be taking
my sigma f 35 brush and this is like a
tapered a highlighter brush and I'm just
going to use this to get really close up
right under my under eyes just to set
this area also going to use this to set
my forehead as well because this area I
feel if I don't set it it looks really
bumpy and I feel like when I'm mattify
it just kind of flattens it down with a
different brush but the same powder I'm
just going to be using this to set the
other areas but just with a lot less
powder so just really lightly it's kind
of dabbing it on that way I know
everything will stay in place and it
just means the foundation is totally set
so I'm going to go ahead and finish the
rest of my eyes so I want to leave the
bottom of my eyes completely free but I
want to apply a lot of mascara so no I
shadow verte lots of mascara basically
so I'm going to be taking the in extreme
dimension of mascara from mac and i'm
just going to use this to really
elongate and volumize my bottom lashes
because we've got such long lashes on
the top I really want to make sure that
it looks at balance some of my mascara
has gone into my
selah but that doesn't matter because we
can fix that let it completely dry and
then we will fix it I'm just going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows because I feel
like naked without my brows is anyone
else to say like I literally feel like I
am NOT human today I'm going to be using
my brow archery from soap &amp;amp; Glory this
is an amazing brow pencil if you want
eat soup for the Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow is it's a lot cheaper and it's just
amazing so if you want one go get 1 i'd
definitely recommend there so today I'm
actually going to be taking my Anastasia
Beverly Hills clear brow gel and I'm
gonna run it through my brows fast
because I want my brows to be really
natural I kind of want to place them
where they're going to go and then
anywhere that needs filling in I will
fill in afterwards so I want to let that
dry because this does take a little too
dry and I feel like I want them to stay
in this particular position I put them
in while my brows are kind of setting
into place i'm just going to take some
of the laura geller highlighter and
gilded honey and i'm just going to apply
some of this on to my inner corner
because i just want to kind of brighten
up my inner corner a little bit oh and
there's one thing I want to clear up
lots of you guys comment down below and
say why I don't look directly into the
lens sometime I am trying to look into
the lens as much as possible but my
camera for some reason likes to go out
of focus so sometimes it would just go
out of focus and I want to see it and if
I don't see and I'm not looking then I
basically just have to throw the videos
were just sometimes say that to me you
don't understand the struggle of my
camera and what my camera puts me
through so yeah that is the reason and
it's not because I don't want to look
you directly in the eye cuz I don't mind
doing that it's just because if I don't
check like quite often but like I'm very
conscious because I'm scared that my
camera is going out of focus so yeah I
put in a lot of work for my videos
sometimes I get back to edit it and it's
just completely out of focus it's so
annoying I can't even tell you next I'm
going to take my brow art tree pencil
and i'm just going to use this too
lightly fill in my brows i'm just going
to clean up underneath my brow with some
concealer
they're like I said before I just want
to get some of the mascara off my bottom
lash line so it all you need to do is
wait for it to dry and then just take a
q-tip and just run it along the skin and
it gets all of that mess off so all of
that horrible buscar of gunk that sticks
to the skin it just takes it off
completely so next I'm going to bronze
my skin a little bit i'm going to be
taking the mineralized skinfinish from
mac and this is the one in dark I'm just
going to be taking some of this on a
bronzer brush and just bronzing up my
skin I don't apply too much of this
because i am quite tanned just going to
runs everything under my cheekbones on
the sides of my head you guys know I
love to be bronzed but there's a limit
and we can't really exceed that today so
that will just kind of give us that
overall bronze and add a tiny little bit
of a contour I'm just going to be taking
some of the hoola bronzer by benefit and
I'm just going to be taking this on the
contour of my cheek and just fluffing it
upwards and this way it will look nice
and bronzed without looking too strongly
contoured and I like using hoola when
it's kind of more on the natural side
because it does look bronzed but it does
give you a bit of definition at the same
time today for a bit of blusher I'm
going to be taking the NAS lust up blush
and I'm just going to be applying this
on to my cheekbones and just applying it
in an upward motion just to give us a
tad bit of color and I really really
like this blusher and then for my
highlight I'm going to take the Laura
Geller highlighter again and just apply
this on to my cheekbones just above my
brow
then also just on the tip of my nose or
my lips I'm going to be taking sort lip
by ninjas running it along my lip line
and I'm just going to start to fill it
in a little bit as well and for my
lipstick today I'm going to be taking
drugs osmotics hydromax the lipstick in
serenity and I'm just going to be
applying that all over the lips guys
this is the finished makeup look I
really love the pop of color on the
blimp it's not too vibrant where it's
not wearable it's actually a really nice
amount of color way you can kind of
where for it every day I absolutely love
serenity by dracos megs I think money
