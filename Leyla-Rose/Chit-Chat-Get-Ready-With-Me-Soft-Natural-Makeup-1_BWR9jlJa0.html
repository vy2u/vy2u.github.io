reason why they look like this is
because I'm about to head out now I am
going shopping and I wanted to do my
makeup and I needed to film so I thought
that I would film a get ready with me
this is a chit chat version of it get
ready with me I really wanted to kind of
talk to you guys and I kind of missed it
I don't think I've done one of these in
a while and this is a really natural
look so I thought that I would do a chit
chat version instead of a voice I hope
you guys enjoy these videos you guys
really liked the last one so if you like
this I really like to have a variety of
different stuff running through my
channel I like to have you know bold
looks wearable looks one of these works
where it's definitely a good
representation of what I wear every day
I wear this look pretty much all the
time um mascara brows foundation lips
that's pretty much it and I really
wanted you guys to see me do this
because I am actually about to leave my
house soon and I just thought we'd be
cool I mean getting ready for you guys
it's just my makeup I'm just gonna keep
my hair probably in a bun because I'm
just popping out shocking there very
quickly um so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this video if you would like to see how
I like to achieve my everyday kind of
look like this and you want to get ready
with me we can just chitchat together
then please keep on watching okay guys
I'm gonna get started and sort out this
face
I just want to completely cover this up
but still be natural so I'm gonna be
using my natural radiance primer from a
Mac and I'm just gonna be applying this
all over as a base my skin has been
completely dry recently so basically
this primer is just gonna help my skin
to feel a lot more hydrated because I
really feel like the skin really soaks
it up and it just makes the skin look
really nice and smooth so I highly
recommend this primer for those that
have a drier skin type and they just
want their skin to look a lot smoother
it's been such a long time since I've
done a chitchat get ready with me I
think it was like in the spring the last
time I done one so I thought I'd do on
considering I'm going out and I needed
to film and I'm gonna be doing kind of
like a neutral ish look so I thought
there's no point of me really doing the
tutorial for that so I thought maybe
just get ready with you guys so I'm just
going to mixing together a foundation
that I feel is one of the ones that
don't break me out
it's the Laura Mercier steel cream
foundation it's very thick and I'm gonna
be mixing that with some moisturizer I'm
gonna be mixing the vitamin E intense
moisture cream and just together it's
just gonna create a little bit more of
that kind of tinted moisturizer feel the
color I'm going to be using today is
cashew beige this is the closest to my
natural skin tone but the one I use when
I'm a bit more tan is called sand beige
and that's just a bit too dark for me
right now
so I'm mixing some of that on the back
of my hand and then I'm just gonna take
a tad bit of my moisturizer so I'm just
gonna be applying that all over and this
is really nice because I know the color
is good for me and I know the
moisturizer works for me and this is
just a really great tip this is what I
used to do when I had less makeup and I
wanted to extort create a little bit of
a lighter coverage you can just apply a
little bit of your favorite moisturizer
in with it and that just completely
changes the formula and just makes it a
lot more liked weight so I definitely
like doing this and I used to do it a
lot before I became a makeup hoarder and
I have basically all the makeup well I
am gonna be using my hands just to rub
it into the areas where I need it and
then because this is just gonna be like
a nice light veil of color I'm then
gonna be applying some concealer on the
areas where the tinted moisturizer
hasn't covered and then if you felt like
you need a little bit of coverage on the
areas where they are just not covered by
tinted moisturizer what you can do is
just take a little bit of the foundation
alone and kind of use that as your
concealer I'm just patting my foundation
on this area just to kind of cover the
areas where the redness is kind of
showing
there's blemishes and that way the whole
face doesn't need to be covered in
foundation it just makes it a little bit
more of a natural appearance this little
blemish right here does not want to be
covered it's quite a dark one so I'm
going to be using a different concealer
to cover that in a set difficulty ler
I'm going to be using as the maybelline
instant anti age eraser
concealer and I'm just gonna be using it
in a triangle under my eye although this
is kind of a simple look I do want it to
be quite nice at the same time so I am
gonna be still doing the triangle under
my eye so I'm still always gonna be
taking it down at these sides of my nose
so I'm just gonna be applying this
concealer in the areas that I want to
bring forward and then I'm just gonna
place them on my chin because I want a
highlight there but also I get spots
there too so we'll cover them up to
blend that all in I'm going to be using
a brush for one so I never use a brush I
just don't use a sponge today I'm using
the Real Techniques expert face brush
and I'm just going to be using this chip
hat into the skin and make sure that we
can see you looks nice and blended and I
kind of like to use this brush in
patting motions just kind of bouncing
the product into the skin the same way
you would with a sponge but instead of
kind of rubbing in spreading the product
everywhere I'm just pushing in like that
just to make sure that we product
doesn't move too far everywhere and it
doesn't make our face look too pale in
that sense
and of remembered that I didn't even get
to talk to you guys about the Game of
Thrones Season 5 Finale Jon Snow is my
favorite character by far like I'm not
joking but I grieved I'm not gonna lie I
wish that someone recorded my reaction
to his death it would have been a
YouTube hit that people saw I literally
bawled my eyes out I was hysterical I
was like no what do you guys think what
do you think is gonna happen I
personally think that he is gonna be
brought back because I think his lineage
and that he has a very significant
character that we don't know about I
think that he is important I'm in the
middle of reading the books and the
significance around him is just too much
for him to actually be gone so I
personally think he's gonna live what
are you guys think comment down below
what you think is gonna happen if you
watch Game of Thrones because I was
chatting through that I didn't get a
chance to tell you guys I also just
applied whatever was left over kind of
on my finger onto my eyelid to during
the day usually I don't tend to apply a
primer just because usually I don't
really use much eyeshadow so for my
complexion I always do make sure to set
it with a powder just because otherwise
I know it's not going to last on me
even though my skin is dry it's also
extremely oily at the same time I don't
know how it works but my skin is a prime
a definition of combination skin I get
definitely both of them and just like
anything with powder I like to press it
into the skin
I'm also gonna be taking a brush that is
smaller in size and just use it to set
my eyelid as well just because like I
said if you're ever gonna put concealer
on the lids you just want to make sure
that you are setting it properly okay so
I never actually do this first but I'm
gonna do my Kwan's my blush and my
highlight first before I do anything
else using the bronzer and the brush I
always use a lava use everyday
it's my zoeva 101 brush and my dark
golden powder love this is from Mac and
I just personally feel like this gives
me the perfect amount of color that I am
looking for I want to look like I am
glowing and that I have a nice amount of
warmth through my skin but at the same
time I don't really look at you orange
and to me this is just the perfect color
I like to be bronzed more than blush I
ever actually don't even know I said
blush I probably won't even be applying
it blush I have a lot of dashes but I
never really use them just because I
only usually like to use a blush when
I'm kind of going out in anyone with me
on that does anyone kind of feel me I've
kind of feel like blush can be a bit
unnecessary sometimes especially if you
are as much bronzer as I do
for my highlight today I'm going to be
using the Laura gala gilded honey baked
gelato swell illuminator this is amazing
I've been using this constantly at the
last couple of days it's basically the
only highlight I've been using and I
really like the effect it gives it
really looks like a glow from within
it's very smooth and it doesn't kind of
have that bullet ory substance it's just
smooth sheen and that's what makes you
feel like you're just glowing and it
doesn't make you feel like you're just
covered in glitter so I'm just applying
that onto my cheekbones and this is the
Tom Ford number two brush this is a
really nice brush I know it's an
expensive one but it's a really nice
shape because it kind of packs on color
this is great for blush as well you can
use this for creams anything really I
like to use it for high
because I just feel like it gives me a
really nice natural glow and I'm also
just applying it on top of my brow as
well just kind of here to give us that
natural kind of glow and we look to the
side to make a spoon of glowing today
I'm just gonna be going for my normal
pen at saw and brow mascara through
brows except I'm using two different
brow products you have seen these if you
watched my birthday call these are two
pronoun products for me but I've been
using them like crazy
off camera while I've been doing my
makeup in the past week since my
birthday
obsessed both Ernest takes your products
and I'm completely in love so I'm just
gonna get started off with the brow is
this is the brow Wiz in dark brown and I
absolutely love this I love the fact
that it has a comb on the other end I've
just been using it like crazy and I just
feel amazing when these are on my brows
like I just feel so confident about my
brows it's crazy how these products are
actually as good as everyone says
because I was kind of a non-believer
because I've never tried it but you kind
of need to try it to be a believer if
that makes sense so I'm just gonna be
using the brow pencil side and just
start to fill in my brows
what I really like about this color the
color dark brown is that it's definitely
cool it doesn't make my eyebrows that
look too warm and red tone but at the
same time I don't feel like my browser
too dark when I'm doing my eyebrows at
this color so I am extremely happy with
the shade so when I'm kind of happy with
the shape that I've drawn I'll stop
drawing cuz I don't draw too much and
then I'm gonna go in with my anastasiya
clear brow gel oh my god this is the
best stuff ever best brow gel I've ever
used in my life I love it I love the
fact that it's clear I've wanted a clear
brow gel forever and this is honestly
like hair spray for your brows nothing
moves I promise and it's just amazing it
really keeps everything in place so I'm
just gonna put my brows or where I want
them with the clear brow gel on the
inner part of the brow I like to flick
my brow hairs upwards and then when it
gets towards the end tail of my brow I
like to pull them downwards towards
their natural shape and then at this
point when I'm kind of happy with them
I'm just going to go underneath the brow
and highlight and I like to use this
shade right here
I'm just gonna go for a really natural I
am NOT going to bother with that
today the mascara I'm using is a Mac one
this is the in extreme dimension I think
it's called and this is kind of drying
out and I just want like with mascaras
and dried out I just get so much better
of a result and my lashes just look a
million billion times denser so apply a
second coat add a little bit more volume
I really like to push it through the
lash I'm just gonna apply a very small
amount of this on my bottom lash line I
don't like to apply too much on my
bottom lash line because my bottom
lashes this is so much longer than my
top so I feel like if I push them too
far then my eyes just look really weird
and it drags them down too much for my
lips I'm gonna be taking the Kiko 501
automatic precision liner and I'm just
gonna be applying it all over my lips
like literally all over this is the most
perfect nude in the whole world and it
lasts a really long time so I'm just
gonna apply this a little over
and I'm just going to be rubbing a dry
q-tip along my lash line to try and get
rid of that sort of smudged mascara that
kind of gets stuck on the lash line
and you always want to make sure you let
it dry completely because that way it
will just crack right off and it won't
make a difference to your mascara but
guys that is the end of this look I know
it was something that's super simple
extremely wearable but at the end of the
day I don't feel like they do a lot of
these looks a lot of my looks are more
dramatic for the evening wearing lashes
with a bold lip it's never really
natural it's very rarely natural so I do
like to do a wearable look here and
there and because this wasn't
necessarily a tutorial in the sense that
there wasn't much to teach you I feel
that I would do a get ready with me and
just kind of show you guys what I do the
majority the time is a very realistic
approach to my everyday makeup it's not
like no makeup makeup look but it is the
kind of look that I will go for when I
want to look natural this is the kind of
look I like to wear shopping because I
just kind of feel like myself
I feel like it's enough makeup my skin
still shows through I feel glowing and
healthy and I'm still wearing makeup so
I still kind of feel like I look
presentable at the same time so I hope
