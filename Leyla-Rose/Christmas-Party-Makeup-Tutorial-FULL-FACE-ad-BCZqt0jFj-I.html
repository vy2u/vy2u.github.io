channel so today's makeup tutorial is
going to be on this Christmas party look
I wanted to keep it really Christmasy
with a bright red lip and I've always
wanted to jazz up a little bit and make
it a little bit more Leila fied with the
sparkly eyes I really hope you guys
enjoy it don't forget to subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already and also
like this video for more christmas
tutorials because i love christmas so if
you do anything how to achieve this look
then just keep on watching okay guys so
the first thing i'm going to be doing is
moisturizing using my vitamin e
moisturizer from the body shop this is
my favorite everyday moisturizer and it
just gives me enough to really hydrate
and moisturize my skin and I just love
this before makeup application next to
prime my skin I'm going to be taking the
body shot all-in-one instable ax and I'm
just going to be using this on my t-zone
and my cheek area this is because I have
the most kind of pores around this area
and this is a really nice pore filling
primer so I'm just pushing this onto the
area that I really feel like needs a
little bit of smoothness for my
foundation I'm going to be taking the
body shop fresh nude foundation and
mixing it with the shade adjusting drops
my foundations are usually pretty much
too dark for me so I'd love to use these
adjusting drops to really help my
foundation to match me a little bit
better you guys have seen me mention
this quite a few times I am also really
really loving this foundation right now
because it's so glowy you can apply one
layer for a nice even glowy coverage
that just looks enough for your skin for
your skin to still show through whilst
giving you a really nice coverage and
it's also buildable as well which I love
I always love my face to look as false
as possible but I don't like it to look
too over the top so this foundation is
perfect I'm also just applying some
concealer under my eyes and I'm just
using this in a triangular motion to
really lift the eyes I'm also going to
be applying this on my forehead my chin
and also on the sides of my mouth just
to brighten any dark areas I'm going to
be blending the in and just making sure
that this looks really seamless with the
rest of my face
because I wanted the skin to stay
looking super glowy I decided that I
wanted to mattify only certain parts of
the skin using the body shop insta matte
I applied it on my forehead my under
eyes and also on any other areas that I
didn't want there to be a shine I'm
going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
off-camera but I will link my our
tutorial down in description box for my
bronzer I'm taking the bodyshop honey
bronzer and I'm just applying this with
one of the amazing vegan brushes from
the body shop and applying this around
the outer perimeter of my face these
brushes are so so soft they feel amazing
on the skin and they are vegan as well
so that's absolutely amazing I'm just
applying it on those areas and making
sure that it looks relatively natural
because I didn't want to go for anything
too crazy on the skin I usually like to
keep the skin quite simple and glowy so
that's what I went for I also went in
with a little bit of highlight as well
and I was focusing mainly on the
lightest shade at the bottom I took that
on one of the vegan fan brushes and I
applied it onto the tops of my
cheekbones and I really really like the
way this looked it looked super subtle
and it really complimented the glowy
foundation I apply beforehand
finally for one of my favorite parts I'm
going to be taking the bodyshop down to
earth I pala and I'm first of all
starting with this shade right here this
is a very very light nude shade and I'm
just gonna be building this up in the
crease to really make a subtle shadow
almost like a flesh tone so that we have
something for the darker colors to blend
into I am using one of the vegan
blending brushes for this and I'm just
blending that into the crease and this
build-up looks really really nice and
subtle in the crease the next color we
are going to be applying is this matte
brown shade and this is a little bit
darker so you want apply this quite
gradually I'm taking a lot on the same
blending brush and just applying it
gradually into that crease area you do
want to make sure that when you go
straight into a slightly darker color
that you do apply it gradually otherwise
it can be quite hard to blend so I am at
tapering outwards towards the tail of my
eyebrow and then I'm going in with
another brush to kind of clean up the
edges just to make the shape look a
little bit more structured but you can
leave this if you like a little bit more
of a smoky look
replicating that on the other side and
again just making sure that I'm really
pulling this towards the tail of my
eyebrow to really lift the eyes and
again going back in with another brush
just to really clean up that edge for my
eyelid I am taking this eye color stick
and I'm applying it onto my lid this is
an a beautiful shimmery gold shade which
i think is so perfect for the Christmas
season so I'm applying this on my eyelid
and just making sure that I stop around
my crease area that way we can kind of
create almost like a half cut crease and
then I am going to be of course doing
the same thing on the other eye and what
I will be doing also is just setting
this with another eye shadow now this
can be used totally on its own but you
can use this underneath another eye
shadow so I'm taking this color from the
down-to-earth palette and I'm just
taking this on a flat brush and just
patting it onto my lid next I'm going to
be going for a beautiful winged liner
now I feel for Christmas time to go for
that really nice classic Christmas look
I feel like a winged liner is perfect so
what I'm doing to create this look is
drawing a very very thin line using a
pen liner on my lid and this is really
simple to do especially if you're using
a pen because I feel like this makes it
so super easy once I've created the line
on my lid I then create my winged shape
and I like to go by a rough 45 degree
angle then I like to connect the two
lines together fill in that little
Triangle area and then just make it look
like the line blends really seamlessly
into the wing I'm also going to go ahead
and apply some false lashes off-camera
and this is how it looks at some false
lashes for my bottom lash line I'm
taking on a smudger brush from the body
shop some of that brown shade we applied
in the crease and then I am just to make
it a teeny little bit more intense
taking a little bit of this matte black
from the down-to-earth palette and just
applying that very very close to the
lash line I'm really going to be pushing
this as close to my bottom lashes as
possible just to create a little bit
more intensity and smokiness but
actually having to apply any liner on
the inside of my eye
and as always you guys know the drill
I'm applying some mascara to my top
lashes and also onto my bottom lashes to
add a really nice amount of length and
volume and that way it looks like the
eyes are fully complete and then finally
to finish off this look I am taking some
red lip liner to act as our guideline
before we apply our liquid lipstick I'm
applying this all around the outer
perimeter and slightly over lining my
lips to create a fuller appearance and
then I'm going to be going in for what I
think is the star of the show I'm using
the matte lip liquid from the body shop
in the shade Tahiti hibiscus and just
applying it all over I am blotting also
just to make sure that all of the excess
is gone and this is how it looks when
it's dry I absolutely love this look I'm
so happy that it's Christmastime it's
one of my favorite times of the year and
I really hope you guys like this
Christmas party look if you guys did
