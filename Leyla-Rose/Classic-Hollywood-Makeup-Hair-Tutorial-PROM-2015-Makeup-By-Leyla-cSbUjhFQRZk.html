today's makeup and hair tutorial is a
classic Hollywood inspired look and it's
perfect for prom and any other events
that you have to go to so the first step
is going to be applying some moisturizer
to our under eyes and our eyelids just
before we apply our primer and I'm using
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for our
primer today and the reason why I wanted
to moisturize is because the Paint Pot
can be quite drying and it just makes it
look a lot smoother when you apply an
eye cream underneath there next I'm
going in with the zoeva smoky eye
palette and I'm using this light pink
color and using this as our transition
shade and I'm gonna be taking a fluffy
blending brush and taking this into our
crease amusing motions that are going
back and forth and just blending this
into the crease and going upwards we're
going to be doing a cut crease look so
don't worry if any of this goes onto the
lid as we're gonna fix this later
you just want to consistently keep
lending this color just to make sure
that it's nice and blended upwards then
I'm gonna be going in with this warm
color and just applying it into our
crease and what this warm brown will do
is it's just gonna start to define the
crease and make it appear a lot deeper
and we're using the same brush for this
and just going back and forth again just
making that very deeper part of our
crease look nice and sunk in and I'm
also dragging it outwards to extend our
eyes out then I'm taking a clean
blending brush from Sigma and just going
back and forth at the very top of the
color just to make sure that it's nice
and buffed out then I'm going in with
this warm brown and just applying this
into the very deepest part of our crease
and this is gonna be the darkest crease
color that we use today and we're gonna
start to kind of carve out where we want
our cut crease to be so I'm just using
this pointed brush to sort of trace out
where we want the cut crease to be then
we are going to blend that color
outwards and just make sure that it
blends into the other colors that we
applied into the crease I'm using that
first brush and I'm just going back in
to make sure that it's nice and blended
then I'm using a short shader brush and
just applying the same soft ochre Paint
Pot from Mac and just using this to
carve out the cut crease that we want so
what we're going to be doing is just
applying this and just going all along
as soon as the lid stops that is the
kind of crease that we want to achieve
you can go for any kind of cut crease
you can go past the lid if you want but
this is the kind of cut crease that I
wanted to go for so it's just sitting
where the crease stops then I'm going in
with the cream color from that palette
and just patting this on top of that
paint pot just to make it stay on and
also to brighten it as well
next we're going to be applying a winged
eyeliner onto the lid and I'm going to
be applying some gel eyeliner and create
a nice thin line on the lid and then
we're going to start to extend this
outwards to the tail of our brow and
then what we're going to do is connect
all the lines and begin to fill it in
then once that's done you just want to
slightly thicken it start thin and then
gradually thicken the line that way you
don't make any mistakes and it's just a
lot easier to replicate it on the other
eye as well next I'm going to be curling
my eyelashes with an eyelash curler and
I'm going to be applying some mascara
onto our lashes to prepare them for the
false lashes of course this is
recommended to apply some false lashes
just because it adds drama to the look
that your natural lashes just can't do
and but of course you can wear your
natural lashes if you feel more
comfortable
my Arbor tutorial is in the downbar so
definitely check that out if you want to
see how I do my eyebrows next I'm gonna
be applying some moisturizer to my skin
just to make sure that my skin looks
nice and moisturized under our
foundation and I'm using the vitamin E
moisturizer from the body shop and I
just absolutely love this because it has
a nice matte feeling which means that it
can double up as our primer as well next
I'm going to be doing my foundation and
I'm mixing my Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation with some argan oil I've been
loving to do this recently because I
just feel this gives me the most
flawless coverage that I can achieve on
my skin so of course go with whatever
foundation you would like as this is a
look that is you know meant to have a
nice flawless skin to go with whatever
full coverage foundation you are most
comfortable with
I'm just buffing that in with my Real
Techniques miracle sponge and I'm also
using my Sigma 3d HD kabuki I'm a
concealer brush is the best thing for
just trying to get into that little bits
that you can't reach with a sponge or a
large brush it's amazing
next I'm just applying a little bit more
coverage and just going over the areas
that I feel need a bit more coverage
then I'm using some concealer under my
eyes to your brighten and highlight
under the eyes I'm using the NARS creamy
concealer in custard and the dream Lumi
touch concealer from Maybelline
I'm also using the sponge to help blend
that in and it just creates a really
nice flawless effect
and I'm using that 3d HD you can see the
brush again from Sigma and this is so
good to clean up anywhere but you really
can't reach
next I'm going to be baking my undereyes
using a loose powder and what this does
is it helps you set the under eyes I've
applied all that powder and allowed it
to sit for about five minutes and then
I'm going to dust it away and then I'm
also applying someone to my forehead to
make sure there is no shine I'm going
with a setting brush from Real
Techniques to buff away the excess
powder and it just leaves a really nice
and brightened effect
next I'm going to be bronzing my skin
with the Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden
light and I'm just gonna be using a
really big fluffy brush just to bronze
the perimeter of my skin and then we're
gonna be going in with a darker matte
bronzer just to apply into the hollows
of our cheeks to create more of a
contoured chiseled effect onto our
cheeks I'm taking the Bahama Mama
bronzer and using a contouring brush
from Real Techniques and just applying
this into the hollows of our cheeks
next I'm gonna be applying some blusher
I'm taking a Naz blusher which is this
really nice pretty golden color and just
applying it onto my cheeks and rolling
it backwards this is just gonna give us
a subtle glow without looking too pink
then I'm applying a highlighter to the
tops of my cheekbones just to give me a
nice subtle glow
then I'm gonna be taking a red lipliner
and going along my lip line to create a
nice chiseled lip line we want to make
sure that our lip line looks nice and
you know defined and straight we don't
want it to look too faded so you want to
make sure that you create a really nice
and straight line with this by the way
I'm sorry my camera went about our
focused at this point so sorry for that
then I'm going in with a slightly darker
lip liner and just applying this to the
outer part of our lip just to create
more definition within the lip
then I'm flying my lipstick I'm using
Gerard cosmetics fire-engine lipstick
and this is just the perfect red hue and
I'm just applying this all over you can
leave it at this step or you can apply
it gloss I wanted to apply a gloss so of
course it is completely optional I'm
using candy apple gloss also from Gerard
cosmetics if you do want any discount
for their products then check the
description box along with a lot of
other discount codes that I have for
various brands next we're gonna get
started on our hair and I had previously
straighten my hair the night before as
you guys know I have very curly hair so
I'm just brushing it through to get all
the tangles and I'm using my tangle
teezer for that and you just want to
make sure that all the tangles are out
so that it's ready to curl then I'm
applying one track of extensions I like
to clip in my extensions as I go so you
can do it however where you feel most
comfortable and I'm gonna start to curl
my hair with my Bellamy six in one color
and I'm using the 25 millimeter barrel
and this is quite a wide barrel because
we want to create a nice or wavy effect
the secret to this curl is that you want
to curl towards your face but as you can
see I've kind of sped it up because
obviously I want you guys to see it as
much as possible I start to curl towards
my face so I'm calling inwards every
single time whereas usually what I would
tend to do is curl outwards and this
just kind of gives us the colors that
come towards our face and it just looks
really nice and classic so as you can
see I'm calling towards my face it's the
same for the other side whatever side
you're on you want to curl towards your
face every section is the same this look
is literally one of the easiest hair
looks I've ever had to do you just
literally do the same thing over and
over again just curling each curl
towards your face
and then when you get to the top section
of your hair you want to section your
hair in a side partings I'm just using a
little clip just to help me get a nice
straight parting and then once I have
done that I just begin to do exactly the
same thing as been doing throughout the
whole of the tutorial and again just
curling towards the face
you
you
okay so once I'm done I've just applied
a little bit of argan oil to my hands
and just running it through my hair to
create a nice shine and this just makes
the hair look nice and healthy and then
I'm gonna brush all of that through to
create a nice sleek wave and as you can
see it all just kind of goes with each
other and it just creates this really
nice sleek kind of soft wave within the
hair so it just creates the most
gorgeous look and then I'm just gonna
start to spray my hair get all these
stray hairs down and it just creates
extra shine as well so that's just the
finishing touch on the look okay guys so
this is the end of this tutorial
