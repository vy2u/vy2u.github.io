Channel today I'm going to be showing
you guys how to achieve this makeup look
I'm wearing right here it's basically
this cool toned eye makeup look with a
pop of blue on the bottom lash line
paired with this gray toned lip
stay get started I'm gonna be priming my
skin and I'm using my Olay two-in-one
hydration moisturizer and primer and I'm
just applying this all over my face to
prep my skin before foundation then I'm
gonna be taking my Laura Mercier silk
cream foundation I'm gonna be applying
this all over my skin and then blending
that in to my skin with a damp Beauty
Blender next I'm just going to be
priming my eyes with a concealer this is
the Maybelline age rewind concealer and
I'm just applying this all over my lid
and I'm gonna be setting this with a
powder this will just really help it to
stay in place and I just prefer using a
concealer sometimes just because I do
feel like it's a lighter option rather
than a Paint Pot I'm just setting it
with a translucent powder just to make
sure that it stays in place and then it
doesn't move and today for eyeshadow I'm
gonna be taking these Smashbox full
exposure palette and first of all taking
this grayish brown shade I'm gonna be
applying this as my first transition
shade and I'm gonna apply this into the
crease with a fluffy blending brush you
want to make sure you blend this as well
as you can just because all the colors
will blend really seamlessly when you do
this also I just want to make sure that
this color looks really nice and
pigmented because I do want this color
to be quite dominant when you can see it
blending out if that makes sense
I do want this color to be visible
through the other shades too next I'm
just going to be taking this darker grey
brown shade and I'm gonna apply this
into the deeper part of my crease and
taking this on a more detailed blending
brush and then I'm gonna go back into
that previous brush we used to apply
that first shade and we're going to use
that to kind of blend everything out I'm
just going back in windshield wiper
motions going back and forth just to
make sure this is really well blended
this brush that I'm using right now is
these away at 2:00 to 8:00 and I just
love to use this to blend
so a piece of footage actually got cut
out I actually applied a silver on my
lid and a little bit of black into the
crease I'm really sorry it got cut out
but I'm just showing you guys that I am
just patting this silver shade from the
full exposure palette onto my lid and I
just applied a little bit of black into
at the outer corner so I'm really sorry
that got caught out it was a little bit
of a bad day for me filming nothing
really worked together but I just
applied a little bit of black and made
sure that was really blended next I'm
just gonna be doing my eyebrows I'm
taking my Anastasia Beverly Hills a brow
Wiz and I'm just running that through my
brows if you guys do want to see a more
in-depth brow video I will link my brow
tutorial down below where I explain in
much more detail what I am doing right
now next I'm just gonna be taking some
lashes and applying it to my top lash
line this will just create a little bit
of extra definition I just love the way
that lashes create a look so I'm making
sure to apply them as close to that
shine as possible just because I'm not
applying any liner I do feel like
eyeliner would look absolutely beautiful
with this look though
next I'm just going to be applying some
concealer to my under eyes this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer I really
love this concealer and you guys
obviously know that by now I use it
pretty much every day I just feel like
it's such a beautiful smooth concealer
it blends so easily and I just love it
so I know you guys will love it too so
if you see this concealer out in the
drugstore and you're considering whether
to get it or not I definitely recommend
it it just blends out so beautifully
with a Beauty Blender as well and I just
absolutely love this concealer I'm also
just using my finger to get into all the
little areas so that it blends really
seamlessly up to my eye makeup next I'm
just going to be setting my under eyes
using the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder and then I'm just taking some of
a kohl liner as applying that to the
waterline just to create a little bit
more drama
this pigment is from makeup addiction I
absolutely love this color it's so
bright I'm taking it on a pencil brush
and just applying it to the bottom lash
line this is definitely the star of the
show in my opinion it just creates such
drama and I love applying a pop of color
to the bottom lash line you can do this
with any color you'd like I feel like
with the cool tones this nice electric
blue looks beautiful I'm also just gonna
be taking some more of that matte black
as close to the lash line as possible
just so we don't affect that blue we
applied previously and I'm just going to
be making sure to really push it to the
upper part of my bottom lash line
and then taking this shimmery shade from
that palette also I'm just going to be
applying this onto the inner corner and
then to finish off the look I'm just
gonna be applying some mascara just to
balance the top in the bottom lashes and
also just to finish everything off next
I'm just gonna be bronzing my skin and
I'm just going to be using the Bobbi
Brown bronzer in golden lights I am
gonna be using a highlighter from makeup
addiction it's probably one of the
prettiest highlights I've used in a
really long time it is so beautiful it's
such a gorgeous white gold and I just
love the effect it gives this is
absolutely stunning so I applied that
onto my cheekbones and also onto the tip
of my nose and also for my lips I'm
gonna be taking Mac's tone lip liner I
absolutely love this color this is my
go-to for the fall and winter I love a
gray toned lip you can go for any type
of nude for this but I really wanted to
go for a nice gray toned nude this
lipstick that I'm using at the moment is
underground from Gerard cosmetics
so guys that is the end of this look I
hope that you enjoyed this tutorial
I'm really sorry some of the footage got
cut out but it's nothing you guys have
never seen for me before thankfully I
had such a bad time with filming this
tutorial so I'm really sorry I've
