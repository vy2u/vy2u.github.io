I'm gonna be showing you my easy copper
glitter eyes and the first step that I'm
going to take is using a matte orange
eyeshadow with a blending brush this one
is from Mac and it's a really nice
vibrant Orange and I'm going to be
blending that really really well and
making sure that color is nice and
bright and I'm going to be putting that
into my crease and I'm just blending
that upwards really nicely so there
looks nice and diffused
just slowly building up more color so
that it looks nice and vibrant then I'm
also gonna be taking the soft brown
color and I'm going to be turning it
down just a little bit this is optional
because some people do like it to be
more vibrant but this is more for those
who like it to be slightly more toned
down so this bit is up to you next I'm
gonna take gleam from Mac and this is
just a really nice shimmery light
highlight color and I'm gonna be using
it on my inner corner this is just gonna
opening eyes slightly and it's gonna
make the eyes look nice and bright next
I am patting copper Sparkle pigment by
Mac and I have wet my brush first with
mac fix+
this is just going to turn the pigment
into a more foiled effect and it's also
gonna make it look more pigmented than
what it actually is I have tried it
before with no fix plus before and it
just does not work it falls absolutely
everywhere so definitely recommend
wetting your brush first then I am just
patting on with another brush and
glitter adhesive this is by shot violet
Voss I absolutely love this brand and
I'm just patting this all over the lid
then I'm just gonna be patting on my
shot violet Voss glitter all the names
will be down below by the way guys all
the names of all the products and
brushes how amazing does this look guys
it looks absolutely amazing
yep just patting them on to give it a
nice sparkly effect and you have to work
quite quickly because it does dry and
fairly quickly so I'm just patting it on
as quickly as possible next I'm going to
be putting on some mascara onto my top
lashes as you can see the glitter and
absolutely everywhere so I'm going to
clean up in a sec then I'm popping on
some false lashes these are like a
doubled up I've got these from IMATS
these are really good and they were so
cheap so I will try and find out the
name and put it
in the description box then I'm gonna be
taking the black in black gel liner on a
small zoeva brush and I'm gonna be
putting that on my waterline and then
I'm just going to take it slightly below
the lash line as well so that I can
blend that afterwards then I'm going to
be taking a rack rack Mac pencil lip
pencil this is read by Mac and yeah I'm
going to just gonna be putting this onto
and where I just put that black it's
gonna give it a more vibrant look rather
than just smudging some orange onto it
so I wanted to make sure that look nice
and vibrant under the lash line and I'm
just taking a sharp ended brush and I'm
gonna be blending that slightly below as
well just to get that make you look nice
and diffused
next I'm gonna be putting on a lot of
mascara onto my bottom lashes to make
them look nice and for to match my top
and yeah this has just been such a
simple eyelet it's been my go-to
recently and that is the end of the
eyelet it's so easy and I'm just
peppering this up with a really nice and
bright under eye out highlight because I
think it just complements it was really
really nicely so I'm just highlighting
quite a lot then I'm going to be
blending that in as well to blend that
in I am also going to be using a zoeva
brush this is absolutely amazing I will
put the number down below again this is
been my go-to brush for blending in
under a highlight but this it's just
like the most perfect size ever and it
just blends it so beautifully so it's
such a high-end quality brush there is
such a small price
next I'm going to be putting on a
highlight this is mary lou manizer by
the balm I'm putting this on fast before
my bronzer because sometimes they can
look a little bit too harsh on top of
bronzer so I've just applied it fast and
then I'm gonna be prying my bronzer
after and the bronzer that I'm applying
is the balm Bahama Mama and I'm just
putting that under my cheekbones to give
me a nice sculpted cheek I just feel
like a nice bronze cheek goes really
nicely with this eye look because it
sticks forever boot everything being
quite metallic so I think it just looks
really nice like that I'm going to be
lining my lips with my absolute favorite
lip pencil in the whole entire world
this is sand beige retractable lip liner
by NYX and I absolutely love them I'm
just using it to sculpt out my lip shape
and just to make it look more defined
and this color can be used for
absolutely every nude in the whole
entire world so that's why I love it
being a fellow nude loved are so if you
love dudes you all love it and it lasts
all day as well which is really good now
I'm just applying honey laughs onto my
lips this is again one of my favorite
lipsticks in the whole entire world this
is a nice matte lipstick which makes
your lips look a little full I am going
to be putting one of my favorite lip
glosses on as well in a sack I'm using
my whitening lightening lip glosses if
you are interested I do have a discount
code which you can use they are really
really cheap with my discount codes so
definitely check out the description box
below for my discount code so I'm just
applying coral craze on top of that and
it is so amazing and buttery how amazing
does this look and it lights up as well
which is amazing so yeah once you've got
your lip gloss on that is the end of
this leg I
enjoy guys and I will see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
