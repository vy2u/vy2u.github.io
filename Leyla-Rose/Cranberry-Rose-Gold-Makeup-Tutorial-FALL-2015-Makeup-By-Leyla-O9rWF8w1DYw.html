Oh
amen
Oh
hey everyone and welcome back to my
channel today's makeup tutorial is going
to be on this cranberry and rose gold
makeup look
so to get started as always I'm going to
be priming my eyes I'm using this
Maybelline age rewind concealer just to
prep my eyes before I apply anything
today I'm using a concealer because it's
just a little bit softer than using a
actual eye primer so I'm just setting it
to make sure that it doesn't move and
then I'm going into our first transition
shade this one is the Sigma passion
fruit single eyeshadow absolutely love
this color this color is just going to
make sure to blend everything really
seamlessly and I really like this color
because it really blends things out well
especially with pinky and cranberry
colors it just acts as a really nice
first color to make sure everything
blends well and then I'm taking bitten
which is a makeup geek eyeshadow this is
in my opinion at the start of the show
this just gives it such a gorgeous
cranberry effect and I just absolutely
love it
so I'm just applying that with the same
brush firstly just applying into the
crease just to give it the hint of this
color this color is really pigmented and
very vibrant so I want to apply it
gradually to ensure that I just don't
get cranberry everywhere so I'm just
making sure to apply it as gradually as
possible and then I'm going into a
pencil brush to build up the intensity
in the crease so I'm just taking it in
the crease and then blending it out with
a separate blending brush and I just
like to go in between brushes as many
times as I need to to make sure that
it's as vibrant as I want and also as
blended as I need it to be too
next I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
corrupt eyeshadow this is basically a
matte black I'm going to be applying
this in the outer V to create some
definition and I just really want to
create a soft smoky effect I'm applying
a little bit of this onto a pencil brush
and just applying it to the outer V and
then using that brush we applied
previously just to really blend it out
nicely so I'm just kind of going back
and forth between brushes as many times
as I need to to make sure that black
blend really well into the other colors
and again I'm just going back into that
black color to make sure that black is
as dark as I want it to be if you want
it to be super smoky then go back as
many times as you need to
and then I'm just cleaning up these
sides of my eye to ensure that it looks
nice and neat and then I'm taking this
makeup geek eyeshadow this is basically
like a rose gold shade and I'm just
going to be applying it onto the lid and
just swiping it over I absolutely love
this color I think it really gives a
nice girly effect to the look and I just
love this color and then I'm taking
magic act foiled eyeshadow also from
makeup geek I'm just going to apply this
onto the inner part of the inner corner
of my eye just because I don't to take
it over the whole eye I just want to
keep it to the inner corner just to
brighten it a little bit next I'm going
to be doing my wing of liner today I
decided to kind of go for a really nice
winged effect and I'm just creating a
nice line over my I mean it out to the
tail and just creating a fairly large
flick like I don't want to go for
anything too crazy nothing too thick but
as you want it to be a little bit of a
bigger wing so I'm just creating the
line that comes out words and then
connecting the two together to create a
really nice like I do have a tutorial on
my channel that explains how I like to
create a winged liner it's a really
intense video so I will leave it down
below if you really need help with
creating a winged liner because that
video is really intense and it gives you
a lot of information so I will pop that
down in the description box for you if
you want it to see that next I'm taking
this glam crystals liner from collection
mm and just applying it all over the lid
this will just give it a really nice
reflective glittery effect love glares
so much so this just gives it the most
amazing look I love it and I just feel
like it really adds to the look and kind
of just finishes off the lid and gives
it a really pretty effect
next I'm just applying my lashes these
are the ILO one to six lashes and I'm
just applying them with some glue and
then taking my tweezers just to really
fit them on to my lid and then I'm gonna
be taking a Kohl pencil and just lining
my top waterline to make sure that the
lash band blends in really well to the
rest of my eye and then I'm gonna be
applying some mascara as well just to
blend my natural lashes into the false
ones too
next I'm just going to be taking the
Make Up For Ever step one smoothing
primer and I'm just going to be applying
this all over my problematic areas which
is mainly in the center of my face
and then I'm taking the ex1 invisi web
foundation and just dotting it all over
my face I want to create a nice full
coverage today but I am going to be
using quite a bit of concealer so one
layer of this foundation I feel is
enough I'm going to be buffing this into
my skin using the Real Techniques
sculpting brush
and next I'm going to be mixing together
two concealers one of them is the
Maybelline fit me concealer and then the
other one is the amazing cosmetics
amazing concealer I'm applying the
amazing concealer first just underneath
my eyes only and this is a really thick
concealer so I'm just applying this just
under my eyes and then making sure to
blend out with my finger and then with a
morphe brush and then I'm going to be
applying the Maybelline fit me concealer
on top of this and also on other areas I
would like to highlight I've been really
liking the combination of these two
together it definitely does give a
really full coverage but I really like
it to create a nice bright under eye
effect and also just to really highlight
my face nicely I just really like it I
do feel like you really need to set it
well though because it is quite thick it
needs to really be set so I am going to
be baking my eyes today I'm also taking
that morphe brush and just using that to
blend in the rest of the concealer to
and I just want to make sure this blends
in as well as I can to the rest of my
complexion
next I'm just going to be taking the max
CC loose powder and I'm going to be
using it to bake my undereyes if you
guys aren't familiar with baking what
baking actually is is just applying a
powder onto your face and allowing it to
sit for a couple of minutes or however
long you need to and this will just
really set the under eyes and also just
brighten it as well
so I just really like the effect this
gives and I feel like this really sets a
thick concealer really well and it just
brightens it really nicely so I'm only
going to be baking my under eyes so I'm
still going to be setting the rest of my
face as normal using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder and I'm just
applying this all over my face just to
set those areas and make sure that
doesn't move and I'm kind of just
tossing it away straight away because I
don't really feel like I need to keep it
on for too long so I'm just dusting it
away using a tapered brush and just
making sure to get rid of all of the
excess and that way it just makes it
look really nice and flawless and bright
and I just feel like it just finishes
off everything and I'm going to do my
eyebrows off camera because you guys
have seen me do it a million times but I
will pop the tutorial in the description
box next I'm just going to be doing a
Kohl pencil and applying it to my
waterline and also onto my bottom lash
line as well I want to create a nice
smoky effect so I'm taking that bitten
eyeshadow on a smudger brush and just
smudging out that black to create a nice
smoky effect and also to give it a
little bit of the warmth of the
cranberry color as well and then to
finish off the look I'm just going to be
applying some mascara to my bottom lash
line to make it look nice and balanced
with the top lashes next I'm taking the
max shade star contour powder and I'm
just going to be using this to bronze my
face fast and then contour also this is
one of my favorite contour powders at
the moment because it's so soft but it's
a really nice shade and it works really
well on olive skin it's not totally cool
it's warm at the same time and I just
feel like it's nice to bronze and
contour too so I'm using it on a smaller
brush just to contour and then I'm going
to be using this on my nose as well just
to contour and shape my nose a little
bit
I am also going to be taking the some of
that loose powder and just use it to
clean up my contour because I just
loving to do this recently I just feel
like it gives it a really nice sharp
effect and it just cleans up any
mistakes and just really defines the
cheekbones so I'm going to let it sit
there while I do the rest of my blush
and highlight for my blush I'm going to
be taking the NYX terra cotta blusher
you guys know that I've been loving this
and I just feel like it's a really nice
color for autumn and then I'm gonna be
taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills new
highlighter this one is in so Hollywood
it's a really nice color if you haven't
got it already I definitely recommend it
it's just a really nice soft white gold
and I just love it I use that on my
cheekbones and also on my nose and now
I'm just dusting away the powder just to
reveal a nice sharp contour which I love
and then for my lips I'm going to be
taking V no lipliner from Mac and I'm
just going to be applying this all over
my lips I'm filling in my lips and
lining my lips with this as well and
then I'm going to go on top of it with a
lipstick
the lipstick I'm using is from zoeva
this is a really pretty color it's very
similar to rebel from Mac and it is a
satin feel so I did want it to be a
little bit more matte so I am taking a
translucent powder and just setting that
and this will just kind of give it a
really nice matte effect so I really do
love to do this so guys that is the
finished look I hope that you enjoyed
