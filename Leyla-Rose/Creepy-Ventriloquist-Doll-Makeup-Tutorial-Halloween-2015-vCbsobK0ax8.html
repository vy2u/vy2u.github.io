today I'm gonna be showing you guys this
creepy ventriloquist doll makeup
tutorial I hope you guys enjoy something
a little bit more creepy and a little
bit less glam if you do want to know how
I achieved this look then just keep on
watching
so to start off I already have one brow
I already covered one up and I'm not
really experienced with this I'll show
you guys roughly what I did I applied
some prick to my eyebrow and I just kept
layering it and in between layers I was
just powdering it with a translucent
powder I did find that there were some
stubborn hairs that didn't want to go
down so I would definitely recommend
using a spoolie and just going through
your brows because I did find that it
was hard to cover so once I've layered
up some glue and powder onto my brows I
went ahead and used a full coverage
foundation this is the Mac full coverage
foundation and I just applied it
straight on top of my brow and I wanted
it to be a color that matched the rest
of my skin tone and this is the Econo
that I'm gonna be using for the tutorial
as well so as you can see there's a
little bit of brow that didn't get
covered but I did go ahead and find a
way to cover that off - I'll show you
guys what I did to do that so I just
applied that all over and then I make
sure to powder all of the foundation as
well
and here my boyfriend comes in and he's
really confused why I'm doing next I'm
justifying some of that foundation all
over the rest of my skin I really wanted
to look extremely flawless I really
wanted to look like there was none of my
natural skin tone coming through I just
wanted to look pretty much all one shade
because we are going to be seriously
contouring after and so yeah I just
wanted to make sure I had an even base
and then I went ahead and highlighted
all the areas I wanted to bring forward
with this Maybelline concealer
I'm just blending that in with the same
brush this is a morphe foundation brush
I went ahead and applied some eyelash
glue onto the areas that didn't want to
stick down don't worry this doesn't pull
out your brows as long as you remove it
correctly I still have all my brows in
tact so don't worry and I'm just
powdering the rest of my face while
that's drying just to make sure that
everything is super super matte I am
going for a wooden doll so I wanted
everything to be as mat as possible to
begin to contour I'm taking makeup geek
latte eyes shadow and I'm just taking
that on a real techniques contour brush
first of all I'm just kind of taking it
on the outer perimeter of my face so
just on my forehead and below my
cheekbone and I do go ahead and do one
side of my contour just because I was
kind of winging this and I wasn't sure
what I was gonna do so I decided to do
one side so I knew I was doing and then
I'm just kind of creating a carve on my
cheekbone and taking a mocha I shadow
from makeup geek that's really gonna
give a lot more definition because it's
a lot darker and I'm just gradually
building up that dark brown and making
sure the cheek contour turns up towards
my nostril so that will just give the
appearance of a very curved cheek and if
you feel like you're losing the shape a
little bit you can go back in with that
foundation you apply it all over and
just kind of reshape the cheekbone
because this is really important and it
definitely changes the structure of the
face and makes the face look like you're
constantly smiling so I'm just making
sure to really define that contour area
and to build up the deepness in the
outer part I'm taking some of that dark
brown on a smaller brush just to really
define that shadow underneath the
cheekbone next taking emphasized powder
from Mac I'm gonna be applying this on
the highest points of the cheeks and
this would be on the apples of the
cheeks for this case this really brings
forward these areas and really makes
them stand out again it totally changes
the structure of the face and it just
really emphasizes these areas next we're
gonna work on the nose and the hollows
of the eyes I want to create a tiny
little button nose just like a doll and
I really want to create the effect of
some
deep eyes so I'm starting off with that
latte eyeshadow again and just
contouring either sides of the nose and
also taking it up to my covered brow and
this is going to kind of change the
structure again of the face because this
is where normally our brows would be but
what we're actually going to do is apply
our brows a lot higher so we're creating
the bone structure higher than our
actual bone structure is to narrow down
the nose I'm taking that contour on
either sides and bringing it quite far
in and then to also shorten the nose I'm
taking it on the bottom of my nose
again using that maka I shadow I'm just
using it to really deepen the eye
sockets and to make them look a lot
deeper than what they actually are and I
am taking a little bit of that down the
sides of the nose as well to really
change the shape of the nose and to
really make it stand out with a small
precise brush I'm really gonna create in
very very narrow nose I'm almost
creating a little half circle on the tip
of my nose as you can see I'm just
creating the effect of a very very
narrow bridge and then on the bottom of
the nose it's a little bit more circular
and this just creates the effect of a
button nose
and then to really emphasize the button
of the nose I'm just drawing a little
line at the bottom of the nose and then
just blending this out
I've gone ahead and applied my eye
makeup on one side I did change quite a
bit of it so don't look at it too much
because I do end up kind of altering it
a little bit but what I'm doing at the
moment is just applying some whites from
the makeup forever flash palette and
then just applying a white eyeshadow
from this morphe palette and just
setting it so I'm just basically
applying it all over the lid and then we
are going to create a cut crease effect
but I do want this to be as messy as
possible as you guys know I'm very
precise with my eye makeup if I really
wanted this to look messy and because
it's scary it doesn't have to be neat so
because we want it to look a little bit
creepy creepy things on superperfect and
then I'm gonna be taking that same
makeup forever cream color and just
applying it on the bottom lash line and
just creating a semicircle and this will
just create the effect of much larger
eyes than we actually have
and I'm also gonna be applying a white
Kohl pencil to my waterline to make this
blend a lot better and then for this
part you do want to be as precise as you
can just draw a black line to outline
the semicircle we just drew and the
white usually gel liner for this just
because I do feel like I have a lot more
precision with that and then with that
same gel liner and brush I'm just gonna
be applying some super scary brows way
above where my natural brows are covered
this just again creates a really shocked
and doll-like effect you can go for
whatever brow shape you like but I
decided to go for some very thin
circular brows I also set the white on
the bottom lashline and now I'm just
applying a brown eyeshadow and smudging
everything on the lid just because like
I said I didn't want it to look neat and
I really wanted to talk really smudgy
and just really messy so just go for
whatever you want you can go over
something neat if you wanted to but I
just didn't want this to the precise I
went ahead and applied some Eldora false
lashes and then I am gonna be applying
some bottom lashes too as you can see I
changed my mind because I did have some
really long bottom lashes on but I
decided to change something a little bit
shorter applying some mascara to make my
natural lashes blend a little bit better
with the false ones and then I'm gonna
be applying these red cherry short
bottom lashes these were perfect in my
opinion because I just feel like it gave
that doll look without it being too over
the top
and then I'm just going ahead and just
perfecting some of the nose contour and
just making everything look a little bit
more perfected finishing touches really
do help so just go ahead and finish off
everything else that you need to next
we're gonna get started on the mouth
area I decided to line my lips with a
red lipstick just because when I looked
at some of the ventriloquist dolls that
used to be made they usually did have a
dark lip so I just lined my lips with
cherry lip pencil and then I went on top
of that with Gerard cosmetics a
fire-engine lipstick taking some of that
maka eyes shadow from makeup geek on a
precise brush I'm just gonna start to
carve out the moving mouth I drew two
lines coming from my mouth and then took
them downwards to create that mouth
shape it's kind of hard to explain it's
not totally a rectangle but you can play
along with this depending on how you
want your expression to be I wanted mine
to look a little bit more sad so I kind
of turned the lines downwards but if you
want to do is to look more happy then
you could turn it upwards it's totally
up to you I'd used some of the brown
just to shade inwards and then I'm
taking some black gel liner and just
going on the outside of the shape we
just drew and then I'm gonna be shading
on the inside as well just to create a
3d effect
next just taking this brown shade from
the makeup forever flash palette this is
totally optional but because I wanted to
go for a wood doll I decided to go for
some lines on the skin to make it look
like I was carved from woods you can
totally leave this if you feel a little
bit nervous if you feel like you'll ruin
it I feel like it looks good with and
without and I just feel like it gave it
a little bit more of a textured effect
and it did make it look a little bit
scarier and so if you do want to go for
something really creepy then just go
ahead and draw some random lines
everywhere going downwards so guys that
is the end of this makeup tutorial I
hope that you enjoyed something a little
bit less pretty and a little bit more
creepy this is probably the early creepy
tutorial for Halloween I'm gonna do this
