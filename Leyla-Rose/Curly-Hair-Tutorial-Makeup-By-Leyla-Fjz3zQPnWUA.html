today I'm going to be sharing with you
how I achieve my boilie miss curly hair
with extensions so to start off with I'm
going to be removing any knots from the
hair extensions using my tangle teezer
and the hair extensions that I'm using
are the Bellamy Lily hair extensions
then I'm taking my Bellamy 6 in one
color with the very smallest barrel and
this is the 18 to 19 millimeter barrel
so I'm going to start to curl the
extensions in quite small sections and
to be honest because I don't want it to
be neat as I'm going to be going by my
natural curls which I never really need
to bring lit you want to take different
sizes of sections so they don't need to
be exactly the same you don't need to be
precise and also I alternate the
direction that I do it as well so
sometimes I do it in clockwise curls and
then I'll also go to anti-clockwise and
just make it look a little bit more
messy rather than really neat ringlets
so as you can see we're getting really
really tight curls and we're going to
sort of fluff them up when we put the
extensions in the hair so you just want
to go through and do as many extensions
as you want I'm going to do 3 tracks of
extensions because I just feel like
that's enough for me but depending on
the thickness of your hair you may wanna
go for more or even less also it depends
on your curls as well so if you have
tighter curls than this you can take
smaller sections and if you have larger
more full curls you can go for larger
sections or maybe go for a larger barrel
but because my curls are fairly tight
but not extremely tight this is the
ideal barrel and size for me
so this is what the whole track looks
like once it all has been cold and next
we're going to get started on our
natural hair so I have already washed my
hair and I have brushed it through with
my tangle teezer while I still had my
conditioner in and this just got our all
the tangles and then I threw it up in a
towel and I just allow it to be in the
towel for five minutes just to draw out
the excess water then what I do is just
take the towel out of my hair and then I
just tip my head upside down and then
the next step is going to be applying
some cold cream into my hair I'm using
the Bed Head on the rebound
caryl cream and I absolutely love this
because it's just so good to create the
nice curls that we want and it just
prevents fred's as well so I just like
to sort of scrunch that up in my hair in
an upward motion and also just sort of
separate it through my hair as well to
separate the curls and I just saw
scrunch it upwards and fluff it around
everywhere and then what I like to do is
take my hair dryer and put it on the
lowest blow setting but the higher heat
setting and just start to dry the ends
first and what I like to do is just sort
of crunch upwards and then blow dryer
and then just do this all over the hair
the reason why I like to do the ends
first before the root is because I just
find if I do the root first it gets too
frizzy
so I'm just going to carry on doing the
same step as before next I'm going to be
applying my foxy curls hi-def coast
right into my hair and I just like to
spray this all over and I just like to
make sure that it gets everywhere
because this prevents the hair from
going frizzy and it just makes the curls
look nice and define
and then what I do is turn the setting
of my hairdryer up so it's a higher blow
setting and then it just blows out more
air and it makes the hair look nice and
volume is
and then I turn my head back upright and
I just like to spray it a little bit
more spray into my hair and then I like
to blow-dry it again just to make sure
the hair is nice and dry and then I
carry on with the scrunching motions
because I just feel like that helps to
the hair to be really nice and curly as
well so obviously this is how my hair
turns out but this might not be the
exact same result for you it's obviously
your hair type might be a little bit
different so do bear in mind that so it
might not look exactly the same but it
should help your hair to look curlier
than normal
just keep scrunching and just keep
fluffing the hair everywhere and I just
feel like when I do that it makes the
hair look nice and volumous and fluffy
the aim of this is not to look neat so
don't worry if it doesn't look neat so
this is what my hair looks like when I
do not have any extensions in obviously
the length of my hair does go quite up
because my hair is so curly and the
curls are quite tight it does scrunch up
so this is why I like to apply my
extensions I do usually wear my hair
without the extensions but when I want
it to look longer this is what I do so I
take the hair extensions that we
previously called and I just section my
hair around my ears and it doesn't need
to be neat because the hair is curly
it's going to cover up where we do it
anyway so I just section out and pin it
and then I'm going to take the hair
extension and just clip it onto the
section of hair that is left behind
from when we section there
and I do the middle clip first and then
need to outer clips on the outside then
I just release the hair and then I'm
going to apply the rest of the
extensions the other two extensions I
apply I do on either side of the head
just so it looks more natural and you
can't see where the hair extensions
begin or end to be honest this ends up
being just a little bit longer than my
hair and a little bit more volume mist
so it doesn't look really unnatural and
very very long and so it does look
really natural still no one can never
really tell that I've got extensions in
and that's the kind of aim that I want I
just want to add a little bit of length
and a bit of volume so I'm just doing
the other side and just clipping that in
next I'm going to be applying my batiste
dry shampoo in dark brown and I'm going
to be applying this to the roots before
I back home and I'm just using this
teasing comb from Avon and I'm just
going to be teasing the roots of my hair
to give it a little bit more volume at
the top just so that it creates more of
that body in the top of the half
and the next what I like to do is just
separate the calls of the extension and
just sort of fluff them up so it looks a
little bit more natural and not so sleek
because obviously you want it to look
more natural so that is the end of this
