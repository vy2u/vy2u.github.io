today I'm going to be sharing with you
guys a very very highly requested video
this is my skincare routine that I am
using it currently and my skin has
transformed lately and ever since it has
you guys have been requesting a skincare
routine this is how my skin looks about
three months ago and it was pretty
severe my spots were getting kind of out
of control I had quite bad blocked pores
and now that has totally changed so I'm
gonna be sharing with you guys the
products I have been loving and just my
skincare routine that I have been using
that has helped to transform my skin so
my skin in this video is actually not at
its best usually it's a lot even clearer
than this but it did have a little bit
of a breakout but regardless if you guys
would like to see my skincare routine
then just keep on watching so the first
thing I'm gonna be doing is tying up my
hair because I don't want my hair to get
in the way whilst I cleanse and I'm
actually not wearing a lot of makeup
right now and I'm not wearing anything
that's waterproof or hard to remove so
I'm actually just gonna be using my
cleanser to remove all of my makeup even
my eye makeup so if I was wearing
something a little bit harder to remove
I'd maybe use an eye makeup remover or a
makeup wipe but nothing special next I'm
gonna be taking my cleanse and polish
hot cloth cleanser from Liz all and I'm
just gonna be applying that into my
hands rubbing it around and applying it
onto my dry skin and this is really
gonna pick up all of that makeup I like
to massage it in and really make sure
that it's moving about all of the makeup
so it's picking everything up I also
apply this onto my eyes as well because
it's super gentle I'm then gonna be
taking my Liz Earle muslin cloth and I'm
just gonna be taking that I'm running it
under some hot water not so hot that you
burn your skin but you do need it to be
quite warm so that you open up your
pores and you can really cleanse your
skin and I'm just gonna be running that
all along the skin just to pick up all
of the makeup and to really cleanse and
just remove everything from your skin I
definitely feel like since I've been
using this this is where my skin has
started to look different recently even
you guys have noticed I use this
cleanser in the morning and I also use
it in the evening and I do two cleanses
in the evening unless I am exfoliating
my skin like tonight
and I am going to be using the gentle
face exfoliates at from Lazar this is
just a really nice gentle exfoliator
exactly what it says on the bottle I
like to use a scrub exfoliant like this
three times a week because I do suffer
with blocked pores and this definitely
helps to prevent that so once I've done
that and massage it onto the skin I like
to remove it with the same cloth with
warm water again just to remove
everything from the skin and that means
we're ready for the next step next I'm
just gonna be taking the pixie glow
tonic and this is basically like a
liquid exfoliant I like to apply this
onto a cotton pad and just apply this
all over the skin what it basically does
is help to go within the pores and
dissolve any excess sebum or makeup
that's lying within the pores this has
helped to remove all of those little
bumps I get underneath this skin but it
can be quite drying so I only use this
once a day and then after that I take my
Liz all instant boost skin tonic and
this is probably my favorite part of the
whole day this is just an instant boost
of hydration especially after I've used
that pixie glow tonic this really helps
to instantly hydrate my skin and just
really restore all of that hydration
after I've heavily cleansed my skin I
use this toner in the morning before I
apply my makeup at nighttime and then I
also apply whenever my skin is feeling
dry or dull even on top of makeup next
I'm just gonna be applying my serum this
is the Ren Omega 3 optimum skin oil
serum and I like to apply this onto my
face just before moisturizer to give it
a little bit extra hydration to kind of
penetrate deeper in the skin and then
finally the last step is going to be
applying my moisturizer this is the Liz
Earle skin Repair moisturizer and this
is so light and moisturizing it's
amazing it's meant specifically for
people with oily skin or combination
skin that stuff up with breakouts like
me this moisturizer is definitely ideal
for me because of how prone I am to
breakouts and blocked pores and I like
to apply this in the morning before I
apply my makeup and I also like to apply
it in the evening as my nighttime
moisturizer so guys that is the end of
this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed seeing my skincare routine if
you are new to my channel I'd highly
recommend you go and look back at my
previous videos so you can see how bad
my skin used
be the skin texture how many breakouts I
had it was pretty bad and I'm really
happy with where my skin is out and I
know it's just gonna get better and
believe it or not this is probably one
of the worst skin days I've had in a
while but I'm still happy with it
because it's a lot better so guys if you
did enjoy don't forget to Like and
subscribe and I will see you all in my
next one bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
