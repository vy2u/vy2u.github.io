to be a star you make me wanna act it
rich another woman we walk you make me
wanna run circles around so glad that
around if you wanna play more manly you
make me want to be hey everyone and
welcome back to my channel today I have
a makeup outfit and hair videos for you
today whether you are going out with
your friends or your significant other
it totally doesn't matter this work is
perfect for any kind of night time look
and I try to keep it as universal as
possible to try and suit as many people
as I could forget to subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already and give
this video a big thumbs up for more
videos about makeup hair and outfit all
together because I thought it'd be so
fun to just do everything in one video I
honestly loved filming and editing this
so I really hope you enjoy it so because
this is a date night obviously we want
to pamper ourselves before so I put on
an eye mask from Sephora and I also had
a hair treatment in my hair I've washed
that out now and I'm just leaving my
hair in a towel for the remainder of
this video for my skin I'm just taking
some of the glam glow glowing
moisturizer and applying this first
before I apply my primer I'm taking the
NYX angel veil primer just to prep my
face before foundation and this is a
really nice primer this is actually my
first time trying it and it's really
smooth I really like it for my 8 color
correcting today I'm taking the master
camo concealer palette from Maybelline
and just using the green shade over all
of my redness because unfortunately I've
been having a few little breakouts
recently I haven't had the greatest diet
so that's probably why and I have been
picking out my spots that you should
never do such a bad habit so I'm just
covering those up and going in with
foundation so I'm mixing together my
Urban Decay all nighter foundation with
a little bit of the Stila
I forgot the name of this I think it's
the stealer at quickly foundation I've
just mixed them together because the
almighty can be a little bit too drying
on my skin so this just adds a lot of
hydration for me and because this is a
date night obviously we want this to
stay on so that's why I did close to
this foundation but you've got dry
skin and you can't work with this
foundation I definitely recommend maybe
putting a moisturizer or moisturizing
foundation visit with this next to prime
my eyes for eyeshadow I'm taking some
concealer which I always do just because
it blanks out all of the color of the
natural eyelid and then I'm going to be
saying this with the power but just so
that it doesn't move next I'm taking me
morphe 35o palette which I love and I'm
taking this really light peach tone
shade and I'm going to be using this a
very light transition shade you can
barely see on my skintone but this is
just going to help all the other colors
blend this is my next transition color
and this is going to be kind of that
next tone in the crease really the eye
should it looks like I'm going for is
very very simple I just want to go for
something all matte and all Brown I just
want the colors to blend up really
smoothly so I'm just gradually going
into another darker shade applying that
into the crease and then it's going to
get darker and darker as it gets more
down just as it looks like a nice smooth
transition I'm also going to be applying
this color onto my lid as well before I
do I want to apply some dark dark brown
hose into the outer corner just to add a
little bit of length and smokiness to
that outer corner this will just make
everything look a little bit more kind
of cat eye light and I'm going to be
applying a thick line of winged liner so
this just complements that but like I
said the main color of this look is that
crease kalaiy applied before this
because I'm also applying this onto my
lid also I want to make sure this is
super blended out and once it is we're
going to be moving on to applying some
concealer on the rest of my face usually
I like to do my eyes first because we
didn't go crazy with the eye shadow
today I could just clean it off with a
bit of concealer like what I'm doing now
gives you the concealer to kind of shape
the eyeshadow a little bit and also of
course applied concealer around the rest
of my face I'm just saying that into
place because otherwise it will crease
and then I'm going to move back to the
eyes and then this is in a little bit of
a weird order but this is genuinely how
I would get ready for a date night so I
wanted it to be realistic for my
eyeliner I am taking the bodyshop pen
eyeliner and I love this so much I'm
using this to sculpt out the shape and
I'm creating quite a thick wing because
I want it to be all about the wing but
also of course when is the ground to
keep through nearly eyeliner as well and
to actually fill in the eyeliner and
taking the NYX
that liquid eyeliner because this is
amazing and it's so black so that's why
I decided to use that I'm taking the
certified certified dreamy lashes and
just popping them onto my top lash line
so volume is so perfect I love it it
just went so well with this I like so
I'm obsessed with deep lashes all right
you guys it's genuinely a miracle I'm
doing my eyebrows on camera for once
because I wanted to show you guys pretty
much the whole process of my makeup so
I'm taking my uh Nastasia brow definer
to fill in my brows and I honestly will
love this I like to go for this one I'm
going for something a little bit softer
compared to when I use my actual brow
Wiz because it just gives a little bit
more of a just like a soft diffused
color rather than it be really intense
so I create my perfect shape and then
just brush through them to make sure
everything looks soft I also went
through with the UH Nastasia clear brow
gel and I also went underneath with some
concealer too I know this is very quick
if you want a more intense video on how
I do my eyebrows I will leave a video
down below but this is pretty much how I
do my brows the majority of the time I
used to chop the products but this is
why I use today moving back in with the
face now I'm taking this bronzer from
ELF
and using it all around the outer
perimeter of my face I'm using this as a
bronzer / contour product because I
don't really want to go for anything too
heavily contour but it is a really nice
warm bronzer shade but also kind of
sculpts the face as well so I don't
usually like to over contour my face
this is perfect for me I'm just using it
in all of the areas I would like to
appear more sunken in and then I'm just
taking the makeup geek kathleenlights
highlight palette and taking the
lightest shade and using this on the
tops of my cheekbones I wanted this to
look really glowy because I'm going for
a red lip and just highlight it's
amazing I love it
to finish off the eyes I'm taking the
some of the makeup geek nude has been
applying that to my waterline and then
finishing off the eyes by taking some
more brown eyeshadow on the bottom lash
line blending it out and finishing off
with some mascara everything is very
simple and neutral because obviously
with this look and wearing a very
statement lip and then you guys will
also see in the outfit my choker is a
very statement piece as well so I wanted
everything else to be relatively
Paul but ghulam at the same time you
don't have to have super minimal eyes if
you're going for a red lip you just want
to make sure that it's not too OPP and I
think this is a really nice amount so my
hair is obviously wet so at this point
so I went and dried it and straightened
it off camera because it's very long to
show that on camera I have shown you
guys a few times before by just
straighten my hair and just made sure
they look nice and sleek and straight
but wasn't entirely sure what kind of
look I wanted to go for with my hair but
I think we looked amazing I tend to go
for a middle parting mature at the time
and I wanted to do something different
but I really like the way that it looks
so I ended up sticking with it and then
for my lips I'm taking the dark red
Illamasqua lip liner and just using that
all around the outer part of my lips and
over lining of course as always just
going around the outer part because we
are going to be creating sort of an
ombre effect I am taking the dose of
colors Merlo liquid lipstick which is
one of my favorite Reds and I'm just
applying this in the centre first of all
and then I'm going to be taking my lip
liner again and just applying it on the
outer edges and blending it inwards to
create that ombre effect I just love the
way that this looks I think it looks
stunning make me want to be a song you
make me wanna act it with another woman
we love you make me wanna run time so
glad that I found if you wanna play mom
and if you wanna be
because we could do dinner run one at
the government jewel but that's awesome
the outfit I decided to pack together
today was something that was all black I
didn't want it to be too casual by also
didn't want it to be too over-the-top
and just think this has such a fun but
romantic look to it of course I wish I
could show you guys a lot about the
options so this is one I feel like you
can play around with I feel like this
would sue a lot of different people and
it's very broad you can swap things out
