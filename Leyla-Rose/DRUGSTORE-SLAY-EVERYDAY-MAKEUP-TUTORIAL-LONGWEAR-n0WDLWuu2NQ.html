- today I have a stay all day tutorial
using only drugstore products this is
such a universal makeup look it's going
to suit a lot of different types of eye
shapes and our skin tones there's a
really universal look you slay as you
wear it but it's also going to slay all
day because it's a long lasting tutorial
so it's hopefully going to last on you a
really long time using the products that
I picked from the drugstore only and I'm
so happy with the way that it turned out
this is make a look that I created it's
just a really nice kind of Instagram
inspired makeup look I hope you guys
enjoy it if you do then just get to
smash a big thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already I'm
going to be posting a lot more on sorry
I've been m.i.a I had a better meltdown
in life but I'm back and don't worry I'm
here if you have any other video ideas
they want me to sell and be sure to
comment them down below is there
anything else I want to say I don't
think so just enjoying this tutorial
kick back relax and make a shopping list
because you're going to need to get a
lot of these products because they're
all amazing products that you need to
create this makeup look and once it
wears I got Pinochle
okay guys the first thing that we're
going to be doing is moisturizing as
always and I'm going to be priming my
skin with Q primers today the first one
is this glow we won from seventeen and
as you can see it's super glowy I really
love using this when I'm using a really
matte foundation because it just makes
things look a lot more skin like and
then to ensure that things stay on
because this is a sleigh all day
tutorial I'm going to be applying the
NYX matte like mattifying primer and
just using that all along my face mainly
focusing it on the t-zone we're all
going into foundation and the foundation
we're using is the L'Oreal infallible 24
hour along that scared at this point I
was like oh this looks light but it does
oxidize a little bit and ended up
looking just just right when it was
blended in so kind of had face with it
and just kind of kept going
slide it with a brush and then I went in
with a sponge just to make sure that all
of the excess taken off because I find
that with really matte foundation it can
be necessary to go on top of it with a
sponge just to make sure it looks less
cakey and this foundation does have the
tendency to look cakey prefer applying
extra on the areas where I need it
rather than just a lot of foundation
everywhere
so next moving on to my eyes I am
priming my eyes using this Maybelline
concealer and I actually took the little
sponge butt off just okay I don't know
it got a bit gross so I'm just going to
take it off so that's why it looks a
little different I just used that as my
eye primer and I made sure to set that
into place before going in with our eye
shadow palette I'm taking the bomb meat
ador palette and I'm festival just
taking this shade right here as our
first transition shade and I'm just
learning this into the crease I want to
go for something that's all matte on the
eyes today it's actually a really simple
look I'm just taking a fluffy blending
brush and applying the first shade just
into the crease just to create a little
bit of that shadow of the crease of kind
of extending outwards and then I'm
taking this warmer more kind of its kind
of like a burnt yellow shade and we're
going to be using that in our outer
corner as well just to deepen this color
and as you can see I'm just going up the
color and it's just creating that really
nice effect in the crease and then I am
taking this Brown right here and this is
going to be our outer V color and I just
like to apply this in that outer V area
just to give it a little bit of
smokiness and definition but nothing too
crazy because we are going to be going
for a really bright color on the lid so
I really not really bright but really
kind of wiped color so I don't it to be
too dark I don't want a contrast to be
too much compared to the two so making
sure that's all blended before moving on
now I'm in love with this color
I find that matte light colors are quite
hard to find that a really pigmented and
as you can see this is just insane so
bright and we're just going to be
creating kind of a semi cut crease with
this it's just amazing because I didn't
even need to put concealer underneath
this to make the cut crease pop even
more but I just love that it's soft but
it's a cut crease at the same time so I
really like it but I'm going for
something that's a little bit more of a
half shape because I stop when it gets
to the little half point of my eye and I
make sure that it blends in next just to
clean everything up under my eyes I'm
going to be taking some more of that
Maybelline concealer without the sponge
on it I'm just using my sponge to blend
it in and just kind of clean up the edge
I don't wanna go for anything too sharp
but the concealer really just helps to
define that shape on the outer corner of
the eye and I find it hard to continue
on with a
as I've done this which is why I did it
now and then of course to prevent
creasing I'm going to be setting that
using the remote six and Matt powder
this is a really nice affordable powder
but the only thing is that I applied it
quite a bit of it and I can see on
camera that it makes it look a little
bit brighter so I would say that it
might flash back a little bit but it's
still totally worth it and I didn't find
that in pictures it likes flash back a
lot but just so you guys know I still do
love the powder though and then also for
my eyeliner I took the multi London
eyeliner pen and just created my
standard wing and then I went on with
lashes these are the Koko Goddess lashes
and I know these aren't from the
drugstore but they're so amazing and I
just could have not use them so if you
guys have any recommendations of lashes
that are like these then please let me
know these are also like the house of
lashes iconic as well if you have
anything from the drugstore that you
know like this then comment down below
is applied some mascara this one is from
L'Oreal just to make all my lashes blend
in to the false ones sorry guys but with
my eyebrows takes a while so I'm going
to pop a eyebrow tutorial in the corner
for my contour i am taking the NYX
contour sticks and I'm first of all
taking this one in a lighter shade and
just using this to kind of act as a
little bit of a bronzer but I am going
to be applying a slightly darker one
just to deepen the very deep areas of
the contour with that and then I'm just
blending that in with my Real Techniques
sculpting brush and just blending in and
making it look all nice and seamless and
I've been loving to cream contour lately
I would never a cream contour person but
I can't seem to contour without it
lately and I'm just loving the way that
it looks I'm going to be setting that
bronzer using this one from a Rimmel and
just going around the outer perimeter of
my face I really like to look bronzed I
feel like it makes me look really
healthy with my skin tone so I make sure
I'm nice and bronzed and then I'm going
in with the balm for Halle mama just to
contour their cheek bone area and just
to make sure that those kind of areas
sink in a little bit more and then for
my highlight I'm taking this one from
NYX this is a cream highlight and I'm
just going to be blending this in with
my sponge and I did go over this with a
powder highlight as well it's not
necessary but because I'm going for a
little bit of an Instagram kind of
tutorial I wanted it to be really
intense on the highlight so I used an
eyeshadow from ELF just on top of this
to really intensify that glow
and then to finish off the eyes I'm not
doing anything crazy just applying some
of that brown on to the bottom lash line
just to make it look a little bit more
kind of balanced compared to the top and
the bottom just blending it out really
really well and then I applied some
white eyeliner from it NYX on to the
waterline to really open and brighten my
eyes and then I did apply it mascara
onto the bottom lashes which is
something I don't usually do but for
this look I was like hey why not let's
apply some mascara and I really liked
the way it looked it kind of reminded me
of a little bit of a doll inspired look
like a like a little doll you know then
for my lips I'm going to be taking the
Rimmel cappuccinos that liner this is
one of the best lip liners from the
drugstore out there it's just my
favorite so I applied that all over the
outer perimeter of the lips over lining
of course because it's Leila of course I
do
and then I took some of the new remote
max liquid lipsticks and I applied it in
this beautiful nude shade all over and
just made sure it blended well with the
lip liner and then to make sure that I
do slay all day I applied some fixing
spray from NYX and this is the matte one
and that is the finished look guys I
really hope you enjoyed this look if you
did then don't forget to smash a big
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if
