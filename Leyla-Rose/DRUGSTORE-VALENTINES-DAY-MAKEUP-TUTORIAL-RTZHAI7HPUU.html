channel today I have a drugstore
valentine's day makeup tutorial i
honestly love this look my skin probably
was at its worst today so obviously it
shows that it's got good coverage and
yeah i really like the way that this
looks and of course it's all drugstore
so if you don't to see it just keep on
watching so the first thing that we're
gonna be doing is priming and I'm using
the angel veil primer from NYX and this
is really nice it kind of look a little
bit white on the skin though so
definitely try it to apply not too much
especially if you're a deeper skin tone
just because it may look a little bit
like whitened on the skin and so maybe
just keep it quite minimal so I just
applied some of that and then I took
some of the remote color correcting
palette and I just took the green and
just went all over my skin because it's
just probably at the worst it's been
the texture was so bad and the redness
was so bad and also it's just super
painful as well so yes just wanted to
cover up that redness using the green
color concealer and then I am going to
be using this super stay foundation from
Maybelline I actually really really like
the formula of this foundation it covers
really nicely I did use a brush that was
quite soft though so it kind of just
like spread the product evenly so it
didn't kind of just like pack too much
product on at once so I did feel like I
had to go over a couple of areas with a
little bit extra coverage but like I
said I do think that it's because of the
brush that I was using but it's a really
great formula and it definitely does
last a really long time so yes I just
applied a little bit more onto my cheek
areas and just was sure to Pat that into
the skin just to build that coverage on
those areas next I'm going to be priming
my eyes and I am using a color tattoo
from Maybelline to do this as you can
see it's quite pink toned compared to my
skin it's kind of like painterly
paint-pot from Mac but I just blended
that in with my finger and then I set it
using this NYX eyeshadow palette I just
used a light matte shade and just used
it all over the lid just to set that
that cream eyeshadow into place so now
our eyes are nice and primed I'm gonna
be going in with this color first of all
and just using that in the crease
firstly but I'm gonna be taking this all
along to the lid I would say that this
eyeshadow look is quite simple it can
get a little bit messy but
long as you have a makeup wipe at hand
it's okay and if you are really worried
about fallout and stuff like that you
can do your foundation after you do your
eyes I do usually like to do that but
for the sake of this video I did my
foundation first so I just applied that
color all over my lid as well and then I
start going into the deeper colors to
create this smokey eyeliner that we have
going on I wanted it to look more like a
cat eye rather than eyeliner
specifically so as you can see I'm kind
of like blending each color up into that
first color so there is no definitive
lines the only real line that we have is
on the side of our eye everything else
is quite blended so as you can see I'm
just building up that Brown and then I'm
going in with a dark dark brown and just
applying that as close to the lash line
as possible before we apply our eyeliner
and then the eyeliner is kind of gonna
be smudged into place and like I said
you can go in and just like wipe the
sides if it gets a little bit messy I'm
using this eyeliner from maybelline this
is from the Gigi collection and I'm just
using it on the lash line and then using
a small brush to blend it it's actually
a really simple eye look it's not too
hard to achieve whatsoever you just need
to use a lot of blending motions and
just kind of like smudging it and just
really taking your time and I did use a
bit of a black eyeshadow to help aid in
making this look nice and blended and
again going back in with the makeup wipe
to make it look nice and smooth I just
applied some mascara to my top lashes
and then I applied false lashes just
because I really feel like false lashes
add so much to a look like this it just
goes so well with a smoky look so I
applied some lashes and I really feel
like it brought the whole look together
for my concealer I am taking the NYX HD
concealer and just using that under the
eyes I really love this concealer the
coverage is so good it always makes my
under eyes look so bright and I just
used a beauty blender to blend that
next I want to be setting my skin and to
do that I am using the soap and glory
one heck of a blot powder and that's
just going to be just like an all-over
set just to set my foundation and my
concealer and then I'm going in with
some bronzer from Rimmel this is their
I've forgotten the name of this I think
it has Sun in the title but this is just
a really nice natural bronzer it's a
good natural Sun something like that as
you guys know all the products will be
listed down below as always and then I
went in with some of this bronzer from
ELF I've had this for ages and it's just
one of my go to drugstore bronzers it's
just such a nice tone it just has such a
nice amount of warmth in it I'm just
applying that on my forehead and under
my cheekbones
for my eyebrows because they are in real
need of a pluck right now I'm just going
for something supernatural I'm taking
some of this NYX tinted brow gel and
just running it through them and as you
can see actually creates a really nice
brow shape because my brows are already
quite full already but then just to add
a little bit of extra to it I am gonna
be taking this NYX micro brow pencil and
just drawing in a couple of hairs on the
inner corner underneath just to define
that line and then also on the arch of
the brow as well for my highlight I'm
taking this Maybelline master chrome
highlight I have to be quite careful
because of my skin texture this just
adds that pop of glow and I love it so
I'm just applying that onto the tops of
my cheekbones to finish off the eyes I'm
just running some black liner through my
waterline and that's pretty much it I
didn't want to go too crazy with the
bottom lash line for this just cuz I
wanted all of the attention to be on the
top lash line and then for the lips I am
taking this NYX suede lip pencil in this
red shade and I was initially gonna go
for a bright red and that's exactly what
I did once I lined my lips I went in
with a remote stay matte liquid lipstick
and it was really red but it was just a
lot so once I had done it I was like I
want to add a little bit of pink to this
so once I had seen how bright it was I
went on top with a Body Shop matte lip
paint and it was in a little bit more of
a pink shade and this just added a
little bit more of that subtlety to it
like it's still bright but it just adds
a little bit of that pink hint to it and
I actually really like that so this is
the end of this tutorial guys nice short
and snappy I hope you enjoyed it please
