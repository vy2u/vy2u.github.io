so today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial on this look that I'm wearing
right now this is so unbelievably
gorgeous and I'm so happy I did this
this is basically like a double cut
crease with a little glitter effect it's
really it looks quite intricate but it's
actually not too too hard and it was so
fun creating this I used a lot of warm
colors and I just really really love
this it gives such a nice cat eye look
and I just think it'll be so nice for a
really like important event like if you
want to look really dressed up I don't
know this is just so stunning and I
think it's a really nice play on the
cat's eye and I like that it's kind of
almost a double cut crease like it's a
cut and then has another cut so I really
like it and I'm so glad I did this mega
tutorial is mainly focusing on the eyes
but I also showed you guys some of the
face as well but the majority tutorial
kind of just shows the eyes because the
face is quite basic and I'm really
excited as well because I did do a video
on icon UK's channel on an ariana grande
and makeup look and I love the way that
video came out as well so if you do want
to check that out I'll link it down
below I'm so excited you guys to see
this look this is just I think one of my
favorite looks I've created thumbs up if
you like dramatic makeup looks because I
never know whether to go for dramatic
stuff like this obviously I enjoy them
but I don't know if you guys enjoy
seeing them so let me know if you want
to see more stuff like this but yeah if
you guys do want to see how to achieve
this makeup look then just keep on
watching stip again I'm gonna be priming
my eyes with some concealer and this is
a cream concealer from Kiko and I'm just
applying it with my fingers all over and
applying a relatively thick layer to
kind of cover up all the natural colors
of the eye and I'm just setting that so
that it doesn't move the first color I'm
going to be applying into the crease is
makeup geeks
latte I believe and I'm just going to be
applying that into the crease first of
all and the way that we're going to be
doing this is basically how I would
normally apply things into the crease
still starting with the lightest shade
and gradually getting darker but I do
tend to take things up a lot higher so
as you can see I'm taking things very
very close up to the brow because we're
going to be creating a crease that goes
a lot higher than usual so in that case
the crease color has to be higher than
usual also just kind of layering this
color to make it look nice and opaque
and I'm taking it up high and also
go outwards towards the tail of my brow
- then I'm taking makeup geek Coco bear
eyeshadow which is one of my favorites
and I'm taking that on another blending
brush and applying that into the crease
and again I'm starting off quite close
to where my natural crease is but I am
going to be taking this a lot higher
than I normally would I'm just making
sure to blend that in really well to the
color we applied it previously and now I
am taking a makeup geeks americano which
is like a dark purplish Brown
and I'm taking that on another blending
brush and just taking this into the
deeper part of my crease again it's a
lot higher than I normally would this is
sitting just above the crease and I am
extending this outwards towards kind of
the tail of my brow and starting to
create the shape that I want to achieve
just making sure that everything is
really well blended and going back in
with that previous brush and just going
back and forth between brushes to make
sure it's a nice transition between the
Browns next taking this eye base from
NYX this is in a pure white shade I'm
going to be taking this on a flat brush
and this is going to be our guide into
carving out our cut crease so what I'm
going to start to do is basically apply
this all over the lid and then we're
going to take this color and basically
use it to create the cut crease shape so
I'm just taking it along my natural
crease and gradually creating that shape
that I really want and I'm taking it
above my natural crease so when I keep
my eyes open and look straight forward
this shape does come above that and I am
extending it towards the tail of my brow
but it does come out words a little bit
more as well it doesn't go sort of
upwards it's a little bit more straight
next taking this sleek matte palette I'm
going to be taking two shades from this
palette I'm going to be using the mattes
white and also the matte cream first of
all just taking the matte white I'm
going to be applying this on the inner
third of my eye this is just going to
kind of set this white eye base that we
used and also really brighten that area
and then I'm going to be taking the
cream shade and we're going to be
applying that onto the center of the eye
just to act as a little bit of a
transition because we are going to go
into a darker Brown and then into a
black so we want to kind of have that
transition
so I'm just taking a makeup wipe and
cleaning up the sides of my eye this is
kind of crucial because I feel like this
really changes the whole shape of
everything so I really like doing this
so I highly recommend it and then this
is the intricate part in my opinion this
is where it gets a little bit hands-on
and can take some time this is where I'm
creating my double cut so I'm kind of
just creating a little bit of a V and
leaving a tiny little gap in between
that cut crease that we created so
there's this tiny little like two
millimeter gap and I've just created a
little V on the outer corner and then
I'm just filling this area with a little
bit of brown I'm not taking it all the
way up to that V because we are going to
be filling that with black and this is
definitely something where it's
self-explanatory you kind of have to see
it being done but yeah I'm just taking
some of this black shade from makeup
geek this is corrupt from makeup geek
and I'm just taking this on a smaller
brush and then applying it onto the
outer V and as you can see it's starting
to come together it does take a little
bit of blending it's a little bit of a
process but we get there it's a little
bit intricate that's probably the
hardest part to make everything a little
bit more glam I'm just taking some
glitter from lit cosmetics and just
applying this onto that area that we
left free this just makes everything
look a little bit more glam you can skip
this if you want it to be a little bit
less than this I suppose I feel like
this really adds something special to
the look and I love this I'm also just
applying some more liquid liner just to
make the outer corner look really nice
and dark and I'm going to be blending
this out with some more of that black
eyeshadow and then I will be taking this
same black eyeliner and creating a line
along my lash line just to make
everything look a little bit more
dramatic and also to have a line for the
lashes to sit on also
for my lashes I'm applying my favorite
lashes I just felt like they fit so well
with this look these are the House of
lashes iconic I'm applying some of the
scar just to make them blend in a little
bit better and then I'm going to be
moving on to my face I'm kind of
speeding through this because like I
said in the intro it's kind of a simple
face because I really didn't want it to
be over the top I want it to be all
about the eyes and it's a face that you
guys have seen before so I'm just
applying some strobe cream as a primer
and then taking my ex1 invisi wear
foundation and just buffing this all
over I really like this foundation
because it's very just the coverages is
really flawless and I really really like
that I'm also just taking some LA girl
Pro concealer and I'm just applying this
under my eyes to brighten and conceal
and I'm just blending the in with the
Real Techniques sculpting brush to
Brunn's and give my skin a lot of color
I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer and is in the shade dark
chocolate and I'm just applying it on
the outer perimeter of my face just to
give myself some bronze also applying
the Too Faced candlelight glow onto the
tops of my cheekbones just to give
myself some glow and then I'm gonna be
doing my brows off-camera so I will link
the tutorial down below to finish off
I'm just going to be applying some gel
eyeliner into the waterline just cuz I
feel let this look kind of suited a
smoky finish on the bottom lash line so
I'm just applying it into the eye into
the eye onto the bottom lash line also I
kind of created that inner corner flick
to really make it look nice and feline
like I think that fits really well with
the whole theme of this look and I'm
just applying it onto the bottom
lashline because I am going to smudge it
and I felt like that looked a lot better
than it being a harsh line so I'm just
taking some eyeshadow this is the Coco
bear shade and just using it to blend
out any harsh lines and to make it look
more smoky and to finish off of course
I'm applying some mascara
to finish off the whole look I am lining
my lips with a cold toilet liner from
Mac it's just a really nice dark brown
shade and then to fill in my lips I've
got to be using the la splash liquid
lipstick and shade innocent vixen like
I've said previously I really wanted
everything on the face and lips to be
really really simple so that's why I
went for nude just because I felt like
all the attention could be on the eyes
and yeah I'm obsessed with the way that
everything came out so guys that is the
end of this makeup look I really hope
