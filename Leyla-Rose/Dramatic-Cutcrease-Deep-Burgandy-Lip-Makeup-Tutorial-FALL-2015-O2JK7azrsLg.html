today's makeup tutorial is going to be
this dramatic plum cut crease look and
this deep burgundy lip
get started I'm gonna be taking my
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm
actually gonna be using this as my eye
primer today I'm just gonna be rubbing
it in with my fingers from my lid all
the way up into my brow bone this is
just a lighter option rather than an eye
primer I'm gonna be setting it with a
powder just because this will ensure
that it won't move and it just makes
sure that it will stay matte then for
the eye shadow palette I'm gonna be
using the Naked 3 palette from urban
decay and taking this a mapped pinkish
brown shade I'm gonna be taking this as
our first transition color this is just
gonna make the rest of the purple colors
we apply blend a lot easier and this
will just kind of make you all look
really nice and flawless
so I'm just taking that on a big fluffy
blending brush and just applying that
into the crease just making sure that
it's really well blended and I'm kind of
extending outwards to kind of lift it up
my eyes a little bit and to give us that
nice elongated cat eye look and then I'm
gonna be taking sketch eyeshadow from
Mac and I'm gonna be using this as our
next shade in the crease I'm gonna be
taking this on a shader brush and then
taking the point of that shader brush
I'm gonna be using that to sort of
define the cut crease and I'm gonna be
blending out that shadow with a blending
brush and going back and forth into that
color depending on how dark you actually
want it to be I'm going back and forth a
few times just to make sure that it's
really well blended and also to make
sure that pigmentation of that purple is
really nice and deep
and then I'm gonna be taking this color
right on the end of this pallet it's
kind of like a shimmery popularly black
color I'm gonna be using this as the
darkest color today just to give it a
little bit more definition and just to
make it look really nice and deep and
dramatic you can totally skip this step
if you don't it to look as dramatic as
mine this is a very dramatic eye look so
to kind of cut it down a little bit you
can skip the black and to kind of just
keep it to the purple next I'm gonna be
taking soft ochre paint from Mac and I'm
gonna be using this to sculpt out and
clean up and that's how we get that
really nice defined cut crease look you
just want to make sure that you clean up
the area that you really really want
this is the easiest method to do a cut
crease in my opinion and it's just
really easy you just take a brush you
feel really confident with and just
gradually build up go higher and higher
until you're happy with how high that
cut crease is sitting as you can see
mine is just sitting just above where my
crease naturally is
to set and to brighten that paintball
I'm going to be taking this off-white
shade from that native 3 palette and I'm
just gonna be patting it all over the
lid just to mattify everything make sure
that it stays in place and as you can
see it does brighten it a little bit as
well again you can totally go for a
different color if you wanted to be less
dramatic I know this is quite bright but
I wanted to go for something quite
dramatic today so you could go for
something shimmery as well but I wanted
to keep it matte and what I'm going to
do as well as just clean up these sides
of the eye just to clean it up and to
make it look a lot more precise on the
outer corner and this just makes
everything look a lot more neat next
we're gonna get started on that wing of
liner I'm gonna be taking my L'Oreal
super liner pen and I'm gonna be kind of
sculpting out where I want my eyeliner
to go I wanted to go for quite a thick
wing today I do have a tutorial more in
depth on how to get your winged eyeliner
to be perfect so I will link that down
below for you guys if you do want to see
that tutorial
and I am going on top of it with the
bomb Schwing aligner just because this
is the blackest eyeliner I own and it
just kind of deepens everything and it
just makes everything look a lot neater
and a lot blacker next I'm just gonna
apply my false lashes as always these
are the ILA one to six lashes I'm gonna
be applying them with some tweezers and
then just applying some mascara
afterwards to make my natural lashes
blend into the false ones I didn't want
to go for anything too thick on the
lashes today because I wanted it to be
all about the makeup and I wanted you to
be able to really really see the
eyeshadow and the eyeliner next I'm
going to be priming my face with the
Olay moisturizer and primer two in one
I've been really loving this primer
recently it's really really nice it
really hydrates the skin and it also
Prime's at the same time which I really
love
then I'm taking my tx1 foundation this
is an e-collar
F 300 and I'm just gonna be applying
this all over my face in little dots and
then I'm going to be blending it out
with this same brush I always used this
is the Real Techniques sculpting brush I
absolutely love this brush to blend in
my foundation I just feel like I get
starching flawless finish were there
it's so quick and it's so easy so I
absolutely love this method of blending
in my foundation
I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyebrows
off-camera but if you do want to see how
I do my eyebrows I will link the
tutorial down in the description box for
you next I'm just applying my concealer
and I'm applying it in all the areas I
usually like to highlight this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer it's my
favorite you guys know that by now and
I'm just blending that in with the Real
Techniques sculpting brush again and
also the Sigma 3d HD precision brush
just because I love this brush I can't
live without it and it's just the
easiest thing for me to blend in my
foundation and concealer
once that's all blended and I'm gonna be
setting those areas with these soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder this is the
best powder ever in my opinion I
absolutely love it and I'm just setting
all the areas where I applied the
concealer and just making sure that it's
really well set so that it doesn't move
and it looks nice and flawless next I'm
gonna finish off the eyes I'm taking
some black pencil and applying it to my
waterline you can totally go for a white
or a nude if you join it to be as heavy
as this but like I said I'm going for
the whole thing so I went for black and
I'm gonna be applying some gel eyeliner
on the inner corner this is the Inglot
77 liner and I'm taking you tiny little
liner brush and just creating a little
feline flick on the inner corner this
does make things a lot more dramatic so
again if you want to turn it down a
little bit you can totally skip this
step but this does create a lot more
drama to the eyes so yeah I'm just
running that along the bottom lash line
as well this will just add a little bit
of definition down there before we apply
the eye shadow I'm just taking some of
that sketch I shadow and just running it
on the bottom lash line just to make
things look a little bit more balanced
and awesome just to soften the liner as
well
and then I'm finishing off with some
mascara this is the Mac mineralized
mascara and I'm just applying a nice
thick coat of this to my bottom lashes
to make sure that they look nice and
full just like the top ones
next I'm going to be bronzing my skin
and I'm taking the Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour care and I'm taking the
color Havana and I'm just gonna be using
this to bronze my skin basically all
over I didn't want to go for anything
too much because again there's a lot
going on on the eyes and I'm gonna be
doing a bold lip as well so I'm just
going for a little bit of bronzing
around the face and I'm just gonna
basically leave as that I'm gonna apply
a little bit of highlighter apart from
that I'm just keeping it quite simple
I'm taking this banana shade from the
contour kit also and I'm just running it
underneath my bronzer a little bit just
to add a little bit of shape to my face
this will just give the appearance of a
more contoured face without actually
having to contour so this just gives my
face a little bit more structure and
then I'm also just contouring my nose a
little bit just because I feel like I
kind of needed it with this look and
then I'm applying some highlights it to
the tops of my cheekbones this is the
laura geller gilded honey highlights and
i'm just applying it on all of the areas
I want to appear a little bit more glowy
and then finally for the star of the
show in my opinion this is the night
moth liner from Mac and I'm just running
this literally along my lip line and
then I'm gonna fill in my lips with this
as well this is a very very very dark
lip pencil it's almost like a very dark
wine color so if you don't like anything
this dark I would recommend either going
for vino from Mac which is more like a
reddish wine color it's a little bit
lighter than this or current which is
more of a purple they are both a lot
more natural than this this is almost
like a Blacky purple like it's really
dark so I'm just gonna fill in my lips
with this also and make sure you hydrate
your lips beforehand otherwise this
won't glide on
I did apply a little bit of lip balm
before I did this just because it does
make everything slide on a lot better
but the color is dark is this you do
want to clean up the edges because any
mistakes are very visible and then I'm
just going on top of that with a little
bit of Max in lipstick just to add a
little bit of a reddish tint to it so
