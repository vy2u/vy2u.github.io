showing you this dramatic liner and a
vampy lip tutorial I'm really really
loving this look and I can't wait to
wear this for the autumn time I think
it's really really easy to achieve and
it just England clothes a lot of
eyeliner so the first step is going to
be applying our primer this is the Dior
heir flush CC primer and I'm really
loving this at the moment it's really
soft and natural so I'm just applying
this all over my skin it's you perfect
before my foundation application and
next I'm just going to be buffing in my
foundation as normal it's my normal
matchmaster foundation and yeah I'm just
buffing that everywhere
I'm using this eBay brush again and I'm
really really loving it I'm gonna try
and find the link of where I bought it
because it's so so cheap but it's really
really good so I've really been loving
it for just quickly applying my
foundation
next I'm just filling in my brows and
I'm using my brow bar to go by walking
lightening to just fill out the hairs
and to give myself more of an arch I
will leave in the description box my
discount code again so that you can
receive a discount on this product and
all over the website so yeah just
filling through my eyebrows as normal
and I'm now applying my eyeshadow primer
this is the benefit stay don't stray as
usual and just applying this all over
the lid and this is gonna make all the
eyeshadow and eyeliner it stick to my
eye and make sure that it doesn't move
so I'm just rubbing this in with my
finger then I'm going to be applying
this gold Kiko eyeshadow all over the
lid this is really nice because it's
really similar to whisper and guilt by
Mac so I like to use this as a highlight
as well so I'm just applying this all
over the lid and I'm keeping the
eyeshadow quite natural today because
we're using so much eyeliner so I'm just
using it for a little bit of shimmer
then I'm going to be using uninterrupted
by Mac and this is just a really nice
yellow toned Brown and I'm applying this
into my crease just very small amount of
definition and these are the only two
eyeshadows that I'm actually going to be
using so I'm just using a big fluffy
blending brush to just diffuse this all
over the crease area now I'm going to
take my gel eyeliner and begin the
eyeliner that I'm using is really good
because it doesn't dry too quickly and
it still has a little bit of mobility
that's why I sometimes don't like to use
the Inglot one because it just dries way
too quickly and I feel like there's not
much you don't have a lot of time or is
this one you can take your time a little
bit with it so what I'm doing is I'm
just carefully going over my lash line
gradually building up a line that just
rims the top of my eye
and the brush that I'm using is a really
really small detail brush and this is
from zoeva I will write everything down
in the description box but it's really
really small so I found it really easy
to do the detail work and I find that
when I'm doing a an eyeliner there it's
a lot easier to gradually build up
thickness rather than going straight
into it cuz I feel like if you go
straight into it a lot of the times
you're going to most likely go wrong so
if you just gradually build up it just
prevents yourself from going wrong and
having to fix it so once that's all over
the lid I'm going to start to drag out
the tail of the eyeliner so I'm just
going to align the line with my bottom
lash line and drag it outwards so I'm
just pulling that towards the tail of my
brow and this is obviously quite
dramatic so if you're gonna have it a
little bit smaller you can do so and
then I'm just going to begin to connect
the line to the rest of the eyeliner of
my lid
and I'm just going to very gradually
start to thicken that
I'm not also going to drag it outwards a
little bit further so it's also almost
going to be at the same place of where
my eyebrow tale ends and then I'm going
to thicken it once again so I'm just
very gradually going over and over it
making it thicker and thicker each time
rather than just taking big chunks and
making it too thick too quickly and I
just feel like it always ends I'm more
successful when I do it that way so I
just gradually go over it it also helps
to be looking straight into the mirror
as well so if you can see I always sort
of look straight into the mirror every
now and again and that just means I can
see where my crease is opening and stuff
like that that way our wing doesn't get
lost in the crease next I'm going to be
doing the inner corner of the eye liner
and I'm basically just going to be doing
a little triangle that sort of Arabic
triangle on the inner corner and I'm
just dragging that inwards on the bottom
lash line so I've just basically connect
the bottom and the top by a little
corner and then I am going to be
dragging that the line all the way to
the end tail and that way every single
line that we've applied all connects
with each other
so as you can see them just slowly going
underneath my lash line and going to be
connecting that inner corner with a line
to the outer corner and again I'm just
going to very very slowly gradually
thicken it next I'm just going to be
using that same eyeliner with the same
brush and putting that onto the
waterline and this is just going to give
it further definition I also went ahead
and applied my lashes I applied some on
the top and the bottom and I felt like
it just gave me more definition
so both lash dolls will be written in
the description box below now I'm just
highlighting seven areas of my face I'm
highlighting under my eyes my Cupid's
bow and my chin and I feel like this
just helps my face shape to look more
shapely so I'm just rubbing that in with
my finger and the highlighter that I'm
using is the light boost by Mac I've
been absolutely loving this lately I
used to use it a lot but recently I've
just fell in love with it all over again
just rubbing that in with my finger I'm
patting it and also swiping it
then I'm just going to be bronzing
this is the Bobbi Brown bronzer in
golden lights and now I'm taking Bahama
Mama to contour and I'm taking that on a
smaller contouring brush and just
applying it to the hollow of my cheek
then I'm gonna take that same eyeshadow
I put on my lid and using it as my
highlight it's a really really pretty
color and it's meant to be a dupe for
Mac Whisperer girl it's not quite the
same but I can see where people are
coming from when they say that's a joke
it's a very similar color I'm just gonna
apply a little bit of that to my Cupid's
bow next I'm gonna take Knight Moss lip
pencil by Mac and just apply this all
along my lip line and I'm also going to
be filling in my lip with this as well
so I'm just going to be going along my
lip line and just gradually fill it in
this lip pencil is a really nice dark
purple and the sort of look I wanted to
go for was a very dark wine color so it
ended up going on top of this with a red
lipstick so you'll see in a sec so once
I've applied that lip liner all over it
feels really dry like this I know loads
of people love applying a lip liner all
over but I can't stand just having a lip
line I had to put a lipstick on top of
there because it's very dry on its own
but I really did like this color on its
own to be honest and it's really nice so
I'm gonna take fire-engine by Gerard
cosmetics and I start to apply it to the
center of my lip and that also gives a
slight gradient effect but I'm gonna
start to sort of rub my lips together
and create a really nice dark pub the
red wine color
so guys once your lipstick is on your
look is complete it's definitely
something a little bit different
considering it's all about the lips and
the liner but it's definitely something
that everyone can try so don't forget to
comment like and subscribe guys thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in the next one thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
