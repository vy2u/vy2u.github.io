going to be sharing with you guys a hole
that I recently done I realized it had
been a little while since I had done a
hole and a lot of my old Halls used to
be Matt calls and a lot of the more
higher-end makeup so I done a little
hole at boots which is the kind of
American equivalent to like CVS or
target and then kind of places this is
basically a drugstore haul and I wanted
to share with you guys because the
majority of the products that I had
bought our products that I've never used
before and I think would be kind of good
to share with you guys the kind of
products that I'm going to be using in
the next couple of weeks and stuff and
if there's any reviews that you guys
want to see and yeah I just really
wanted to do a haul so I hope you guys
enjoy this video if you do and see what
I picked up at boots then please just
keep on watching so I done a nice little
hole at boost recently I've just been
kind of going through the makeup I've
already got it was kind of nice to just
buy a couple of things and just see what
else was out there and I've kind of gone
into stuff that I would have never
really picked up before so I'm really
excited and yes let's just get straight
into it it was 342 on eyelashes so i
picked up the three boxes of ashes I got
the Eyler volume number 100 lashes and
they just looked like this have volume
but they're quite natural at the same
time usually I like to buy these lashes
to stack up I'm actually going to be
using these in a tutorial because I want
to show you guys how I like to customize
my own lashes and a couple of you guys
wondering what that basically is and
what I basically do is I stack up loads
and loads of individual lashes in a
certain way to create my favorite style
of lashes so that's basically what i'm
going to be showing you in a tutorial
that will be coming up very soon and so
i'm going to be using these for that but
these are just a really nice natural
lash style and this is just really
pretty I did get a box of the pro lash
individuals from either and this is the
fine too full and they basically have
loads of fine little lashes and then on
the other end they have loads of full
lashes and they have them in all sorts
of different lengths and stuff so that's
this one and yeah I really like the
individual lashes they're nice on their
own as well but like I said I do like to
use the
to apply on top of strip lashes to kind
of customize their own style also i
bought the katy perry punk princess
eyelashes from isla also and these were
very very natural you guys I'm going to
be seeing these in the box I'll try and
show you but it's already going to come
up but these are really really natural
they kind of like the ardell demi
wispies but even more natural it kind of
has that that wispy effect but they are
much much lighter so I did stack these
up with another pair so I can't really
show you guys these ones thing these are
really great for someone that was maybe
looking for an eyelash that's very very
natural especially if you've never kind
of worn eyelashes before it literally
looks like someone's natural lashes so
these are really really great for
someone that isn't too fond of applying
thick eyelashes and also i bought the
biore free your paws charcoal pore
minimizer and this is new I have never
seen this before and you guys know that
i do have oily skin and i do tend to
struggle with my paws being blocked
that's one of my main problems i got a
lot of blocked pores on my forehead on
my cheeks and on my nose and they just
don't like to go away so we have only
used this one since i bought it i just
used it last night so I don't have a
review on it yeah why do a review on its
if you guys do want to see a review on
this then comment down below basically
an exfoliator and it's black so it has
that kind of charcoal feel to it and it
says that it gently exfoliates and deep
cleans to instantly reduce the
appearance of pores thankfully my paws
aren't very large so I really have a
problem with that but it's just to
really get out all the gunk from my
pores I just haven't found a product
that really gets all the stuff out
really really well I had do have
products that help it but I haven't
really found something that I really
really love so I'm trying this out to
hopefully see if it worked I mean you
can't really tell by one wash but I
guess it's doing ok i will do in review
on this if you guys want to see it but i
did buy this and this was only 599 which
really isn't bad at all so this is
exciting and i'm looking forward to this
and this was the only skincare kind of
product that i picked up so picks up
another BB cream and this is the dream
bronze bb-8 in one beauty balm sunkissed
glow perfecta and this has
SPF of 25 and it is in the color medium
to deep medium and this is very dark for
me at the moment this is more when I get
a tan and it's also to mix into another
BB cream that i own i mentioned this in
my april favorites but i did mention
that it is too light for me this would
be fine in the winter but i am fairly
tanned at the moment just because i have
been self tanning and this is just too
light for me so i'm basically going to
be mixing these two together and because
they are kind of the same in the sense
that they have the 18 one formula i
thought would be good to kind of mix
these together so that is why i actually
got it in the darker shade the other
shade was gorgeous as well so i might
pick it up in the normal shade too but i
think it in the darker shade just
because i wanted to mix these two
together because this at the moment i
can't really use unless i mix it with
something cuz it is way too light for me
and but yeah i'm really excited i also
picked up another foundation which i
haven't tried yet i wanted to see if you
guys wanted me to do one of my first
impression fridays on this so again
comment down below if you want to see a
first impression of this but this is the
Loreal infallible 24-hour matte
foundation and i got it in the color
honey and the reason being is because
i've seen so many youtubers raving about
this this is kind of like the foundation
of the moment so i really wanted to pick
it up and i got it in the darkest color
they had which was honey and it isn't
really that dog but i think it's going
to match me know if not it won't be a
little bit like but i think it should be
ok but i'm really really excited to try
this this is very very mad and I've kind
of been in Turing matte finish at the
moment but I'm really excited to try
this just because it says that it's 24
hours and I'm just excited because I
want to be able to use this in the
summer and I've been just been looking
for another good foundation and it would
be great to have one from the drugstore
so excited to try this I picked up some
lip line is because I'm looking to
broaden my lip liner horizon I only use
next at the moment and mac and then I
have like one Jordana one so I got four
lip liners from Rimmel and I'm really
excited about these because two of them
are retractable and you guys know that
my craze for lip liners are retractable
lip liners I love when they lip liners
retractable i'll tell you the ones that
i've got i got cappuccino and vice these
are the normal sharpening ones and i
will just
oh this cappuccino is what I'm wearing
on my lips at the moment and I can
actually say I'm in love with deck but
the formula is great is very very creamy
other one is spice it this kind of
reminds me of sore but just a little bit
less pink and has a tad more orange in
it but it is very similar and I'm very
impressed with the formula of these they
feel very creamy and the coverage is
great what I find about a lot of drug
store lip liners is that they just kind
of feel like they're really scratchy and
they don't really come off as well and
the coverage isn't as good but as these
are amazing the other two is addiction
and East End snob and these ones like I
said are the retractable lip liners and
what I love about these is that these
are a little bit more nudie so these are
going to be a lot lighter than the other
ones and I'm just in love with these one
is kind of like a beige nude and then
the other one is like a pink nude and I
also want a bit concealer crazy because
you guys know I absolutely am in love
with concealer at the moment that is
what I have been loving to try so I
bought five different types of concealer
which I know is not necessary but I'm
just really interested in kind of trying
new types and just trying different ones
for highlighting and just highlighting
under the eyes and stuff and there are
so many good ones in the drugstore and I
just tend to go to drugstore stuff much
more than I like to go for high-end
stuff so I'm really excited to try these
two of these I've tried already and then
the other three I haven't so the two
that I've already tried is the
Maybelline fit me concealer in number 20
I use this in practically every single
tutorial because it's one of my favorite
concealers it's one of the best
coverages and the best formula it just
glides onto my under eyes and it just
works perfectly for me and the number 20
is a really nice yellow undertone
whereas the other two colors that they
have a thinker 15 and 25 the two pink
for me whereas 20 works perfectly so I
love this to got the Maybelline instant
anti-age a razor I perfect and cover
concealer these I have gone through
about two of these already in my
lifetime and this is my third one I
haven't used this in a while and then I
was searching through my concealers just
to see what I had and then I found an
empty bottle of this and I was like why
haven't i repurchase this because I
remembered how much I actually love this
and I am in love with this I'm really
excited to start trying this again
because this just diffuses light so
perfectly on your face and just in the
past like six months I haven't used this
so I'm really excited to start using it
again I tried to use a little bit more
of what was left in my old package and
there was nothing left so I was like I
need to repurchase it and this i'm
really excited as well so those two i
have already used and then the next
three i have never used before says the
collection illuminating touch
brightening concealer and i got it in
the lightest shade which is naked one
and this is kind of like the maybelline
dream lumi touch kind of likely twisty
pen and i got it in the lightest color
but it is very very pink almost like a
salmon in color and I didn't expect it
to be that dark it's not dark is still
brightening but I expected it to be very
very light so I'm probably going to be
using this to correct my under eye
circles when my eyes are a little bit
darker I don't necessarily suffer from
dark circles but when I do have more of
a tired today they do appear darker so
this will just be more of a corrector
for me and then I also got the
collection lasting perfection of ice
cream I also got the collection a
lasting perfection ultimate wear
concealer and this promises do have a 16
hour wear which is a big promise ring in
the colored media warm and someone rave
about it and in this area I really like
to use a concealer that I know isn't
going to crease because I just have
these two lines they're really fine that
always like to crease so when i get a
concealer that doesn't crease I like to
apply just under the eye and then I can
use whatever I like on the highlighting
part of my face and the last concealer
is from soap &amp;amp; Glory this is the
tricking my last concealer latinboyz the
trick and treatment under eye dark
circle concealer it's a special yellow
tone that helps to hide blue and purple
under-eye circles that's the thing i
don't really understand because the
powerful tones usually you'd like to use
more of a pink salmon tone so I don't
know I mean I want to use this for the
highlighting part because it said
specifically it was a yellow tone and
for the yellow babies I know that how
hard it is to actually find yellow turn
to the drugstore I mean it's like
completely almost impossible sometimes I
can barely ever find a yellow tone so
when I saw this I was like
I'm excited this is in the color bright
on and when I took this out to swatch it
I realized it had a luminescent to look
and I just got really excited because I
knew I wasn't going to be using it for
the really under I bet I want to use it
to highlight this kind of triangle part
to really give us that cheekbone effect
and when i swatched it I realized that
it has almost impalas infect so when you
blend it in it kind of has a light
reflecting feel and it's very light
coverage I'm very excited to use this
like I said on these areas this was 9
pounds which is kind of expensive for
drug store even the truck still getting
more and more expensive as time goes on
i think is i just love the boxes so
anything the soap and glory box is just
the best they're so cute it was 342 on
the other soap &amp;amp; Glory products so I
wanted to try some of these so the last
two products are the kick ass kick ass
ask gasps gasps it's really weird sing
in a weird English accent don't bug
glory kick ass it's open glory kick ass
instant retouch pressed powder and this
is totally translucent and almost
weightless and it says that it has super
blur and 3d camouflage I saw coach your
beauty talk about this and it does have
a really pretty yellow undertone which I
love I am excited for this so I'm gonna
let you guys know what you think like I
said I've been obsessed with what
concealer and setting powders recently
so I'm really excited to try this
because I want to see if it actually
works and if it doesn't already nice
brightening effect when I do swatch it
it does look fairly translucent but it
looks slightly brightening so I'm
excited to see how it looks and
photography and stuff like that and then
because it was through 42 and I got to
the check out the lady told me and I
like run back to go buy something else
and I need a new eyeliner because am I
the bomb one is slowly running out so I
wanted to get a new one and I thought
I'd get another pen and I didn't realize
how thick this actually was so I might
need to buy another one that's a little
bit thinner but this is the super cat
liquid eyeliner pen is the steel
eyeliner and this is again from soap &amp;amp;
Glory it doesn't really say anything
else this is basic
you just like cat eyeliner pen and it
just creates a really nice thick line so
I don't know how it's going to be for
creating a thin flick but I am pretty
excited to try this just generally when
I do my eye makeup when I do it with a
smoky eye or something but if you do
want to create a thin line I wouldn't
recommend it because it does actually
have like an actual felt tip look it's
not very thin so guys at the end of my
