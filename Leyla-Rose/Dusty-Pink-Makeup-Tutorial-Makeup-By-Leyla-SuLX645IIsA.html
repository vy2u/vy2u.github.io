channel today's makeup tutorial is going
to be on how to achieve this dusty pink
so guys before we begin I just want to
tell you guys know that my eyebrow
tutorial will be down in the bottom bar
because I do have them done already I
also have one eye down so we're gonna
get started
onto the next one so I'm gonna start off
by priming my eyes as always with my
soft ochre Paint Pot I always do this
because it just makes all the eye
shadows stand out so much more then I
will be taking the Sigma eyeshadow in
passionfruit and this is a matte pink
shade and I'm gonna use this as my first
transition shade and I'm using a big
fluffy brush and just start to blend it
into the crease just to make sure that
all the other colors are blend really
nicely and this is also going to give
our eyes that little pop of that dusty
rose shade next I'm going to be taking
frappe which is a makeup geek eyeshadow
and I'm gonna be applying this into the
crease with another blending brush and
I'm just gonna kind of use this to go
back and forth and I'm gonna be applying
this into the outer corner and also on
the inner corner as well because we want
to create a kind of halo effect around
the eyes you just want to make sure to
blend this really really well and just
use lots of blending motions to make
sure this blends really well because
it's going to prepare it for the next
color
next I'm gonna be taking maca from
makeup geek also and I'm gonna be
applying this with another brush this is
a little bit more of a detailed blending
brush and I'm gonna be applying this
into the outer corner and I'm also gonna
be applying this into the inner corner
again to create that halo effect around
the eye so I'm just applying this and
blending adds I apply it and then we're
gonna go back into that other brush
afterwards to make sure that it blends
even more just keep blending with that
brush at the moment and try and keep it
as close to the crease as possible and
try not to blend it up too far next I'm
gonna be taking that blending brush that
we used before to just try and blend out
that color as much as we can we just
want to make sure our colors really well
blended
next I'm just cleaning up these sides of
my eye to make sure that it looks nice
and clean and crisp I'm taking the Sigma
open sesame' loose shimmer this is like
a loose pigment and it's like a really
nice rose color and I'm gonna be
spraying my brush with fix+ before I
apply it to the brush because this will
just make everything stand out a lot
more and it's also just going to make it
go on a lot smoother and more foiled
like so I'm just applying it onto the
lid with a synthetic brush and I'm just
making sure to Pat it very gradually
onto the center of my lid only so I'm
not taking this to the inner corner or
on to the outer corner because that will
affect the brown eyeshadow we put that
just before it you just want to keep
packing this on until you're happy with
how thick it looks and then I'm gonna be
taking some glitter this is the Sigma B
which glitter and I'm just gonna be
patting this on top of it and this is
such a gorgeous glitter it just gives
the most amazing effect and I'm just
gonna be patting that on top with the
same brush and I did spray this brush
with fix+ again just to make sure that
it all sticks really well then I'm gonna
be applying my false lashes these are
the Vegas nay Grand glamour lashes from
ila these are so gorgeous they're so
fluffy and like crisscross see they're
really nice they're not usually lashes I
tend to go for that but they go really
well with this kind of look so just
applied them and then I'm applying some
mascara to just make sure they blend
really well into my natural lashes
because I'm not applying any liner you
want to make sure that your lashes don't
sauce check out so you just want to make
sure they stick to the false ones
next I'm gonna be taking my natural
radiance primer from Mac and I'm just
gonna be applying that all over my skin
to hydrate my skin and also just prep it
for any foundation we're gonna apply
then I'm gonna be taking the L'Oreal
infallible 24 hour matte foundation and
I'm using this in the color honey and
I'm just gonna be applying this all over
my face and then I'm gonna be blending
that in with a Beauty Blender and I'm
just gonna be bouncing this into the
skin this is a really good foundation at
first when I was applying it I was kind
of like oh this doesn't look good but
once it sets into the skin it actually
looks amazing so it's really nice you
just got to kind of give it a chance
so I'm just bouncing this into the skin
and I did feel like a lot of the areas
wasn't covered I needed to be covered so
I did go on top again with another
little layer on the areas that are
harder to cover like the just the areas
on the center of my face I'm just again
blending that in on the center of my
face with my Beauty Blender next I'm
gonna be applying my maybelline fitme
concealer onto all the high points of my
face
I'm using it under my eyes down the
sides of my nose to narrow my nose down
also onto my forehead the bridge of my
nose and also my chin
and again I'm just gonna be blending
that into my skin with my beauty blender
next one will be taking my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush and I'm gonna be using
this to blend in all the concealer under
my eyes and on the corner of my eye just
to make sure that we blend it really
really well and that way we can get into
all the little areas that you can't
reach with the beauty blender
next I'll be setting my under eyes using
the Mac CC neutralized powder and also
this tapered brush from Sigma and then
I'm gonna be brushing away that powder
in a sec I'm not losing a lot of powder
because I didn't want it to look too
heavy sorry I have just applied in and
I'm almost instantly brushing it away
we're just using whatever's excess on
the brush to set the rest of my face
next I will be taking a Kohl pencil and
applying it into my waterline and this
is just going to smoke out that bottom
lashline and this just really creates
that look the bottom lash line is really
smoky so I really like the effect that
this gets I'm also gonna be applying
this underneath the lash line and just
kind of running it in-between the lashes
I am gonna be blending this out with
some eye shadow so just taking each
smudger brush you just want to kind of
smoke this out you don't really need to
be too neat with it just take some
eyeshadow I'm using the frappe color and
I'm just kind of using it to smudge this
color as much as I can and then I'm
taking a bigger fluffier brush and just
kind of using it to smoke out that
bottom lash line even more again like I
said it doesn't need to be neat next
time we'll be taking some mascara to
kind of finish off the whole look I
really like the way a lot of mascara
looks on the bottom lash lines you want
to really volumize your bottom lashes
next I'm gonna be bronzing my skin and
I'm using the mineralized skinfinish in
dark and I'm just applying this all
around the outer perimeter of my face
I'm not gonna be contouring today
because I'm kind of just overall
contouring a little bit like I just kind
of feel like I don't know I'm not too
crazy for it recently because I just
kind of feel like it can be a little bit
unnecessary like you just don't need it
all the time
so bronzer for me is enough today
and then I'm taking the Gerard cosmetics
highlighter in Lucy and I'm just going
to be applying this on to the high
points of my face
and today for the lips I'm gonna be
taking a remote retractable lip liner
this one is in East End snob I'm just
gonna be lining my lips with this I'm
not really gonna be filling in my lips
because I actually have a lipstick that
totally matches this lip liner the
lipstick is from Gerard cosmetics is
probably one of my favorite lipsticks
from them it's one of the newest ones
it's called vintage rose and it's just
the most gorgeous pink shade it's like
this rosy pink and what usually crazy
for rosy shades but look at this it's
Charlie matte as well which I absolutely
love and it's just so gorgeous I just
know I'm gonna be wearing this so much I
absolutely love it so guys that is the
