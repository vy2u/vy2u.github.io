channel so today I have a makeup
tutorial for you guys and I'm gonna be
showing you how to achieve this easy but
really affordable makeup look that is
perfect for this time of year I created
this really nice golden toned eyeshadow
look which is really easy to achieve
using the 17 easy on the eye palette and
as you can see the colors in this
palette are beautiful they're really
simple neutral and I think perfect for
any time of the year it's a really nice
step-by-step look that's very achievable
and very easy to create especially if
you're a beginner and it also paired it
with this berry lip which I thought
would be really nice this lip is
definitely stepping outside of my
comfort zone I love how it all ties
together and I really hope you guys like
it as well video is in collaboration
with seventeen and boots and it is so
cool to be a part of the seventeen squad
I really really hope you guys like this
video that I've made with them and yeah
let's just get on into the video okay so
to get this look started I'm gonna be
taking these seventeen skin Wow
three-way highlights are and I want you
gonna be using this as a primer this is
really nice because it adds a glow
underneath your foundation and because
the foundation I'm using today is quite
a full coverage matte foundation I do
want to make sure that my skin it looks
like it has a really nice glow
underneath it so I'm just rubbing some
of this in between my fingers and just
applying this evenly on my skin well I
really like about this is that it's not
a really obnoxious glow it looks really
natural and luminous and underneath your
foundation this would look so lovely you
could also mix this in with your
foundation is wok you want it to make it
look glowy within the foundation or you
could just apply it on sort of like a
little areas that you want to highlight
as well but for me I want a full-on glow
underneath my skin to really give it
that nice glowy texture for my
foundation I'm gonna be taking the same
time up to 25 hour foundation and this
is a really nice full coverage
long-lasting formula which is really
good because I have oily skin so I'm
just dotting this on my skin and then
I'm
be blending it in because it's a
relatively full coverage foundation I
want to start off quite thin and then if
we need any more we can build up as you
can see that one layer did it's so good
at covering up pretty much everything so
all I need to do now is just apply it a
tiny little bit more just on my
problematic area so just where I have
some scarring so now that I have a layer
of foundation all over I'm going to be
moving on to your priming my eyes for my
eye shadow I'm gonna be using these stay
time 18-hour concealer and I'm gonna be
using this as my eye primer I'm just
going to be using a really small amount
of this and just popping it on my
eyelids and blending it out that way I
should have something to stick to and it
would just look really nice and flawless
underneath that eye shadow next moving
on to a show and this is one of my
favorite parts just because I love I
shadow so much I'm gonna be taking the
17 easy on the eye palette in the shade
birthday suit and this palette is only
absolutely stunning like look at the
shades I think these shades are so
perfect for every day or you can dress
them up as well for something more of an
evening wear but the colors are really
simple so if you're a little bit afraid
to dive into eyeshadows this palette is
really really nice as 8 powder shades
and then it also has 4 cream shades as
well which i think is amazing something
that I really love about this palette as
well is that it does come with a little
card inside that has all of the colors
numbered which is amazing it's almost
like painting by numbers which is so
simple to do especially if you're a
beginner so if you don't know quite what
color goes where this does come inside
the palette and also on the back all of
the colors are numbered so you know
exactly which one they're talking about
so I think that's really really cool and
I think that's really nice if you're a
beginner so we're gonna start today by
taking cool rose which is number 5 and
we're gonna take this into the crease
because it's a matte shade and that is
perfect for the crease this way it just
adds a little bit of dimension and I
really really love this nice rose shade
I think this is really nice for this
time of year
so just kind of build up in my creased
and just making sure I'm blending it
really really well
next I'm going to be taking baked
chestnut which is such a autumn kind of
name you might love that that is number
eight and I'm just gonna be taking this
and applying it on the outer corner of
our eye so right on our lid I'm just on
the outer corner I'm going to be taking
this cream shade right here and this is
called a bud copper which is number ten
and I'm gonna be taking this and
applying it right on the inner half of
my eye and this is really gonna make
that in a corner pop so I'm just going
to be patting this on and because it's a
cream it's gonna be really really
intense then I will be taking number
four which is radiant gold and I'm going
to be patting that on top of that cream
shadow to really make it pop
it's a clean up my eyeshadow and also to
brighten my undereyes I'm gonna be
taking some more of that stay time
concealer just going to be dotting that
one to my under eyes and I'm just gonna
be blending that out and setting it add
some extra definition onto my eye I'm
gonna be applying some winged liner and
I'm gonna be taking the 17 lacquer liner
and I'm gonna be using this to create my
way brush on this eyeliner is so super
thin so it's really easy to create a
nice thin line one of my favorite ways
to express myself is through my eyeliner
so I'm definitely gonna be creating a
little more of a bold wing today and I
absolutely love the way that a bold wing
looks with a nice golden toned eyeshadow
my lashes I'm gonna be taking these
seventeen dole top mascara and I'd love
this because it has a plastic brush
these kind of ascaris are my favorite
types of scars to use and then to add a
teeny little bit of definition onto my
bottom lash line I'm just going to be
taking these soft smudge pencil in
Makkah and I'm gonna be applying this
right on the borderline I'm just leaving
it as it is like this creates a really
nice almond shaped eye on my eye shapes
I like to leave it that but you can
totally go and apply some mascara onto
your bottom lashes if you feel like it
next I'm going to be taking these
seventeen brows that brow kit so just
taking some of the wax from the palette
and just applying it into the brows
first of all
then I'm taking some of the powder and
just applying it on top of that and just
filling in my brows lightly it's a
little kit there's this little brow
pencil that is just so adorable I'm just
going to be thinking a little bit this
I'm just applying it to the bottom arch
of my eyebrow all my brows into place
I'm going to be taking the clear
definition and mascara and you can use
this for your eyes all your eye brows
but I'm just gonna be running this
through my brows just because my
eyebrows are really curly so this just
kind of allows you to brush them through
and it just looks a little bit neater
but none of my eyebrows are done I'm
gonna add some bronze enos to my face
I'm gonna be taking these 17 instant
glow light bronze and I'm just gonna be
applying this onto my cheek area taking
it up to my temples and then also
applying it onto my forehead then for
some glow I'm going to be taking these
17 instant glow gold bronze shimmer
brick and I'm gonna be taking the light
shades from the top and just using them
as a highlight I'm just gonna be popping
these on to the tops of my cheek Wow and
finally for my lips I'm gonna be taking
these mega matte lipstick in the shade
for your world I'm not exactly sure if
that's how it's pronounced I'm just
gonna be applying it all over for a nice
berry tones this is the finished look I
just love how beautiful and simple it
was
even though how affordable every single
product actually is I'm really happy I
got to do this collaboration with boots
in seventeen and I really hope you guys
