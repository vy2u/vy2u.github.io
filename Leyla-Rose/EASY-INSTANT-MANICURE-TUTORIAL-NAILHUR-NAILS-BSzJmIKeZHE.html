channel today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to totally transform your nails
into a perfectly manicured nail look in
a very small amount of time today I'm
gonna be using the nail her press-on
manicures I absolutely love these nails
they come in so many shapes sizes colors
styles so many to choose from
I recently wore the square ones and I
painted them my own shade and I just
absolutely loved them today I decided I
wanted to be a little bit more lazy if
you're like me and you tend to mess up
on the painting your nails you can go
for the ready-made painted ones today
I'm going for these sweet pink ones in
the square Leto shape there are more
pointed towards the end and then as it
gets to the end it kind of squares off
so this is a really popular style at the
moment and they're my favorite style to
wear the box has everything that you
need so I'm just gonna open it up and
show you guys what comes inside the box
so as you open it as you can see you see
some nails at the front there are nails
to suit the majority of nail sizes which
is amazing
I have very wide nail bed and I always
find something to fit me it comes with a
nail file nail glue and also lots of
different sizes like I said even more
underneath just so if you have smaller
nails or larger nails they will have
something to fit you which is amazing so
why I like to do first of all is first
of all try and find something that's
gonna fit my now I like to make sure
that the nail covers all of my nail bed
and we can kind of shape it a little bit
to fit it more securely afterwards as
you can see I just like to place it into
the nail bed see how much it fits and
just make sure that it totally covers
the whole nail bed and then I like to
take the nail file that comes with in it
and then I like to kind of file around
the bed of the false nail to create the
shape that fits my nail the best I have
more of a rounded nail bed but these
nails tend to have more of a squarish
nail bed shape so what I'm doing right
now is just rounding off the nail bed so
that it'll feel a bit better and I'm
just gonna place it onto my nail to see
if it's fitting any better and then just
go back in and shape it as much as I
feel like I need to
to make sure that it really fits my nail
and then it's gonna sit really snug on
there
and once I feel like I'm happy with the
fit I like to get all five nails ready
for one hand before I stick it on so I'm
just making sure that that one fits and
I'm gonna do the same with all other
fingers on my nail so I'm just basically
doing the same thing sitting on to my
now then filing them and just making
sure that they all fit really securely
onto my nail
next I'm going to be gluing them onto my
nails using the glue that comes in the
packet I'm gonna be applying some onto
the actual force nail and just making
sure not to apply too much but making
sure that it's applied evenly and then
I'm also gonna be applying some onto my
actual nail bed as well
well done Leila you're covering the
camera for the camera can't see but I'm
just applying it very thin even layer
onto my nail also and you want to work
quite quickly when you're applying it
because as soon as the glue makes
contact with the nail it will literally
stick straight away so before you
actually sit on the nail try and put it
where you want it to to make sure that
it's in the right place because once
it's on you won't really be able to move
it and then after that I like to just
press it down onto my nail for about 30
seconds and just make sure that it's
really on that nice and tight that way I
know that it won't come off
and this is how I feel like I really get
it to stay on it's just making sure that
it's nice and stuck onto the nail so the
glue really adheres tightly I'm doing
the same thing with all other nails on
that hand it's really simple you can
actually go ahead and buff your nail
beforehand that does allow the nails
have something to grip onto so if you
feel like fools nails never lost on you
you can file your real nail beforehand
to kind of give it a little bit more of
a grip but I personally feel like they
lost fine without me doing that and also
my nails are a little bit damaged at the
moment from real acrylics so I don't
feel like I really need to do that what
I love about these nails is that they
are totally damage free they remove in
hot water I just like to dip my hands in
hot water for about 60 seconds and then
just literally peel them off so not only
are they easy to apply they're actually
really easy to remove which just means
you can switch up as much as you want to
you can really play around and I just
feel that this is really great for
people that can't have their nails long
for work or if they feel like I don't
know like if they just like to switch
things up that's how I feel anyway and
just to finish off what I'm doing right
now is just filing the nail a little bit
around the edges just so it looks really
natural and just so the edges don't look
too squarish so just making sure that I
really like the way the shape is this
doesn't damage the paint as long as you
don't find it too much and then I'm just
going on top of it and applying
thin coat of a top coat so this is
totally optional again I just feel like
it gives you that really nice fresh out
the stab on the feel I feel like it
gives it a really nice shine and for me
it just tops it off but this is totally
optional so guys that is the finished
look I hope that you enjoyed this is my
very first nail video so I hope that you
