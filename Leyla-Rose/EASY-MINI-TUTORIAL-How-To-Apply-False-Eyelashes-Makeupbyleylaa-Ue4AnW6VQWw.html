you how I apply my false eyelashes the
first thing that we're going to need are
a pair of falsies obviously duo adhesive
glue any liquid liner any mascara and a
pair of tweezers and also a flat surface
to work on just to apply the glue so the
first thing that we're gonna do we're
going to apply that force blush glue
onto the surface in the lab to sit for
about 30 seconds to get tacky then we
are going to take the back end of our
tweezers put it into the glue and then
run it all the way along the lash band
just to make sure that for the lash band
is covered making sure that every part
of the lash is stuck to the lid when we
apply leave it to sit for 30 seconds
again so that's tacky when we applied on
the lid this is just going to make
easier to stick and until it doesn't run
glue everywhere all over our eye so from
the center first we're going to attach
that to the lid and then with our
tweezers we're going to apply the outer
corner and also attach the inner corner
as well
as you can see guys I had already
applied my liquid liner mascara so it's
your choice if you want to apply that
after or before you apply your false
lashes just to have to disguise the lash
band on the eye so guys once they're
attached you're ready to go that's the
end of this tutorial I hope that you
enjoyed and I'll see you for the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
