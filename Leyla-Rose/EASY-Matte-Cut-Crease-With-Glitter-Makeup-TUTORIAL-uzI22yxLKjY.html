going to be showing you how to achieve
this easy glitter cut crease I
absolutely love the way this looks it's
so simple and I think almost anyone can
do this literally I think anyone can
it's so simple and I love the little pop
of glitter in the crease so yeah if you
guys do want to see how to achieve this
then just keep on watching
so firstly I'm just going to be priming
my eyes as I always do and I am using a
concealer for this just because it
really does help to keep my eyes looking
nice and balanc almost as if it's a
blank canvas and I do like to set it
into place as well because concealers do
tend to warm up a little bit and I don't
want it creasing on me for my eyeshadow
I am taking the Urban Decay Naked
palette today and it's been a while
since I've taken out this bad boy so I
am using it for this one just because
it's so neutral and I absolutely love
the colors in this I'm taking the color
Naked onto a fluffy blending brush and
I'm just using this as my first
transition shade I'm applying into my
crease by I'm also extending it outwards
as well to start to create the shape
that I won you don't really have to be
too neat with this at this point because
we are going to be cleaning up the cut
crease with selmak concealer and then
I'm taking the color buck on a different
blending brush as you can see the color
buck it's probably my favorite color in
the whole palette so I've already hit
pan on this a long time ago and this is
where I'm really going to start to
deepen up that crease and this is where
you want to start kind of being a little
bit more neat and you do want to make
sure that the colors are blending
upwards really really seamlessly so I'm
just kind of creating some depth and
then going in with some concealer and
this is where we are creating the cut
crease shape magic this is why it's so
easy because really it doesn't take a
lot of skill I'm the only skill that it
really takes is creating that shape with
the concealer but as you can see I'm
kind of doing it very very gradually you
don't need to just create that shape and
that's it I'm going up very very slowly
and I'm just kind of continuously
looking in the mirror opening my eyes
and just seeing is that the shape I like
and then if it's not enough then I will
just gradually make the shape higher and
higher until I am happy with it
and then when it comes to extending it
as you can see again I'm starting quite
low because I don't go too high then of
course when I feel like I'm at that
perfect place where I like the shape I
can then go ahead and fill in the whole
lid with the concealer and then we can
set it with some matte eyeshadow the
eyeshadow that I'm using is from the
Naked basics palette and I am taking
this color right here it's kind of like
a very very light yellow tone shade and
I'm just patting my whole lid across
with this personally I prefer a matte
shade especially because I'm doing the
little detail of glitter and I
personally feel like it stands out a lot
more if the whole eye is matte so I'm
just going across the
but this just making sure it's nice and
set and I'm going to be going in with my
glitter the glitter I'm using is
actually this gold glitter liner from
NYX and I'm just literally going
straight above where I did that cut
crease and we're just going to be
literally going across the line with the
gold glitter it's very self-explanatory
and you just have to be very gentle with
it be very slow and just like it was
with actually creating the shape just be
very gradual and gradually thicken it
until you are happy with it and then of
course this look would not be complete
without some winged eyeliner i'm using
the loreal paris super slim eyeliner and
this is my favorite eyeliner for
creating a nice wing just because I feel
like it's so easy to create the perfect
wing shape and just creating something
that is relatively long but I don't want
it to totally join up to the edge of my
cut crease I'd say I'm going for quite a
straight line instead of it turning
upwards quite a lot I'd say that it's
coming outwards more than it is turning
upwards so yeah this is the kind of
shape that I decided to go for you can
totally pick whatever you feel suits you
best
I personally like a thicker line that
you can pick a thin one if that suits
your eye shape and then I'm applying my
favorite lashes to my top lash line
these are the house of lashes iconic
lashes and I'm also applying some
mascara to finish off the look so guys
as we finished glitter cut crease I hope
you like it I really hope you guys found
this easy to achieve and easy to follow
as well just because I definitely feel
like this is something that you can all
achieve it's really really easy and I
definitely feel like you can really make
it work depending on your eyes shape I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
