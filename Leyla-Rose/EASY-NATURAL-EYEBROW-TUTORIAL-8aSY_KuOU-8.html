and today I have an updated eyebrow
routine slash tutorial it's kind of
morbid tutorial because I don't really
have a routine possibly I'm always
switching between different eyebrow
cells but this has been one that I have
been doing a bit lately so I thought I
would do a tutorial on the eyebrows that
I have been doing lately and because I
do the mystery tutorial so I don't keep
them in every single makeup tutorial I
thought I would do it in one dedicated
tutorial that you can always refer back
to you and yes pretty much they are
super easy honestly like this is
probably one of the easiest quickest
eyebrows ever obviously depends on the
natural eyebrows but look as I go by my
natural eyebrow shape so much it really
doesn't take a long time to me if I want
to feed more eyebrow videos and they
should take big thumbs up and subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already for
more videos like this all of my social
media will be linked down below but it's
pretty much makeup I made on everything
so if you guys do want to see how to
achieve these full brows then it just
keep on watching so the first thing I
like to do whenever I do my brows is
brush my hair upwards this just gets all
of the hairs in the right position and I
do like to start with drawing at the
bottom part of my brow so that way all
the hairs in place and I'm good to start
drawing I'm taking this pencil from
Maybelline and I'm going to start to
draw the bottom part of my brow now this
kind of look is relatively natural I
don't use a lot of eyebrow pencil by
apply it very very gradually so I like
to do first of all is just define that
bottom part of the brow and then
continue through the rest of the brow
and extend the tail something that is
quite different with my brow shape at
the moment is that I do extend it out
was more straight I like to make the
shape a lot more straight than what it
used to be and then once I'm happy with
the shape on the bottom and I like the
structure of the brow and it can we just
like to gradually apply little strands
throughout my brows and just brush them
through and continuously go through with
that process add them in brush it
azzaman brush it that is literally the
whole process because I find that that's
the way that I get them to look the most
natural and I do like to add a little
few extra fake strands on the inner part
of my brow as well to make them look
closer together because I personally
prefer that
and then when it comes to the top
portion of my brow instead of applying a
really thick line like I used to on the
top of my brow I like to flick all of my
movement upwards to create the effect of
bushy hairs but kind of sucking upwards
and I saw that this really compliments
when I apply my clear brow gel and that
is what I am doing now I'm using this
one from benefit and just pushing my
brow hairs upwards to make them look
fuller and more bushy and obviously my
eyebrows aren't thin to begin with but
they look a lot thicker when I use this
method and then just to clean it up a
little bit I go underneath with the
tiniest little bit of concealer just to
make them look a teeny bit more
structured and that is pretty much it so
guys I hope you enjoyed this quick and
easy bushy natural but structured
eyebrow routine and if you do like it
and you forget to give this video a big
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
and I'll see you in the next one bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
