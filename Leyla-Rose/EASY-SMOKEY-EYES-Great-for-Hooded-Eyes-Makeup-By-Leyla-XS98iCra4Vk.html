today I'm going to be showing you a
really easy smokey eye look and not only
is this really easy to do but it's also
very suitable for a hooded eye shape so
the first step that I'm going to be
doing is priming my eyes as I usually do
I like to prime from my eyebrow all the
way to my lid just to create a flawless
base so that all our eyeshadow sticks
and blends perfectly so just make sure
that it's all blended in then I'm going
to take uninterrupted eyeshadow from Mac
and I'm just going to be using a a
blending brush and applying this into
our crease
next I'm going to be taking this dark
brown eyeshadow and applying this all
over the lid and the reason why this is
suitable for a hooded lid is because
it's better to use a darker color all
over the lid rather than a gradient from
a lighter to darker shade because the
hooded lid usually covers that so that's
why I'm doing that instead and I'm going
to be blending that color out with this
Inglot eye shadow and this is a very
warm shade obviously you can go for
something a little bit cooler if you
prefer but this is just a really warm
shade that just makes it look really
really nice so it just works really well
so I'm just gonna be using a small
morphe brush just to blend that all
together and then I'm going back into my
other blending brush just to make it
nice and seamless then I am taking a
Kohl pencil and applying that into my
waterline running it through my bottom
lashes and also applying it to my bottom
lash line and this is key for creating
that smoky look because all the
attention has to be on our bottom lash
line as when you have a hooded lid
there's not a lot of space to work with
on the top so then I'm going to take
uninterrupted again and just start to
blend that out and this just creates a
really nice smoldering look and it's
really easy to do all you have to do is
just smudge it you don't need to be
precise you just need to smudge it out
with the eyeshadow then I'm going to
apply my mascara on my top lashes and
also in my bottom lashes as well
then I'm applying some false lashes
obviously this is optional but it just
makes the eyes look a lot more open open
then I'm going to be applying my
foundation before you guys panic I have
eight hands so my foundation is a lot
darker than my actual color on my face
but it matches my neck I promise it
looks really strange at first but it all
blends together in the end then I'm
going to be highlighting with my
Maybelline a fit me concealer this is my
absolute favorite at the moment and I'm
just gonna be applying this under my
eyes in a triangular shape and I'm also
going to be applying it on the other
high points of my face and this is gonna
make my face look a lot more defined and
just highlight the parts that I want to
highlight so I'm buffing that in with a
small more feet rounded brush and I'm
just gonna be blending this in to create
a seamless effect you don't want to see
where the color starts or finishes so
I'm just blending that in all over the
face
then when it gets to the under I bet you
can use a slightly smaller brush to get
into the more detailed areas then I just
go back into that blending brush just to
make sure that it looks a nice and
blended and so that we can't see any
concealer on our eyes next I'm going to
be filling in my eyebrows I am using an
eyebrow gel from MAC Cosmetics and I'm
just using that to flick through my
eyebrows and just to create a more
defined brow at the moment I'm growing
my eyebrows out and I'm trying to hide
it as much as possible so a gel is
really good for that because it kind of
hides where the hairs are like poking
out so I'm just using that and just very
gradually brushing it through my brows
and I'm also creating more of an arch
because unfortunately in my natural brow
shape black sand arch so I'm just
creating a artificial arch and it's
better to build up product gradually
when it comes to a gel formula otherwise
it just clumps in between the hairs then
I'm just going to be highlighting under
my brow with a concealer and this is
just gonna perfect any mistakes that
we've made and also creates a really
nice lifted brow effect because I am
using a shade lighter than my skin and
this just makes it look really nice and
lifted so it's a really nice technique
to use to just make the brow look really
nice and put together then I just go
back into that blending brush to make
sure it looks all seamless then I'm just
a bronzing my face and I'm using a real
techniques blush a brush for this I
don't want to apply too much so I'm
using a more sparse brush that B has
sort of fluff out a little bit more and
that just makes sure that the product is
spread further rather than just in a
very specific placement so that way I
just look very naturally bronzed then
I'm applying my hot mama blusher from at
the balm and this is my favorite blush I
absolutely love it then I am
highlighting the tops of my cheekbones
with the balm mary-lou manizer and it's
just gonna give us a really really nice
glow
then I'm going to be lining my lips with
a sort lip pencil you can go with any
lip color for this look obviously it is
completely up to you I wanted to go for
something that was a little bit more
pink because well I always go for a nude
and I just didn't want to go for a nude
today so I wanted to go for something a
little bit more pinky and also I've been
loving this combination recently so I
just apply these saw all over the lips
and then I go over it with a soft matte
lip cream from NYX
so as you can see I'm just gradually
filling in the lips
then I'm applying the soft matte lip
cream this is a new color Istanbul and
it's just a really pretty pink color and
I just like to apply this on the center
of the lip so guys that is the end of
this super easy eye look as you can see
there's not many steps to it so it's
really easy to recreate I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up I can't wait to see
you guys in my next video and I will
talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
