so today I have a chit chat get ready
with me I haven't done one of these in a
while so I'm super excited just to sit
down and chat with you whilst I create
this makeup blow it kind of created my
current everyday look with like faux
freckles and glossy lips and I love this
look I'm forever wearing it especially
when my hair is curly just cuz I feel
like the whole vibe is just really nice
and I love it guys had been requesting
me to create this look because I post it
on my Instagram all the time
be sure to follow my Instagram by the
way it's makeup by Leila as well as my
Twitter and snapchat as well so be sure
to follow me on those and subscribe if
you haven't already you have you guys
enjoy this video to moisturize my lips
while sending my makeup I'm gonna be
using the incredible jelly shot lip
quencher this actually has avocado oil
in it which makes it super hydrating so
I'm gonna use that now actually what's
so cool about this is it actually has a
flower inside of it which is so cool
another my lips and moisturize I'm gonna
be taking some of the benefit
Porefessional mattes rescue I always
find it so hard to like talk to you guys
about stuff whilst I'm doing my makeup
so whilst I'm doing my makeup I just
carry on chatting to you guys and add
you have something super cool to tell
you about incredible incredible is
actually launching on the 2nd of
November which is actually the day that
this video is launching so incredible
has actually launched a super exciting
and I was actually a part of their
launch campaign so I'll leave a link to
the Instagram down below what I actually
love about incredible is that they have
like such a wide variety of lip products
I love that they have kind of like
everything they have bombs they have
maps they have glosses they have
metallics I kind of have just like the
widest range and I honestly love that
I'm gonna put a little bit of powder on
to my skin before I apply my foundation
and this has been something I've been
doing to try and help to keep my makeup
on and lost as long as I can now I don't
put this all over my skin just in the
areas that get put dominantly oily so
kind of like in my t-zone area so I put
it on my forehead my nose my like very
inner cheek area and then also my chin
I'm using the RCM a no color powder to
do this and I'm just taking a small
brush and just like patting this into
the skin so next I'm gonna take my
foundation I'm gonna take the ex1
invisible and I actually have this in
the shade F 400 and I think it's gonna
be too dark for me
it's gonna take some concealer and pop
it under my eyes is the Born This Way
concealer and this is where everything
starts to look normal I promise I'm just
taking some of the top shape tape this
is like white can see this is literally
like almost white no it looks crazy
right now but it all comes together I
promise another great skin in the world
whatsoever
I think genetically I was just not like
blessed with the best skin although my
family skin does not get wrinkly in old
age which is fabulous for me but I think
the reason why I'm so prone to breakouts
is definitely like hereditary I don't
think it's anything that I do it's
probably hormonal as well recently my
skin broke out so badly I don't think I
think that was kind of the time where I
wasn't filming all that much it probably
was a lot to do with stress and stuff
like that as well did it up within a
month so I'm thinking I'm gonna do a
video as to how I cleared up so quickly
and just like all of my tips and I want
to do a skincare routine as well so let
me know if you want that kind of
integrated into one video or if you want
me to do two separate videos I'm like it
was me I think it was just like a lot of
lifestyle choices I was making and it
just like wasn't helping my skin as well
as the fact that a lot of it wasn't my
fault
but there were choices that I could make
that could improve it and I did and I
managed to clear it to the point that it
is now within a month so I think that's
pretty good and I want to make a video
on that stupid soon so comment down
below let me know if you want to see
that I'm using the Rimmel insta-fix and
mattes
translucent powder to do this face is
nice a matte and smooth and whilst I am
doing the rest of my skin I'm just gonna
apply some of the UH Nastasia clear brow
gel through my brows and just flick all
the brow hairs upwards because the kind
of bra that I want to go for today is a
little bit of like a bushier brow rather
than like a super defined one okay we'll
still be defined but I want to go to
something just like a little bit bushy
oh so I want to flick all the brow hairs
upwards so once that's drying we can
carry on with the rest of our skin I've
been using the UH Nastasia contour kit a
lot lately so I think I might use that
I'm using the bronze
shade right here ones that can look a
little orange if you apply too much of
it so I don't wanna go too crazy with it
I honestly never ever ever use blush I
don't know what is wrong with me I just
feel like I don't if it's because like
I've always suffered with like bumpy
cheeks I just feel like it emphasizes
that but um I just don't want to put any
redness into my skin like I just don't
feel I don't feel like there are many
blush colors that I think are worth
putting on my skintone like I don't know
like it's weird cuz if I was doing
someone's makeup that had the same skin
tone as me I would probably put blush on
them but for me it's just like a
personal preference where I just
preferred not to then I'm also just
gonna take this underneath my jaw
because I'm around a little face and we
want to make sure that that does not
look round then I'm just gonna take some
more of that banana call out and just
use it actually underneath my eyes damn
that's bright I picked up way too much
of it and then whilst we are at it I'm
just gonna contour my nose and I know
missing this for ages if I need to do a
comp nose contour video because the way
I contour my nose is so different now
now I'm gonna fill in my brows and I'm
gonna take the under starsia brows to do
this and I'm just gonna go like
underneath my eyebrow first of all
because I want the bottom to be nice and
fine I just kind of like flick up all of
the little brow hairs actually want them
to look rather messy so up close they
just look kind of messy just going to do
them again with a bit more brow gel and
these will hold up which is amazing the
Anastasio brow gel is so good I'm gonna
take the Too Faced chocolate bar palette
for this today because we're just gonna
take a fluffy blending brush and just
take some of the color salted caramel
which you this little peachy shade right
here I kind of like gonna extend this
outwards and I'm gonna do this kind of
messily like I don't even really care if
it looks super neat and blended like I
just want this color in my crease and I
just want to really like drag it
outwards nicely this makeup look is
super simple and I'm just constantly
wearing looks like this then I'm just
gonna take some of the color white
chocolate which is
Buchanan right here and I'm just gonna
pop that on the lid just to lighten
everything been gonna take the color
semi-sweet which is this kind of like
medium brown shade and we're gonna start
drawing our winged eyeliner and I'm
gonna start like midway through the lid
and just again like I don't even go
really neat with this I kind of just run
this along my lash line and then as it
gets to the outer corner just make it
like a little bit thicker and then kind
of turn it into a wing honestly like
such a natural way to define your eyes
like if you really did I'm gonna apply
false lashes but if you really didn't
want to
it kind of just extends your eyes
without really having to do much then
I'm gonna be taking the color triple
fudge which is the darkest Brown in the
palette and I'm just gonna be making
this with a flat brush and I'm kind of
gonna be doing the same thing but just
closer to the lash line just cuz I don't
want the whole like eyeliner eyeshadow
that we've done to be too too dark so
I'm just kind of running this close to
our lash line and then again just kind
of like winging this out so now we're
gonna apply it lashes and I'm gonna be
taking the this is also down I'm gonna
be thinking be Koko goddess lashes
always get so many questions about what
lashes I use all the time and these are
the ones for me these are my last pair
and I need to buy more because they are
just my favorite lashes in the entire
world I've got glue on my lashes I'm
also kind of like wait for that to dry I
just apply mascara to my natural lashes
I'm just taking the benefit they're real
and then we're just gonna apply the
lashes straight on
I just love my eyes like this I don't
want eyes like this immediate area
before I know that some of you guys
gonna be like you've seen you do eyes
like this before but this is just a get
ready to me like business just I like
doing my eyes like this for every day
like it just it looks nice and easy
before I gonna move on to highlight and
stuff like that I'm gonna add faux
freckles and I know this is kind of
controversial because some people
absolutely hate when people do for
freckles I personally think like why not
but I mean you do you if you don't like
it then don't do it
and like the way that I do this I kind
of just like put the put the pencil like
onto my skin and then just twist it and
it kind of just leaves this like tiny
little dot and like some of them will
have more pressure some of them are less
pressure it really just depends but like
I'm you don't want it to look too like
uniform if that makes sense if you don't
it to look like spots everywhere you
kind of want it to look a little bit
like some are darker than others some
are bigger than others if you wanted to
just kind of look a little bit this like
neat and then now I'm gonna apply some
highlight the highlighter I'm gonna use
is the UH Nastasia so holy wood this is
one of my favorites and I'm just gonna
take a tiny little highlight brush like
this and just pop this on the tops of my
cheekbones so before I finish off my
lips and everything I'm just gonna go
and refresh my hair and go wet it and
just kind of like scrunch it a little
bit and dry it and then when we come
back I will finish off with my lips
taking some of my Rimmel cappuccino that
liner and I'm just going to be using
this just to define the lip shape I
don't want to fill in my lips with this
because I want all of the effect to be
on this gloss that I'm gonna be using
from incredible we've been thinking the
incredible in a dream world
iridescent sheer gloss in the shade
mermaid tantrums
this is genuinely one of the prettiest
lip glosses
in the entire world like look at this I
was like that pink gold iridescent to it
and it's just stunning I guess this is
the finished look I hope you enjoyed
