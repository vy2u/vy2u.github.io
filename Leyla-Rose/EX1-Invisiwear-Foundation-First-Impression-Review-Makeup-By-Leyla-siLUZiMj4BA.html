today I'm going to be doing a first
impression review on a new foundation I
just recently bought it is the ex1
invisi wet liquid foundation I have
heard a lot and lots and lots of good
stuff about this reason why I look like
I just rolled out of bed is because I
practically just did because I have
loads of videos to film today and I
wanted to put this on so I could wear it
for at least 6 hours foundation was
basically created for people with olive
skin tones so people with more yellow
undertone me myself I have a varied
yellow undertone the moment I am a
little bit tense I'm hoping this color
will match me I bought the color F 300
was going to buy a lighter color and a
dark color I wanted to buy to make sure
I liked it first what I really like
about this foundation is the price it's
only 12 pounds 50 in the UK does say on
the back that is oil free nhanh pore
clogging and it has true color pigments
to even out skin tone and correct
imperfections for a perfect coverage
that is almost invisible so I'm guessing
it's I don't even know really what kind
of coverage of this is going to be it
doesn't really say much about it online
it's just good in biz aware so I
guessing it's meant to look like natural
skin which I am all for I like my skin
to look as natural as possible as long
as my little red scars and a couple of
blemishes are covered I'm all good
because I'm going to jump straight into
the application for my face I feel like
my face is a little bit dry so I'm going
to be using a hydrating primer this is
the matte and natural radiance primer
this doesn't affect the aware of my
foundation ever so this just absorbs
straight into the skin is just kind of
almost like a serum and that kind of
primes your face as well so this will
really affect anything I really want to
use this one because my face does feel
quite dry
you
when I apply this with a beauty blender
because I just feel like it will give me
nice even coverage and it will kind of
do the work for me as far as the
consistency goes it does have quite a
thick texture it almost feels like one
of those kind of whipped textures I'm
just going to apply a small amount of
this as far as the color goes it really
really really is a yellow tone which is
fantastic
I honestly needed a yellow tone
foundation I do have some that work but
I just feel like I didn't really have
any that I really really loves and just
going straight into my Beauty Blender
and just blend everything in
okay so I definitely feel like it's on
the lighter side of coverage I can do
food like it covers well but I
definitely feel like you know a lot of
my redness is showing through like two
layers I think will be great it's really
nice I feel like the finish kind of just
seeps into the skin in a good way where
I feel like it does look like skin
although I do feel like I need some
extra coverage so I'm just going to
apply a little bit more on to the center
part of my face just to cover up all of
this redness because that does usually
show through for me unfortunately so I'm
just going to apply that on top
so don't if you guys can see this but
with even with the second layer I do
feel like there's a lot of my blemishes
that is still pumping through that
usually I'm not hard to cover to be
honest I don't really have an issue with
covering these these just usually cover
up with foundation so this definitely
isn't a full coverage foundation even
buildable wise I don't feel like the
coverage builds up too well because I'm
going to be wearing a full face of
makeup afterwards I really want it all
to be covered so I really do hope the
third layer will cover it I really do
feel like a third layer it's bit
excessive but if this isn't a full
coverage foundation then fair enough it
is described to be more of a invisible
type of foundation so that's totally
fine
I feel like a third layer did cover up
the majority of the redness but I do
still feel like you can still see my
skin coming through it's definitely not
April coverage Foundation doesn't have
the best customizable coverage it does
really feel like it feels like skin
which is amazing that's exactly what you
want in a foundation but every day did
dry to a semi-matte finish I'd say so
let's see how it lost throughout the day
at the moment it is half 10:00 in the
morning I'm going to come back hopefully
after I finished all my tutorials that
will hopefully be in about 3 hours and
we can just chat and see how it's gone
after 3 hours I will have a full face of
makeup on after that so you can see how
it looks in the full face - and also we
can just discuss how it kind of applied
with the rest of the makeup - let's see
how it goes roughly after 3 hours and we
will discuss later there hey guys I'm
back after applying the rest of my
makeup and it has actually been three
hours since I last saw you guys I
initially applied my makeup I'll be
honest like it's taken a while for me to
actually love this foundation but now
that it's on and I've taken a few photos
with this foundation I actually love it
I think this is smooth onto my skin
amazingly if you guys have been
following me for a little while you know
I have a little bit of trouble with
getting my skin to look smooth and
especially on the camera I'm filming on
it picks up every little detail like
details that you cannot even see in real
life so honestly I can see on the camera
already that my skin is looking really
smooth when I done my makeup I applied
my concealer as I usually do i applied
it under my eyes forehead nose and chin
and i set only those areas with the
powder and I felt like it smoothed over
once I set it I definitely feel like
setting your face with a light veil of
powder will definitely help to smooth
everything out because until I did that
I didn't like it but now that I've set
everything and I bronze and everything
like that I feel like it's set into my
skin beautifully I'm just kind of
looking at my skin
especially after taking photos of the
makeup I done today I was kind of like I
think this is the smoothest my skin has
ever looked not being able to feel it on
your skin and it feeling really nice and
light is a really good thing in my
opinion but it does really look natural
and I feel like it smoothes beautifully
went set with powder butter I used was
the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
don't you guys know that I love and now
that it's in place I honestly feel like
it hasn't really moved since I applied
it if it was like the longevity of it is
really good because it does dry to a
semi matte finish but I don't know what
it was about it it just felt like it
needed setting so I do feel like I'm
really liking it now when say this has
the best coverage I'd say that this has
probably a medium coverage and then when
I applied my concealer I felt like
that's when I got the coverage that I
desired which is like a medium to full
coverage like it's a generous amount 30
mils is a normal amount that you get in
a high-end bowl and 1250 is a really
great price I do want to wear this for
at least another two hours just to see
how it lasts from now as well like I
said it photographed beautifully I'll
insert a picture now just so that you
guys can see an unedited photo I took
with my sony alpha 5 100 camera just
really happy with it I just feel like
this can definitely be a foundation that
I am going to go back to I love how
weightless it feels and because it is
described as to be like skin and it's
invisi where I think the fact that it
doesn't really have a buildable coverage
isn't the worst thing in the world
because it's not really described to
have an amazing coverage so I wanna see
how this Lost's over the next few hours
and I will update you and tell you guys
how I am feeling about it ok guys so I
am back it has been another 2 hours
there's now 3 o'clock in the afternoon
this is my final chicken for today just
to give you my final kind of opinion of
how I feel um overall I feel like the
longevity of this foundation is really
really good I thought if you have oily
troubles just set your makeup a little
bit more but I do feel like I haven't
had any problems with my oil coming
through I can see on my nose and my
t-zone area it's getting a little bit
shiny at the moment it looks really nice
and healthy like I said previously I
feel like this is the smoothest my skin
has looked in a while I'm just genuinely
so excited to try this foundation
especially in my normal color as well
I'm going to buy that I really really
like it highly recommend it I probably
gave it like an 8 out of 10 because I
don't know I feel like until you really
try a foundation you can't really give
it a proper review but my first
impression of this is that I really like
and I'm definitely going to be using
this a lot more and I think this was a
great first impressions because a lot of
you guys wanted me to review this
foundation so if you're thinking of
getting it I definitely say it's a great
foundation but remember just because
something works for me doesn't
necessarily mean it will work for you
and just cuz I don't like something
doesn't mean you will love it
so it's always good to keep in mind that
we are different people too but if you
are thinking of getting it and you have
a similar skin type to me then go for it
I personally feel like this would work
on quite a few skin types I definitely
think that it is worth the money
definitely worth a try twelve pounds
fifty is not a lot for a foundation and
I definitely feel like it has a high-end
quality to it before like this is one of
the best olive toned foundations I've
ever found which is good you guys I hope
that you found this first impression
review helpful let me know down in the
comments your experiences with this
foundation if you've had bad experiences

people's opinions and I'd love if you
