so today I'm going to be doing a common
eyebrow mistakes to avoid video I've
done lots of these videos before in the
past and you guys really wanted to see
an eyebrow one so definitely like this
video and subscribe for more videos like
this and by the way before I get into
this video just wanna let you know I am
getting over a sore throat and my voice
is totally gone so that's why it sounds
a little bit funny as far as these
videos go these are just helping you to
correct some common mistakes that you
can make with your eyebrows I've said it
before but there are no right and wrong
ways to do makeup anyway without the
rambling before my voice actually
totally disappears let's get on into
this video the first common mistake that
you can definitely make is applying
product too heavily onto your brows now
you can do this with any eyebrow product
I used a deep brow in this demonstration
because dip brow sort of pomade products
are quite easy to go to heavy-handed
with they're going to be wrong I like to
go for a bold brow sometimes but it's
definitely good to be in control of the
product that you are using so a good way
to combat this is to apply as gradually
as you can as you can see in this tool
clip I'm doing lots of small movements
that are very light handed if you do
heavy-handed with the brush and you put
too much product on there then it's just
going to go away too thick so you just
want to use a combination of not a lot
of product on the brush a light hand and
very light movement also so something
that you also want to make sure you are
preventing it kind of goes in with the
last one but it's just applying product
too quickly it's really important you
guys take your time with this even if
you want to go for a bold brow still
doing it slowly rather than all at once
means that you are going to get
something that looks a lot more
flattering for your face or rather than
something that's really blocked like
easier to control rather than just
creating a shape that you do not want
and then finding it hard to take away
from that also applying product in the
wrong direction can really set you off
on the wrong track if you go in an
upward down motion like almost like a
zigzag or even going in the opposite
direction of your brow not only is it
going to agitate your actual brow hairs
but it's not going to look natural
because when you think about it there is
a certain place where your brow hairs
actually grow for our general rule of
this is in the center of your brow it
goes upwards in the middle of your brow
it kind of grows diagonally towards
outer part of your face and then it
continues on diagonally as it gets to
the tail of your eyebrows up and down in
a zigzag isn't really going to look like
brow hairs again even if you're going
for something bold it's not going to
mimic the way that a brow actually looks
so the way to really get it to look like
really natural full brow or a really
natural source soft brow is to start
from the bottom part of your brow and to
flick upwards in little brow hairs and
follow the direction that your hair's
naturally grow in the next one is really
common with all them there I definitely
have with this one and that is applying
product too harshly on the inner corner
now sometimes I like to go for a really
bold brow and I want it to have fold all
the way through in a straight line
upwards on that inner corner is going to
it's not going to be that flattering so
best way to do this even if you are
applying a lot is to gradually apply the
product starting from about one third in
now that you've filled in that other
part of your brow you can move onwards
very slowly and then stop when you feel
like you want to for making sure that
the pressure on your brush is not too
much so you can sort of gradually get
into that center part without sort of
drawing a line and just creating a
divide from when your eyebrows start
this one might be obvious for some
people but when I first started out in
makeup I did not even know that eyebrow
gel even existed my hair is naturally
very very curly and that's really so on
my eyebrows so my eyebrows tend to curl
and do whatever they want throughout the
day so a mistake that you can make is
not taming your brow hairs and then it
just it doesn't really go with all the
hard work that you've created on your
brow and it can just look a little bit
messy so using a clear brow gel or a
tinted one if you like to go through the
brows and to set them into place really
make sure eyebrows look so much better
honestly I feel like unless I've done
this my eyebrows don't look as good as
they can be so definitely recommend
getting into the habit of creating a
beautiful brow using clear brow gel no
matter what style you are going for
something else you also want to be
careful of is the actual color of
eyebrow pencil you are using on your
brows now I have very dark hair it's the
darker shade of brown you can probably
get before it turns to black and I don't
use a black pencil on my eyebrows
because I know that it's going to look
way too harsh on me it really does
depend on your face and just generally
the color of your hair so this isn't for
everybody generally you want to match it
to your roots
the best that you can so that it looks
natural on a rose honestly go for
whichever color you want go for blue go
some kalitta brows honestly it's totally
up to you this is just if you wanted
your brows to look natural okay so I am
an absolute massive fan of cleaning up
the bottom of my brows because I think
it just makes it look so clean and
that's the kind of style but I like to
go color trend for a lot of people if
you use concealer all around the brows
this is something you should definitely
be careful of because it can make the
brows look very artificial if you are
going to do this something you want to
make sure of is that the concealer
matches your skin color the best it
possibly can if you're using something
too light it kind of just looks like
your eyebrows are floating and in
pictures and in normal daylight it can
look really really harsh and just
unnatural so be careful the shade of
concealer you're using
usually I tend to use a lighter
concealer when I'm doing the bottom part
of my brow to act as a highlight but if
you are going to be going around the
whole brow be careful not to use a
bright colors the whole way around so
guys that's it for today I really hope
you found this video helpful and you
learned something new today I really
hope you guys enjoyed and if you did be
sure to give this video a thumbs up
comment down below what video you're
going to do next in this section what
mistakes you want to avoid be sure to
check out other videos that I've done
within this category and without further
ado I'm going to let you guys go and I'm
going to rest my voice so I could be
normal for the little bit here I love
you guys so much and I'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
