so today I'm going to be doing an
eyeliner mistakes to avoid video and I'm
really excited because I haven't done
one of these in a little while and I
know that a lot of you guys love them if
you do love these kind of videos and
don't forget to Like and subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already and if
you want to see some eyeliner mistakes
to avoid and how to fix them then just
keep on watching ok so a mistake that I
definitely recommend you guys trying to
avoid is applying too much they could
eyeliner on the inner part of your eye
that inner part tends to have quite a
small amount of eyelid space if that
inner corner is too eyeliner heavy it
does look a little bit less flattering
than if it had a very slightly more
tapered in look so this is how it looks
when there's a lot of eyeliner on that
lid especially on the inner corner and
when the wings there it doesn't do the
job of kind of lifting the eye because
there's so much eyeliner on that inner
part but if you was to create the
eyeliner very very gently tapering it in
so as you can see I'm still starting
from the inner corner but I'm very
gradually allowing it to get thicker as
I get to that outer part of my eye so
that just allows the eye to look a lot
more kind of gentle it doesn't look as
harsh and that way you can tape it into
a thicker eyeliner a lot easier a lot of
mistakes tend to come from the shape of
the wing and I am definitely a victim of
this I do this all the time still to
this day so it's something you have to
be very careful of it's very easy to
create a very angular wing sort of
pointing too much upwards as you can see
it doesn't even point towards the tail
of my eyebrow even goes above that so
really what you want to do is you want
to try and create something that
emphasizes your eyes the best now
something this upturned may suit someone
else's eye shape but for me as you can
see this just it just doesn't look right
so what you want to do is you want to
look at your eye shape and you want to
think logically what is going to suit
your eye shape the most and also some
people find that on their eyes shape a
straight wing looks a lot better whereas
on my eye it doesn't really look that
way so you have to kind of experiment
with the kind of shapes that suit your
eye shape this is how my eye looks with
a more straight slash downward one and
soberness it doesn't really do much for
my eyes so it's just something you have
to experiment with for me and my eye
shape I go for something roughly is like
a 45 degree angle not saying I think
about that when I'm creating my eyeliner
that's usually just the way it tends to
go and what tends to be the most
flattering don't go and grab your
protractors and having actually measure
this this is just a total rough estimate
and it's just something that you can
kind of guide by you don't it to be a
total right angle and you don't it to be
flat something in between is something
to just sort of guide you a little bit
okay so the next one I think we are all
guilty of at some point in our makeup
journey and for me this is when I'm in a
rush so when I'm in a rush I just skip
eyeliner because it's more likely that a
mistake is going to happen what you tend
to do when you're rushing is just
creating the thickness that you need and
then making a ton of mistakes and then
not being able to take away because
obviously gradually adding is a lot
easier than adding too much and then
having to take away so I would recommend
instead of doing this is applying
eyeliner very very very very gradually
so just starting off very very slowly
that's why if you're in a rush maybe
just skip the eyeliner and just go
straight for false lashes and eyeshadow
and stuff like that things that you find
a little bit less precise because as you
can see as I'm doing with this eye I'm
very gradually creating the shape that I
need and if I want to thicken it I do it
extremely slowly and even with the wing
as you can see I'm doing it in small
strokes making sure that I'm happy with
the exact angle of it then I'm going to
be perfecting it connecting it eyeliner
is an art so it's definitely something
that is time-consuming at times so
definitely apply it only if you have the
time and also if you are in a rush and
you really really want an eyeliner just
take that teeny little bit of extra time
because having to fix those mistakes
with wipes and stuff like that ends up
being a lot more time-consuming anyway
now someone called this a mistake but I
definitely feel like this is extremely
important starting off with the eye that
you are most uncomfortable with ends up
having way better results because you
kind of create the eyeliner very
gradually on the eye that you feel least
comfortable with and then you can
replicate that on the eye that you do
feel more comfortable with is still down
to personal preference so don't do this
if you don't feel comfortable with it
but this way you won't be focusing
solely on the skills of your bad eye but
you'll be focusing more on trying to
recreate the other one which means you
won't end up having two different
eyeliners that look different and
another tip I have you guys is basically
to try and prevent your eyeliner from
looking too jagged something that can
cause this which is very easy mistake to
make
is using an eyeliner that is drying out
or something that is getting a little
bit old so making sure that you're using
a fresh eyeliner like a liquid or a gel
make sure that this ends up going on
nice and smoothly and that way it
doesn't look jagged and kind of looking
like it's you know going everywhere and
finally the last mistake that I'd
recommend you guys avoiding is allowing
your outer corner of your wing to look
too blunt something with winged eyeliner
that I definitely feel is very very
flattering is allowing that outer corner
to come to a very very tapered fine
point now I wouldn't say this is
necessarily a bad thing what's very
stylish right now is that outer corner
coming to a very very sharp point and it
can be quite hard to do especially with
certain eyeliners so a tip for this to
create that if you can't do that alone
with your eyeliner is taking some
concealer and really pushing it and
sharpening up the edge of that wing and
this is personally what I like and I
really like the way that it looks so
guys that is the end of this video I
really hope you enjoyed and other some
of you guys get a little upset when I
make these videos because you take them
in the wrong way I just want to make a
little disclaimer and just say I'm not
looking down or belittling anybody who
makes these mistakes this is coming from
the purist point of view when I make
this video I'm literally making it to
try and help you guys makeup is an art a
lot of people gonna do it differently
and not saying that this is the one and
only way to do eyeliner at the end of
the day makeup wipes off it's a really
light-hearted thing I don't think anyone
should really get upset about it you
guys did enjoy this video please like it

like this I love you all so much and
I'll see you all next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
