today's tutorials on how to achieve this
quick and easy colored eyeliner lick the
first step is going to be applying some
matte brown eyeshadow into my crease
I've already gone ahead and primed my
eyes beforehand because you guys have
seen me primed my eyes about a million
times so I just applied Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot all over my lid before we
started and i'm just using the morphe
jaclyn hill pilot and applying a matte
brown into my crease this is just going
to create a little bit of definition
before we apply the eyeliner we don't
want our eyes to look too pale and just
too flat this just adds a bit more
definition next I'm going to be taking
some of this shimmering champagne color
and applying it all over the lid these
are the only two eyeshadows we're going
to be applying on to our lid today just
because I want it to be really simple
and I want it to be all about the
eyeliner
so today I'm going to be mixing a sugar
pill pigment and I'm also going to be
mixing this with my mac fix+ until it
makes a paste and I basically created it
into my own eyeliner you can use your
own colored eyeliner if you have one but
I personally don't like buying them
because I don't use them enough so i
just created my own mixing the two
together and what I've just done is i'm
using a zoeva sort of bended eyeliner
brush and I'm starting to apply this all
over my lid and making sure that it's
nice and opaque and then it's a nice
thick line
then I'm going to start to extend the
outer corner of the wing and you can go
for whatever style of eyeliner suits
your eyes I just know that a thicker
Wing suits my particular I shape so I'm
just creating a thick wing and then I'm
connecting the two lines together and
just making sure that I gradually build
up the thickness just so I don't go too
thick to quickly and I'm just kind of
whispering it out towards the outer
corner so I can get it to come to a
really thin point on the outer edge and
I'm just gradually thickening it on the
lid to make sure that it will joins
together nice lady and then I'm just
going over one more layer just so that
it's nice and opaque just because I want
it to be as opaque as possible so that
my eye doesn't show through underneath
next I'm going to apply some mascara and
apply some false lashes I'm gonna apply
some false lashes because my lashes are
quite short I'm going to apply some
really natural lashes just because I
really want it to be all about the liner
and i'm just applying these with some
tweezers
next I'm gonna apply some mascara on to
my bottom lash line again like I said
you can apply some of this eyeliner on
the bottom if you wanted it to but I
wanted it to be all about the top liner
so I'm just applying some mascara and
that's it like I said I wanted this to
be a really simple so this is the whole
eyeliner look so I decided to go for
teal but don't forget that any color
will work with this eyeliner look so
have fun be creative and see what
different colors you can come up with I
