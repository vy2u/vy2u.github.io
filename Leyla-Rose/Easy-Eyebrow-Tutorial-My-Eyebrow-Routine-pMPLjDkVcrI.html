channel so today I have a quick video
showing you guys basically my updated
eyebrow routine I've shown you guys how
I do my eyebrows before and to be honest
they do change as the seasons go on guys
have been requesting an updated eyebrow
routine because my old one was quite
different this one is very very simple I
literally use like three products the
technique is relatively different not
super different but it is quite
different this shape is different so I
thought I'd do an updated perfect
eyebrow routine video I do understand
that this isn't the eyebrow style that
everyone likes to go for but because
this was requested I did really want to
create this for you then we get to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already
also big thumbs up if you want to see
more videos about eyebrows and also
comment down below and let me know what
I brows style you guys have been loving
it lately but for now let's get on into
this eyebrow tutorial so the first thing
that I'm going to be doing is brushing
my hairs upwards because what I want to
do is see very very clearly the shape
that I want to create on the bottom part
of my brow so I'm going to be doing is
just starting on the very inner corner
and just taking it any straight line
this is kind of how my brow differs I
start a lot more closer inwards towards
sort of the space in between my eyebrows
and also this shape is a lot straighter
rather than it being curved and the sort
of method that I like to use to apply my
eyebrow pencil is in stroking motions
this kind of mimics the look of hair I
personally really really like the way
that this looks I also like to go back
and forth between the actual pencil that
I'm using and then the other side of the
pencil which is a little spoolie brush
and this just really helps to keep all
of my hairs in order it also makes
everything look a lot more natural and
blended in again I'm using lots of
flicking motions to create those hairs
on the very inner corner of my brow and
it looks really really nice very very
natural and like natural hair the key to
this method is to do it slow and steady
this still doesn't take a very long time
to do in my opinion it's just you don't
rush with it you don't press too hard
and when it comes to creating that arch
shape I like to keep it relatively
straight nothing too over-the-top and
sore pointy and I like to press a little
bit harder on this area because I really
like to define my arch just because I
feel like this really lifts the face as
you can see this shape is still quite
straight I don't want it to look like
it's arching upwards and from this point
I will continue to draw those strokes
through the brow and just make it look
as dark as I like to be honest with you
it depends
how I'm feeling each day depending on
how the rest of my makeup is if I'm
feeling like I want it to be really
really dark I'll just keep going I'll
sometimes use a dip brow pomade but
sometimes I do like to keep it quite
natural as well I would say that this is
probably more on the dramatic side but
it's still not super super dark because
you can still see like my natural brow
hairs through although I do make it
quite a bit darker on that arch area and
leave it quite light on the inner corner
to create almost a fading effect which I
feel looks super natural next I'm taking
some clear brow gel which for me is an
essential it only does this give the
brow a really nice amount of texture but
it makes it stay in place all day which
is super necessary especially if you
have curly brow hairs like me mine just
like to kind of turn downwards
throughout the day so this one is
amazing this one's from benefit and it's
my new favorite so I do put a generous
amount through especially on that inner
corner because those hairs tend to not
stay up and then the final product I'll
be using is just some concealer
underneath the brow because I personally
feel like this just perfects that area I
don't always do this if I'm going for
more of a natural look and I want it to
look a little bit more messy I'll leave
this if I'm going for something more
polish like this I feel like concealer
just really adds that little bit of
extra highlight and lift under the brow
and then finally because I can see how
the brow looks I can just go in and just
add any touch-ups for example I'll just
add a little bit of extra around the
arch area make sure everything looks
nice and blended make sure I'm happy
with the shape and once that's done I'm
pretty much done with the brows so guys
this is a comparison and finished look
of how the brow looks with and without
any eyebrow makeup on as you can see it
makes such a difference when I apply a
very small amount of product I can get
my brows looking and very similar but
just not as intense but this is kind of
the brow look that I like to go for when
I'm going for something more intense
when I have a full face of makeup on I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video

you all in my next video take care guys
