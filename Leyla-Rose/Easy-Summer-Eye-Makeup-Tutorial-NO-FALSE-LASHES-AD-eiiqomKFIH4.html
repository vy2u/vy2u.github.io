today I'm going to be doing a brow and
eye tutorial I have created this really
pretty summer I look it's very simple
and I've also gone for this neat defined
brow look to Pat with it this look will
be perfect for a summer night out
festival look it would be good for
anything during the summer times if your
do wanna see how I achieved it then just
keep on watching
so the first thing I'm gonna be doing is
taking the L'Oreal Paris super line of
brow artist pencil and I'm taking this
in the shade brunette I'm just taking
the spoolie end and I'm just brushing
all my head upwards because I find this
really easy to really get into the
bottom part of my brow and I brush them
upwards to create that really defined
brow shape I'm first of all just gonna
be taking the pencil and drawing quite a
harsh line on the bottom of my brow and
first of all just starting right in the
center and taking this all the way to
underneath the arch all the way to the
bottom of my tail and I'm just gonna be
taking the brush side and just brushing
this through to really soften up the
line at the top that way some of the
product will kind of just distribute
through the brows I'm then just gonna be
continuing to enhance the shape on the
top of my eyebrow so now I'm really
gonna create that defined shape on the
top I'm just kind of sculpting out where
I want the arch of my brow to go because
I my hair doesn't actually grow on this
sort of area so I have to kind of create
it by myself and in between the strokes
I like to go back with the brush and
just making sure that I'm distributing
the product evenly through the brows so
that it looks nice and smooth I do like
to brush through them quite a bit
because I just feel like it all looks a
lot neater that way I like to
continuously switch between the pencil
and then the brush the pencil and the
brush to really make sure that this is
going through the brows and just
spreading through nice and evenly and
that way I just feel like the brows look
a lot smoother and it looks like the
pencil is really running through and the
whole color looks nice and defined and
nice and bold at the same time
to make sure on my brow hairs sit in
place I'm just gonna be taking the wax
from the other end of the pencil and
just running it through the eyebrows and
then also to give my eyebrows a little
bit of texture I'm just gonna be going
through with the brow artists brow
plumper from L'Oreal Paris also and I'm
just gonna be running this through the
brows and this really gives my brows a
lot of texture especially in the front
and I really really like that adding
some clear brow gel like this through
your brows will really make the brow
hairs look a lot thicker I personally
feel like this makes your eyebrows look
so much nicer so I really like to do
this this really works well if you have
fine eyebrows like me I like to place
the brows with this brow plumper in the
areas that we have applied the pencil
that way it looks super defined and no
hairs are kind of peeking out and
looking like it's kind of messing up
hard-to-find shape this really helps to
keep everything in place and to make
everything look super super defined
which you guys know I love I'm gonna be
taking some of the L'Oreal Paris True
Match concealer and taking this in quite
a light shade this is in the shade
vanilla and I'm just taking an angled
brush and just applying this underneath
my brow and what this will do is really
define that bottom part of your brow I
personally only like to do this at the
bottom rather than the top as well
because I just feel like I can get a
little bit much if you do it on the top
and the bottom but this just really
helps to clean up the shape and make
everything look so much more defined and
I just really feel like it really
enhances the shape a lot
now I'm just gonna be doing a little bit
more finishing touches now that the
brows are all in place and you know
we've kind of applied some concealer
underneath that way you can see if there
are any gaps or anything through the
brows any touching up so I just went
through a little bit and just made sure
that everything looks perfect which it
does and now we're gonna move on to
eyeshadow I'm gonna be taking the
L'Oreal Paris color riche quad and this
is in the shade beige trench and I'm
just taking this a bronzy shade right
here and this is gonna be our crease
color I'm just gonna be taking this into
the crease and pushing it in and really
blending this out it's a really nice
shimmery bronze shades and this is gonna
look super summery it would look perfect
with a tan I wish I had a turn right now
I feel like it would look so gorgeous in
the summertime so I'm just blending this
out into the crease to give ourselves a
little bit of definition and then I'm
gonna be taking Leah L'Oreal Paris color
riche eyeshadow in the shade 204 nude
and this is the most prettiest gold
bronze shade ever it's so pretty I feel
like the camera doesn't do it justice
because my lights are so bright it makes
them look a lot whiter than what they
actually are I'm patting that all over
the lid and then I'm taking my L'Oreal
Paris perfect slim super liner and I'm
just gonna be drawing a nice bold wing
because what is someone without a winged
liner you know I just feel like winged
liner just ties everything together I
started out with a line on my eye and
then drew out the wing and then drew the
lines together as I always do when I
create a winged liner and then I'm just
gonna be just thickening the line a
little bit because I do want the wing to
be on the thicker side rather than thin
I really love this eyeliner because you
can really customize how thick you want
your eyeline it to be and then to finish
off I'm just gonna be taking some of the
L'Oreal Paris full / sculpt mascara
which you guys know is my favorite
mascara of life I love this mascara
really does lengthen and volume and it
really makes you easy to get down to the
bottom base of the lashes so guys that
is the end of this look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this I love this kind
of look for summer it's perfect for
festival season it's perfect for that
nice summer night out and it's gonna
perfect with any lip color on multiple
skin tones and also it will look so good
with the tan as well I really hope you
guys enjoyed if you did then don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
next time bye guys
