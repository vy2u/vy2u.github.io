channel today I'm going to be showing
you how to achieve an everyday contoured
makeup look I'm going to show you guys
how to sculpt your face while still
looking natural but at the same time
being really easy to achieve for
beginners or for pros so prior to
filming I already applied my eyebrows
we're going to be moving straight to the
skin I'm going to be priming my skin
just before I apply foundation just to
give my skin a bit more hydration
because I have been suffering with a bit
of dry skin lately next we're going to
be moving on to foundation I'm taking
the new L'Oreal infallible sculpt
foundation and applying it all over my
skin I'm going to be blending this out
with the new L'Oreal brush that's
specifically for blending out contour
one side is a foundation brush and the
other side is for contouring and we're
going to be using the other side later
on it's made specifically for contouring
because if you do apply anything on top
of this it's not going to look cakey it
also contains a grip technology within
it as well which makes it grip onto
anything you apply on top of it which
prevents anything from sliding or
looking blotchy which is perfect for
when you want a perfect contour what I
love about it as well as if you can
build up to fill the coverage so any
areas where your skin shows through you
can apply a little bit more just to
build up the coverage to conceal my
under eye circles I'm just using a
little bit of the L'Oreal True Match
concealer underneath my eyes just
because the Racquet sleep means I need
it I'm multiplying too much of this
because I am going to be applying the
highlighting product underneath my eyes
as well
next taking the star of the show I'm
taking the L'Oreal infallible sculpt
highlighting and contouring duo now this
is such a unique product it's a cream to
powder formula and it is a lifesaver and
first of all just going to be taking the
highlighting product and just be
applying this underneath my eyes in a
triangular shape this is just going to
lift the eyes and really give us that
high cheekbone effect
not to mention giving us a little bit of
a facelift then I'm just applying a
little bit of that underneath the
contour or where I'm going to be
applying my contour just to highlight
this area and I'm also going to be
applying it onto my forehead at the
bridge of my nose and a little bit on to
my chin as well and then taking the
other side of the brush which I
absolutely love this brush is just
really good especially this side because
it is indented so it fits into that
cheekbone area so perfectly I'm applying
the contour slide on the sides of my
forehead under my jawline and also onto
the contours of my cheeks and this is
really going to give our face a nice
sunken effect on these areas and it's
just going to make our face look nice
and sculpted and as you can see I'm not
being too neat with this whatsoever
I just want to make sure I'm applying it
in the areas I'd like and we're going to
be blending it all together and this
product doesn't need to be set which I
absolutely love if you have super oily
skin you can go ahead and apply a powder
on top of this but because it does dry
to a powder see how you go fast it
blends really nicely as you can see and
it does look like skin because it dries
to a powder finish I'm just going to be
blending that in using the same brush
and as you can see it blends in super
flawlessly and this is what makes it so
good for an everyday wear because it
looks like skin once it's all blended in
it just looks like a natural shadow on
the face but if you did prefer a more
dramatic or deep contour this product is
buildable so you can add as many layers
as you like next taking this blush
sculpt trio I'm just going to be
applying the darkest shade and using it
as my blush just to give my cheeks a
little bit more shape and just add a
flush of color and because this gorgeous
copper shade is so beautiful I actually
decided to use this on my eyelids as
well just to act as my eye shadow for
the day and you guys know I love coppers
in anything warm and these blushes are
so pigmented so I decided to use it as
an eyeshadow
for my lashes I'm going to be taking the
l'oreal full slash sculpt mascara if
you've been watching my previous videos
you guys would see me raving about this
mascara and using it quite a bit the
last couple of months it is one of the
most perfect mascaras I've ever used
it's just one of the most perfect
brushes because it's shaped like a comb
and you can really get deep to the base
of your lashes while still giving you a
nice amount of volume and definition and
also you can add a little bit more into
the tips of your lashes right on the
outer corner and I really like to do
this to give my eyes a little bit more
lift on the outer corners from that same
blush palette I'm going to be taking the
lightest shade and using this as my
highlight to give my cheekbones a little
bit more shape and also to give us a
glow to line my lips I'm going to be
using this pink toned lip liner and then
I am going to be using one of the new
L'Oreal infallible matte Mac's
lip colors and I'm going to be applying
that onto my lips and this is in a nudie
peach shade and this is just going to
make my lips look a little bit more
coral and it's totally matte and super
lightweight which I really like so guys
that is the end of this makeup tutorial
