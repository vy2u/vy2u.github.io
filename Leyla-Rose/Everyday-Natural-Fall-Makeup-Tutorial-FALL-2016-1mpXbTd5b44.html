so today I'm going to be showing you my
everyday makeup look for fall / autumn
this is a really simple makeup look that
I think anybody can achieve I did apply
a pair of lashes but I showed you guys
how it looks before lashes as well so if
you don't like to wear lashes on an
everyday basis I showed you guys how it
looks without it it's very very simple
I've had it with this beautiful warm
nude lip which i think is perfect for
this time of year of course you can pair
this look with any lip color if you feel
to go for something bold if you want to
go for something more on the natural
side like me you could do that also so
if you do want to see how to achieve
this look and then it just keep on
watching so the first thing I'm gonna be
doing is applying some moisturizer the
moisturizer I'm using is The Body Shop
vitamin E and then whilst that's drying
I'll go straight in for my primers I'm
going to be using two today they're both
the makeup forever ones that these step
one skin equalizes and I'm using first
of all the nourishing base all over just
to add a little bit extra moisturization
into my skin and then I'm going to be
going in with the step 1 smoothing
primer because this is a really nice
primer just to smooth out all of the
pores before I move on to any foundation
I'm going to make sure to color correct
firstly just because some of my acne
scars are still showing through and also
you can tell how much sleep I pad by the
bags under my eyes so yeah we need some
color Corrections we're just gonna be
taking the soap &amp;amp; Glory all is calm
kickoff green concealer and I'm just
going to be taking this and applying
this on my cheek areas just find that
this really really helps to just deal
with redness just pop that all over and
then I like to go in with the Becca
color corrector for the under eyes this
is their under-eye brightening corrector
this isn't like a heavy duty one it's
quite a natural pink peach tone so this
just kind of deals with relatively mild
under-eye circles I'm just taking my
Real Techniques sculpting brush and just
pushing this card crackler kind of all
around the skin but really making sure
to push it so I don't lose that color
next step for me is going to be applying
my foundation now that my skin is
prepped and color corrected I'm taking
the Naked Skin Foundation from Urban
Decay honestly this isn't my go-to
everyday
Foundation to be honest with you I tend
to use my x1 the most but I've use this
in so many tutorials lately that I
didn't want to make it boring for you
guys so I thought I'd show you guys
another foundation that I do like to
wear as a very lightweight foundation
which i think is really nice for
everyday go spot here that's so painful
under the skin and the funny thing is I
have a matching one on this side so I
have them right there on either side I'm
just blending that in with the same
brush I used for my color corrector the
clean kabuki brush I'm just going on top
of that and just pushing it into the
skin so it looks nice and natural
oh my under eyes I'm going to be taking
one of my favorite concealers this is
the Maybelline fit me a beautiful
everyday concealer this looks really
nice and full coverage but it feels
really lightweight so I really like this
just applying this under the eyes and
just doing any triangle motion and then
also going down the side of my nose as
well to blend out my concealer I'm
taking my Beauty Blender and just
patting this under the eyes just to make
sure it's really nice and blended while
into the rest of my face I'm also just
taking it onto my lid as well because
this can act as our eye primer putting
this leftover on the sponge I just like
to take this and apply it on my forehead
on my chin and then to set my skin I'm
going to be taking the soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder basically going
to be setting everywhere with this my
bronze I'm taking a Make Up For Ever Pro
bronzed fusion this is in the shade 30 M
and I'm just applying this with a NYX
kabuki brush is just going to give a
really nice subtle bronzed look because
this bronzer is a really really natural
so I'm just patting this on all the
areas I would like to create a nice
natural soft looking bronze and I'm
going to be taking for my more heavy
duty bronzer and contour my Kat Von D
shade and light palette I love this and
I can't live without it I'm going to be
taking at the highlight shades to
brighten my under eyes so and then
mixture of the bronze and the contour to
add a little bit of structure and warmth
to my cheeks and also around the temple
areas as well and then I'm just going in
with those highlight shades and just
popping those underneath the eyes also
going ahead and applying some of my
Laura Mercier powder underneath my
cheekbones just to define them a little
bit more because I didn't apply a lot of
contour I just want to very naturally
define that area thank you my Laura
Geller gilded honey illuminator and just
applying that onto the tops of my
cheekbones just going ahead and dusting
away that loose powder from underneath
my cheekbones to make sure everything
looks nice and glowy and is set into
place I'm taking my Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray and I'm just going
to be spraying these very generous
amount of this all over my skin next I'm
going to be doing my eyebrows and this
isn't usually how I do my eyebrows when
I do sort of full-on makeup tutorial and
taking the Bravo conditionings primer
from benefit and I'm going to be putting
this in my brows first of all I'm just
pushing all of my eyebrow hairs upwards
once that brow conditioner is dry I'm
going to be going in with my uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills dark brown brow powder duo
brow powder has two shades in it I like
to use the dark one and I like to use
this on some sort of angled brush and I
like to use a powder every day because I
just feel that it looks a lot more
softer and more natural first of all I
just like to go on the very bottom part
of my brow just pull it inwards
pull this line relatively straight so I
kind of just take it from that and it is
quite straight it does go upwards a
little bit but it's quite straight and
then from that line I like to just flick
brow product upwards in the direction
that my hair grows and right on the
bottom of the arch I just like to take a
little bit of pencil just because I find
that because my hair hasn't totally
grown on that area yet it looks a little
bit sparse so any areas that do look
sparse I'll just go over with a pencil
just because it is a little bit more
intense and then as always I'm taking a
bit of concealer and applying it on the
bottom part of my brow just to make
everything look nice
need just running some brow gel through
my eyebrows as well just to give it a
little bit of texture and also to make
sure they all stay in place but eyebrows
are done what I like to do usually for
lashes it will either be just mascara or
I will put on a nice long pair of lashes
I just want it to look a little bit more
glam I'll pop on a pair of lashes and I
have no problem with wearing lashes for
everyday but it's totally up to you
that's what I wanted to show you guys
both of them together so it's going to
first we'll show you guys what it looks
like with mascara and the mascara I
usually like to go for is the L'Oreal
Paris telescopic finally I'm going to be
doing my lips I'm going to be applying
my cork lip pencil all around my lip
line first of all just to make sure that
I have a nice shape going on and then
finally for my actual liquid lipstick I
am taking the bodyshop matte lip liquid
and this is in the shade winds and Rose
this is such a perfect nude shade and I
think it's so perfect for every day
these are new from the body shop and
they smell amazing this dries to a
velvet matte finish which makes sure it
doesn't feel too dry my lips do feel
quite hydrate is still when this is on
which it's quite rare to find in a
liquid lipstick and it's available in 12
shades which is pretty amazing so this
is how it looks without the false lashes
I'm going to go ahead and apply some so
you can see what it looks like with the
lashes on I personally love lashes so
I'm really excited to pop some on and
then we will finish off this look guys I
really hope you have an amazing day
