achieve this look that I'm wearing and I
done it in and get ready with me style
video whilst chit-chatting with you guys
at the same time I thought like I really
missed you guys and I really wanted to
just sit down and just interact with you
guys because I just missed you I just
missed chatting I haven't done a
favorites video alright you know just
generally chatty video in a long time
and I just feel like I miss you know
communicating with you guys so I hope
that you guys enjoy this video if you do
want to see how to achieve this everyday
spring makeup look then please just keep
on watching as I'm gonna tie up my hair
because I can never do my makeup when my
hair is in my face I always try to like
when my hair is nice and I've actually
done something to it I always tried to
like leave it down and I just can't do
it so tying up in a bun for me is just
the easiest thing in the whole world it
just makes life easy so I just truly tie
up and the easiest bun of Y now all my
hair is out of my face I just feel like
I can begin
I've already cleansed my skin and I've
applied some Sur again has recently
changed and I feel that my skin feels
drier than it used to feel and I've
found that applying my moisturizer just
before I apply my foundation I just feel
that it looks a lot smoother and more
flawless so I am doing that now and the
moisturize I'm using is the vitamin E
one from the body shop and I love it
next I'm going to be taking my silk
cream foundation from Laura Mercier and
mixing it with a little bit of my mere
flora argan oil and I've been liking
mixing these together because it does
give me a really juicy finish and it
also helps to moisturize my skin at the
same time I'm applying my foundation and
honestly guys one of the reasons I've
actually chosen to do this is because my
Giorgio Armani ran out and my Armani
foundation is one of my favorites but I
just got it so expensive and it's risen
in price it used to be 34 and I think
now it's 37 that is so expensive and I'm
trying to use some of the foundations
that I already have because I do have a
lot that I don't use and oh my god 37
pounds where
Foundation is expensive so I'm trying to
branch out and just use the things I
already have and the color I use in this
is sand beige and then I'm just gonna
start bouncing this into the skin with
my Real Techniques sponge I'm just
starting off with a really thin layer
and just gradually building it up
because my skin just can't take too much
makeup it just doesn't work for some
reason so I start off with a thinner
layer first and then just kind of begin
to build up a little bit the skin is
just completely betraying me and just
changing its course of life and it's
really really annoying I'm just gonna go
ahead and apply another layer of that
because I didn't apply a lot to be
honest I'm just gonna do the same
mixture and usually I just like to take
I'll just show you I'm doing two little
tiny drops of the argan oil and then
just I'd mix it with my hand and then
I'm just gonna go over the areas where I
need a little bit more coverage so who
watches Pretty Little Liars who saw the
finale oh my gosh I don't want to spoil
it for anyone that hasn't seen it but
those who have seen it they know what
again I'm just gonna be bouncing that
into my skin and just creating a nice
smooth smooth layer on top of the layer
that we did before bill just really
helps to smooth it onto rest again or
better and I've just been loving using
this steps I always take my foundation
down to my neck doesn't matter what
color I am my neck of my face are the
lightest parts of my body like this
matches my arm and my legs and
everything like this is the color of my
body and everything I did recently put
up a brow routine definitely check that
out because I go into a lot more detail
does anyone else feel that the whole
Rudi defined brows is really just like
going out of style and I just think how
much more and natural brow in the right
shape shapes the face does anyone agree
I just feel like as long as it's the
right shape you don't necessarily need
to be putting loads and low
and those are product on it the weather
is so disgusting right now here in
London it's horrible just gray you look
outside the window and everything is
going it's just such a horrible day like
it's just all grey and horrible and
what's annoying is that the lighting
when I do my videos can just completely
change and I'm gonna prime my eyes with
soft ochre Paint Pot as usual and I'm
just gonna Pat this all over and just
blend it in oh I forgot to add my brow
JEP is so crucial for me because like
the hairs on my head
my eyebrows are all so curly so I
definitely need to do this step so
because this is like a spring look I
wanted to go for the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette first I'm going to take my Kiko
200 brush and go into limit it's just
the collar just here and it's like a
really nice light baby pink color apply
this in my crease and this is just gonna
start to define my crease and a little
bit a really soft on the eyes today and
go for a slightly brighter lip because I
never ever go for a bright lip I'm not
going for a really bright lip but
because this isn't everyday look I don't
want it to be like a red lip or a hot
pink lip but I wanted to have you know
the pop of color to be on the lip a so
with this like slanted brush that I
never use and I always like chuck away
I'm gonna try and use it today is it for
makeup addiction and this is the
highlighter brush and I'm gonna be
taking a noon up which is this color
right here it's like the darkest of
matte Brown that they have and just
apply it on my out and B and take it a
little bit onto my lid so I'm just gonna
be patting it on the outer corner of my
lid and just creating a little v-shape
and I'm gonna take that brush that we
started with and then just go over that
and then this will just kind of make it
easier to blend out later next I'm going
to be going in with my two three seven
brush firms away right and it's just
this tiny little brush that I like to
use on my inner corner and I'm also
gonna be using this to apply our live
color I'm gonna be taking trick and
trick is just this light rose gold color
and I'm just going to be applying this
all over my lid
but on top of it with strange which is
the lightest color in this palette but
it's a matte one so this is a shimmery
color that I'm applying now and you can
apply them that color on top of it just
to make it a little bit lighter and it
will mattify it a little bit and then
I'm just gonna take some of that strange
and apply it into the inner corner
applying some mascara onto my top lashes
and I'm gonna be using the Mac extended
play mascara and just applying a very
thin coat because I am going to be
applying some false lashes it's
completely optional some people like to
wear lashes everyday some people don't
work with whatever you want I've been
loving this little mixture recently it's
the Mack pearl of concealer and the
color that I use is NC 25 and the dream
of the lumen touch by Maybelline in the
shade two nude these are really good
like this is really similar to like the
light boost formula but it's not as
yellow light boost is very very yellow
and so I just like to take a little bit
of deeper logo concealer and just apply
that first and I do like to get it quite
close to my upper lash line that's why I
don't do my mascara or anything I do
after I basic and highlight and
everything because it's just easier to
get closer to the lash line and then I
come back to the dream Lumi touch
afterwards so I'm just gonna be buffing
this in or bouncing it shall I say and
do the bad thing and this sponge onto my
skin and the pro longwear does start to
dry so I would say to work quite quickly
just because it does really help days
where I don't have anything to do or if
I just have to go out and go get
something from the shop or something
like something work don't have a lot to
do during the day you will not catch me
wearing makeup if anything it will be
like a tinted moisturizer and possibly
my eyebrows but that's it in the year
and maybe a lipstick but that's it like
once that's on and it's all blended in
you want to work quickly and apply your
dream Lumi touch because it is going to
dry and we join it to crease I'm going
to powder it before it creases so I'm
just gonna be taking me dream Leary
touch and just applying it like that
just on top of it as you can see is
significantly lighter and it's a little
bit more of a salmon color rather than a
yellow tone which I don't really have a
problem with and this just gives us for
the most gorgeous bright under eye on
the hollowed I'm just gonna quickly
blend the other one and then we are
going into it set our under eyes with a
powder just to prevent it from creasing
because once it's creased you you can't
go back it's it's done cuz you're done
for once it started creasing it's just
not gonna stop after that taking the Mac
CC correcting powder in neutralize and
this is the yellow turned one and I'm
gonna be taking a sponge and a baking my
under eyes but what I basically do is
look down make sure it's not creased cuz
like I said it's not gonna stop creasing
you want to apply a significant amount
of powder under your eyes and allow it
to sit there for about I don't know five
minutes
okay so now I'm going to start to dust
away the powder it's been on for about
five minutes and I'm just gonna be using
a real techniques setting brush for this
and I'm just literally dusting away the
powder dream let me touch again and just
very lightly do a little bit of
highlight in the center of my nose and
I've been loving this recently because
this is not thick it does it it has a
concealer consistency but it's not sick
it doesn't have that really thick
concealer II feel and I have just been
loving this technique recently I'm going
to be taking my Bahama Mama bronzer and
just start to use this to contour it's
just the perfect color to contour with
because it's like cool tone but warm
still at the same time and I'm just
gonna be very slightly taking it on
either side of the bridge well I'm going
to be taking my Mac 1 6 8 brush and go
into that but how my mama powder again
and just start to carve out our
cheekbones and then we're gonna warm it
up with a little bit of bronzer I'm just
gonna be patting nuts on to the hollow
of my cheek
alright to pie it first and then go in
circular motions
and just make sure that has no harsh
lines this is easily one of my favorite
brushes ever in the whole mod this is
the 101 that Lux face to finalize the
waiver because it's not like shaped like
a powder brush where it has no shape in
the chili makes you feel like you're
defining your face ball your bronzing
which is really nice I never really go
for blush I'm going to be going for some
highlights I'm going in with beach Bobby
Brown shimmer brick compact this with
limited edition but it's pretty similar
to bronze it's just a little bit more
Goldy which I love and I'm just taking
my Mac 184 brush and just packing
loading it onto my brush and just
applying that on to the highest points
of my cheek just to give us that
gorgeous glow I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that and just apply it to
the bridge of my nose just to bring that
forward and also my cutest side I'm
gonna be taking this skin tone pencil
from Rimmel this is the nude pencil from
Rimmel scandaleyes 1 I'm just gonna be
running this along my waterline
with lesser mascara to my bottom lashes
and I'm using the same Mac extended play
as I did on my top lashes I really
couldn't think of a lip color so I'm
thinking of mixing between tequila
sunrise and nude from drugs makes their
lipsticks are amazing and they're always
doing such amazing deals on their
website I put my discount code down
below if you guys want to use that on
their website because it does give you
money off so I'm gonna use tequila
sunrise after I'm gonna put nude first
so nude is like a peachy nude anyway
this kind of gives this is very similar
to kinda sexy from Mac I'm gonna apply
lip run after by the way if he was
wondering
and then I'm gonna go for some tequila
sunrise on top and this is quite bright
I'm gonna line my lips with so lip
pencil and just see how that turns out
