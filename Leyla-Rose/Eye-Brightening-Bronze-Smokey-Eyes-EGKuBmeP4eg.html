going to be showing you today it was
highly requested on my Instagram I will
write all my details below so that you
can find me on Instagram Twitter and
Facebook yes this look was highly
requested I put this up as a prom makeup
and the whole of Instagram went crazy
over it and everyone really loved it and
asked for tutorials I asked again
yesterday and I asked what they like to
see most of a variety of looks and this
was just kept coming everyone kept
saying this one so I had to do it and I
really liked doing this tutorial and I
kind of just created with playing with
makeup and playing with white in the
inner corner and I found that it really
makes eyes pop with a smoky eye so I
really really just exaggerated why and
that's how I created this look so if you
want to see how I got this look then
please watch on and I will see you tie
with oh god this is an of decay benefit
stay don't stray primer in medium to
deep so I've used this today because
it's kind of giving me a more bare
canvas to work on rather than a clear
one like decays primer potion and I am
going to take this Kryolan grease paint
and it's basically it's in white and I'm
going to use this to enhance the inner
corner highlight and this is what's
going to really make this look so I'm
just gonna take it with my finger and
apply it
up to about there
and there and slightly underneath it as
well and that is about how much you
should need you shouldn't really need
anymore is to take a matte white
eyeshadow and I'm going to Pat this over
the grease paint that we've put on you
can use anything you can use a white
eyeshadow base I just didn't have any so
a grease paint works fine with me so I'm
going to be using from this Bobbi Brown
lick and I compact this is the Cabana
coral lip and eye palette I'm going to
be using just this matte white that's
right there
and I'm using a sigma large say shader
e60 I think is I'm going to take this
matte white and I'm going to Pat it
like that
the more you put it on and you pack it
on that obviously the more vibrant is
going to look next I am going to work on
the center of the eye and I'm going to
apply this kind of it's got a copper
color this coppery color and it's a
cream shadow by Avon I've had this for
absolute years and I find any get to put
it to use so I'm just going to apply
this with my finger and I'm going to
apply this on the center of my lid
the next step is going to be applying
the shadow to set this and I'm going to
be using Roche my urban decay and that
is this one here I've deployed the
pallet and I've put it into this one
here sorry I forgot to cover it and yeah
so I'm going to be using this one here
and it's kind of like a red coppery
Brown and I'm going to be patting this
on top of that copper color that we have
just fine
I'm really sorry but my camera
completely just cut out the last bit
blurred out and yeah my camera really
hates me today again but all I done is I
just blended the two colors from the lid
and in the inner corner together I'm
just using the white eyeshadow so I just
kind of gradually pied it in and that's
already that's all that didn't get
recorded the next step is going to be
taking a blending brush and blending
this color upwards and I'm going to be
using my Naked palette and I'm going to
be using buck from my Naked palette and
I'm using my hair addiction blending
brush so I'm just going to take this and
I'm going to blend the color upwards
like so
I'm going to be extending it and pushing
it upwards
in windshield wiper motions
like that and doing the same with the
other eye okay so the next step is going
to be applying a black into the crease
and the outer V and I'm going to be
using creep also from The Naked palette
and I'm just going to be applying it
like so creating a V in your outer
corner
I'm extending it quite not too far but I
am extending it then I'm going to take
that same blending brush with bark and
I'm going to blend this upwards
and I'm going to darken the crease once
more with this black
applying that same color underneath as
well so I'm going to take that copper
color that I put onto my lid and I'm
going to be taking it all the way
underneath so but with that I'm going to
be applying onto a flat brush that
copper cream eyeshadow
and applying it underneath
and then on the same brush I'm going to
take that same rich color that we put on
top with a cream eyeshadow on the top
lid and we are going to take that
underneath as well and just have that on
top just to darken it a little bit
you're going to be applying gel eyeliner
to the inside and to the top and I'm
gonna fast forward this for you because
it's pretty self-explanatory
you
now that eyeliner is done we're going to
apply our mascara and to the top and to
the bottom and then we're going to apply
our false eyelashes
you
okay guys so this is the finished look I
hope you are happy with the information
that I've given to you I hope that it
was easy to follow this is perfect for
summer and it suits every type of eye
color and shape it really makes them pop
and it's important for the inner corner
to really pop and to have that highlight
so the white is you know it makes this
look so and make sure you a that and gee
I just want to thank you all for
watching again thank you for all your
support and I'm really sorry I haven't
had that many videos but I've finally
finished college and I am here for the
summer I will be doing tutorials and
