going to be showing you an eyeshadow
do's and don'ts video I have seen this
video followed on YouTube for quite some
time by a few different youtubers and I
really wanted to do my own take on it
because eyeshadow is such a tricky thing
and I have a lot of tips for you so I
want to do my own version of it so this
is by no means an original idea so on 1
I am basically going to be showing you
all the things I think you should be
doing and on the other side I'm going to
be showing all the things that I would
recommend you doing if something works
to you then by all means go ahead and do
it
but I'm just going to show you guys some
common mistakes that are made and
basically what you should be doing
instead if you do want to see some
eyeshadow do's and don'ts then just keep
on watching so the first do is to use a
primer or a base now this is definitely
something that can be quite
self-explanatory but some people
actually skip this step and they might
not know how much of a difference it
actually makes I personally prefer using
a concealer because my eyelids can get
quite dry and I just like the feel of a
concealer a little bit better and I
personally love this because I feel like
it just cancels out all of the natural
colors of my eyelid I do make sure to
set it though because it is a concealer
so it will warm up in crease but it just
makes my eye a blank canvas to work on
it makes every color blend and appear
more vibrant and that also brings us to
our next don't you don't forget to apply
some sort of base underneath your
eyeshadow as this will prevent the
eyeshadow from adhering well to the eyes
also it will appear duller and it won't
last as long so I definitely recommend
applying some sort of base underneath
your eyeshadow
so my next do is actually something I
don't always stick to I recommend doing
your foundation after you have done your
eyeshadow just because it prevents all
of that messiness from falling onto your
foundation and your concealer and all of
that that you've taken so long to
perfect it also gives you the option to
clean up the sides of your eyes wipe
away any fallout and just make
everything look a lot neater and then of
course once you've cleaned it up you can
go ahead and apply some concealer or
foundation or whatever you're using and
that will also just make everything look
a lot smoother and cleaner and that way
you didn't waste any time having to fix
messy foundation and then of course on
the flipside don't finish your base
makeup before your eyes
if you
apply your foundation then fair enough
but you don't wanna do your concealer
your foundation your powder and then
you're left with this big old mess and
then of course you have to go and apply
your concealer on top of that which
sometimes makes it look dull I sometimes
do apply my foundation and concealer
first but only usually if I'm not doing
a lot of heavy eye makeup so my next do
is actually a very big one this is
probably the most important thing when
blending out your eyeshadow and it is to
use transition shades the transition
shade I'm using at the moment is makeup
geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow and the
purpose of a transition shade is to make
all of the other colors you're applying
in the crease or on the lid blend a lot
easier into one another the aim of the
game is kind of to create a transition
between multiple colors and make as if
that you can't see seams between them so
what I like to do personally is use
multiple transition shades so go from a
light peach into a medium peachy Brown
and then go into a slightly darker Brown
and then into the darkest color I'm
using so having a palette that has
multiple options really helps with this
and it really creates that nice flawless
blend I always recommend starting off
with the lightest shade and slowly
transitioning into the darker shade that
way you can really get a nice seamless
blend and you can apply the darkest
color exactly where you want it and then
of course that brings us to our next
donut you don't want to apply a dark
color fast especially in the crease so
as you can see me doing here I am taking
a big old brush taking a lot of dark
brown and applying it first into the
crease this is just going to give across
a very unblended look and also even if
you want to go ahead and try and blend
that out with a clean brush it makes
life really hard and it's not easy so
starting off with the lightest color
really helps next you want to make sure
that you do use little amounts of
eyeshadow at a time what you want to do
is pick up a little bit of an eye shadow
I'm sharing with a dark color so you can
really see what I'm doing and you want
to make sure you're taking a little bit
and patting off the excess so any
product you're using is embedded in that
brush and you can gradually apply as
much as you need that way you don't go
too much too quickly and you can blend
out and everything looks nice and
seamless what you want to make sure you
are not doing is applying too much color
at once this will just create a really
big mess and as you can see me doing
here I am swirling my brush
into this pan that is just too much and
it's just going to create a really big
mess so I'm kind of just applying too
much and then when I try and blend it
out again like I said before it's just
going to be really hard to blend out and
I'm not going to get that smooth
transition so the next thing you want to
make sure you're doing is using the
right brush for the purpose you are
using it for so for example you want to
make sure you're using a blending fluffy
brush like this one to blend our
products any fluffy large brush is going
to blend out a lot better you also want
to make sure using flatter brushes like
this to pack on product on the lid on
the brow bone and also smaller detailing
brushes like this to add details in
smaller areas using the right brush for
its purpose is going to make a world of
a difference and you are going to see
such a difference in your eyeshadow and
you also want to make sure you are not
using a brush that doesn't do the right
thing for example you want to make sure
you are not using a flat dense brush to
blend out product because it's just not
going to do the right thing for you it's
just going to move product around and
make you look a bit patchy you also want
to make sure that whilst applying darker
colors or applying into more detailed
small areas you are not using large
fluffy brushes because it's just going
to get that dark color everywhere and
with that being said you don't apply
your lid color using a fluffy large
brush because it's just going to move
the product about and not apply enough
pigment and the last thing you want to
make sure you are doing is holding your
brush right especially whilst blending
as you can see here I am holding my
brush and you want to make sure that to
create a nice flawless blend you are
holding your brush closer to the end of
the handle of the brush that way you can
allow the bristles to do its work and
you're not applying too much pressure
and it can just allow it to do its job
and then of course what you want to make
sure you are not doing is applying too
much pressure whilst blending or even
just generally applying eyeshadow
holding the brush too close to the
bristles and applying too much pressure
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
blend any better you're kind of just
going to be pushing into the eye too
much and it will make it look a little
bit patchy so guys that's the end of
this eye shadow do's and don'ts video I
really hope you enjoy there were some
unique tips that maybe you haven't heard
before I shadow is definitely one of my
passions and I would love to do a
version 2 with this as you can see I
applied some liner so if you would like
me to do a liner one next then don't

that or any other type of do's and
don'ts I really hope you enjoyed this
