stop talking now let's get on into this
tutorial let's go okay guys so I have
already plumbed my eyes and I am going
to be going straight in with the Urban
Decay heat palette I am taking this
color right here for my first transition
shade I'm taking this on a big fluffy
blending brush and because we're going
for such a dramatic cut
Crees we really want to transition from
the lightest shade all the way to the
darkest one so I'm first of all just
applying this in the shape that I want
and I'm extending it past my eyebrow and
also taking it in to the hollow of the
inner corner of my eye then I am taking
this color right here and this is gonna
be the next shade and we're just gonna
be building this up into the slightly
more deeper part of the crease so I'm
taking this higher than I normally would
because obviously we are gonna go for a
cut crease and that's gonna go above our
normal crease line so I'm just gonna be
blending it and making sure these two
colors are blend together when you go
gradually and you build up slowly it
just ensures that you have a smoother
blend which is definitely what we want
when we're going for something as
intricate as this then going in with a
different brush I'm gonna be taking this
color and this is gonna be the slightly
deeper shade within the crease areas I'm
still following that general shape that
we created with the other colors but I'm
keeping this color lower towards the
crease and making sure not to take this
up too high so we don't ruin the nice
blending that we have already done and
then I go back in with that previous
brush and just make sure this is
blending really smoothly before I apply
any more going back and forth between
brushes and colors really helps to make
sure everything blends super smoothly
and that's what we want for a look like
this we want it to look nice and blended
and not messy then I'm going in with
this color which is just such a gorgeous
color it's a really nice dark red toned
Brown and I'm taking this on a really
small blending brush and I'm using this
to define at the cut crease now so what
I'm doing is as you can see just going
along with that kind of shape that I've
created on the other eye I started with
my eye that I'm not as good with because
I find that this really really helps oh
definitely do that if you struggle with
doing your bad I do the bad eye first
take your time on it and then do the
other one and I'm just blending out that
line and making sure that it blends
smoothly into the colors we applied
previously I wanted this to be a really
extended hot crease so I am taking this
out past the eyebrow as well but you can
keep it within if you don't want to do
that now I'm going in with this very
last shade and this is a little bit more
of a dark move Brown and I'm just using
that as the darkest shade with that same
brush and just keeping it as close to
that crease as possible whilst it's
still being above the crease because
obviously when our eyes are
we want to still be able to see the cut
crease but we are going to be carving
out with concealer so once it's blended
I'm just going in with some concealer
and this process kind of takes a while
so I did speed it up this is definitely
the bit that you want to be the most
intricate about because once you've kind
of gone over it with concealer it's a
little bit hard to fix it so I'm just
slowly creating the shape and I'm going
above the crease and extending it
outwards and just making sure that it's
nice and perfected before I move on and
set that concealer into place so I
actually used the first transition shade
as the color that I applied all over the
lid and it's a little bit dark so we do
go in with another color afterwards just
to brighten it I really like the brown
tone on the lid and it being totally
matte so you can go for a sparkle or a
shimmer or something like that but I
find with cut creases and that's just
work a lot better and then I'm just
going in with a little bit of this pink
shade it's like a really like skin tone
pink and I'm just patting that on top of
this because it just lightened it and
brightened it a little bit which I kind
of wanted just because on its own it was
a little bit too dark so just patted
that on top and made sure that it looked
nice and smooth and now I am just going
in with some eyeliner and the eyeliner
shaped I wanted to go for was a little
bit straighter than normal and something
that wasn't as extended as I would
normally do because I didn't want it to
connect with the tip of the cut crease I
wanted it to kind of leave a gap but you
can just do whatever you want you can
connect it if you want but for me I
wanted to do something that was a little
bit different compared to what I
normally do for my lashes I am taking
the Lily lashes in the style
mikonos I believe I think that's the
name of these they're really thick and
fluffy and they just went so perfectly
with this look and then I just applied
some mascara to my natural lashes to
make them blend in trying not to get
mascara on the actual false ones just
because I didn't want to ruin the lashes
now for my skin I'm gonna be coming back
to the eyes later by the way but for my
skin for now I just primed it with a
little bit of the makeup forever
nourishing primer and then I'm just
color correcting because my skin is had
a freakout this month I think cause it's
the change of the weather
my skin's just broken out a little bit
but a lot of them are really deep under
the skin it's weird I think yeah my
skin's just changing a little bit
probably with the weather so I color
corrected and then I used my ex1
foundation and applied it all over my
face as you can see my skin is
definitely lighter on my face compared
to my body just because I exfoliate my
face so much I'm also applying my
concealer which is the NARS radiant
creamy concealer and I just used it
under my eyes on my forehead a little
bit and also on my chin and I really
like to make sure that this is nice and
blended in so I'm just blending it in
with a brush and then for my under eyes
I'm taking my brush but then also using
my finger because I really feel like
using your finger under your eyes is
just honestly one of the best ways to
blend in concealer it just makes it so
smooth and yeah I don't know like it
kind of nothing really compares to it
and I'm sitting my skin using the Too
Faced loose powder and once it's all set
into place I'm just like oh my goodness
like when my face is totally matte it
just looks so much smoother I don't know
what it is about my skin but the texture
sometimes just looks so much worse
unless it's matte like the light just
shines off it but when it's matte it
looks so much smoother so yeah then I'm
taking some bronzer this is from Rimmel
and I'm just using this all along the
outer portion of my face and I'm just
taking this underneath my cheekbones and
also under my jawline as well and then
I'm just gonna go in with a little bit
of the hoola bronzer by benefit and just
take that on a slightly smaller brush
and just use it kind of in the contour
areas but I didn't want to go for
anything too crazily contoured just just
a little bit of shape on these areas for
my eyebrows as you guys know I never do
this on camera so I'm gonna leave a
tutorial just there and I also did my
nose contour off-camera as well and then
I went in with my highlight this is the
UH Nastasia so Hollywood illuminator and
this is just one of my favorites just
look at that glow man so good I also
applied this on to the tip of my nose
and then we are gonna finish off the
eyes so for my eyes I decided to go in
with a little bit of black kohl pencil
just on the waterline just to really
make everything look nice and smoky and
then I went pretty heavy with this on
the bottom lash line just because like I
said I really wanted this to be smokier
than any other
Croesus I've ever created so I put that
on the bottom lashline and smudged it
out using some of the dark bronze be
used in the crease and then once that's
kind of smudged out and nice and blended
I decided to go in with one of the
Browns we used in the crease but one of
the lighter ones and just use that on a
bigger brush and just applied it quite
low under the eyes to create this really
nice like vampy smoke and I just oh it's
so good I loved that so much and you can
see the transition on the bottom
lashline I love it so I applied that I
also applied some of the Sur Hollywood
illuminator on the inner corner just to
make that inner corner pop and then I
finished off the eyes with somewhat
mascara and that is the eyes complete
all we have to do now is apply it the
lip color and for the lips I decided to
go with something really dark but
honestly you can apply whatever you like
with this you can apply a red a pop or a
nude a glossy nude it like the
possibilities are kind of endless with
this so use your creativity and use
whatever lip color you like I used this
one from Too Faced it is super dark so I
did go on top of this with a slightly
lighter red just because I felt like it
just looked a little bit too much like
black I didn't want it to look black
just because the eyes are so heavy so I
did go on top of it with a slightly
lighter one from Too Faced also and I
just felt like this really pulled
everything together because of the red
tones that were in the eyes as well so
guys at the end of this tutorial I
really hope you enjoyed honestly this
makeup did take me a little while so

bit longer than the normal the tutorials
