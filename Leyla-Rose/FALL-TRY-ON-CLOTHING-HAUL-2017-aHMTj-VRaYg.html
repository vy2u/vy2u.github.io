channel it's not a fool without the crap
because that's what I do better so today
I need to stop clapping do you know what
no I'm not gonna stop laughing I'm gonna
embrace the clap hey I have a child haul
for you guys and honestly this is
travels all my favorite videos to watch
the film as you know I love get ready
with me videos they're my favorite to
film but this is also like really up
there with my favorite videos got quite
a lot of clothes from a bunch of
different places and I'm just gonna go
straight into it if you guys haven't
subscribed to my channel already make
sure you do click the subscribe button
then then also click the bell as well so
you guys are notified every time that I
upload and then also don't get to follow
my social media as well my name is
makeup by Laila on everything just
because I can't get Leila rose there are
other Leila roses out there how dare
they until then I make up my limit on
everything Instagram snapchat and
Twitter so be sure also be sure to check
the links down below I am going to make
sure that everything is listed below
everything will be linked down below all
my sizes will be down below and yeah
that is pretty much all I have to say
let's go on into this haul because we
have a lot of clothes ok yeah I review
clothing hauls I always tried to pile
everything up into the individual stores
and I feel like I always mess things up
but the first store that we're gonna be
talking about is misguided I love
misguided I honestly feel like they're
always like one of the number one places
I check ASOS is definitely my number one
but then misguided is like very close
underneath that just cuz excellence has
everything like a source also has
misguided clothes if that makes sense
so I got some stuff from misguided I
don't know what order to do this in hmmm
I guess I'll talk about the trousers
first of all so these are actually
inside out because I just did the try
ons when it comes to trousers and he
bought anything on the bottom half it's
so hard for me to get shots of them so
everything will be linked down below so
if you want to see it properly on the
model you can click the link for each
individual individual see I'm gonna have
all of the clothing items link down
below so if you want to see it properly
on the model they're gonna look better
anyway but obviously I tried my best
with the bottom half I'm still trying to
figure out a setup in this room that
works for trying on for the bottom half
I haven't yet so terribly sorry about
that first two items from misguided our
cargo army trousers and I actually have
three pairs of camo trousers in this
haul which kind of tells you that I am
liking camo again I've always lost
cowboy but I feel like I'm definitely
loving it for this time of year so the
first one is this pair right here I
actually have the same exact pair in two
colours so the first one is this really
really pretty print with two kind of
shades of gray and then bug in Dior name
which i think is amazing for this time
of year and then I also have it in this
grey tone as well so it has like three
shades of grey and then the white as
well but the thing about these Charles
is like the only thing I've got to say
is that they are definitely more like
cargo trousers they do not kind of like
emphasize your shape in any way in fact
they kind of like make you lose your
carbs because they're so kinda like
straight leg but I actually personally
like pulling these up quite high and
then putting a belt with these kind of
like I did in the Tryon and I really
really like the way that they look just
bear in mind that they're not gonna be
the most kind of like I don't know say
feminine because feminine is your
definition of feminine but and it kind
of makes you lose your carbs a little
bit so just bear that in mind
I see like these are the trousers for
you if you want to make your butt look
good they're the kind of trellis where
you kind of lose shape a little bit but
it's totally fine like your curves still
under that you'll live do you guys know
if you've been following me for a little
while you'll know that I kind of stayed
away from color for a really long time I
started to ease myself into more colors
you can see I have a colored mood light
behind me I'm wearing red are you guys
proud of me I need I need you guys to
tell me how proud you are of me down in
the comments I'm definitely starting to
wear more color and I actually picked up
this cropped off the shoulder top from
misguided as well and it's so pretty
love the shade of this I think it's
really really nice it is perfect for
this time of year and it's just a really
really pretty color and I really just
like this I like the rib detail as well
it's just it's really simple but it's a
statement
because it's that a really nice mustard
color so this is gorgeous and this would
look great with a nice pair of jeans I
also got this box jumper it's cropped
guys already know I love black white and
gray you can never go wrong with that
and I really love white items as well I
thought you can just never go wrong so
this is just really simple it's
obviously long-sleeved it's lightweight
though it doesn't feel thick so it's
good for this time of year if you don't
wanna get too hot depending on where you
are in whatever country you are doing
this is always cold here so that's
actually all I got from misguided I got
a ton of stuff from a sauce a sauce is
my number one I love a sauce so much and
the first thing being this jumper that
I'm wearing right now um
I say it's a jumper but it's honestly
really really thin I would say that it's
the material of a t-shirt obviously it's
like long-sleeved almost like a
sweatshirt but it's really lightweight
and I really like that because
personally I don't always want to wear
really thick jumper this is really nice
and lightweight and of course it's from
Puma I love this kind of style red is
definitely my favorite color right now
I'm just obsessed with red like it's
just such a nice color the print on the
front on both arms and what are the
backs it's definitely not basic but I
really like it and I just love the
aesthetic of this top I love the fun I
really appreciate fonts because I like
doing like typography and stuff like
that so I really really love stuff like
this and I really like the font so yeah
it's just so random like that I feel
like I'm going to wear this a lot but
I'm not complaining I really really like
it I think it's perfect for this time of
year though I also got another similar
style to this but from vans and it's
basically this top right here it says
vans on the front of it it also has this
detail on one of the arms and it says
off the wall which is obviously Vance
Logan and it has this like really cute
checkered print why can't I talk today
and is this really nice check his print
on it which is obviously like signature
for vans and I just really like this I
think it's basic enough where you can
wear it for just anything and it's very
similar to this the material of t-shirt
material but long sleeve like a
sweatshirt so
I really really like that and it's
oversized as this one is as well and I
just really like the fit of this it's
just nice and loose really nice if you
just want to work everyday then also I
picked up this Asus basics chunky knit
sweater so this is the only I guess
really autumn thing that I bought this
is the most generic autumn thing that I
bought and beYOU can go wrong with
jumpers even though I'm not the girliest
when it comes to the way that I dress I
think that the neckline is really
feminine because it's a V car and
obviously like it's chunky but not too
chunky as far as the knit goes I would
say it's quite oversized and just very
very comfortable it's relatively soft
and it's just nice at this time of year
so I decided to pick this up just when
I'm feeling a little bit maybe more
girly I also picked up this a
lightweight ripped jumper as well and I
honestly love love the style of this I
feel like it Louis has a retro feel to
it and I just love that like an white
but it has this stripe detail on the top
of the jumper around the neckline the
neckline is kind of like a polo neck but
it doesn't come all the way up and I
just like that it's got a high neckline
and then it also has the stripe detail
half way down the arm as well I just
love this like it's really different
I've never seen anything like this also
picked up this basic t-shirt from vans
as well and not really much to say about
this it's just a really lightweight kind
of oversized I would say it's almost
like a boyfriend fit you really like
this I think this would look amazing
tied up as well just cuz I love doing
that t-shirt so you guys already know
this though and then also from a sauce I
got quite a few coats and jackets
because I don't know I feel like we
always invest so much into the like
lower layers and I can sometimes me
myself buy like a bunch of like print
t-shirts and just invest always into
that kind of stuff and then not enough
basics like basic tops and jackets
because in this time of year if you're
going to be going out in England or any
other cold country you're gonna need to
have nice jackets otherwise all of the
kind of fashion gets lost underneath
boring jackets so this year I've decided
that I really wanted to invest more into
just a nice jacket it's just because I
feel like I never do so the first jacket
I have to show you is actually in denim
Jackie and I have a bunch of denim
jackets oversized jackets obviously
they're not that warm and when it comes
to this kind of time of year you are
gonna get cold if you're just wearing a
denim jacket so I decided to pick up
this and this is actually from pretty
little thing and I love this love this
just because obviously it is a denim
jacket but it has this amazing like wool
on the inside which actually keeps you
warm it really does make you feel warm
which is amazing but I love that it's
kind of around the collar as well so it
just gives you that a little bit more of
a warm autumn full vibe which I just
absolutely love that I think this would
be great to do as I didn't try on and
where it's double denim I don't die I
don't know we're done of that often but
I think it would look good specifically
with this okay so this has to be one of
my favorite items that I have in the
whole whole and just because it's just
such a statement jacket it's not one of
them Jackie's I feel like I'm going to
be able to wear that often because it's
such a statement but I love this so much
it was pretty pricey I'm not gonna lie
but when I saw it I just fell in love
with it and that's this jacket from
Alpha Industries I love this jacket so
much it's just amazing so basically it's
a bomber jacket it's a very very very
good quality bomber jacket definitely
the best quality I have and it's very
thick you can tell that it's padded
really really nicely so it's gonna keep
you warm but obviously I got it for what
it is but describe this jacket as a
really really light icy blue and I don't
know anything in that color edges and
just everything on it is absolutely
amazing and that's why I mean when I say
statement it says NASA it says
one-hundredth space shuttle mission and
also on the arm you've got this detail
of the American flag this little like
zip on it I just I love this so much and
it just fits so well like it feels so
snug alpha products have the
authenticity born out of military roots
honestly I don't know much about this
brand but it feels it because this
honestly feels like a good quality
jacket I was obviously bought this for
fashion reasons but I love this and I
believe they have this in different
colors as well then another jacket they
is more of a coat rather than a jacket
this is kind of like a puma coat and
it's thick and massive and fluid it's
like really padded it's really big how
does this massive hood with this
beautiful fur on it I love it it's
obviously not real far I'm just saying
like the color is so pretty
and obviously it's cowboy and I really
love this this is actually from bershka
and I saw this when I was out with Ellie
when we were in Westfield Stratford and
I saw this and she saw the red one and I
also really like the red one I feel like
I might pick up the red one now because
I love the fit of this so so so much I
bought this in the size small but it is
quite oversized I got it because I'm
probably gonna be layering things
underneath it because I get so cold in
the winter this is definitely a coat
that I'm gonna be wearing all throughout
winter and I just like having coats that
look nice because I don't know I just
feel like like I said sometimes fashion
gets lost when you hide everything
underneath a coat so for me this is like
fashionable it's kind of like my style
my vibe to it but it's honestly warm
which is amazing because it does come in
red as well so I'm definitely tempted to
pick that up in bread so the last few
items are from a bunch of random stores
so I just thought I would throw these in
because I have picked them up recently
now mesh key boutique actually sent me
these and I just have to mention them
because they are honestly my favorite
camo trousers that's my own I love the
misguided ones that these fit really
nicely these are kind of in the style of
Joker's so they have an elasticated
waist band and then they also are
elasticated towards the bottom as well
like around your ankle and it does have
a little bit more of a skinny fit which
i think is really feminine and like I
said it allows you to be loose but not
lose your curves at the same time
whereas the misguided ones are a little
bit more like cargo trousers where you
do kind of lose your shape a little bit
I personally love these I just have to
mention them it did send me some other
stuff I maybe just wanted to let you
guys know about these because they're
insane I've worn these in on Instagram I
really really do love these I just
really wanted to mention them because
they did send them to me but they're
amazing so I will leave them linked down
below I just wanted to mention them
because I know that you
also I picked up two items from I saw at
first and the first item is this really
big puffer jacket and this is really
kind of like a statement piece because
it's quite big and it's a lot I really
really like you as a nice like edgy vibe
to it and I just really like this so I
wanted to pick this up it's quite like
thin the material you can tell it's like
not the most expensive material but it's
really really nice and I do really
really like this also for my surface as
well I picked up this oversized black
denim style jacket now this is a little
bit thin so this is definitely something
that you would wear more in the autumn
time rather than winter and something
that's perfect for me now but the reason
why I love this is because of the
detailing it has these I think they're
called iron this all along kind of like
the shoulder area and then also just a
long different parts of the jack and I
just think it was so nice and different
actually is zip up which i think is
really really nice for a denim jacket
and I think this would look really nice
across the shoulder kind of styling it a
little bit differently and I really like
this so I decided to pick this up as
well and I just really like how
lightweight this is this will be great
for the summer as well and then lastly
the last thing I have to show you is a
pair of trainers slash shoes because
it's not only local without buying into
my addiction of buying trainers / this
is all these on a sauce but they didn't
have my size so I went searching the
internet for them and then I found them
on shoe in my size I'm a size 3 so I'm
quite small in bands and I decided to
pick these up just so these are the
classic like original bands
although top but they have fire on them
I just can't deal I think this look
amazing with what I'm wearing now I just
can't do with these like I love them
they're my new favorites I haven't even
worn them yet but I am obsessed and I
just knew I have to show you guys so if
these are still in stock I will link
them down below I believe that they do
still have some sizes of these on a
sauce so I'll try and link that down
below and I'll also try and find them on
a shoe as well if there are any left on
there
in my country it was kind of hard to
pick these up I believe they had them in
on the US ban store but they don't ship
to the UK so for the UK a sauce I'm not
sure if they still have them Bob try and
link them down below as well as
everything else the guys at the end of
this hall I really hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did then maybe thumbs up let
me know down in the comments what pieces
