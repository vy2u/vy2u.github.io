channel so today I'm in a very different
setting I really really hope this setup
works if you don't like it I will not
film in this to up again I just wanted
it to feel a little bit more cosy got my
bed in the background so today I'm
obviously doing a try on haul and I'm
really excited I didn't actually buy too
much I don't like it when hauls are too
overwhelming personally I just find it
too much too hard or when there's so
many clothes I got like a decent amount
of stuff from two places so I thought I
would share what I got and I will
probably be doing more shopping because
I love to shop and I'm really getting
into fashions let me know if you like
this style of video and you want me to
do more the majority of the stuff that I
got was from misguided and I'm so
excited to show you what I got I'm
pretty much happy with everything the
first thing is this jumper that I'm
wearing now why did I just do that the
first thing is this jumper that I'm
wearing and now and actually cut out
around the shoulders and this is the
first like shoulder cut out clothing
item that I've purchased because I'm
looking I when I first saw them I wasn't
really sure how I felt about them I was
just a bit like why aren't the shoulders
covered like on your shoulders gonna get
cold it's just a bit weird but I kept
seeing them everywhere and I was like
let me just buy one and now that I'm
wearing it I'm like this is strangely
extremely flattering I don't know what
it is about it but it's just really nice
I love that it's in grey coz grey is one
of my favorite colors to wear in
clothing and it's actually cropped which
is really really nice it's ribbed
stretchy I bought this in a size 6 and I
just really really like the way that it
fits it looks really nice and fitted I
I've only bought I think one pair of
jeans before from misguided and I wasn't
really sure how I felt about it because
it didn't really fit me um I ended up
giving them away because I just didn't
like the way that it fit but I bought
these in hopes that maybe it would fit
me I bought eight regular but these are
the high-waisted laced-up skinny jeans
and basically on the leg which is quite
hard to explain so I'll just show you I
don't know if I'm gonna be able to show
you this in the Tryon so I'll just show
you now this is at the very bottom of
the leg it has a lace up detail and this
is on the back of the leg so right where
your cough is it has like this lace up
which I thought was really really nice
it's very pretty and different and I
really like the color I don't
have any jeans this shade I would say
it's kind of like a camel color I
wouldn't say that this is one of those
pairs of jeans where I feel like it
helps me perfectly
I just feel that it fits okay so this is
like an okay pair of jeans and I guess
the whole point of this is for the
lovely detail at the bottom and of
course for the color so this is the next
thing and this is basically a zip-up
kind of jumper feeling cardigan you
don't have to explain this because it's
like five clothing items in one it has
the feeling of a very thin ribbed jumper
it has a zip at the front and it's
shaped like a bomber like you know how
it's got the crewneck at the top of a
bomber I don't know how to explain this
it's kind of like I said everything in
one but I really really really love the
way this fits I think this would look
amazing paired with like a white plain
t-shirt or vest piece the next thing I
picked up is actually another camel I
don't know what's wrong with me like I
literally have bought so many camel
pieces last time in my last tour it was
all olive and camo and now everything is
nude and camel the Nords wrong with me
so this is a ripped jumper it's exactly
the same material as the last little
bomber cardigan thing that I showed you
it's very very stretchy it fits kind of
snug but loose at the same time it's
almost tighter towards my belly it is
cropped so it has a really nice affair I
personally feel like this would look
nice with a nice pair of high-waisted
jeans or if you wanted to show more of a
belly you could of course wear like a
lower rise pair of jeans not oversized
of course but it does look a little bit
loose inside areas which I personally
think is really really nice the next
thing from misguided that I got is this
body of course hard to show you so it
will be easier to see on the trial and
the neck is kind of a little bit more of
a plunge it'll show a little bit of
cleavage not too much in my opinion I
feel like this has just enough for me
like I personally feel like anything
more than this I'll just feel
uncomfortable in and then right at the
top of the neck it has almost a choker
effect which I really like I'm obsessed
with chokers to begin with course this
is a body so it clings really nice to
you it clips up down at the bottom so
you can wear it with leggings or jeans
so the next two items are actually
dresses and you guys might be thinking
they look when do you ever wear dresses
I know right I literally never wear
dresses
I saw this on misguided and I was like
it's not really good for this time of
year but I
looking for this in the summer and I
could have find it so when I saw it I
just kind of thought let me just pick it
up eclis a ribbed looking midi dress and
this is any pink nude shade I will this
in the size four which I know sounds a
little bit crazy but I feel like these
always come up really large and of
course you kind of want this to hug onto
your body like it is more of a summary
item so I would be saving this more for
the summer but I just thought I quickly
mention it because I did order this as
well but of course it's not really the
best thing that's suitable for this time
of year then something else that I
thought is just so Christmasy and
perfect for this time of year this is a
high-neck velvet sleeveless bodycon
dress I got this in the size six and it
still isn't super super tight on me this
is of course
red velvet which is amazing I mean I
feel like I'm literally in Game of
Thrones right now you know I don't think
of anything more perfect for the
Christmas season so I might go onto
mascara and buy a few more of their
velvet items because they're always out
of stock around Christmas time so if you
see these on there and you really really
want them pick them up because a lot of
the time they just go out of stock so
definitely grab it when you want it and
this would look amazing with thigh high
boots it would look nice with tights and
heels I just think this is the perfect
kind of Christmas outfit if you're going
for a Christmas party
of course it shows the arms but it's
again high up to the neck this is sort
of funny you guys I bought this in a
size four and it's still massive on me
absolutely massive this is an oversized
waterfall coat and I really really
really wanted this to fit me better
massive oversized clothes definitely
swallow me up but that's why I got it in
a size four because I thought if I get
an eight and it's just going to drown me
so let me get two sizes down I really
love the color it's in this beautiful
light nude and I just think it goes with
a lot of things and I also got three
pairs of shoes from misguided as well
the first one is a pair of heels which I
just knew I had to buy these are
incredible has a clear heel the straps
are also clear and then the sole is nude
so this is just a shoe that I feel like
would go with absolutely anything
they're actually surprisingly
comfortable I call these in a size three
I'm obsessed with them and I'm so
excited to actually wear these they're
very easy talking as well because of the
thick heel and I love them I feel like
they look way better on
do when I hold them because when I hold
them they look a little bit just like
kids shoes but when you wear them they
literally look so unbelievable on the
foot like it makes your foot look
amazing so oh that was the first pair of
shoes and then I bought two pairs of
boots they're actually the same style of
boots but in two different colors is of
course a thigh high boot I am showing
this there of course thigh highs it has
a little tie right at the back where it
fits on your size so that you can kind
of tie it to make sure it doesn't slide
down which i think is amazing and they
say that this is nude but I would say
that this is more of a tan color like a
tan flash camel I absolutely love these
they fit perfectly they feel so
comfortable they are of course a flat
also for the exact same pair but in the
lack and I'm so happy with these these
actually fit me perfectly
these are definitely gonna be like you
know your everyday go-to shoes in the
winter / autumn this is gonna be this is
this year's for me I did have a pair of
thigh-highs a few years ago from River
Island and they never fit me properly
and I was never happy with the black
boots you just can't go wrong because
they're flats it's perfect and I just
feel like I'm gonna lecture they're
going to be wearing them every single
day
pretty sure I've already shown you this
jumper because I bought this a little
while before so I've probably already
worn this on camera I bought this in a
four and this is basically a cropped
jumper and this beautiful Orange II red
shade I just think this is the most
perfect color for fall I just I can't
deal it's so perfect it's cropped like I
said so personally I prefer wearing this
with a high waisted pair of jeans
because I just feel more comfortable
than my whole belly showing I saw this
in Dorothy Perkins and basically Dorothy
Perkins was right next to Miss Selfridge
in the department store that I was in so
I picked this up and again it's this
beautiful tan shade and I just thought
it was absolutely perfect for this time
of year it's a really nice size actually
I feel like it's big enough to fit in my
phone my vlogging camera makeup keys
it's quite large so I feel like it's
actually really really nice to have this
was 20 pounds which I feel like is
definitely a bargain and that is the end
of my haul I really really really hope
