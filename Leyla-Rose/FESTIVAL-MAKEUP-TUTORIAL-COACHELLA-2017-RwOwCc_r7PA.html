so today I have an incredibly exciting
makeup tutorial for you guys it's a
festival makeup look I'm personally not
someone that's a festival person I've
actually never been to one I really
really appreciate the fashion and the
makeup that goes into it so I thought
I'd create something that you guys can
wear for going to one or if you're like
me you can just wear it in a bedroom and
take a ton of selfies comes up if you
like that because that means are a few
artists that did inspire me and I'll
leave their Instagram down below and
apart from that if you love makeup
tutorials like this that are a little
bit more dramatic then be sure to give
this video a big thumbs up and subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
let's get on into this tutorial ok guys
so to get started off in this tutorial I
am putting all my hair out of my face
using my Minnie Mouse headband and we
are starting off with our eyes I'm
taking the Urban Decay primer potion in
Eden and I'm going to be applying this
all over the eyelids and this is going
to be a really really good base because
we're going to be using so many sort of
not bright eyeshadows but we really want
them to stand out so this is just a
really good base and it really makes the
eyelids or one shade and we really
really want that so I'm just blending
that in with my finger and just making
sure that it's nice and smooth before we
apply any eyeshadow on to the eyelids so
for my eyeshadow today I am using the
makeup geek eyeshadows and I'm starting
out with this shade right here I'll have
all of the names listed down below I am
blending this first of all with a large
blending brush into the crease you could
start out with a slightly lighter shade
I did have a little bit of trouble
blending this so if you are a little bit
more inexperienced or just something
along them lines maybe start out with a
slightly lighter shade because it just
makes life a lot easier but we got there
in the end so that's the main thing and
I'm just making sure it's nice and
blended
so like I said I just took my time and
just really made sure this blended
really evenly and that it didn't look
patchy so once that is nice and blended
into the crease I'm going to be moving
on to my next shade and I'm taking this
beautiful orange e brown shade right
here and that's going to be our next
color
for this look for me I went for
something very very warm but honestly
you could pick any color scheme for this
look because it is a festival you can go
crazy with it you could use all
different types of blue shades copper
shade green shades cool tone it's
totally up to you but because warm are
my favorite I start with those so I
applied some of that into that crease
area I'm just creating that v-shape on
the outside of my eyes making sure to
blend it really well and extending it
outwards to elongate my eyes of course
it's quite dramatic because it is a
festival inspired look so you can go as
minimal or as crazy with this as you
like you can be really creative with how
much eye shadow you want to apply and
how much you pull it outwards the next
color we're going to be using is this
purple emo shade right here and I'm
going to be using this on the outer
corner on a tapered pencil style brush
and this is going to really be
concentrated in that outer crease area
to really smoke this out now you don't
have to be too neat with this because we
are going to be cleaning this up you
want to make sure that you're blending
in between as you add up this color just
because you don't it to be too intense
and you can't blend it out so I'm just
cleaning up the edges to make sure I
really like the shape I didn't take away
too much but I did want to make it nice
and sharp because that's the kind of
style I like but you do not have to do
this if you like something a little bit
softer then for the crease of course
we're going for a cut crease so we want
to start well cutting that crease of
course and I'm taking some concealer to
do this you can take the primer we
started with or a concealer and what I'm
basically doing is creating a rounded
almost half cut crease it's not a total
cut crease because as it gets towards
the outer portion of my eyelid I am
going to blend this with the rest of my
eyeshadow so it's a lot easier to show
you guys and to try and explain this but
this does reach above my eyelid I'm not
sticking with my actual crease I'm going
slightly above it and then stopping as
it gets to the outer corner now before
we move on to anything else we want to
make sure we are setting that concealer
into place because it goes above my
crease it will crease pacifically so I'm
taking this color from makeup geek also
a slight shimmer to it which I really
like it wasn't totally shimmery I just
added a bit of something to it and then
I'm taking some of that orange e brown
shade and applying that onto the outer
corner and we're going to start to blend
this in I'm keeping this below where we
applied that concealer and I did apply a
little bit of an orange shade as well I
think this is Morocco from makeup geek I
forgot to show this when I had to
palette I'm just making sure to really
really blend this in as seamlessly as
possible into that cream shade as you
can see if you just want it to be a
really nice smooth transition and then I
apply a little bit more Brown just to
make it blend even better okay so at
this point I think that this is still a
very wearable cut crease but this is
where it gets a little bit more crazy
and a little bit more festival-like so
I'm taking this white liquid liner from
NYX and I'm going to use this to trace
along my cut crease to make it look a
little bit something different and I
think it's very suitable for a festival
or a party or something along them lines
it's really different now I sped this up
because this actually took me absolutely
forever and I was finding it really hard
to do this on camera so did the other
eye off-camera and I would definitely
recommend really taking your time to do
the white because if you go wrong it's
so obvious so really take your time
doing that and now I'm just applying a
winged black eyeliner which you guys
have seen you do about a thousand times
before I do have tutorials where I focus
on this but just going for in normal
wing I did go for something that was
quite large just just because they're
going for the all the drama today you
know as much drama as we possibly can
and yeah it just pretty much used my
next matte liquid liner to create this
and that kind of just adds a really nice
amount of sea lioness to this work I'm a
glutton
I'm also just applying some false lashes
and applying some mascara also I don't
think this would be complete without
false lashes so I definitely recommend
applying some to add even more drama
alright so we can be moving on to the
skin for now until we come back and add
more drama to the eyes and I'm using my
seventeen skin wow primer to add a glow
to my skin now honestly I've been loving
this primer lately it just adds a really
nice amount of glow and it's really
similar to the Mac strobe cream but even
better in my opinion so
just applying some foundation now and
blending it out with my blue technique
sponge
this is pretty pretty average I didn't
want to include too much of my skin in
this because again I've done a lot of
videos where I focus on this button to
show you guys what I'm doing anyway just
so you can see the full tutorial I'm
just making sure that it's all blended
in and I did add a second layer of this
because I noticed the Real Techniques
sponge actually picked up a lot of
product so I had to go in with a second
layer of foundation and then I went for
a really nice bright under-eye because
we're going to be applying glitter under
the eyes I didn't want it to look dark
under there to make me look like I had
dark circles if that made sense so I
applied some normal color concealer like
similar to my skin tone and there's a
really bright concealer to really
brighten that under-eye area I used the
Maybelline age rewind concealer all
around the skin and then just under the
eyes I mixed that and the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer to really brighten
and add a full coverage onto the under
eyes I set that all into place as I
normally do just because I mean it's a
festival so you don't you don't - coming
off throughout the day I'm adding some
contour now for the contour and
highlight I don't usually go too crazy
and I didn't today either because
obviously we do want the focus to be on
the eyes and the lips so I just went for
a brandy shade something matte that is
going to sculpt my face slim it down and
make you look warmer and more bronze II
you know without taking away from the
rule focal points of this look highlight
I still have to have that I couldn't
take away from my highlight so I used
the iconic London liquid illuminator and
I'm obsessed with this at the moment
when you apply it with a sponge I just
think it looks insane so I applied that
all over my cheekbones and it looks
amazing to be honest absolutely love it
I'm going to be doing my eyebrows
off-camera I'm afraid so I will leave
some tutorials I've done so many brow
videos in the past I'll loosen tutorials
down below and also one on the eye which
I don't know which side I think it's the
right side I think I'm not sure okay
brows are done and now we're just going
to finish off the bottom part of the
eyes now I did apply some black eyeliner
into the waterline but I can never
capture this on camera because I just
struggle I really struggle and then I
apply just a little bit of eyeshadow
underneath it just so it would
looks totally Bab of course glitter is
the main focal point of the under eyes
now I'm mixing together a ton of
different glitters and I'm layering them
up all of the glitters I'm using art
from lit cosmetics so I'm going to list
them in which layer I did each down
below so I started off with a darkest
one so this one was a almost coppery
looking one so it was almost like a
similar tone to my skin and I wasn't
happy with that so I sort of went
brighter and brighter and it created a
little bit of depth to it and I really
liked that so I definitely recommend if
you're going to create the glitter tears
just go with it there's no real rules to
this just make it look like tears I
didn't really know what I was doing if I
was creating this to be honest and then
I went ahead and applied some little
tiny like sequins tiles on top of it
using eyelash glue and once I had done
it on one eye I knew what I was doing
but this is so fiddly but I found it was
so hard to capture this on camera
props to anyone that can actually film
this stuff because honestly I was just
going up and down I tried to capture it
as well as I could for you guys I just
used eyelash glue and tweezers to apply
them over the glitter of course you
still want the glitter to shine through
I'm just applying just like a few of
them protruding down to the tears and
just almost you know getting less and
less as it gets downwards towards the
cheek to make it look like there are
more stars towards your lash line and
then it gets less and then I did apply
three little stars as well at the bottom
of each little teardrops I've got three
on either side of my face and that is a
pretty much the glitter tee of guys I
really did improvise when it came to
this so do whatever you thought you can
make it any color you like but I did
make sure if you have the teardrops so
that it did look like listed tears so
yes that's what I did and I really feel
like the sequins made a massive
difference and then I just applied some
mascara onto the bottom lash line just
to cover up any glitter that got into my
lashes so I did my hair and this is the
hair so I came up with a cheery route
liked it and didn't actually film me
doing it because I really suck with hair
but if you guys want me to do tutorials
with hair let me know even though I'm
really not like good with them for my
lips I went with an all urban decay
lipstick on folks and love urban decay
lip products will
I'm up all over Decatur on this use the
1993 lip pencil and then one of their
vice lipsticks and one of their
eyeliners to create this little accent
on the center of my lip this is really
in trend now because it looks like a lip
piercing and I thought it'd be really
nice to do because it goes with the
whole metallic II look off this makeup
look so that is the finished festival
slash Coachella inspired makeup look I
