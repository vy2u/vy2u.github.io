as you can see today I am completely
fresh-faced because we are going to be
doing a vest impression review I haven't
done a first impression review in a
little while I know I was doing my first
impression Fridays for a bit but there
were so many videos I want to take it up
and it was taking up every single Friday
so I am still gonna be doing first
impressions but just not every Friday I
just woke up so if you're wondering
about this morning voice that is why I'm
so excited to try this and I'm gonna
tell you why so today I'm gonna be doing
a first impression review on the make up
forevers face and body foundation and
the make up for ever step 1 skin
equalizer and the smoothing formula I am
so excited to try these I got Trevor is
very new to the UK I could get to make
up forever in the UK but it wasn't in an
actual store where you could actually
like test them they were only really
online and then there's like one place
which i think is ear and makeup emporium
which is in like central London in
Kensington and that is really far I'm
really far but that's quite far out for
me so I would never really just go there
to go pick out makeup because there's
nothing else really around that area for
me they just opened won their first ever
I believe actual makeup forever store
the first makeup promo counter is now
open in Debenhams in Oxford Street I
went there last week and I have been
putting off putting these on my face
because I really wanted to put them on
on camera and give you guys a little
first impression of them because I
really didn't want to do it without you
guys I felt like I was cheating on you I
should be putting them on without you I
feel like I share my experience with you
guys so yeah I really wanted to try
these with you guys I just wanna warn
you guys I did get a dark color of the
makeup for a bus it might be a bit
darker that much skin but because they
make a firmer face of body is meant to
be like the Mac face and body be even
better a lot of my friends used to tell
me how good this foundation was I bet
you're thinking if this is my first ever
make up forever products or why didn't I
get the HD foundation I am gonna get the
HD foundation but they had basically no
decanas stock probably their most
requested foundation so it was all gone
I know the color that I am so I they're
going to order it online
and then I am going to pick it up so I
tested my foundation while I was there
but they actually had fun to buy and
stock so when I get that I promise I
will do a first impression review on
that as well I know I'm really late
during the bandwagon I think a good
immune review would be good to see on
youtube because i think everyone pretty
much tried that foundation like 5 years
ago so it's probably good for me to try
now anyhoo i also picked up the step 1
skin equalizer and this is the smoothing
primer there were so many to choose from
I was either gonna get this one or the
radiant one and I was thinking to myself
like why is my main issue and it was the
fact that I want to be smooth and I've
seen a lot of youtubers using these so I
thought I'd get the smoothing one and I
think if I get another one I'll probably
be the radiance one because that's like
the next one I think I've seen so I'm
gonna get that one as well so makeup
robot is gonna be picking up in my
makeup collection because it's now
available in the UK so let's just jump
straight into it so the color that I
picked up in the make up forever face
and body is number 34 I'm really scared
it's gonna be too dark okay I worked for
Mac for a good couple of years so I do
know very well how about foundations
work so this has the same name as the
Mac face and body so it's gonna be hard
to not compare the two so I'm gonna let
you guys know you know my way up so
which ones I prefer and yeah so I'm
really excited to try this
this is darker I'm just letting you guys
know but it's because I got this for the
summer because face of woody is so light
I wanted to get a really nice dark shade
so that when I have a little bit more
time I can use this in the summer
because I don't like putting a lot of
makeup in the summer time especially if
my skin is clearing up slowly
applied anything onto my face yet I'm
just gonna be applying my moisture
infusion serum from Mac and I'm not
gonna apply anything more because this
is quite a moisturizing foundation I
don't want to apply anything too
moisturizing so anything to oily
so I'm just gonna be applying a serum
today but I'm gonna apply a generous
amount of serum
it's just sinks straight into the skin
so it doesn't really have any oily
residue or anything so now I'm gonna be
trying the makeup purpose step one the
skin equalizer smoothing primer I am so
excited for this I love you guys that
much that I did not use this the whole
week I have heard this sitting there on
my table for a week and I was like I
need to wait I need to wait I can't do
this without them so I'm just oh it's
weird so weird texture I don't know how
much to apply this at the moment I'm
just taking like not even a pea-sized
because I don't know how little of this
you need so I'm just gonna stop in the
center of my face oh it's a nice texture
okay I'm gonna be more than this it's
kind of like a liquid and then as it
smooths out it kind of just mattifies
and you can feel it really smoothing the
skin so it's definitely mattifying I can
imagine it clinging on to dry skin so
I'm gonna see how this sort of clings on
the other areas yeah you definitely need
more of this
it's kind of hard to squeeze out it's
like in a really tiny little nib and I'm
like anything for my life try get this
out
all right next I'm gonna place them on
my nose and my cheeks because they are
the most bumpy areas of my face my worst
is my forehead and my cheeks I really
suffer with them areas being not very
smooth okay so before they get face and
body as you guys know my favorite method
of applying foundation at the moment is
using my sponge
this is way too watery and I just know
it's going to soak all that anything
watery a sponge will just kind of suck
up so I think a brush would be a lot
better for this i stippling brush is
gray I'm gonna be using the Real
Techniques buffing brush and that's just
this brush here and it's kind of like a
little bit more of a flat top so it's
gonna kind of pack on a little bit more
coverage so I'm just gonna apply this
when I shake it it sounds a very liquidy
actually sounds more watery than my face
and body so I'm very excited I'm
probably gonna need to put concealer on
my spots because I am just potty
unfortunately I'm just gonna top that
yeah it's very very liquidy I'm gonna do
this
it smells nice it smells like clean
don't you guys have a halite I guess
this is you talk to me because I know is
said that I want to try it I didn't want
to do without you guys so I know I have
no time for it I will want to use this
promise so I'm just gonna start to kind
of buff this into my skin and I'm just
gonna do this in circular motions this I
think would be the equivalent oh I think
like c5 in Mecca face and body
I reckon but just definitely do not
familiar women but I think it's gonna
kind of match my shoulders kind of I
really like the texture like I really
liked how it's but I am just gonna apply
one more layer at time just so I can see
how the coverage builds because I think
I really love about my face and body is
that it builds really well I'm just
gonna be passing it to see how much
coverage it will build and it does build
a really decent amount of coverage it
really does I'm just gonna be patting it
and not rubbing because I want to see
how far this coverage can go I just know
I'm gonna love these both like I said I
know the colors a little bit off by I'm
gonna be using this when I'm a little
bit more time up I know this is a little
bit dark on its own but I am gonna be
applying some concealer and stuff anyway
as far as the finish goes I'm really
happy with that
it doesn't feel oily or greasy and I
reckon that's because of the primer
underneath there and with the two
together I'm really happy with that and
I can just see it just being a really
nice smooth coverage I have really bad
spots at the moment this
nothing I can do about it and it's hard
to tell I wish I didn't but I kind of
I'm glad I have them at the same time
just so that you can see realistically
how it's gonna look on someone's skin if
they have you know not my thick skin it
happens but what on the rest of my face
anyway so you guys could see what it
looks like as a full thing and I will
just check back with you as soon as I've
done the rest of my makeup no so as you
can see this is how it looks with a full
face of makeup and I did just film a
tutorial so it has been a couple of
hours actually since I first told you
guys I'm gonna go quickly go and apply
some makeup so when I first applied it
it was about 10:30 and now it is 10 to 1
so it has been it's been about two and a
half hours since I first applied it and
I can honestly say that it's sitting on
the skin absolutely beautifully I first
applied at about 10:30 and when I first
applied it I could see my blemishes
coming through it was really nice and it
does feel very natural looking at it now
I can honestly say that it just looks
natural and I look like I'm glowing from
within and it is quite light for being
on camera if you record a new use to
photography and camera and just working
with flashes and stuff like that you
would know what I mean what I'm saying
it's quite thin for camera work because
for me I don't have clear skin to be
using this while I'm camera but it is
beautiful for a daily we're all I
literally done for complexion wise was
apply some concealer under my eyes like
my normal Maybelline fit me that I
always do and always search the place on
my forehead to just highlight that was
it that's all my done and I literally
just applied like the tiniest little bit
of spot concealer just on my spot like
when I say the tiniest little bit just
just to Pat it apart from that
everything else is this foundation alone
and I'm so happy because it literally
feels like I don't know my makeup Boober
it just feels like skin and especially
on these areas where there's nothing
going on for you people with normal skin
where you don't have blemishes oh my god
you're gonna love it because on these
areas where I don't have anything it
just feels amazing and silky on the
areas where it's a little bit more bumpy
even
feels silky it really does and I
honestly think that primer really helped
with it as well so I'm gonna come back
in a couple of hours just to show you
guys how it lasted after a good few
hours where and then we will see it what
my final thought of it is guys I'm back
it is been roughly about six hours since
I initially applied this makeup onto my
skin I'm not going to be able to come
back and film for the rest of the
evening
so I thought I would just give you my
final view now say I am really impressed
you might face a body gets a lot greasy
err than this and it barely stays on me
and I have been pretty active today I
haven't really been doing nothing so
it's been you know a decent amount of
activity and it has been pretty warm for
me to feel like my oils would come
through and it would get a little bit
hot it does look you know glowy and that
I need a little bit of powder that's no
problem for me because I am used to
having oiliness in my t-zone same time
on a lot of other parts of my skin it
just looks glowy healthy and beautiful
and it doesn't feel like I'm wearing
anything it doesn't feel heavy if I
wasn't wearing eye makeup I would
probably forget I'm even wearing
anything because it just feels really
good like actually feels really not true
and I can see this becoming one of my
favorite foundations I'm so excited to
wear this for summer and I'm really
happy with the color I got because I
just know it's the perfect shade for me
it's got the perfect amount of yellow
and the perfect amount of that really
nice neutral tone as well where it's not
completely yellow because it will still
look really good with a tan so I'm
really excited that's for the primer I
feel like the primer really did help
Eric and it would have got a little bit
greasy out if I didn't have the primer
underneath it so I'm gonna be using this
primer probably a lot more in the future
as well and I can just see myself really
liking these products but for someone
with a really really really oily skin I
would probably say to definitely use a
primer like this one underneath and it's
gonna mattify your skin on the dry areas
it just does not look dry at all so I
think this would be amazing for someone
with a dry skin great for someone with
more of a mature skin type and I really
like it and as for the comparison
between the matte face and body and this
one
I have to use this for a little bit
longer but I'm thinking I'm gonna prefer
this one just because it is just made my
skin look absolutely gorgeous and the
Mac face and body I don't know what it
is about it but it doesn't just it just
doesn't give the same effect
I think it's that it ends up looking wet
I'm not going do you not I mean
I don't know I really really like you
I'm very happy that I actually picked
this up of course is a very pricey
foundation so I definitely recommend if
you are going to be purchasing this
definitely get a sample first because I
don't know I always find it use for
makeup is it reacts with my skin I will
always find a use for it whether I'm
dark or whether I'm light out that
mixing thing see we do have any other
different and suggestions of foundations
and stuff like that that you'd like me
to try in the future and please do
comment down below but as for this one
this foundation is absolutely gorgeous
I'm gonna be using it a ton throughout
the summer and especially the primer I
just know all my oily skin girls are
gonna absolutely love this is it really
smooth it's gonna be great and filling
in pause and it's gonna really help to
prevent oily mess coming very so
honestly I have to give top marks for
both of them I've just I love them I
love them a lot my face doesn't need a
bit of a powder but I am completely fine
with that I'm used to powdering my face
all day long so I'm cool with that
