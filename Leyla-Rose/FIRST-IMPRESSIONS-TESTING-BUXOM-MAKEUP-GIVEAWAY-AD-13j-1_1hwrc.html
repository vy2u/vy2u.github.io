so today I have another testing video
and today we are going to be testing
buxom makeup and this video is kind of
special because it's in collaboration
with box sim as you're going to know I
will always be 100% honest and I only
work with brands like absolutely love
and you want to spoon following me for a
while notice that for sure but the
opportunity to test this was really
great because you guys have actually
been asking me to test box and makeup
for a while and all my opinions are
still 100% honest you guys know that
I've always been honest with every
opinion that I give but the reason why
this video is so exciting is because
there's actually a giveaway included in
this video so I'm going to talk about
that first before we actually get into
the video what's amazing is that five of
you guys actually have the chance to win
this box full of products that I chose
and used in this look this is actually
what you could be winning and then tell
you quickly what items they're gonna be
now but you are actually gonna see
throughout this video that I test each
and every one of these products is also
going to be a note in the box as well
from me so I'm excited for this giveaway
and partnership with box them before we
get into me showing you guys what box
and products are actually in the box I'm
just gonna quickly tell you guys the
rules and it's super easy you need to do
is click the link that's in my
description box it's gonna be just like
a quick form we can just fill in your
details and stuff like that to do is
follow buxom the handles right here and
also brown box and their handle is just
that as well but both of their
instagrams Brown box is basically the
company that like puts these boxes
together you filled in the form and
followed them both on Instagram you will
be automatically entered with five
winners they'll be randomly selected and
they will win one of these this
competition is international and it will
be open for seven days from the day that
this video goes live the winners are
going to be announced on the brand box
Instagram account and also the winners
will be emailed as well very quickly
before we get into the actual video I'm
just gonna run through each of the
products you'll see them in use
throughout this video so I'm not gonna
talk about them too much because
obviously I want you guys to see my kind
of like first impression and be testing
them in this video the first product
that's in the box is this bronzer this
is the hot escapes bronzer by buxom and
it's in the shade Tahiti also inside the
box is the box them may contain nudity
eyeshadow
and this contains six eyeshadow shades
you'll also be getting the holder liner
waterproof eyeliner and this is in the
shade call me which is a black eyeliner
also you'll be getting the box and lash
mascara I know I'm obsessed with lip
products so I'm so excited that they're
gonna be three lip products in the box
before you guys gonna be a lip pencil
this is the new plump line lip pencil
and I chose the shade undercover this is
that she knew and it's launching it this
month which is so exciting also we have
the box erm wildly whipped light suede
liquid lipstick and I picked the shade
it's tend to fall finally the last
product is the buxom full-on lip cream
and this is in the shade White Russian
you want to see all six of these
products being used to the test in this
video and keep on watching be sure to
enter the competition down below and
also by following brown box and buxom
cosmetics on Instagram now I think
that's all I have to say let's get on
into the video so as you can see I have
my foundation concealer and powder on
and I also did my eyebrows as well I
don't have any products that I'm going
to be trying fromfox them for those so I
just went ahead and done it before we
got started the first product that we're
gonna be testing is the buxom hot
escapes bronzer and this is in the color
Tahiti and it says that it has a light
island scent which is like really
interesting so this is what the bronzer
looks like and it has it seems like a
really nice Sheen to it so it's not
gonna be a matte bronzer that does smell
good that does not recognize the smell
kind of reminds me of like tanning oil
and a little bit like the nice tanning
oil you know it's gonna smell like
coconut in it it's really nice but it's
really light really lies if you get
bothered by scented stuff this won't
bother you at all watching it on my hand
it just looks like a really natural
Sheen so it doesn't look shimmery or
glittery or anything like that so it's
gonna hopefully look nice and glowy whoo
that is so nice like it looks super
natural so if you wanted to go for
something that made you look like not
truly bronzy this is a really nice one
to go for because it's like the color is
really natural like it's a natural
bronze color
you see compared to my skin it's like a
couple of shades darker than my skin
tone and then because of that natural
Sheen it looks really healthy like a
really nice healthy glow that's so nice
so although for my skin tone it's not
the darkest bronzes it applies really
smoothly
it doesn't look patchy whatsoever cuz I
have acne on my cheeks and I have that
texture it's really hard to get bronzes
that look nice and smooth especially
because there's shimmer in it usually I
would avoid that when it comes to like
any skin texture definitely like it
gives you that healthy glow that you
need in the winter because I don't know
about you guys but I am absolutely
missing the Sun right now I'm moving on
to eyeshadow and the eyeshadow palette
that we're going to be using is the
buxom may contain nudity eyeshadow
pallete these are the six shades are
come inside they are really nice they're
like neutral nude shades but they also
have gold and like these sparkly Browns
a mixture of matte and shimmer which is
really good for a pallet especially if
you want to travel so I think this would
be a great palette to travel with I
fooled you guys in a little bit closer
and the first color we're gonna be
taking is this natural nude shade right
here me this eyeshadow shade is such a
nice transition color just because it's
like my skin but just like a couple of
shades darker if that makes sense blend
all the colors into a color like that
everything just blends so much smoother
so I really really like that now that we
have our transition shade I'm just gonna
be going into this match shade right
there and then to the deeper part of our
crease just to give it a little bit of
definition before the lid I'm gonna be
taking the gold shade just because I
really like to go for them golden tones
haven't been doing to go for anything
too much on the top because we're gonna
go for something a little bit smoky on
the bottom I'm gonna be using the buxom
hold the line waterproof eyeliner and
this is in the car call me this is a
black eyeliner and I have heard so many
good things about this eyeliner so I'm
super excited to try this out it
actually comes with a show-up not really
needed a shop know basically glides on
like a gel but we're gonna be using this
in our waterline and also on the bottom
and then we're gonna be smudging out to
me
smokey I hate this honestly glides on so
easily so I'm just gonna take some more
of that brown eyeshadow and just use it
to smudge out this line our kind of look
that I'm going for is that kind of like
inverted smokey eye and then obviously
when we apply our mascara it will really
kind of like pull it together that
eyeliner blended so easily and I
honestly can't tell how good an eyeline
is gonna be because a lot of them they
apply like a gel but they're really hard
to blend out but this is really nice
because it blends it out so smoothly I
didn't need to go back in with any
eyeliner it didn't like buff it away
when I bought it it stayed really
pigmented okay so next we're gonna be
trying to be buxom lash mascara this
says that it intensely volumize
separates and defines
I love brushes like this where they have
the look plastic that's an describe this
but when the actual brush is made from
plastic and not the fibers I really love
what I brushes like this personally just
cuz I really find that it helps to
really separate and coat each lash I
also really like the consistency of this
mascara because it feels a little bit
thicker I hate when and scars are runny
so this is a really nice thick
consistency so that's my top lashes done
as you can see my lashes aren't very
long anyway to begin with but I really
like the results of their this mascara
is nice I really really like this I feel
like it's so rare for me to like a
mascara okay guys so I'm gonna go put
some full slashes on and I'm gonna get
my hair down and then we're gonna do the
lips and I'll be right back so I put my
lashes on and now we're gonna get
started it with the lips that's we're
gonna be trying the buxom plump line
lipliner and that's this right here I
mean it's obviously like a jumbo one so
you can use it to define your lips like
me or you can use this color all over
honestly it is so smooth it just glides
on I love about this as well as that it
actually has a brush on the other end as
well which is so helpful if you kind of
want to like blend in like the lip line
if you don't use your finger I usually
just use my finger but there's a brush
on the other end which is so handy next
we're gonna go in with the Box summit
wildly whipped lightweight liquid
lipstick that's the mouthful machines
tend to fold I know you could go for
just this lip combination on its own but
I'm gonna top it with a gloss which I
think it's gonna look really nice with
this look into a plant over this I'm
gonna be taking the buxom full-on lip
cream and this is in the shade White
Russian
