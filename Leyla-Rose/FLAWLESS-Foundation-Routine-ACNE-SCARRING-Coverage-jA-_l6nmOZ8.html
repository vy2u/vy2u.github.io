base routine for you guys and it's also
going to be showing you how I cover up
my acne scars because I do still have
some scarring from when I had acne and I
am also going to be giving you a few
tips and tricks on how to get your face
looking as flawless as possible so if
you do want to see how to achieve nice
flawless finish and just keep on
watching so first and foremost the most
important step is definitely prepping
the skin properly so the first thing I'm
going to be doing is taking some
moisturizer this is the bodyshop bitumen
II moisture cream and I'm just going to
be applying a very very generous layer
all over my skin even if you don't
typically have dry skin I still find
that moisturizing your skin before you
apply your foundation is extremely
important any tiny little dry patches
could be kind of sticking up making the
foundation look a little bit bumpy or
making a look patchy so the foundation
sticks to some parts more than the
others so the next step is still about
making sure that your skin is nice and
prepped but this time is making sure
you're priming it really well as well so
what I like to do first of all is use a
moisturizing primer just to make sure
that my skin is still nice and
moisturized because I do suffer with a
little bit of dry skin every now and
again and then I will go on top of that
with a pore filling or smoothing primer
this one that I'm using is from Too
Faced and this one's just really nice
because it's just nice and smooth and it
doesn't feel too thick so I like to
apply this onto my bumpy areas for me
the areas that need smoothing are my
cheeks my forehead and also on to my
nose and that way all of my skin
concerns are nice and taken care of and
that way my foundation will look a lot
more flawless so the third step I
definitely recommend anyone that has any
darkness or scarring from acne so what I
like to do first of all this involves
more of my under-eye area but I like to
apply some color corrector I like to
just apply some sort of warm concealer
under my eyes just to counter out with
some of that darkness and then I like to
take a mint concealer onto my cheeks and
also on the other areas that are feeling
a little bit red or that have a few
little acne scars on it these are the
areas I tend to go a lot of redness and
I will pretty much just blend that all
together with a brush I like to use a
lot of patting motions because I
personally feel like this kind of allows
a lot of that color
got to stay on the skin and I'll pretty
much just burn that all together and I
would highly recommend this especially
if you feel like when you apply a layer
of foundation that your skin is still
showing through it just allows you to
use a less foundation and to be honest
the concealer I'm using from soap &amp;amp;
Glory the green one is actually really
light coverage you can't really feel
anything on your skin that way it kind
of takes care of the color but it
doesn't feel heavy so I just wanted to
show you guys a very quick comparison
this is just applying color corrector
that is a very heavy at all as you can
see it's taking care of a lot of the
acne scars and now we're going to be
moving on to foundation so the
foundation that I am using is the ex1
invisi wear foundation today I tend to
skip between lots of different
foundations but this is definitely one
that I love and I'm going to be applying
this with a brush today because this
just works really well with this
foundation but some foundations I do
prefer a Beauty Blender it really does
depend on the actual formula that I'm
using I just like to pack a lot of this
onto my skin and then blend it onto my
face and that's pretty self-explanatory
again I like to use lots of kind of
patting motions and round motions too
but I like to Pat because this builds
more coverage as I blend this onto my
skin you will see how kind of easy this
is covered up what's on my face and
that's due to the color correction if I
hadn't applied any color corrector then
you would have seen the difference
between what my face would look like
with just foundation on it so if you
haven't tried color correcting before I
definitely definitely recommend it and
if you do feel like some areas are still
poking through you can just apply a
teeny bit more foundation for my
concealer I am mixing together my
Maybelline fit me concealer which you
guys know I love and a little bit of the
Too Faced Born This Way concealer just
because it's a little bit brighter than
the fit me and I'm just going to be
blending this in with a Beauty Blender
and whenever I'm bleeding in concealer
under my eyes I would tend to go for a
Beauty Blender because it does take away
all of the coverage it's very easy to
have a cakey looking under eye because
the under eye area is such a delicate
part of the skin so I definitely for
like a Beauty Blender looks really nice
and flawless a lot more than a brush I
use the love applying it with a brush
but I've definitely found that beautiful
it just looks a lot more natural and
flawless at the same time now the keys
are making everything look flawless and
allowing your foundation to stay on a
lot longer as well is setting it into
place and taking one of my favorite
powders from so
glory and just applying it onto my
forehead my undereyes pretty much
everywhere actually what this will do is
not only lock it into place but when
something is matte it doesn't look shiny
when something is shiny almost
emphasizes what's on your skin so if you
have bumps having a matte coverage looks
a lot more flawless than having
something jewy because the shine kind of
adds emphasis to the bumps I don't know
if that makes sense but basically matte
does really really help with bumpy
looking skin I've suffered with texture
for quite a while so I found that having
a all matte coverage it just makes
everything look a lot more flawless so
now that my skin is nice and set I'm
going to be doing the whole rest of my
base activities I'm going to be bronzing
my skin adding a little bit of
definition to my cheekbones and also
just like highlighting under my eyes and
all of that good stuff this is kind of
self-explanatory just applying a matte
bronzer I definitely find that keeping
again all of the products you're
applying matte really does help all of
the skin texture to look nice and smooth
and then the only thing that wouldn't be
matte for me is my highlight and I do
make sure not to apply it on any spotty
or bumpy areas so for me when I apply my
highlight I would only apply it onto my
cheekbones because that area is
generally quite smooth but if I did have
any spots there I would most likely
avoid applying highlight so guys at the
end of this video I really hope you
