channel so today I have a festive makeup
tutorial for you this is gonna be
perfect for the Christmas season don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already and subscribe to my vlog
channel because I am doing vlogmas
currently I'm vlogging every single day
running up to Christmas and I'm gonna be
vlogging a lot more as we get through to
2017 as well so make sure you subscribe
okay enough rambling let's get on into
this tutorial so the first thing that
I'm going to be doing is taking the NYX
HD eyeshadow primer and I'm going to be
applying this on to my eyelids just
making sure that's gonna be properly
blended in so there's no sticky residue
everywhere and then I'm gonna be going
in with the NYX ultimate eyeshadow
palette and this is in the warm shade
I'm taking this color right here and I'm
gonna be applying this into my crease
but first of all I do want to create a
really nice warm red toned crease so
this is a really nice transition shade
to really make sure that all the other
colors blend up perfectly into this one
next I'm gonna be going into this matte
warm brown shade is very orangey and I'm
going to be popping this into my outer
corner I want to create kind of an
extended I but I do want to make sure
that this color is really pushed
everywhere in the final look you can see
a lot of warmth pushing through the
crease so this is gonna start that and
I'm gonna go in with a little bit more
of a radius shade but this really really
adds some warmth so I'm just gradually
applying it into that crease area I'm
not being too neat right now because I'm
gonna take a makeup wipe and clean up
the shape I'm just making sure this
color is super super pigmented in that
crease so I'm just making sure to blend
that color into the rest of the colors
we apply beforehand just because we want
it to be a really nice transition
between the two you don't see any harsh
lines you just want it to look like a
very soft blurred shade next I'm just
going in with a makeup wipe and
perfecting the shape really transforms
the shape of my eyes so I love to do
this but you can totally pick anything
that suits your eye shape although I do
really love to use a makeup wipe because
it's very easy next taking a mixture of
these two
really warm brown shades I'm going to be
taking that and applying it into the
crease and outer corner again I am
taking
is quite high above the crease because
not only are we doing a slight cut
crease so we want this to appear through
we do want this ready maroon shade to be
very very apparent so that it can match
with our lip shade so you do want to
kind of continuously apply this until
it's very very pigmented with matte
eyeshadows you do kind of have to work
with it so just keep packing it on until
you feel super happy with the
pigmentation and then also be sure to
keep blending it as well that way it
doesn't look too chunky and then finally
I'm taking this darker Brown this isn't
much darker than the other shades we've
applied it's just a little bit cooler
I'm just gonna be taking a little bit of
this and just applying it into that
outer corner area this will just add a
teeny bit of shadow just to change the
shapes up a little bit we are gonna be
applying a thick wing of eyeliner in the
end so this doesn't really matter too
much but this is what I did just to add
a teeny bit of shadow next I'm taking
the NYX jumbo pencil in milk and
applying this all over my eyelid well
this will do is really help us to sculpt
out the cut crease we're going to be
creating I'm going to be taking a brush
afterwards to really sculpt up the eye
but first of all I'm just taking the
actual pencil itself and just going
straight to the lid I'm applying a
decent amount of this so I have enough
to work with and using white will really
help the metallic shade we're going to
be applying to really really pop as well
and then like I said I am taking a brush
and just using it to very lightly carve
the shape of the cut crease the shape is
quite different to anything else I've
created usually I like to create a
little bit more of a cat shape but this
time I'm creating something a little bit
more circular table viously suit my eye
shape but it is a little bit more of
that kind of circle shape this just
creates a little bit different look but
you can go forever cut crease style you
light I do want to make sure that a very
edge of the white eye pencil is very
very neat so that when we pack on the
eye shadow it looks super super sharp
next taking this L'Oreal Paris color
riche eye shadow and applying this to my
lid this color is so pigmented and it
gives a very foiled effect so it's
perfect for this time of year it's very
very sparkly it's we're going to be
using this and just patting it all over
the white we don't any white to show
through so you just basically want to go
over all the area that you carved out
being very careful around the edges to
be again very very sharp you can't just
like apply it messily you have to be
quite precise with this part otherwise
it does look messy moving on to eyeliner
I am going to be
creating well first of all I was kind of
winging at this point I wanted to create
a eyeliner that was kind of it stopped
at the edge of the eye and then the rest
was eyeshadow but it didn't really work
out for some reason it might have been
because the eyeshadow is using was very
very foiled so I ended up actually
creating more of a wing anyway but we're
kind of going for a softer wing it's not
very very precise so I'm taking the NYX
matte liquid eyeliner and just creating
first of all the line on my lid and then
what I did is kind of stopped around the
outer corner because I was going to like
smudge it outward so that it didn't look
like there was a wing if that makes
sense
I wanted it to be a little bit softer
than this but it still is softer than a
normal winged eyeliner so I'm happy I'm
taking some gold glitter liner from NYX
and I'm applying it all over the lid
right on top of where we applied all of
that eye shadow
now that our eyeliner is on we can just
apply it only on the areas with the gold
and I do allow this to dry before I move
on because this will crease and it will
sort of fold into your eye creases so
I'm just applying it all over and this
just adds the nicest Christmassy text
moving on to lashes I'm taking the Coco
Goddess lashes these aren't necessarily
from the drugstore I'm not easy to get
ahold of but they are probably the best
lashes for the price that they are I
bought these whilst I was in America but
you can buy these online and they really
are quite inexpensive probably the same
price in dollars as they are I'll Earl a
sh is and I've just honestly they're
just one of my favorite favorite lashes
ever as soon as I go back to America I'm
gonna buy them or I'm gonna place an
order very soon because I'm running out
for my mascara I'm taking the Maybelline
lash sensational and I'm just applying
it on my natural lashes to make them
blend in and I will later apply these on
my bottom lashes as well moving on to my
skin I'm taking my favorite moisturizer
this is the body shop the Tim in a
moisturizer and just using this to add
some hydration and then I'm taking these
17 skin while skin highlights a primer
and I'm just using this to give me an
incredible glow I absolutely love it
for my foundation I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
which is one of my favorite foundations
ever from the drugstore or high-end I'm
just applying it onto my skin and
blending out with my Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge for my
concealer I'm taking the Maybelline fit
me concealer and applying it under my
eyes just to really give me a nice
amount of brightness and also to conceal
my under eye circles I'm just gonna be
blending that out also using the same
sponge just to make it blend out
perfectly to set everywhere and make
sure that it stays in place and looks
nice and matte I am taking these soap &amp;amp;
Glory one heck of a blot powder and just
taking it on my under eye areas first of
all to make sure they don't crease also
on my forehead and just around
everywhere pretty much to make sure
everything is set into place I'm going
to be whizzing through my brows very
very quickly I do have a full tutorial
on this I do have a few but my most
recent one is definitely one to check
out so I'll link it right here on the
eye so click that if you do want to
watch my eyebrow tutorial so this
particular video I'm taking my brow
Autry pencil from soap &amp;amp; Glory which is
from the drugstore and also my L'Oreal
Paris brow plumper as well because it's
very inexpensive
moving on to the skin I'm taking the NYX
contour and highlight palette and I'm
taking this shade and I'm using it on
this cute certified brush how amazing
all these brushes find this color around
the outer perimeter of my face to
contour and to add a bit of a bronze cuz
I'm looking very pale this winter you
got my forehead under my cheekbones and
also around my sort of jawline area as
well I'm also just taking a lot of this
banana shade and just using it under my
eyes just to brighten it up a little bit
and now I'm gonna be moving on to your
highlights I am taking this I'll
highlight and I love it this is actually
an eye shadow but I use this all the
time on my drugstore tutorials and I'm
in love it's just so gorgeous like look
at it and now that I'm finished with the
skin I'm just gonna be setting it using
this NYX juhi setting story finally
finishing off the eyes I am taking this
eye pencil from remote and I'm running
it in my waterline and also underneath
the bottom lash line I'm gonna be
smudging this out because I do want to
create something super smoky and
dramatic but you can leave this lighter
if you want to leave a little bit more
focus to the lips I just wanted to go
for all-out drama and taking some of
that ready brown shade we used in the
crease and just using this to smudge out
that black line you're doing it to stay
quite dark and dramatic so you do want
to take it down slightly quite a bit as
well and also I'm just finishing up the
using some mascara the same one that
used before on my upper lashes and
finally for the lips I'm taking some of
these away about matte lip creams and
I'm first of all just taking this really
dark one and it's totally optional you
don't need to use too but I'm just using
this all over the lips I did quickly
line my lips but it got cut off from the
camera I forgot to press record of a
little bit of the next one but it
doesn't really matter just use any dark
lip liner just literally to give a bit
of shade first of all just applied that
one all over the lips because I did want
to have quite a dark lip but I wanted to
be slightly more red so I did go in with
a slightly lighter shade as well in the
center to create a slight ombre effect
by the way I just wanted to let you guys
know that these lip colors are under ten
pounds and they are one of my new
favorites you can get them off beautybay
so yeah even though they aren't
available in the drugstore
they are unreal and I love them so
