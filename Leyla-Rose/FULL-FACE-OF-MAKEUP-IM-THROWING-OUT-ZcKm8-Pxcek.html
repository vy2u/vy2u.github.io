so today I've started off with no makeup
on and that's because I really wanted to
film something a bit different today
I've actually been meaning to film some
kind of video like this I never jumped
on the full face of makeup that I hate
video so I decided to do this one and
this is a full face of makeup that I am
throwing out I just want to throw out a
couple of disclaimers before I really
get into this number one when I see
throwing out I don't necessarily mean
I'm going to throw everything in the bin
I have a lot of friends and family and
friends of friends they end up giving a
lot of my makeup too so yes don't worry
I don't just like throw my makeup in the
bin some of them they're like not in the
best condition so it's kind of like it's
best to throw it in the bin I don't want
this video to be negative in the
slightest just because I say that I
don't like a specific product doesn't
mean one I don't like the brand and two
it doesn't mean that it's a bad product
because it may work amazingly for you
it's probably a couple of products in
here that you're gonna be like really
because a lot of people actually rave
about some of these products and they
just didn't work for me so I thought
would be interesting to just like put it
all together did you saw Bella do this
video so I got the idea from her I'll
leave her video down below and I think
that's all I have to say I think I'm
actually gonna struggle to make it work
but I'm not gonna try and make it look
bad I'm actually gonna try and make you
look decent well hopefully hopefully we
can okay so I've already moisturized my
skin I don't have a primer that I'm
gonna be throwing out today straighten
for foundation and the foundation I'm
gonna be trying is kind of a cult
favorite and that is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation now I don't
think this is gonna match me it looks a
little bit light so we'll see how it
goes I don't know what it is about this
foundation but I just did not like it
like everyone was like you need to try
this foundation it's so good they don't
like the way that it's set on my skin I
don't know what it was about it just
wasn't that great can you imagine I if I
liked it no that would be really funny
as you can see uncle acne going on and
also scarring so it's not gonna cover
everything I totally gather I just
wasn't a fan of the formula it doesn't
look all that dry right now but like
when you get really close up to the nose
it just it kind of separates on my skin
and I just
like that see I love the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD normal foundation I think
that's such a beautiful foundation this
just keep tapping my Beauty Blender on
my face just like hoping like magic is
gonna have alright then so the next one
I've barely used and I feel so bad
saying this but this is the Fenty Beauty
ivory match thick skin stick I don't
know if this has been to be a concealer
or if it's just like a highlight stick
we'll try it as a concealer because I
think that's so you can see that I have
that I would throw I'm gonna do all the
concealers I'm definitely not a fan of
but I am getting rid of this I'm gonna
give this to someone just realized I
haven't I primal really loved the idea
of Fendi beauty I was like all foreign
no I usually color correct and
everything but this foundation just
doesn't sit on my skin I don't know what
it is I know I'm using a Beauty Blender
but it's just not sinks is going
terribly I'm actually trying as well
like I'm genuinely trying to make this
look half decent I'm not gonna lie to
you my under eyes can get a little bit
dry but this is just accentuating
everything so much more by the way my
eyebrows are just in need of being done
so badly
we go in and actually set anything I'm
actually gonna be contouring and I
haven't used this that many times but I
just didn't get along with this this is
the artist of makeup contour stick it's
actually it's blending okay today to be
fair it's actually not too bad
everything's gonna look a million times
of Lies I'm using so many products that
don't work for me all at once so I guess
everything together is gonna look really
weird going if we're gonna be able to
make this work obviously okay moving on
I'm gonna be using the NARS
translucent crystal light reflecting
loose setting powder those light
reflecting particles flash back so much
and I also just don't like the way it
sets either I feel like this power that
just clings to like every single bit of
dry skin still love this but this is the
bourgeois chocolate bronzing powder I'm
not gonna lie to you guys I've had this
for a while probably longer than I
should have liked you know and it just
goes fast like the amount of time that
you probably should have it
this just nothing comes out on this but
I guarantee you we're not gonna get any
color what did I say oh it came out
on my cheek a little bit though but it's
just not really just not really doing
anything for me okay so I never apply
blush if there's everyday for that it's
today and we're gonna be applying the
Becca Beach tint water-resistant color
on great water-resistant in the shade
guava now I don't know I think this is
this might be a mini version it was like
I think like a Duloc sample I don't
really wear blush anyway and I have acne
on my cheeks oh no I just doesn't feel
normal doing this obviously don't think
my face has ever looked was in my entire
life by the way it's game dawg so that's
why it kind of looks like it's getting
darker because it is getting darker so
the lid to finish off this incredible
skin next I'm gonna be going in with a
pure sunkissed glow strobe and highlight
parlor just not pigmented and there's
something about the formula that feels a
bit dry so I'm gonna play with my finger
and like yeah it's just like really dry
feeling and obviously the way that my
base already looks it doesn't look its
greatest okay so next we're gonna be
using the pure Browder and this is
nothing against this specific one just
any brand where they do this I just
don't understand like this applicator I
don't get it like I don't understand
like it's just impossible to get a good
brow like this it's so dark as well like
I'm really gonna try like I said my
browser pretty like bushy right now
anyway that was me really genuinely
trying I am not kidding that is me
trying this product I just don't
understand it I look angry with these
eyebrows applicator is impossible try to
find a spoolie so I can just brush this
through a little bit like hopefully save
it no this foundation is just coming off
my nose like I'm just touching it and
it's separating and it's coming off my
nose toe for eye primer it's a bit of
like a weird one but this is the
decay primer potion in anti-aging if you
have stupid dry eyelids then it might
work and just to like decrease those
lines I'm just gonna set this as well
because it gets
that's oily I'm not even joking I should
or some actually gonna be using today
and actually getting rid of all my Mac
eyeshadows now I know you guys probably
thinking what I've just come to the
conclusion that these are literally been
sitting in my makeup collection for so
long and I never reach for them anymore
because I just think there are so many
better alternatives I just feel like
I've become still angry with these
eyebrows you're gonna be just reaching
from this palette I can't take out the
colors right now I'm first I'm just
going into this white brown color you
see like this is looking pretty no more
like nothing out of the ordinary at
least one thing is going okay now I'm
going in with this and I remember
exactly what this color is cuz used to
be my favorite and this is rule oh my
gosh this is like memories it's actually
quite sad getting rid of this because at
one point matte eyeshadows were just
like everything to me before the color
antiqued on my lip this kind of look
really reminds me of my Mac days cuz
it's actually all I used to wear okay
now that I've applied this eye shadow
I'm actually like I actually really like
like I might keep a couple of singles
but I'm not gonna keep the whole
palettes just because they really do sit
there and I don't use them and or
eyeliner I'm using the 17 lack of finish
wet look liner and honestly I don't
think this isn't all bad eyeliner I just
don't like wet finish I like that okay
so for lashes I'm gonna be using the
Hooda Beauty lashes in the style common
I just don't I I hate these like the
moment I tried them I like some good of
you lashes but just not these ones I
don't know what it is but they're just
that kind of lash where like you know
when you close your eyes and they look
shiny yeah this look really like ebay
like and I actually have a lash glue
this is the Acedo lash companion I don't
get along with this you know what
everyone loves a product and you just
don't understand why that's this lash
glue it just everything comes off so
instantly for me whenever I use this so
I wanted to get them to stick it's like
the combination now of the lash glue
don't really keep the products that I
don't like
that often I tend to give them away
quite quickly as you guys know I'm very
specific with lip colors anyway I'm not
a massive fan of color but I do like to
try different things the one thing I
just couldn't get on board with was
metallics this one is the makeup forever
artist metallic matte in the shade 201
and honestly it's nothing like
specifically - this one just a lot of
the metallics I just couldn't get into
it like I just I'm not a fan of how they
look on me I definitely recommend the
lip liner wow I hate this so much
I've just never seen myself look better
than I don't know I'm keeping my Minnie
Mouse is on because I need to wash my
hair I'm gonna go wash my face guys I
genuinely tried with this like I
genuinely did you guys know me like I
wouldn't purposely fail something
definitely feel like good makeup is
important like makeup that works for you
is so important because a mixture of
just a ton of stuff that doesn't work
for you combined you just look like a
train wreck genuinely just go do your
bad this looks
I just need to leave anyway I hope you
