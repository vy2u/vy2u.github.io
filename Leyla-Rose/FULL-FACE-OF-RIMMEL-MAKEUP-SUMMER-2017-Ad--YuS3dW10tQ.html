so today I'm back with another one
branded tutorial and today we are going

I did the remote road trip with Rimmel

where twelve of your favorite influences
travel around the UK to show you guys
some amazing makeup and style
inspiration is so much fun and I'm so
happy that got to be one of them and I'm

actual Rimmel road trip with myself and
roxy is actually up on their YouTube
channel so I'm gonna link it down below
so if you do want to go and watch that
you can go watch it down below we had so
much fun we actually did a road trip
down at London which is of course my
home city
I hope so recreate the look that I was
wearing in that video for today so this
is an evening look I went for something
that's quite vivid on the eyes so on the
bottom I've got this pop of blue but
it's actually really really wearable
it's not like too OTT and then of course
I've kept the top of my eye quite Layla
the way that I've left it everything is
gonna be listed down below and they'll
also be a link where you can shop my
whole look as well so you know exactly
where to buy the products that I used in
this video so mine in Roxy's remover a
trip to London is actually the sixth
episode of six so we were the last ones
and we ended in London like I am so so
happy to be doing this and yeah it's the
best I had the best time so be sure to
check out if you haven't already is an
amazing video and we had so much fun
filming it so be sure to check it out
down below so without any further ado
let's get on into this video and I'll
show you how to achieve this look using
only normal products okay guys so to get
started I'm gonna be using the insta-fix
and go a primer and setting spray to
first of all just prep my skin this is
such a hydrating spray I love it it has
cucumber water in it and I just think
it's one of the most just the best thing
so this time of year because it is so
hot and it was so hot that I filmed this
so I applied that all over and then I'm
also taking the insta flawless and
applying that as my primer you can
actually use this as a BB cream on its
own but I'm just using it underneath
give me a little bit of a glow and some
hydration and these are from the new in
strange and I absolutely love this range
I use so many of their products in this
video because just the new in strange is
amazing so also from that range I'm
taking the insta conceal and correct and
taking some of the green at color
corrector and I'm using that to conceal
some of my red acne scars and this works
so well it's a really nice smooth
formula without it being too thick and
that's what I like in a color corrector
because obviously we are going to be
applying quite a few layers of makeup on
top of this we just want the color
soli and that's exactly what it does and
I just love it I'm using a buffing brush
just to kind of push this into the skin
because I don't want to move about too
much I sort of sometimes brush it but
generally I like to push it into the
skin that way I keep all of the
pigmentation and it doesn't move around
too much next for my foundation I'm
taking the Rimmel match perfection
foundation and I'm using this in the
color 402 bronze I actually have a town
right now and it just matches me
perfectly I love it so much and I love
this because it just has such a nice
coverage it's really actually quite a
full coverage but it looks really
hydrated and actually doesn't look like
you're wearing that much which is
personally my favorite type of formula
in foundations and I can get away with
wearing a decent layer but it doesn't
look really dry and cakey and this
definitely doesn't do that whatsoever
and it really does have a nice invisible
coverage and I think that's really
important for foundation especially a
full coverage one so I really love that
and I'm also taking the match perfection
concealer and I'm using this to
highlight my under eyes using this in
the shade 10 ivory and it's very light
for my skin tone but it's such a good
yellow tone for my under eyes it's
perfect for that really nice brightening
effect as you can see I kind of just
apply it in an upside-down triangle
shape and this just really lifts the
eyes and I just personally love the way
that that looks it's kind of like an
instant facelift which I love and I'm
just using a brush and my fingers to
make sure that it's nice and blended in
and also ensuring that I get some of
that onto my eyelids as well because it
is going to act as our primer for our
eye shadow
well to set my skin I'm gonna be taking
the Rimmel insta-fix and matte
translucent powder and this is also a
part of the insta range and I'm just
going to be using a brush to apply this
all over my skin I love this powder it's
one of them really nice finely milled
powders doesn't make your face look dry
in the slightest and really makes
everything look nice and smooth so I'm
just making sure to set everywhere
really just because generally it's so
hot in England at the moment so you
really kind of have to set everywhere so
this powder is perfect for that also if
you have dry skin or oily skin this
powder will definitely work for you
there's no flash back so it looks
perfect in pictures and it's just an
all-around really good translucent
powder I'm about to stop my eyeshadow
but before I do I'm taking some of the
Rimmel brow this way a brows tiling gel
and just using this to flick my brows
into place and whilst that dries I'm
gonna go on with my eye shadow and I'm
taking the magnifies palette I'm using
this in the shade keep calm and wear
gold and I'm just getting started off
first of all with this light matte brown
and this is gonna be our first
transition shade I'm building this up in
the crease and creating a really nice
extended eye just to really shape out
the crease and I just love the way that
an extended eye looks on my eye shape
particularly and then I'm taking this
slightly darker more pommy matte Brown
and I'm taking that into the crease as
well just using this to slightly deepen
the crease and just ensure that it's
really well blended through the color we
applied previously for my eyelid I'm
gonna be taking these scandalize
eyeshadow stick crayon and I'm applying
this in the shade bulletproof beige I
love this it really makes any eyeshadow
you apply on top of it pop so I'm
applying the gold from the magnifies
palette and just putting that on top of
the pencil and I just find that it
stands out so much more and I just
really really love the combination of
these two products together next just
taking the darkest color from the
palette and just using this to smoke out
the outer corners slightly I'm just
using that on a blending brush I'm just
applying it solely on that outer beat
area just to give it a lobe of that
smoky effect and we are going to be
applying winged eyeliner so I just find
that a little bit
darker crease complements it really
nicely I'm taking this scandalize pen
eyeliner and I love this it makes it so
easy to create a wing so I'm just going
ahead and drawing a line on the top lid
and then creating my wing afterwards and
I just like to create the shape of the
wing and then connect these two lines
together I just find that it's one of
easiest ways to create a wing so as you
can see I'm kind of just like building
the wing and then connecting the two
together for my waterline I'm gonna be
taking the remote magnifies double-ended
eyeshadow and eyeliner stick and
obviously it's in the shade of black I'm
taking the eyeliner side and just using
this to draw on my waterline to add that
smokiness and then I'm taking another
scandalize eye shadow stick and this
time is in the shade blamed blue and we
are going to be using this to add that
pop of color on the bottom lash line as
you can see it's such a wearable blue I
feel like when you wear color this way
it makes it so easy to incorporate color
so yeah I just find that it makes it way
more wearable we weren't gonna look at
you be like you're wearing blue eye
shadow it just makes it look really
really wearable and I love that so I'm
just smudging this out just to make it
look a little bit more blended and I'm
not really adding anything to it I'm
just actually taking that pencil and
blending it out and then I'm using a
combination of two mascaras I'm using
the wonderful mascara first just to
separate my lashes and add some volume
and then to really add volume I am
taking the volume colorist which is an
extreme black and I find this is really
nice just to finish off the lashes so I
combined the two together and it's just
like a little bit of a concoction and I
love it and that way I feel like my
lashes are good to go and then I also
applied the same mascara onto the bottom
lashes as well for my eyebrows I'm
taking the brow this way at fibre pencil
and I'm just gonna be running this to
remind our brows to make them look
fuller and honestly like my eyebrows I'm
quite happy with them but when I wear
eye makeup I feel like I need to add a
little bit of something so this is
perfect for me because it adds little
fibers in-between your natural brow
hairs and for someone like me that's got
kind of naturally brow hair there
this works perfectly for my contour and
highlight I'm gonna be taking the Rimmel
insta dual contour stick in the shade
medium and I'm first of all just taking
the contour side and using this to add
some shadows to the edges of my forehead
underneath my cheekbones and also onto
my jaw line as well and this just
creates a really nice subtle shadow and
scopes the face and just makes
everything look more in proportion and
just so much more sculpted and I love
that kind of look I actually love the
color of this as well because it adds a
little bit of bronze eNOS to my skin too
which personally I like a warmer contour
just because it goes better with my skin
tone and then I'm taking my highlight
side and just applying this to the tops
of my cheekbones and blending in and I
just love the way that this looks it's
so quick and easy and personally I feel
like this little contour stick is so
good for when you're on the go because
it's just got everything all-in-one in a
little package and for my bronzer I'm
taking the Rimmel natural bronzer and
just applying this on top of the contour
just too of course it make me look more
bronzed but also set this contour into
place
and then finally for my lips I'm taking
one of my absolute go twos and favorite
lip liners in the entire world and this
is the lasting finish a thousand kisses
lip pencil in the shade cappuccino I
love this I've loved this few years and
I feel like it's just one of the best
lip pencils to make your lips look
fuller it's just the best pen switchover
line your lips with so I'm doing just
that and I am gonna be applying a gloss
with this just because I was feeling
glossy and I'm using the all my gloss
lip oil and this is just a gorgeous very
subtle pink color and I absolutely and
love it so guys that is the finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
