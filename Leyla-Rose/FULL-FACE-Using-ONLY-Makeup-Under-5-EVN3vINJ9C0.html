so today I'm going to be doing a really
exciting video oh I'm so excited to do
this because I just feel like it's
really different to a normal makeup
tutorial know do I love this makeup look
but I do really like the whole concept
of this video every product that I use
today it was at least five pounds and
under apart from only one product the
only product that was above five pounds
was my foundation and that was $5.99 and
that's just because I couldn't find a
good foundation that was underneath it I
didn't want this video to basically be
me trying a bunch of makeup that I'm not
sure about I wanted it to be products I
basically love there are five pounds in
under and to be honest there was no
foundation I had in my collection that
was five pounds in under so it's $5.99
it's only 99 P above but that's the only
product whole purpose of this video is
to basically tell you guys you don't
need to spend a lot on individual
products to get a flawless finish I
think that it's possible with these
products and this is just one selection
of products I have I have a bunch of
other products that I wanted to use and
I was like maybe I'll do a version two
of this if you liked this video don't
forget to thumbs up and comment down
below if you want a Episode two of this
because this was really fun to film and
it was just cool to kind of find
products that were five pounds and under
so yeah let me know if you want to see
another version of this maybe I can do a
little bit more of something that
involved more makeup so maybe like a
smokey eye or something like that so
yeah this is the makeup look that I came
up with it's something quite simple
lingly this is like my ideal everyday
glam don't get to subscribe to my second
channel we're a lot more personal vlogs
and all that kind of stuff go on my
second channel and my social media as
well let's jump into the video so to get
started I'm going to be using the Olay
hydration and blur primer now this is
only four pounds 49 and this is just a
really nice moisturizing primer to bonus
primers tend to be quite expensive so
this is quite inexpensive and its really
good next for my foundation I'm going to
be taking the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless foundation and this is the
only product in the whole tutorial that
is over 5 pounds it's $5.99 still really
inexpensive and to be honest is actually
one of my favorite foundation I'm just
applying this all over my skin and
blending this out with my Beauty Blender
and this
Foundation is incredible it just looks
so smooth and it really does make your
face look paulus I just absolutely love
the finish this has it's very unique and
I can't really compare it to any other
foundation I have it's a very unique
formula it does dry matte and it's just
really nice and buildable as well so if
you have a little bit of extra coverage
that you need it's really easy to build
so next to conceal and highlight my
under eyes and to contour also I'm using
the LA girl Pro concealer and I'm using
these in obviously two shades one is
quite light and then the other one is
very dark to contour my skin now these
are actually an American product I
believe that these originated in the
u.s. I get mine off beautybay and I
actually bought these tune from IMATS
from the beauty based and so they do
sell them online if you live in the UK
and these are only five pounds and these
aren't really really good they have kind
of a matte finish and they're about
medium coverage but you can build them
and I think they're really good for
contouring because they do dry and they
dry on my skin anyway I really really
like these and I feel like they blend
really seamlessly also so I've just
applied it on all the areas I would like
to highlight and contour and I'm just
going to be blending the end with my
Beauty Blender
to set my skin I'm going to be using the
Rimmel stay matte powder and this is an
incredible 399 that is so unbelievably
inexpensive and this is actually one of
my favorite powders from the drugstore
now it's not quite up there with my soap
&amp;amp; Glory one which you guys know I love
but this just sets everything really
nicely and it's quite light so it
doesn't feel too cakey so it's ideal for
everyday wear I really like this and I
just think it does its job eautifully to
fill in my eyebrows I'm using this brow
pencil from ELF and this is only three
pounds this is really nice I could
compare the formular of this a little
bit to the UH Nastasia brow definer it's
not the same in any way by all means but
the formula is quite similar it's kind
of got that waxy formula and I do really
like it I really like the way that my
brows came out after using this
considering the price I think it's 100%
worth a try and I think you might really
like this so yeah definitely give this a
try because it's really inexpensive and
it does its job really nicely I also
went ahead and highlighted underneath my
brow using the LA girl Pro concealer
again just using this on a flat brush
just to highlight that under-eye area
this concealer is actually really nice
to highlight I usually like to use a
cream concealer rather than a liquid but
this actually looked really nice
underneath the brow for my blush and
also my bronzer I'm using this elf
contouring blush duo and I'm using Lee
bronzer shade of course as my bronzer
and I'm also going to be using the blush
shade to add some color onto the apples
of my cheeks now together this is 4
pounds 50 which kind of means is 2
pounds
25 each if you look at it in that sense
that's extremely inexpensive and these
are both matte very pigmented and I
think these have a high quality feel to
them very comparable to Knaus the
packaging even looks like NARS and I
just really really like this
today to highlight I'm actually going to
be using an eyeshadow and this is the
elf baked eyeshadow in the shade and
chanted this is only four pounds fifty
which is an incredible price for a
highlight I think it's quite hard to
find a nice highlight in the drugstore
for a really inexpensive price and I
love this it gives a really nice subtle
glow from within and in photographs this
came out so beautiful and it just gives
a really nice rose gold nasaan to the
tops of your cheekbones and I love it on
my eyes I'm just reusing some of the
bronzer shade just because I didn't want
to go into any extra eye shadows I
wanted to keep this look very simple so
I'm applying some of that into the
crease for my lid I'm gonna be taking
this berry em dazzle dust which is
basically like a loose pigment and I'm
gonna be applying this onto my lid look
how gorgeous this color is it's just
such a gorgeous warm gold and I'm
obsessed with it this is actually only
four pounds 59 which again is so
inexpensive you will never run out of
the pigment so I just think it's insane
that it's that cheap and these are so
pigmented and actually some of my
favorite pigments out there the Rimmel
eyeliner I'm using is this scandalize
one and this is only 399 it's one of my
favorite black eyeliners because it does
stay put in the waterline and it's
really really black as well so it's
definitely one of the best black
eyeliners I have for my lashes I'm using
the Ardell wispy lashes and again these
are one of my favorites I use these on
the regular these are only three pounds
17 from Amazon and I think that's just
insanely cheap for eyelashes these are
just such a timeless style of lash and I
think everyone looks good in a wispy
pair of lashes so I'm just applying some
of those and some tweezers and some glue
and then applying some mascara it's gara
I'm using is the BH Cosmetics long sexy
lashes mascara which is only 4 pounds 50
for my lips I'm taking this lipliner
from NYX and this is only three pounds
I'm taking in this brown shade because
you guys know I love to go for a brown
turned nude so I'm just applying this on
the ABS perimeter of my lips and this
lip liner is actually really nice it's
very blendable and very pigmented and
the actual lipstick I'm using is from
Maybelline and this is the Maybelline
Color show crayon and I'm using this in
a nude shade also I am actually obsessed
with this and I've been wearing this
constantly for the last couple of days I
just think this is such a gorgeous color
and I just love it so guys that is the
end of this video I really hope you
enjoyed thumbs up for more videos like
this and subscribe to my channel if you
