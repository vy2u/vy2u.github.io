this one is going to be a little bit
weird this video and it's gonna be not
like the usual tutorials I tend to make
so as you can see I've started off this
video with no makeup on and that is
because today I'm going to be doing a
challenge today I'm gonna be doing my
full face of makeup without using a
single makeup brush without using a
single makeup sponge and basically
everything is gonna be done with my
hands and I am kind of scared I've seen
this makeup challenge of floating around
YouTube a little bit and I wanted to
create my own version of this I am going
to attempt to make my makeup look as
good as I possibly can
so I'm gonna go for the full face
meaning eyeliner and everything I don't
know how we're gonna do this so firstly
to pry my skin I'm going to be taking
the makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer and I can do
this bit with my hands so far so good
okay so this is what I get scared I used
to apply my foundation with my hands
back when I was really young girl I'm
kind of hyperventilating I could just
feel like this is gonna go horribly
wrong he said my foundation I'm using is
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
it's my favorite foundation and I just
feel like it's one of the most foolproof
foundations that I own so let it fight
with going wild and I'm just rubbing in
I sometimes use my hands when I use a BB
cream this still doesn't feel true
Pacey's so far so good I'm just gonna be
applying a little bit concealer on my
cheeks because I have some scarring and
I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
concealer for that and we nails are too
long
I'm having to like put my knuckle in it
nothing like separation anxiety from my
brushes that's how I feel I just bought
this does not feel natural normal I
don't usually do I'm gonna move on to my
eyes and then I'm going to come back to
the rest of my skin later what I'm gonna
be doing is taking some of the pro my
concealer from mac and I'm using this in
the shade NC 15 now this is quite light
but that's because I want to get quite a
bright under eye and I'm just going to
be taking this onto my lids first of all
and then later on we're gonna be using
some of this underneath my eyes as well
I'm just gonna be taking a little bit of
my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
and just popping a little bit onto my
finger it's gonna be setting the eyelid
I just feel like I need that a little
bit of extra dryness otherwise it
definitely won't blend because I'm gonna
have to blend it using my finger so
using the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette I'm gonna be taking and peanut
butter which is this color right here
and I'm just gonna be taking this I
don't know what finger to use she's
amazing my ring finger and blowing off
the excess I'm really scared
okay okay
but just going to follow the crease of
my eye I'm just going in circular motion
and then just like that's gonna work
kind of it could be a lot worse it's
going alright see notes
okay to this eye and I just it's really
hard he said when you get to the other
eye because you have to cross over your
body it feels quite weird so I'm gonna
have to use my right hand and I'm
actually left hand it so it feels I
think the darkest color I'm going to use
today is just truffled so I'm just going
to be taking at this color right here
it's going to be applying this on the
outer part of my eyelid and just take it
into the crease
it's not blending as well as I wish it
would but it's gonna have to do my
actual eyelid I'm going to be using a
color eyeshadow this is the super shock
i shadow in a maze and this is better
apply of your fingers anyway we find
doing this everything is I do have long
nails so it could be a little bit
challenging I cannot be held accountable
for the faces I make throughout the
duration of this video because I'm
struggling so now it's time for probably
one of the most challenging parts of the
whole thing the eyeliner so I'm gonna be
using some of these tart tart East clay
paint liner because this is quite smooth
and I just feel like I need to smooth
right now always happening you know this
this is gonna torment me you guys know
how much eyeliner means to me as well
how I'm gonna do this eyeliner
all over my face is a mystery don't know
why I might pick myself through this
dress I have not again
oh my gosh it's gonna be alright if I
actually pull this off I will be very
proud I'm actually stress
it was so much of a char go and I'm
still really unhappy with it like I do
not like the way that it looks asshole
now I've got to do another one I went
wrong accuse someone of the color pop
eyeshadow it once it's dried just to
raise it con get into the palm of my eye
probably one of the hardest things I've
ever done
yeah they're totally not even and this
one is way thinner is probably the most
time I have ever ever spent on my
eyeliner in my life worried I'm not
gonna have enough footage on my camera
it's on the rest of my face I'm done the
rule against using makeup wipes okay
makeup wipe it is I'm gonna clean up the
sides and I feel like that's gonna save
my whole life
and then I can cover it with concealer
and that's gonna fix everything
okay I'm going in with some more of that
see that I used on my eyelids the one
from Mac nowadays I literally don't use
anything to blend in my concealer apart
from a Beauty Blender like I just I just
call it nothing looks the same
but it's all good and well when you look
from far away but the closer you get
you're like this is just not working I
miss you but using some of my two-faced
primed and flawless powder and just pop
it on my middle finger they use like
achievement essentially interest very
gently used to rub it in a circular
motion I don't know what people did
before they have makeup brushes but this
is as good as it's gonna get I think
okay so now I have my base on I'm gonna
do some bronzer now the bronze I'm gonna
use again I'm kind of cheating a little
bit but I need I need it all right now
I'm gonna use a cream bronzer just
because creams are so much easier to
blend with your fingers but I'm just
going to be taking the town a date shoot
the pig needs hat you'll be taking this
too late and a Chanel Chanel I really
hope you guys are enjoying this like I
really didn't think that this would
torment me that much
using cream products really help because
they just blend so much easier and I
just feel like if I try with a powder
now I just feel like that would know who
what I'm just every taking some of the
iconic London and strobing stick again
this is a cream so this is gonna look
really nice and you can blend it with
your fingers now I'm gonna go in for an
intense highlight look
just what I've been slapping my face all
day Oh skin it's done unfortunately now
I'm gonna move on to my eyebrows now of
course the things that I love to use is
a brow pencil and I am NOT gonna
straight from that because I can't to do
my eyebrows my fingernail so I'm gonna
stick with my uh Nastasia brow is that
is broken the spoolie is off the other
end anyway so I'm going to be using this
with no spoolie so nothing to brush
through it unfortunately I'm just going
to be using the brow way so I'm gonna
have to use my finger to brush through
my brows but abusing these satified
Calypso lashes I absolutely love the set
of eyelashes they're definitely one of
my favorites right now so I'm just gonna
take this measure it to my eye and then
I'm going to glue it without using
tweezers because in my opinion I count
tweezers as a makeup tool so I'm going
to use just my fingers to apply them to
my lash line
I just feel like I need something old
about flashlights I'm gonna take some of
this pencil
why not just I'm quiet my waterline
if I'm gonna continue my lips just going
to do a normal that combination I always
do very quickly in a speedy manner and
then I want to come and chat to you guys
at the end
so guys at the end of this challenge as
you can see this is how it turns out I
am going to be showing you some
close-ups of right now and my overall
thing of this is that I appreciate
makeup Russian is a lot like I really
appreciate them honestly I don't know
what I'd do without them like if I had
to do this on a daily basis it would
legitimately take me three hours to get
ready the part I personally found the
most challenging was the eyeliner of
course it was just it took me so long
and I definitely thought because I have
fake nails yes they're long but I don't
know if it's even they're not thin
they're not thin like a natural nail
that kind of thick so it was hard to get
my eyeliner to come to a real nice point
apart from that I feel like the
eyeshadow actually went really well next
time if I ever do this challenge again
I'll definitely try to some darker
shades I was afraid for this time
because I wanted to focus on me my
eyeliner so I didn't want it to be dark
with a messy eyeliner as well so yeah
everything apart from that was okay like
it wasn't totally challenging to do the
parts that felt really unnatural was
probably the base like the base just
felt really unnatural when it came to
the highlight and stuff like that that
was fine but when it comes to wanting to
set your your base it just feels really
weird going like that with powder it
just feels really strange can't go out
like this and be like yeah it's fine no
one's gonna notice anything but for me
when I look at my own makeup I just
thought everything just looks off you
know I mean like it just doesn't look
right
but then it was funny for you guys I
hope this makes you smile who can make
you laugh and I hope they made you
appreciate makeup brushes and also their
liquid eyeliner brushes I appreciate
