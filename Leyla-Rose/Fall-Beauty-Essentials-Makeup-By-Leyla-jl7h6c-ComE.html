today I'm going to be showing you guys
some of my personal full essentials this
is mainly going to be skincare makeup
and a few hair and nail products as well
so I'm just going to be telling you guys
the stuff that I just can't get enough
for for this time of year and stuff that
I think that all of you guys should be
using because I love them that much as
well so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you doin know all of the
products that I love to use this time of
year then please just keep on watching
so I'm going to get started off first of
all with skin mainly because I feel like
as it gets to the colder months I feel
like the temperatures do definitely
start to drop it definitely does depend
on where you are in the world but here
in the UK it pretty much drops straight
away I'm already reaching for my onesies
and my fluffy socks I'm feeling really
cold now so I do feel like we have to
take care of our skin a little bit
differently to how we would in the
summertime personally have a combination
skin so I do get oily oily all
throughout the year why do suffer
sometimes with dehydrated at dry skin as
well so I definitely need to accommodate
my skin to that especially in the winter
because I do feel like I do flare up on
my face especially with a little bit of
eczema and just dry skin in general I do
feel like as it gets to the winter
months I stop to transition into a more
hydrating skin care routine I know I
haven't told you guys my actual skin
care routines because I am changing
things up but I'm gonna tell you guys a
few of my skincare essentials that I
just love to talk about a million
products from the body shop but these
particular to really really really stand
out for me one is the vitamin E intense
moisture cream this is incredible I use
this in the daytime and sometimes the
night time by justin we use this
multiple times just love how
moisturizing this is I really feel like
it doesn't clog my pores it's really
light but it really moisturizes really
nicely plus it's not expensive and it's
just really easy to keep repurchasing
this definitely one of my favorite
moisturizers and especially as we're
getting to the colder months I just
absolutely love this also just to add a
little bit more moisture into the skin I
love to use facial sprays and one I feel
like I've been reaching for a lot of
something I feel like I'm going to be
reaching to all the way into the winter
this one is the body shop vitamin E face
mist is mainly rosewater and glycerin
but it really hydrates and it just adds
an extra step into your skin care just
to give you a little bit spritz I like
to apply it sometimes on my makeup when
my makeup looks a little bit dry before
my makeup and also just generally a part
of my skincare routine too I like to
apply this for my face it's just a
little bit dry it just adds a little bit
of extra moisture to love facial mists
in the autumn time and I just feel like
I really like to use them as it gets
colder and the skin gets drier also
something that I feel like I haven't
talked about before but I use it a ton
and I just feel like it needs to be
mentioned I do for this will be great in
the autumn and the winter time and all
throughout the years well this is the
vanity planet spin for perfect skin
device this is basically a cleansing
brush similar to the clarisonic but a
lot more affordable which is amazing it
comes with four different brush heads
and the three brush heads that I
particularly have been using a ton and I
firth going to be amazing is the
cleansing exfoliator and the body brush
and I just wanted to share this with you
guys because I do feel like it's going
to be stable throughout the colder
months to really exfoliate and remove
all dead skin cells from the face just
cleanses really well and especially
because in the autumn time we're using
so much more makeup this will just make
sure to remove all of that I do you have
a discount code so that you guys can get
seventy percent off of this it's usually
a hundred dollars but with my discount
codes you can get it for thirty dollars
I highly recommend this guy's and I just
know that you will love it their
customer service is amazing as well so
if you have any questions or anything
like that the vanity planet store people
are amazing so I will list the little
discount code here on the screen and
I'll also pop it down below as well for
you i get x mark i have had ex smart for
since i can remember i think i've had
eczema pretty much since i was born just
always had it i suffer with it a lot on
my legs you guys don't see my legs often
but behind my knees I getting quite bad
and I do get it sometimes on my hands as
well in the winter time especially I
always tend to go back to this
particular one because I feel like it's
just the best this is the palmers cocoa
butter I absolutely love this from my
lifetime I must have gone through a
hundred of these I don't think I've ever
mentioned it on my channel before
because I don't tend to
what 40 care that much but this is the
moisturizer I use pretty much all over
my body especially on my xmin areas
because this helps to remove scar so any
scarring I get from the eczema raw
eczema that's really painful this really
helps to sue there's well prefer this
over the creams that my doctors have
given me I just really really love this
so as it starts to get colder and the
skin gets really really dry this is my
go-to I honestly cannot live without
this and I'm so almost finished this one
of course I need to repurchase this I
particularly like this one I know they
have different types if I just like the
original one with the vitamin e in it
because vitamin E is super moisturizing
this is an absolutely essential for me
in this time of year and I have one more
body kind of care products this is the
gradual tan from st. Tropez this is in
the color medium to dark you guys know I
have spoken about this a lot in the past
take us to the full time I feel why we
start to lose our natural color really
like to take this product all the way to
the winter months because it's not super
harsh and because I am fairly tanned
naturally I do feel like this is a
really nice addition just to give myself
a little bit of color to make me feel
like I'm a little bit more healthy in
the wintertime I do feel like I can look
really really pale and because I'm quite
dark I've got dark hair and dark eyes
dark brows I feel like a little bit of a
tan just looks a lot healthier than me
so I like to use the st. Tropez gradual
tan because it moisturizes at the same
time it's giving you a natural glowing
turn and the fact that it's the medium
to dark one means that it actually shows
up really nicely or me so I was trying
to think of what hair care products are
a must for me in this time of year and I
could only think of one this is also a
skincare product and I do like to use
this as a moisturizer and I like to add
this into my foundation as well so it's
like an all around good product this is
the mia flora argan oil I'm pretty sure
I've spoken about this in multiple
videos in the past is an all-purpose
natural oil so you can use it in your
hair you can use it on your face and you
can also use it for ever else you need
to as well I love using this when my
hair feels dry it's nice on the ends of
their hair to prevent breakage
especially in the UK if it gets pretty
cold so when it feels really horrible
bitterly cold this just helps to retain
moisture
into my hair and I love it i also like
to use this on my face if I have any dry
patches this will just moisturize them
straight away and I also love this to
mix into my foundation because it just
makes whatever foundation I'm using a
little bit scherer and also more
moisturizing as what the next I'm going
to be moving on to the makeup products
this is pretty much what everyone was
waiting for am i right first of all I
have three eyeshadows to show you they
all happen to be makeup geek but they
are amazing colors the first one's
called desert sands is just this color
right here it's basically like a burnt
yellow brown it's amazing this color is
extremely similar to Mac uninterruptedly
you guys know I've loved this for years
and years and years all I love is that
desert stance is pretty much almost
identical it's just a little bit lighter
and this one has a little bit more brown
in it but it's just so close it's
amazing I believe Matt gun interrupted
is actually being discontinued I heard
that I don't know if it's for sure even
so this is pretty expensive I believe
it's roughly around 19 pounds whereas
this makeup geek shadow roughly goes for
about six ninety-nine dollars so roughly
about five pound these are just such
incredible shadows I love the makeup
geek shadows but this color just
transforms any look you're going to do
into a fall autumn look I love it so
this shadow has been something I've been
going for specially for an everyday I'd
love to use this as my soul transition
color sometimes I mix this in with a
bronzer and I just absolutely love it so
this one is a must for me I absolutely
love this shade another one which I love
all year round in the autumn time this
just reminds me of the color that leaves
changed to this one is called cocoa bear
it's a really nice warm red tone brown I
love this it's absolutely amazing it's
just nice to go for a really nice warm
smoky eye and have this in the crease so
these two together are like a dynamic
duo they are so beautiful together this
is your first color and then this in the
crease it looks absolutely beautiful and
such a beautiful full combination so
these two have been loving the lash I
shadow I wanted to show you was this one
called bitten also from makeup ebookers
they are amazing this one is a little
bit different i actually have this in my
crease right now like a british pub
granbury shade I really really love this
it's very different to the other two
there's a very different type of eye
shadow I haven't seen many colors like
this anywhere and I just love how this
looks in the crease also all over the
lid it's beautiful and I just feel like
i'm going to have loads of fun with this
color over the winter and the autumn as
well so I'm really excited to just use
this more and more because i love how it
looks right now so you guys know i am
not a huge blush person like I know
where blushes a lot it will very rarely
pick one up and be like I like it there
are only very few out of the whole
drawer blushes i have that i tend to
reach two and this one I think it's
perfect for full this color is just my
favorite thing and I'm so excited I feel
like I could wear this every single day
and I have no blush person this is terra
cotta from next this would look amazing
on so many different skin types not just
a olive skin tone but I feel like
specifically it can be hard to find a
blush that looks good on an olive skin
tone and this is definitely one that I
feel like I've got it on my cheeks right
now it just adds a little bit of color
that looks different to a bronzer but it
still goes without olive skin tone and
it doesn't make you look too washed out
because I do feel like sometimes when I
apply a blusher it makes my whole face
just look washed out so usually pink
tones I tend to stay away from depending
on the make up I'm doing sometimes I'll
use it but they're not usually things
i'll reach for for every day but like i
said this is really nice it's a setting
kind of feel so it's not totally mad it
adds a little bit of dimension to the
face and color and I just absolutely
love this not to mention this is so
affordable next is one of my favorite
brands and they have such high quality
makeup but they are so affordable and
it's also available in the majority of
countries i believe so hopefully you
guys can get your hands on this if you
have ready okay so that was all the
makeup products I had just kidding I
have a ton of the products you guys know
I cannot get through this without
telling you guys about a ton of lip
products so before I tell you guys about
a few lip combinations and products that
I love I wanted to tell you guys about
something that I use all the year round
but will be a necessity for me
especially as it starts to get colder
and that is comics comics is my favorite
lip balm is
extremely inexpensive it's quite weird
texture it's a glossy texture if you
ever seen my lips looking glossy eating
tutorial this is what I have armed
really helps my lips to be hydrated I
use this all the way around the year but
I do love this especially for the winter
and especially because we wearing lots
of matte lip colors this just really
helps to prevent that dryness and
chapped lips I love this this is my
must-haves and I've been using this for
years and years and years let's move on
to some lip products now one lip product
for that I wouldn't usually recommend
but it's definitely something I wanted
to talk about if you are not a huge fan
of having lots of lip products on your
lips and you wanted something
moisturizing this is the clinic chubby
stick I have had this since last year
maybe the year before actually I don't
know how long I've actually had this but
I always tend to go back to it this time
of year shlee for an everyday because
it's just a really nice nude color they
come in a ton of different colors so you
can get whatever color you love the most
but it's basically a moisturizing
lip color and it's always like a lip
balm that has a tent in it as well so
this is the color I love but if you guys
know I love a nude and so I love this in
the autumn and winter time just to add
some hydration into the lips while still
adding a little bit of color as well
they have these all throughout the
drugstore you don't need to get clinic
just this type of product is amazing if
you suffer from chapped lips they do
some I think they do the Revlon ones
like I have this Revlon lip but I like
as well these are great but this is just
really handy to have in your bag so if
you ever want to top it out bigger lips
are dry it's kind of like a two-in-one
so I just wanted to mention this
although it's something I don't use all
the time it's definitely something that
you should keep in your purse because it
just kind of feels like if you need an
emergency chap stick with a bit of color
so a lip combination i have been wearing
constantly like pretty much all of my
snapchat I've been wearing it in all of
the normal days where I'm not doing
tutorials where I wear my own makeup
look this is the little combination i've
been wearing and i feel like i'm gonna
wear it until it hits summer again
because i love it the lip combination i
love is stone and Gerard cosmetics 1995
lipstick 105 is beautiful on its own but
I love to cool it down a little bit but
stone down is
we a gray brown lip liner that's this
color right here and then Gerard
cosmetics 1995 is basically it's like a
movie pink brown and it's just beautiful
for this time of year I wear this with
pretty much any look I'll wear this with
a smoky eye or the minimal I with a lip
liner it just looks beautiful with
everything and the combination of these
two together just makes your lips look
nice and full and I just love it so
those two definitely like full
must-haves I love it like it's the best
tell the product i love that i bought
last year this color was really pretty
this is in the color 7 and this is the
rouge edition velvet from bourgeois is
basically this color right here it's
kind of similar to the 1995 it's just a
lot warmer and this starts go to a kind
of matte finish it goes beautifully with
Max or lip pencil I love that and I just
feel like it's really nice because you
can get it from the drugstore it's not
too expensive and it does go in that as
well wonder by now i feel myself going
back to you every single time is mac
vino this is basically the perfect lip
color for a purple lip or burgundy lip
it's basically a dark wine color I've
used it with this today I've used it
with so many different lips and I just
love the way this looks with a majority
of different colors just feel like a
dark lip liner is just a staple this
season if that makes sense okay so now
there's just one more section I wanted
to talk about I don't usually talk about
nail colors but I love painting my nails
especially in the full time and you
might actually haven't seen me do my
nails in a while that pretty much been
free for ages and that's basically
because I'm just trying to grow them out
because I got fake nails done near my
birthday which was in July and my nails
haven't grown back properly since I'm
basically just winging my nose to grow
all the way through so that nail polish
goes off nicely because my nails are so
damaged from that I've been using all of
these colors on my toes I love them I
never show my toes on camera so I'm not
going to show you by been loving these
three colors and I just know I'm gonna
go for them throughout the whole season
basically this one is by SE and this one
is sand trip hey love this one this is
the best i have this on my toes at the
moment and it's basically like a cool
toned great nude which i think is like
perfect in my opinion it's very natural
i think it's really nice on the nails as
well i love this and i love going for
grayish tones throughout this time of
year as well like my natural option for
this time of year and another one from
SC this one is called chin chilly this
is basically like a gray just a normal
gray I love gray gray is my favorite
color I think soon as my nails grow up
I'm going to use this as well and then
one that just has to be done this is
barry m rosebery is just a beautiful
wine color you can't go wrong for colors
like this for this time of year I hope
