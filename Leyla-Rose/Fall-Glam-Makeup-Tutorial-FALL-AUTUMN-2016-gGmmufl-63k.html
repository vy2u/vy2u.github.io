can see inferno me hey guys I'm welcome
back to my Channel today I'm going to be
showing you this full glam makeup look
and this is my first full makeup
tutorial of this year and I'm so excited
for you to see this it uses a lot of
warm colors and it's just my ideal glam
but using lots of full tones so first of
all to prime my skin I'm going to be
taking these Smashbox primer water and
I'm just spreading that all over and
then I'm gonna be moving into some
foundation and the foundation I'm using
today is the Too Faced Born This Way
it's definitely one of my favorite full
coverage foundations so I'm just popping
some onto my Beauty Blender and just
applying as little as I can I've been
all about sort of as minimal foundation
as possible lately just because I just
find that if I apply foundation all over
really lightly and then go over on the
areas where I need ever gotten to some
color correction I felt like I had a bit
of a lack of sleep so I took some of the
Becca color corrector and just applied
it under my eyes I'm going to be moving
on to my eyeshadow now but we will go
over that with some concealer later on
just making sure that's pressed in
nicely onto my under eyes using my
Beauty Blender and also my fingers so to
start on the eyes
as always I'm priming them with a little
bit of concealer this concealer is the
Maybelline age rewind which definitely
has to be my favorite concealer to prime
my eyes with I'm just rubbing that in to
my lids and just making sure that it's
nice and smooth and the eyeshadow
palette that I'm using today is the Too
Faced semi-sweet palette this is one of
my favorites and I'm just taking this
color right here which is called peanut
butter and I'm just applying that on to
the crease area I really want my crease
to be nice and warm because I definitely
want to channel all of the autumn colors
so the Reds the warmth I just feel like
it reminds me of the full time so I'm
just blending that really nicely into
the crease because I am going to be
applying a readi shade into the crease
also I do want to make sure this color
is going up quite high towards my
eyebrows that way this warm brown will
show through when I do apply the next
shade and then going to be taking this
color pop super strong eye shadow and
this is an a matte warm brown shade it's
very ready and I'm just going to be
applying this into
Chris and I am using this with a
synthetic brush just to make sure that I
pick up all of the colour-pop eyeshadow
this definitely does work better with
your finger or with a synthetic brush so
I'm using a synthetic brush and then
just blending out the edges with the
brush that I used for my previous I
shadow this was the first time I was
trying the eyeshadows properly from
colour-pop
and they definitely are very strange but
once you get used to them they do blend
really easily and then I'm taking some
of the color truffled also from the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and
just applying a little of that into the
outer V area just to give it a hint of
smokiness and then of course I do want
to make sure all of that is blended
really seamlessly together so I'm going
back in with my previous brush and just
making sure it's all nice and blended
and then I'm going in with another color
pop eyeshadow this time is a super
shimmery gold color and I think this has
to be one of my new favorite eyeshadow
is I'm applying this with a flat
synthetic brush onto my lid and this
just makes the whole look look so
gorgeous this is why I love full makeup
looks just because the sparkle warmth I
just feel like this makeup look really
does have a massive essence of this
season so I'm so excited to go into fall
it's just my favorite time for this type
of makeup I'm applying it all over the
lid and just making sure that it blends
into the rest of those eyeshadows and
I'm just going to be applying some
concealer now I did my makeup in quite a
strange order today just because I did
want to clean up the sides of the
eyeshadow using some concealer so that's
why I'm doing my concealer now before
finishing off the eyeliner I'm just
taking some of you Born This Way
concealer mixing together two shades and
then just blending the end with my
Beauty Blender
to really set that into place I'm going
to be baking wisdom of my laura mercier
translucent setting powder I'm just
taking that on a beauty blender and just
applying it under where I did all of
that concealer basically this just
really sets it and brightens it and just
makes it look so smooth and whilst that
is baking I'm going to be doing my
eyeliner I'm just taking some of the NYX
matte eyeliner and creating my wing I'm
just doing a standard wing that gets
thick towards the outer corner and you
guys know that I love to go for a
thicker wing so as you can see that's
exactly what I'm creating but you can
totally go for whatever you find
comfortable and then I am taking one of
my favorite pairs of lashes right now
these are the satify serious lashes and
I'm just applying them on the top
lashline and I just love the way that
these look so much I literally need to
go and buy 5,000 pairs of these because
these are my new favorites
and then to make my natural lashes blend
in really nicely with the false ones I'm
just taking some of the Urban Decay
perversion mascara and just applying
that onto my natural lashes and then I'm
just dusting away at some of that Laura
Mercier translucent powder just making
sure that it's all dusted away and then
would be excess I'm just kind of like
moving it around my skin almost to set
the rest of my foundation and this just
looks nice and smooth and I love it it
also did apply my eyebrows in this time
and I will leave a tutorial down below
you guys always do ask me why I skip
this step and it's just because nobody
does it take a long time but it's also
I've shown you like five thousand times
so I'll leave the tutorial down below
and then I kept the bottom lash line
very simple with just some mascara and
some black eyeliner on the waterline to
finish off my skin I'm going to be
taking some of this bronzer from
colour-pop this is a really natural
shade and I just kind of built this up
very gradually onto the cheeks the
colour-pop bronzers are definitely
something I'm not used to when they're
matte and they're this natural I just
never used anything like this so it did
take me a little while to build up the
way that I like it so I just applied
some of that onto my cheeks and then I
did go underneath that with some of the
Laura Mercier powder just to create some
shape and that way it will really define
my cheekbones and then to really add
some highlight on to the tops of my
cheekbones I am taking some of this
highlight also from colour-pop and I'm
going to be taking this along at the top
of my cheekbones and as you can see this
is a gorgeous highlight so stunning I
love the way this look I think this one
was called at lunch money which i think
is just so cute how cute is that name
I'm just applying that only on to the
tops of my cheekbones because I wanted
to keep everywhere else relatively matte
and then for my lips of course you guys
know it I'm using lots of color pop
makeup in this video I'm taking a lip
liner from colour-pop and just going
along the outer edges
you
and then to finish off the lips I'm
gonna be filling in with the colour-pop
liquid lipstick in the color
beeper I have heard so many people talk
about this liquid lipstick so I knew I
needed to try and I think it's such a
perfect nude shade for fall I mean it
just has a really nice tint of pink to
it but it looks perfectly dark enough
full of full season so I love it and I'm
just going ahead and dusting away that
baking powder baking powder from
underneath my cheekbones and now it's
time to do my hair and that is the end
of this look so guys that's the end of
my first full makeup look of this year I
