showing you how to achieve this full
makeup look with a burgundy lip I did
two different lip choices i did a max
wanna make also done a glossy one so the
first step i'm going to be doing is
applying my foundation i am using much
master foundation by mac and i am
bumping that in with the Real Techniques
buffing brush so i'm just going to make
sure i bought that all over the skin in
circular motions and patting motions and
patting motions is just going to build a
vehicle reg this is a matte finish
foundation and it's also a medium
coverage so i've been liking this
foundation recently but you can use
whichever foundation works with you
next I'm going to be applying my
favorite eye primer by benefit it's the
stay don't stray I primer and I'm going
to blend that in with my finger this is
just going to create a bear canvas for
us to work with when we apply on I'd
shadows and eyeliner
I'm going to be applying texture by Mac
and I'm going to be applying this with a
big fluffy brush and I'm just blending
this above my crease and I'm going to be
blending it quite far are in vigorous
motion so I just want to make sure this
color out with all the rest is very very
blended if you make the first transition
color as blended as possible it makes
the rest of the colors very very easy to
blend so I'm just using lots and lots of
side with motions and a blending it
further
next I'm going to be taking brown script
by mac and I'm going to apply that with
a smaller brush into the outer corner
and slightly above the crease and I'm
just sort of extending outwards and I'm
going to be applying it again just a
little bit more in the outer corner this
is just going to add more definition and
as I imply embark as well this is just
going to create further definition so
it's just going to make it look nice and
deep in a school
next I'm going to be going to be taking
town picked up by mac and I'm going to
be applying that with a pencil brush all
over the lid
and I'm also applying eyeliner just to
the lash line I'm not going with any
wing today but you can if you want to I
just like the look of having nice and
diffuse towards the out words rather
than it being all about the way of the
line next I've applied lord it up
eyeliner this is a pair glide pencil by
Mac I've just applied it underneath as
well and then blending that out with a
flat brush using brown script eyeshadow
I've also gone ahead and applied my
lashes and my mascara and I'm just going
to get on the eyebrows so what I'm using
is the brow bar to go and i'm just
applying that through my eyebrows I
don't want anything too dramatic I'm
just gonna sort of go for go through my
brow and just make it look more defined
and creating more of an arch as well I
do have an eyelash tutorial in on my
channel and i also have an eyebrow one
as well so i will link them in the
description and I will also link as well
a discount code so you can get a
discount off the brow bar to go and i
highly recommend it
amazing next I'm just applying my NYX HD
conceal our any very very light color
and I'm going to be applying it on to
you under my eyes and on my Cupid's bow
and this is just to highlight them areas
and I'm just going to be blending that
out with my finger and patting motions
and side with motions
next I'm going to be bronzing the skin
with my Bobby Brown prawns are in the
golden light this is my favorite bronzer
ever it gives the nicest glow and it's a
really nice medium tone it's nothing too
orange it's nothing too Brown it's
nothing too shimmery and it's also very
very much so I really really like it
next I'm going to be taking trace call
blusher and applying it as a highlight
this has been one of my favorite things
at the moment is absolutely gorgeous on
an olive skin tone
now I'm going to be lining my lips with
a Knicks retractable lip liner as usual
and I'm just going to be applying this
all over the lip to act as a base to
make sure that my only lipstick stays on
a really long time and it's also going
to make the line on the lipstick oh my
look nice and crisp
next I'm going to be applying my
Velveteen lipstick violent crime in
wicked and this is one of my favorite
colors it's one of the nicest fall
colors ever it's a nice dark red and
it's a little bit of a burgundy tone as
well so it's nice and it looks different
depending on which lip liner use we're
there so with this lip liner it looks
like a nice dark red I also done another
lip choice as well I also done the
seduction lip gloss by whacking
lightning and that was a dark glossy
aversion as well so that one looks
amazing too
so as you can see that's how it looks
with the seduction lip gloss and I'm
also going to show you now how it looks
with the lime crime Velveteen as well

day and I will see you in my next video
