today's makeup tutorial is going to be a
Halloween one obviously this is just a
general feline glam Halloween tutorial
you can totally add spots or stripes
depending on what feline you wanted to
go for if you want or a tiger or cheetah
it's totally up to you so if you guys do
want to see how I achieved this makeup
look then please just keep on watching
and let it burn
it burns
you've gotta know prior to filming I
already primed my face with my Mac prep
and prime natural radiance primer and my
makeup for of a step one smoothing
primer for my foundation I'm taking my
Studio Fix fluid in NC 40 and just
applying this all over my face and
blending it in with a Beauty Blender I
wanted to create a nice flawless face
and a nice base for us to work on so I
wanted to apply a matte foundation so
any matte foundation will work to begin
to highlight I'm going to be taking the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC 15 it's
extremely light but this is really going
to start to highlight the areas we want
to bring forward I'm applying it with a
traditional foundation brush I'm
applying it onto my eye area on my upper
lip and also my chin I'm also making
sure to blend that in with a Beauty
Blender just because we are going to be
applying an even more intent to
highlight on top of this so you want to
make sure this is as seamless as
possible so this will act as a really
nice base for that to sit on
to begin to contour my face I'm going to
be taking this brown shade from the
makeup forever flash palette and just
applying this with a concealer brush
onto the sides of my forehead onto my
cheekbones and also onto my jaw line
with the cheeks I want to make sure that
the end of the contour is turning up
towards my nose this will just really
change the structure of my face and
start to make everything look a lot more
feline like and then going to be
blending that in with my Beauty Blender
to make sure it's nice and seamless and
then on top of that I'm going to take a
darker foundation to just warm up my
face a little bit too taking this our
CMA Foundation palette I'm taking this
dark foundation shade and applying this
on to all the areas we just previously
contoured this will like I said just
warm up the skin and also just make all
the contour blend a lot more seamlessly
into the skin I am again gonna be
blending that in with my Beauty Blender
and you just want to keep blending until
this looks really seamless because we
are going to be applying some powders on
top of this
the next part is personally the most
important in my opinion I'm going to be
taking this white shade from the makeup
forever flash palette and just applying
this in an upside-down triangle shape
underneath my eyes and really dragging
it upwards this is going to extremely
highlight our under eyes but it's really
going to give us a different effect to
just normally contouring and
highlighting your face I'm also going to
be applying some of this white shade
onto my chin and also onto my upper lip
this is just really going to bring these
areas forward and it's going to give the
appearance of fur being that instead of
just highlighting these areas but this
is also going to structure the face a
lot more differently to a human face I'm
going to be blending this in with my
finger first just because I don't want
to change the placement of this product
when I blend it in I really want it to
stay in the exact place I placed it
because if it moves around too much then
the whole face is just going to end up
white and we don't want that next I'm
just going to take my Beauty Blender
just to make sure everything looks nice
and seamless but I am making sure not to
move this about too much to set and also
brighten these white areas I'm taking
this white shade from this morphe
palette the makeup forever flash palette
is a cream product so you do want to
make sure that you're setting it in
place and this will just also make
everything stand out a lot better too
and then taking the instant retouch
powder from soap and glory I'm just
setting the rest of my face to next
sticking Lottie from makeup geek I'm
going to be applying this eyeshadow on
the sides of my nose to broaden my nose
and to make it look a lot wider at that
human nose so I'm just going to be
applying this on to the sides of my nose
and also into my eye sockets to deepen
up my eye sockets and also give the
appearance of a more hooded eye shape
this is again going to change the
structure of the face and I'm just
blending that eyeshadow into the eye
sockets to create a little bit more
deepened effect I'm also just blending
that down the sides of the nose and just
connecting it to the cheek contour I've
also taken that same color on a Real
Techniques contour brush and just using
it on all the areas we applied that
contour previously that way it will just
set the cream contour this will just
make everything look a lot more defined
and just make our face look super
structured and just really different to
how our face would look like if we were
human basically I'm also just applying a
little bit more of that brown into our
eye sockets and this will just deepen it
and make our eyes look a lot more sunken
in I'm going to go ahead and do one eye
off camera and we'll get started on the
next one taking Coco per eyes shadow
from makeup geek we're going to be
applying this into the crease I want to
create a really nice feline like eye but
it is going to be glam at the same time
so this Coco bear eyeshadow is just
going to warm everything up I want to
apply this into the crease but also drag
it outwards towards the tail of my
eyebrow to really lift my eye upwards
then taking maca from makeup geek also
I'm just going to be applying this into
the crease with a pencil brush this will
just start to prepare it for the black
and just create a little bit more
shadows and definition and this will
just start to really make the eyes look
a lot more of a different shape than
what our natural eye looks like we are
going to be playing with our eye shape a
little bit and just
a little bit more of a hooded eye shape
you want to make sure it's nice and
blended so just blend blend blend I'm
going to start to also gradually apply a
matte black shade this one is corrupt
from makeup geek I'm just applying it
with a pencil brush and just blending
that out with another blending brush
that we use to apply the first color we
want to gradually apply it into the
crease and also just gradually take it
higher and higher so that we don't apply
too much too quickly you want to also
make sure that you're dragging it
outwards towards the tail of your brow
also next taking my soft ochre Paint Pot
from Mac I'm going to be taking this on
a concealer brush and just creating the
effect of a larger eyelid space than
what I actually do have this is also
going to make it look like we have more
of a crease that's kind of flopping over
our eyelid on the outer corner if that
makes sense and this just really does
play up the shape of your eye I'm gonna
be taking this base shade from the
morphe palette also and just apply that
on top to set it into place to connect
our eyes to our nose contour I'm going
to be taking that black eyeshadow and
just connecting that line to our nose
contour like I said this is really going
to change the shape of our nose and eyes
and just really give it that feline
effect next taking that mock our eyes
shadow I'm going to be going into the
nose contour and just deepening it a
little bit more this will not only make
the nose look a lot more structured it's
going to make sure that it stands out
the most out of your face we want people
to see the nose and the eyes first when
they look at you because that is usually
the things that you've noticed when you
look at a cat basically I'm also going
to be applying a line of eyeliner on my
lid and not just a normal line I'm going
to be applying a big wing we're winging
it today I'm going to be using my super
cat liner from soap &amp;amp; Glory and just
creating a nice big wing
I'm also gonna be applying my false
lashes these are the isla grande glamour
lashes from Vegas nay I just applied
them with some glue just apply some
mascara to to connect my natural lashes
with the false ones up next I'm going to
be taking some of that brown eyeshadow
and using it to create a double bottom
lash line this is going to make the eyes
look more open and it's also going to
change the shape of the eyes to make
them look a lot more like cat's eyes I'm
going to be taking some dark brown
eyeshadow and just applying it to smoke
out the bottom lashline and I'm going to
be taking it closer to the inner corner
as well just to define that fake in a
corner we just created I'm also going to
be taking some more of that pen eyeliner
and just applying it to the inner corner
to create a feline in a flick and then
to finish off and make the eyes look a
lot larger and taking some skin tone
eyeliner applying it to my inner corner
and also to my waterline and then to
totally finish off the look I'm applying
some mascara to my bottom lash line for
my brows I wanted to go for some crazy
fluffy wild brows and taking some of the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills clear brow gel
and just applying it to my brows to
flick all of my hairs upwards and then
taking my brow archery pencil from soap
&amp;amp; Glory I'm just going to be applying
this through the brows and just flicking
it upwards to create the effect of more
hairs
to create the tip of the nose I'm just
drawing a straight line on the tip of
the nose and filling that in with the
makeup for a flash palette and using the
dark brown shade this is going to act as
a base as we are going to be applying
some eye shadow on top of this I'm going
to be applying makeup geeks bitten on
top of this to create that nice little
pink brown nose next I'm just going to
be applying a line of eyeliner on the
top of the nose and then we are going to
be shading this with some black eye
shadow later I'm also just shading
either sides of my nose to make it
appear more sunken in and I'm just using
the latte eye shadow to do this I'm also
just taking that same eye shadow and
just applying it on the inner part of my
Cupid's bow I'm also going to be shading
the nose with a little bit of black
eyeshadow this is just going to make it
look like it blends a little bit better
this is again totally optional you don't
have to do this but I'm just a little
bit more perfectionist and then I'm
taking a black kohl pencil and just
drawing it down the center of my Cupid's
bow and this just gives it that really
nice feline mouth I'm applying a little
bit more white eyeshadow to really
highlight this mouth area I really feel
like this is important too and then as
you can see my hair and my ears are
suddenly on just because my camera died
so I've decided while it was charging
I'd quickly do it I'm just taking some a
brown eyeliner and just applying little
spots on the top lip this is instead of
whiskers but you can't apply whiskers if
you'd like this is just where the
whiskers would go if I did do that next
I'm just taking stone lip liner and just
filling in the outer corners of my lips
and just dragging the outer corners
upwards a little bit to give that cat
mouth and I'm just going to be outlining
the outer corner of the top lip also and
I'm going to be filling in the outer
corner with a little bit of chestnut lip
pencil from Mac as well just to deepen
it and to you know add a little bit of
dimension to it this is again optional
you don't have to do this but this just
creates a little bit of extra dimension
