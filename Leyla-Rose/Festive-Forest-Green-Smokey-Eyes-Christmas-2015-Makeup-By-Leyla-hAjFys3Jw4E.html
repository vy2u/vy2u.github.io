today I'm going to be doing this makeup
tutorial this is my first Christmas
tutorial of the year I am so excited
because I've just gone in straight away
for like a super festive makeup look
this isn't the ordinary festive book
using golds and reds and stuff like that
I decided to go for something festive
but something that isn't super
traditional and something that I
wouldn't see that often
I'd say it's quite unique but it still
does have the essence of Christmas with
anyone for this all mapped forest green
smokey eye and I am just in love with it
not only does it make brown eyes stand
out I think it would look amazing on any
eye color I feel like it does a lot for
brown eye and I used only eyeshadows
from this palette from sleek and I just
I'm so in love with them I honestly feel
like this screen right here is so unique
they are all so pigmented and they just
created this I look so perfectly so this
is this star of the show so this is the
only palette I'm using today you guys do
wanna see how I achieve this forest
green smokey eye that is perfect for
Christmas then just keep on watching to
get started today we're gonna be priming
our eyes and I'm taking the Mac soft
ochre paint ball and just applying it
all over my eyes from my lid all the way
to my brow bone then taking this sleek
ultra matte palette this is definitely
the star of the show
I'm taking the peach color just here and
applying it with a big fluffy Sigma e-40
brush and I'm just gonna be blending
this into the crease this will just make
everything blend it's so much easier
we're using lots of vibrant and dark
colors today
so we really want to make sure that
these colors have something to blend
into so I'm just gonna pack this on into
the crease make sure it's nice and
vibrant and then we're gonna be moving
on to this reddish brown and taking
about a separate blending brush and just
building this up into the crease because
we do need something for the dark greens
you blend into so this is just really
gonna help the green to transition into
that peach color a lot better I'm just
going back and forth and just building
up this color as much as I can
this will also just warm up the crease
as well and just make everything look a
lot warmer
I'm just going back into that previous
brush to make sure it's really well
blended to make sure that the green
comes out true to its color I am
applying the NYX jumbo pencil in milk
onto my lid and I'm just gonna be
applying this and blending it out with
my finger this will really make the
green stand out and just make it appear
like the exact color it looks in the pan
this color is really pigmented anyway so
the green is pigmented without a base
but just applying a base just means that
it is gonna look super vibrant which is
exactly what we wanted then taking the
forest green which is so amazing I just
love this color so much and taking the
on a small shader brush and just
gradually packing it on top of that
white all over the lid and this will
just look so amazing I love the fact
that it's matte instead of shimmery it
just gives a really nice twist and it
just reminds me of a Christmas tree so I
think you know it's as festive as
festive Ken getting that brush I'm just
kind of pushing it into the crease
before we start to blend it out I am
gonna be taking this dark brown from the
palette just so that we can blend out
the edges of that green and this will
just make it look a lot softer and it
just gives a little bit of a middle in
between the warm brown and the green so
it just makes the transition a lot more
easier applying that with a very small
dinky blending brush and then just
wiping the sides of my eyes and cleaning
out any fallout that just means that
everything will look nice and neat and
we are ready to do the rest of our eyes
I'm applying some gel liner to my
waterline just so that we can give us a
super smoky effect we are going to be
applying some eye shadow to the bottom
lashline a little bit later but for now
some black on the waterline is perfect
and I am gonna be applying some lashes
as well these are the House of lashes
and noir fairy lashes I love these
because these just make everything look
nice and smoky they're quite simple and
they don't look too much so I do really
like these lashes and I'm just applying
a coat of mascara as well just to make
the natural lashes blend in a little
now we're gonna be moving on to skin
taking this Mac natural radiance primer
and just applying it all over to take
care of my dry skin and then I'm gonna
be going in with a nice matte full
coverage foundation this is the l'oreal
infallible 24-hour liquid i'm just
taking that on my Real Techniques
blending sponge and just blending this
all over my skin I absolutely love this
foundation I love the color because it
makes me look really nice and healthy
right now you're thinking I look orange
but it does Elend in I promise it's
taking that on a sponge and just making
sure that it looks nice and flawless all
over my skin
for my concealer I am taking the
Maybelline Dream Lumi touch concealer
and the color nude and just applying
this under my eyes only just because I
didn't want to go too crazy with the
concealer all over my face today I just
wanted to brighten my under eyes and
just kind of focus everything on the eye
area I wanted everything else on my face
to be really simple so this will just
make sure that all the focus is on the
eye area and this will just really
brighten that under eye I'm using my
finger to blend that in and I also was
using the Real Techniques sponge again
to set that I am taking my soap and
glory instant retouch powder on a sigma
f-35 brush
nothing new there you guys have seen
this before and I'm also gonna be
setting the rest of my face with the
same powder and I'm gonna be taking that
on a bigger brush as well just so that
everything could be super matte and that
it doesn't move next I'm gonna do my
eyebrows off camera because you guys
have seen me do it a million times but
there will be a link in the description
to my tutorial next moving on to the
rest of my eyes I am gonna be taking
some more of that forest green shade on
that same shader brush and we're just
gonna be blending it onto the bottom
lashline I just felt like this gave a
really nice effect and I did feel like
the whole under eye looked nice and
green and it just made it look even more
festive so I definitely recommend going
for a green on the bottom as well and
I'm just taking a blending brush and
just softening up the edges so that it
doesn't look harsh and it just looks
nice and blended to finish off the eyes
I'm taking some mascara
and I'm leaving it as that everything is
totally matte I didn't want to apply
anything shimmery on this eye look I
think a matte I look looks just so nice
I just really like the way that the fact
that it's all matte it just gives it a
really different effect to bronze my
skin I just took the mineralized
skinfinish in dark golden and just
applied it to the outer perimeter of my
face and that's pretty much all I wanted
to do I just wanted to apply a little
bit of highlighter and applying it to
the tops of my cheekbones and to the tip
of my nose I didn't want to go too crazy
because like I said I wanted all the
focus to be on the eyes today
and then finally for my lips I am taking
well lipliner from Mac and I'm just
going to be applying this all over my
lips I am going around my lips and also
just filling it in as well I did apply
the la splash innocent vixen liquid
lipstick as well and I did feel like it
looked a little bit too pink for me I
did want to go for something a little
bit PG ah so I went on top of that with
the Gerard cosmetics hydro matte
lipstick in Aphrodite so guys that is
the end of this makeup look I hope you
