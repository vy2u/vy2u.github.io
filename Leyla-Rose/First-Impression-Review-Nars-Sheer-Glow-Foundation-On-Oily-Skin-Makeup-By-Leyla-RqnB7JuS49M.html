first first impressions video the first
impressions I'm going to be doing today
if you can't tell by the title is the
NARS sheer glow foundation and the
radiant creamy concealer I have never
tried these before I've very roughly
tried the creamy concealer it was one of
my friends and I just put on very
quickly on top of the makeup I already
had but I've never actually tried these
I know I'm really late to join the
bandwagon everyone uses these and loves
them the actual reason I wanted to do
the first impressions is because I have
extremely oily skin and I wasn't sure
how this was going to work I did really
want to try it and I want to try and
make it work it's a pretty expensive
foundation so I wanted to make sure that
you guys were clued up before you got it
especially if you have oily skin as well
and yeah we'll just see how it goes I'm
not I'm completely like in the blue of
this I'm obviously seen it applied on
YouTube but I've never applied it to my
own skin so yeah let's just jump
straight into it
so I'm going to take you literally from
the start you can see exactly what I'm
applying on my skin so I have nothing on
my skin at the moment I've literally
practically just woken up and washed my
face and so the first thing that I'm
going to be doing is applying my own
control lotion by Mac and this is a very
light moisturizer which helps to
disperse the oil evenly all around our
skin so it's basically instead of us
applying a moisturizer to give us just
hydration it basically hydrates and
moisturizes our skin while still making
sure we don't look too oily I just like
to concentrate this on the center of my
face or my nose and my cheeks and then
also on my forehead I find like my
forehead of nose is the worst really it
gets that's what gets the moist oily so
just applying that mostly in the center
and then just spreading it outwards I
decided to apply primer because really
on a daily basis I would most likely be
applying a primer so there's no point of
me not actually wearing one because
that's how I'm going to wear it on a day
to day basis especially because I have
oily
so the problem that I'm going to be
applying is a really lightweight one
it's the air flash CC primer by Dior and
this is really really lightweight so
this is nothing that's going to affect
real actual feel the foundation and I'm
just going to make sure that it's evenly
applied nothing too heavy so I actually
haven't even opened this yet so this is
just coming out of the box perfect and
the color that I'm using is Syracuse
which is medium / dark one so that's
what it looks like it's a really nice
packaging and there's no pub why have I
seen youtubers with pops so I'm assuming
that you have to buy the pump separately
similar to Mac I didn't know this so
yeah this is great I'm just gonna have
to apply it to the back of my hand and I
actually didn't even try this color
before I'm hoping that it's okay it
looks slightly darker but I usually come
to wear something that's a little bit
darker anyway so it should be fine and
the brush that I'm going to be using to
apply this is my Real Techniques expert
face brush and I'm just going to be
applying yep those pretty dark but
nothing that's different to what I know
it's okay
it's nothing too different to what I
usually apply wow I really like this
it's applying very smoothly you can tell
it's a medium coverage I didn't know
that any way that it was a medium
coverage but it's actually applying
really nicely I really like it so what
I'm going to do is just apply one thin
layer first see how it covers and then
if we need to apply any more
we'll go on top
so a couple of you asked a little while
ago why I haven't done a foundation
routine and the reason being is because
my method of applying foundation
literally changes like the wind so I
sometimes don't see a point of actually
going into doing it and then it changing
I literally use a different foundation
pretty much all the time
only recently I've been using the same
one because it's just been working for
me but the actual method that I apply it
in is always changing so yeah that's why
I haven't done it but I'll love doing
stuff like this where it's more of a
first impression and review and let me
know if you want to see any more so that
is pretty much applied all over and I
can say to you that that was really
quick I love when a foundation
application is really quick sometimes a
really thick sticky substance of a
foundation is really hard to spread
whereas this is really smooth and light
it's quite liquidy feeling and very
smooth and I really like this this looks
really nice and that's sort of the
coverage that it's given so you can see
that my skin is not completely smooth I
do have blemishes here and there and I
also have redness as well so it did
cover that up really really nicely there
are parts that I would like to be
covered a little bit more but mainly for
one normal layer that's covered really
nice so I'm just going to go over a
couple of different areas and apply a
little bit more coverage and there you
like the colour as well it's really nice
I'm very yellow so it's hard to find
sometimes in other brands apart from Mac
colors that are really yellow because
they usually tend to have a lot of pink
in it so this is actually really nice so
I'm just going to be tapping on the
areas that I want a little bit more
coverage this is really comparable to
the luminous silk foundation by Giorgio
Armani and I really like that one it's
just in a really light color so I
haven't been able to use this virus
database has been updated thanks
it has a really numinous finish with a
looking sticky so I really really like
that next we're going to be trying the
radiant creamy concealer and the color
that I got this in was custard and this
is because everyone talks about custard
and I really hope that it's okay it
looks really light but I usually tend to
use a concealer that's a little bit
lighter than my skin anyway to sort of
highlight under my eyes so I'm going to
be trying this as well so I'm just going
to be applying this under my eyes I'm
not sure how much I want to put yet
because I don't know how it's going to
spread so I'm just going to apply sort
of four little dots and then one in my
inner corner like that and the brush
that I'm going to be using on my
concealer is the 1:10 face shape brush
by zueva
and it's just a really nice small domed
brush and I think this blends in
concealer really nicely okay so this is
pretty light but it's I think I mean
considering I ordered this online I
think I did a pretty good job of picking
colors I would never recommend that
though guys because that's where stuff
goes wrong ordering online I did have a
faint idea of what I wanted I had looked
at it previously but I sort of just did
a bit of a guessing game okay so I am
absolutely loving this at the moment I
think this looks really nice and it's
definitely radiant and it does have a
slight sort of reflectiveness
reflectiveness is that a word I'm not
sure but yeah it definitely reflects the
light a little bit so to highlight
under-eye I think it's really nice to
have that reflective finish
so this is how it looks finished off
with the foundation and the concealer I
really really like the colors that I
picked I'm pretty proud of myself that I
managed to pick that online and I also
really really liked how everything is it
feels very luxurious very lightweight it
doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything
and I really really like how it looks it
looks very radiant but it doesn't look
too sticky and that's really good for an
oily skin so I just need to see how it
will last what I'll do as well is insert
a picture of the foundation with flash
and I'll do it in the natural lighting
because this ring light does make it
look really really different what it
would look in natural lighting so I'll
go take a picture and insert it now so
the time now is just 12 o'clock and I'm
going to check in in about 4 hours to
see how it is lasted halfway through the
day and then I will check in another 4
hours later around 8 o'clock to see how
it has lasted a full eight-hour day the
reason why I want to use an 8 hour frame
is that because that's a normal sort of
working day or a normal school day or
yeah that's the sort of normal time
frame of the day this isn't known to be
a really extra long lasting foundation
so I'm going to give it an 8 hour
stretch and yeah so far I really like it
I'm really excited to see how it will
last I've got a couple of things to do
today I'm going to record some more
videos I'm going to clean my room I've
got a couple of errands to run so I'm
just going to do all of that and see how
it goes so I'll see you at about 4
o'clock
so guys I'm back it is now four o'clock
it's been exactly four hours and I can
honestly say that the foundation has
lasted really really well I know my own
skin and I know that nothing ever lasts
on me they remind I have been at home so
I would expect that if I was working or
something like that it would get a
little bit oilier than this but not a
huge amount but it's literally stayed
exactly the same so I imagine that if I
was at work it would get a slight bit
oily literally around everywhere even
the mouth area
everything has stayed on remember I
didn't powder it as well it is amazing
I'm really really really impressed it
looks really nice there's nothing that's
really wearing away it just looks
exactly the same to be honest so I
actually I'm really really impressed at
this I am going to clean up my room I've
recorded some YouTube videos and I'm
going to tidy up so that means I'm going
to be hoovering and there's going to be
some heat so we'll see how that will
stand I'm going to come back in another
4 hours at 8 o'clock to see how it
finally lasted and yeah I'm really
really impressed and I like the finish I
think I like it more now than I did when
I first applied it I think it looks
really nice and it sitting really nicely
on the skin and the coverage is really
nice I like how it's not really full
coverage I would like to use this for
daily use and sort of just going to work
and that kind of stuff but it's gorgeous
I'm really really happy with it so we'll
see how it is in another 4 hours so guys
I'm back after another 4 hours so it is
8 o'clock I'm not sure if you can even
see this but I just want to show you the
time to prove to you that it actually is
8 oh what's gone on it says it is 11
past 8 and it has been a total of 8
hours since I initially applied my
foundation and I have not touched it
I haven't topped up I've done anything
and it has actually last a surprisingly
long time I'm really really happy with
how it looks I have a little bit of
oiliness and my foreheads and coming
down my nose a little bit on my upper
lip and chin and on my sort of cheek
area and under my eyes is a little bit
of creasing just from facial expressions
so smiling and stuff like that it's just
gone into the lines very very slightly
but
said I haven't topped up all day which I
usually would I am really really
impressed there's only certain lines
here and there and little bits of fading
around the mouth area and stuff like
that but that is bound to happen
considering this is a foundation that's
meant to give you a glow and it's not
made for long where I'm actually really
impressed it's comparable to the Armani
foundation 100% but I think I actually
like this a little bit more overall I
think I'll give it about a 8 out of 10
reason being is because the coverage is
really really nice I think I haven't
found a foundation I think is perfect
yet so that's why I give it an 8 and not
a 9 or a 10 and I actually really really
like it and it's definitely a foundation
that I love a lot I've got to try a
little bit more try a couple of
different application techniques to
really know how much I love it
and maybe I'll push it up to a 9 so guys
