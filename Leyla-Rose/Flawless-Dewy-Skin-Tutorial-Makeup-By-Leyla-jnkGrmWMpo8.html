today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve gooey and flawless skin my skin
is not necessarily one of the most
flawless skin types so I wanted to show
you how to achieve a nice smooth
coverage and as you can see this is what
my skin looked like this morning my skin
was not agreeing with me I had a lot of
redness what you see on my face isn't
necessarily a lot of spots
they are just scars and redness that
likes to flare up so I like to prime my
skin really well before I apply any
foundation so what I'm doing at the
moment is applying some serum and then
I'm going to be moisturizing my skin
also and making sure that your skin is
well prepped
just make sure that nothing clings on to
any dry skin the foundation just applies
a lot more smoothly and everything is
just looking a lot more nice and smooth
and flawless basically so once my skin
is all moist dries I'm going to be going
in with a primer to give us that glow
today I'm gonna be going in with a
luminizing primer and this is the
L'Oreal Lumi I think that's what it's
called and what this does is it's gonna
help illuminate the skin underneath our
makeup then I'm gonna be going in with
our Laura Mercier silk cream foundation
and I've mixed it with a little bit of
our argan oil what this does it just
gives me a little bit more of that junus
also it shares down my foundation so
that it looks a lot more natural at the
same time so what I like to do is work
in thin layers if I do want to build up
more coverage then I can go over another
layer after so I'm just using my Real
Techniques miracle sponge to bounce that
product onto my skin and create a nice
even layer all over
we use lots of bouncing motions and just
create as flawless of a smooth layer as
possible you just want to make sure that
there's an even amount of coverage all
over your face and then if you do want
to build up any more coverage you can
just go back into that foundation and
apply some on the areas that you feel
need a little bit more coverage like I'm
doing now then I'm just going to use the
sponge to bounce that on top then I'm
gonna apply a concealer under my eyes
today I'm going to be using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm just
applying some underneath my eyes and on
the high points of my face such as my
forehead and also my chin
and again I'm just gonna be bouncing
onto my skin my sponge just to make sure
that it blends really evenly everywhere
all over the skin we want to make sure
there's no harsh lines when a really
subtly highlight the areas we're gonna
highlight without making it look too
obvious so you want to make sure that
all the lines are really well blended as
you can see I'm using lots of pressing
motions to make sure that it's pressed
really well into the skin next I'm gonna
be taking the Lancome teint miracle
stick and I'm applying onto the areas
that I want to highlight also I'm
applying onto my cheekbone my nose my
forehead and also my Cupid's bow and
chin and what this is gonna do is gonna
highlight these areas meet a really
gorgeous glow then I'm just going to be
pressing some translucent powder onto
the areas where I get a little bit oily
and this will just prevent you from
looking shiny and greasy and I'm also
setting my under eyes with this powder
as well next I'm going to be bronzing my
skin I'm using a matte bronzer to create
a little bit more definition on the
areas that I want to sink in slightly so
I'm applying it on to the outer
perimeter of my face and also under my
cheekbone I'm not going to be heavily
contouring or anything I just want to
use something matte to create definition
with my face and then also for a little
bit of color I'm gonna be using the
revolution baked bronzer and just start
to apply this on the cheek area and also
a little bit on my forehead as well this
is just gonna give us that really
gorgeous bronze to effect then I'm gonna
be taking my mac's fix+ and applying it
onto my fan brush and applying it into
the Mac soft and gentle highlight just
to add on to the areas that I want to
bring forward also this is just gonna
top off our dewy look and just make us
look a nice and glowing from within then
I'm just gonna use a clean powder brush
just to make sure that's all blended in
and to finish off I'm gonna be using my
NYX Julie setting spray and just make
sure that all lasts and look nice and
gooey so guys that is the end of this
tutorial I was a little bit hesitant to
do this tutorial just because I didn't
want to do a skin tutorial when my skin
is not necessarily the most flawless
type so I hope you guys enjoyed this
