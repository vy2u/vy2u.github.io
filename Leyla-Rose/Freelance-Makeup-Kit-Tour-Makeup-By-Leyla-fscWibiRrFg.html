gonna be showing with you guys my makeup
freelance artist kit and you guys know
that I am a freelance makeup artist so I
do makeup on other people and you guys
have been wanting to see this video for
so long so I really wanted to show you
guys what is in my freelance kit so guys
I'm going to stop rambling and just get
straight into it this video is going to
be extremely long so grab some popcorn
because this is gonna be a long one okay
so I'm kind of standing far away from my
camera because I really want you guys to
see the whole bag but this is my
freelance bag that I basically take with
me everywhere I filled it up with the
majority of stuff that I would take with
me obviously it varies depending on what
type of makeup I'm gonna be doing so for
example if I know that I'm going to be
doing a bride's makeup look and we've
had a trial then obviously I'm not gonna
take as much because I know what I'm
using on half I have never done the
person's makeup before then obviously I
will take a lot more products and it
really does depend so I keep them all in
this bag and this is a bag that I bought
from Mac Pro and I bought this in the
Covent Garden store in London and this
was when I was working for Mac so I did
get a discount on this bag I'll try and
find the price of this bag for you and
put it in the description box for you
and give you a link at the moment I'm
not doing any makeup at home I only go
to people's houses so obviously this
means I need to have a big bag that
means I can take everything with me so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to open it up and show you the different
compartments that it has so I'm just
gonna open it up for you guys so it has
two handles here which are great these
are hard-wired ones and if you are used
to carrying a freelance bag you know
that them annoying lexa ball handles are
the most annoying things ever when a bag
is this heavy you need to have a really
sturdy strap so these two really help to
be able to carry it really easily and
then it also has this long one as well
so that you can put it onto your
shoulder and this little part here is
really good because it obviously has a
grip on it which means that it will help
to lay on your shoulder really nicely
this side it has a zip so
has any space for you to put your phone
in your money or Oyster cards your bet
whatever you want to put just a really
small pocket to put any small objects in
it this side it has another little
wallet here that doesn't have a zip so
again if there's anything else you want
to put in there I wouldn't put valuables
because it doesn't have a zip it has two
little zips here and I'm just going to
put one of them so that we can open it
because I want to show you guys as close
as possible I'm just going to do a
really quick overview so what it
basically has is this one side of these
little compartments that do come out by
velcro and it has this centerpiece here
which does zip off which I will quickly
show you so this does zip off to again
you can take this off if you want but
it's got a zip compartment here for
again any valuables or anything I just
keep a lip palette in here and then the
other side has another pocket with
another - zips behind it as well so as
you can see there's so many different
compartments within this this is why I
bought it because it really is why there
there's just so many compartments and
it's perfect for makeup so as you can
see I've got some eyelashes here and
then also it has this compartment here
which is a large compartment which I
keep my brush belt in in these
compartments here there are basically
three pockets that don't come out these
are basically just three deep
compartments for you to put whatever you
want in it all the heavy stuff and the
liquid stuff goes really well in this
part so I'm going to be going into more
detail I'm going to start off by going
in depth to the first section so this is
the section of all the clear bags so
I'll just show you each bag and what's
inside of them the first one here is
full of my concealers and the concealers
that I use are all from Mac so the first
section has two of my favorite
concealers from Mac and I have these in
a range of colors of course because you
want to have enough colors to match a
majority of skin tones because when you
are freelancing you don't know what skin
tones you are going to get these ones
are the mineralized concealers within
the NC tones I have NC 15 NC 35 and NC
42 and NC 50 which is this dark shade on
the end and then in the NW
shades which are multi pink tones I have
and W 25 and W 30 and W 35 these are the
best concealers for a dry skin so I have
these for a more dry mature skin and
anybody that wants a really natural
glowy and complexion these are great to
put under the eyes or just generally
anywhere that you need a little bit
extra coverage and of course I have to
have my pro longwear concealer as you
can see I've got a nice bunch of these
as well these are my favorite concealers
I like to use on people because these
look amazing for an evening looks
whenever I'm doing a nice smoky eye I
like to apply these under the eyes to
highlight because it just gives the most
gorgeous look so I have these again in
the majority of different skin tones and
I'll just quickly tell you the colors
that I have have the shades NC 15 NC 30
and C 35 and C 42 and then I also have
in the NW shades and W 25 and W 30 and
NW 35 in the other small clear
compartment that is my eye products and
these are just like some I've aces some
glitters stuff like that so I'm just
going to show you guys what I happen
yeah
glitter liners are a must for me in my
kit because whenever someone wants a
sparkly look and pigmen doesn't always
give it to them and taking loose glitter
can sometimes be a bit long and a bit
time-consuming so the glitter line is
it's just a really easy way of giving
someone some shimmer have some from NYX
these two are from NYX I have a Kiko one
and a glam crystals one you guys have
seen me use all of these on myself as
well I love these on my client and I
love using them on myself as well also I
have my two paint pots which I literally
cannot live without sometimes I will
take a few more paint pots but these are
my main ones so I have painterly and
soft ochre I also have a pencil
sharpener which has the duo side so it's
got the small size and the large size so
for jumbo pencils or the smaller size do
you want to make sure that you're
sharpening before every client just to
make sure that all the bacteria is
cleared off it also have an eyelash
curler of course to car lashes before
eyelash application or just generally
before I put mascara on and then I have
two gel eyeliners which I love I've got
the English eyeliner in the number 77 of
Mac blacktrack which is this other one
here this one is a lot smoother
and not as black and then lastly I have
my format pigments which are absolute
crucial for me I always I have on
vanilla vanilla is literally the most
versatile color in the world you can use
this one any skin tone and it will look
amazing whether you're the lightest skin
tone or the darker skin tone and this
looks amazing because it has a reflex of
gold then I have naked which again can
suit any skin tone it's great on a
darker skin tone as an all-over lid
color or is good on a lighter skin tone
again has an all-over lip color this is
great to highlight darker skin as well
and it's just gorgeous it's that also
melon melon is my favorite gold to use
on people it is just the most gorgeous
gold so I have tan and tan is a little
bit more of a pink toned tan color I
love a more pink undertone than the
melon and it's just a really nice all
over lid color if you want to go for
something natural but still reflective
okay so in the next section here is this
large long section and I will just
quickly tell you again what's within it
I have two of the mineralized loose
powders I do have a couple more colors
of these but I keep them in my personal
collection now because I love using
these on myself as well so the colors
that I have our dark and extra light and
you can mix these together depending on
the skin tone so I've got the lightest
shade and also one of the darker shades
just to mix between and this looks great
on brides because it gives a really nice
radiant finish and then realize skin
finishes I've got one in dark and in
dark golden these are great to bronze
with so I absolutely love using these to
bronze my clients skin
I have global glow gold deposit and soft
and gentle and these are amazing
highlights and it's just a more pink
toned one a dot gold and then a medium
gold tone and these are really good for
applying on to the skin then also I have
some setting powders I have been Mac
prep and prime Cece powder and the Naz
translucent crystal light reflecting
loose powder and these are really good
to set any skin tone because they are
translucent these are the best things to
take with you in a freelance makeup kit
because you don't want to take too many
different colors with you you want
powders that are going to be more
Universal so translucent is the best
pulsar in here I have a couple of eye
pencils
I have fascinating nc15 to nw20 and
feline Kohl pencils all from Mac and
these are just a white a skintone and a
black pencil to apply onto the water
then I have a mascara the mascara I'm
using at the moment is Studio scalp lash
and then I also have a majority of
different disposable mascara wands just
because these are more sanitary than
using the one that's actually in there
you want to make sure that you never
double-dip just because you don't want
to spread any bacteria between clients
so in this compartment I have some
Levine Mac blushes and these are great
because I just have a majority of
different colors just depending on what
kind of look you want to go for every
fall which is just a really pretty pink
color
I have dolly mix which again is like a
hot pink then I have peaches which is
more of a peachy tone I have Spring
Sheen which is peach again with a little
bit more of a gold undertone I have
style which is again a orange tone with
a gold Sheen I have peachy keen just
like a peachy pink and then also I have
harmony which is my favorite contour
color I use this on pretty much every
skin tone apart from a really deep skin
tone to contour with and this is just a
great contouring color so I like to keep
that there as well so here I have a
couple of Mac palette some conceal and
correct palette in the darker shade and
then I have a lighter one as well and I
also have three lip palettes as well so
I have the brown the red and the pink
then also I have another lip palette
this is an Engel OTT one that I
customized myself yours are all
completely matte lip colors so I have a
nude one a pink a coral and red and
purple just have a couple of different
matte lip glosses I won't go through the
names because there are quite a few but
these are just like all peachy pink and
clear tone oops
and then I also have a matte clear gloss
as well which means you can make any
color glossy also in here I have my duo
eyelash glue I also have in here a bunch
of different pencils some of these
eyebrow pencils some of the mullet
pencils these are the lip pencils I tend
to take with me so some of them are red
to nude pink really dark ones and I
really like to take a good amount of lip
liners with me just because you can
manipulate any lip color depending on
lip liner you use also have a couple of
Nicks for track the bullet liners
because these are my favorite these are
in the more ready tones which I like to
take with me because I don't have many
Mac ones with the red tones and also
I've got Fort Mac eyebrow pencils which
I love who that is that section complete
this just keeps everything nice and
compact so anything that some loose just
fits really well in here like I said
before this middle part that does is it
onto the center which separates the two
parts I always to keep my brush felt in
here now my brushes are not clean I am
NOT on my way to do a client do not
worry I promise I always clean my
brushes I do a brush collection soon or
my favorite brushes to use on other
people my favorite brushes to do on
myself then in here I've just got a
couple of different eyelashes okay so
like I said before all of this is just
like the really heavy stuff and this is
where I keep a lot of my foundations and
my primers my setting sprays I've got my
iPad it's here as well so the first
thing is my Bioderma which I absolutely
love this is just a really nice makeup
remover that feels like water basically
has no scent to it I think this is sim
free but it's basically safe it's
paraben free and non rinse and
hypoallergenic and it's just good for
any skin type and it's just good to know
that I can use this on any skin and they
won't have a reaction to it also I like
to take some makeup wipes as well and
also I have a little mini brush cleaner
and you guys know that the Mac brush
cleaner is absolutely huge so I bought
these tiny little travel bottles which
are amazing and I always take this with
me and this is just good to clean your
brushes in between each client and then
also in here I have a couple of Lancome
foundation these are the Lancome teint
miracle and you're probably wondering
why they look like this these I got from
when I used to work in a department
store these are basically the testers
from when you work in a department store
I have one two three and ten so I have a
couple of different shades which are
great don't these are the different
colors that I have and then the next
section here is another one of these
long zip compartments and I have in here
my Mac prep and prime in natural
radiance and this is in the pink tone I
have my Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray this is really good to make sure
the makeup stays on all night also I
have to Nick's sings verses why I have
the matte finishing spray and the jury
finishing
so halves of the loominator creams I
have the bd+ illuminator by droid

website so I will pop that down in the
description box below so if you do want
to get some money off the Gerard
cosmetics website site-wide also we have

pearlescent glow so it looks a little
bit more like that bluey puppy parley
glow I also have an eye cream here as
well this is the Mac fast response eye
cream also here I have another little a
mini mac fix+
and then also I have my moisture
infusion serum from Mac which I love
using on myself as well and then also my
Mac prep and prime skin base this is

honey so just a couple of different
tones in pink and yellow tones lastly
are the much-loved Studio Fix
foundations I used to love this on
myself but I never ever use these
anymore
just because they are very full coverage
and I barely ever use a full coverage on
myself anymore and I will just quickly
show you guys the foundation
as I have with these and these are
highly requested when I do makeovers
because people love to have a full
coverage so I have the colors in NC 42

and NC 15 and also in this tiny little
zip compartment here I have my morphe
lip palette which I love and this feels
way more feel lip palette as you can see
I haven't really gone into it that much
but I've been loving this recently so
these give a majority of different
colors that you can use on the lips and
the cheeks and this is the 10 ln palette
