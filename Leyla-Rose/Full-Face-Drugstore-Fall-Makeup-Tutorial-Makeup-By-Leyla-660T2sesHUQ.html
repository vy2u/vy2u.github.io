today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this full makeup look using only
drugstore or affordable products
I have already primed my skin and filled
in my eyebrows so if you do want to see
an eyebrow tutorial I will link that
down below for you first of all I'm
applying my foundation this is the
L'Oreal infallible 24 hour foundation
I've used this only once before and I
actually really really like this
foundation it really reminds me of the
Mac Studio Fix liquid I'm just applying
that all over my skin using my Real
Techniques sculpting brush I'm using
some concealer to prime my eyes this is
the Maybelline age rewind concealer and
I'm just buffing it in all over the lid
to make sure it covers up all of my
natural pigmentation
I'm also gonna be setting my concealer
just because I don't want it to move all
day and I'm using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder to make sure it
sets in place then for my eye shadow
today I'm taking this sleek matte
palette and first of all taking this
peach shade I'm going to be using this
as the first transition color I'm just
applying this with a fluffy blending
brush into the crease and just making
sure to blend it really really well I
really want to make sure this color is
really well blended that way everything
will blend after it I'm taking this of
warm burgundy shade and I'm gonna be
applying this with these separate
blending brush into the crease just kind
of blending it back and forth and
keeping it towards the crease and the
outer corner just cuz I want to warm up
the crease and I do want to deepen it
but I don't want it to be all about this
color so I am blending it by don't want
it to go up too high and then just
taking that other brush and just
blending that in to that previous color
we applied just to make sure that it
blends more smoothly and we can see a
really nice transition between two
colors and then taking this deep Brown
I'm gonna be taking this and applying
this even further into the crease again
making sure not to take you up too high
because we don't it to be just fully
Brown we want to be able to see all of
the colors we've applied again you just
want to make sure you're blending it
really well with that previous brush to
make sure it transitions well
then taking this l'oreal eyeshadow i'm
gonna be applying this all over my eye
with my finger and as you can see look
how beautiful this color is it's so
stunning and I feel like when use your
finger you can get a real amount of
pigmentation and it looks super glittery
when you use your finger baidu just
going with a brush as well just to clean
up the edges to make it look nice and
neat for my concealer I'm taking this
wake me up concealer from a Rimmel I
believe this is my first time trying it
and I actually really like this
concealer it's really nice and smooth
but it's not too you know full coverage
it's a really nice coverage it's not too
much it's quite light but it does blend
in really well I'm just applying this on
all the areas I would like to bring
forward so under my eyes my forehead the
bridge of my nose and also on my chin as
always again I'm just taking that
previous brush we use to apply our
foundation and just make sure to blend
it in so that there are no harsh lines
I'm also gonna be going in with my
finger as well just so I can really
nicely get into all the little areas and
just blend it out as well as I can
I'm then going to be setting that
concealer with the same instant retouch
powder as I am always using I'm just
applying that on to all the areas we
applied the concealer making sure to set
the under eyes really well just because
my eyes crease very easily so you want
to make sure you get all of the under
eye area I'm also setting my forehead
because my forehead always does tend to
shy
next taking this brown gel liner from
Maybelline I'm gonna be applying a
little bit of this on the outer corner
of my lid and then I'm going to be
smudging it with some of the matte brown
eyeshadow we apply it into the crease
just to give it a really nice softened
effect and then taking some of this dark
charcoal gray shade from the same
palette I'm gonna be using an angled
brush and just pressing it very close to
my top lash line this will just give it
a little bit of definition and just give
the eye a little bit of that kind of
smokiness without over taking the whole
look and then taking these Eldora false
lashes these are the only things in this
whole look that isn't from the drugstore
buy I just love these lashes so I just
had to include them and I'm just
applying these with some tweezers and
some glue and I just absolutely love
this lash style it's so pretty it's so
wispy but full at the same time so I
will definitely link them down below for
you so you can see what they look like
on their website I'm just applying some
mascara to make my natural lashes blend
into the false ones then taking some of
that brown gel liner I'm just going to
be applying that to my waterline to
create a little bit of drama without it
being black black would obviously be
very intense or a Brown is just a little
bit more of a step down from that
then taking a little bit more of that
matte brown shadow we applied in the
crease I'm just gonna be blending that
onto the bottom lash line and just
making sure to blend that with a
blending brush so we get a really nice
soft effect
I'm also taking some of that same color
we applied onto our lid I'm just
applying on the inner corner to give it
a hint of sparkle and then to top
everything off I'm just going to be
applying some mascara to my bottom
lashes so make sure it looks really nice
and balanced and also just to give a
little bit of drama onto that bottom
lash line next we're gonna start
bronzing our skin and I'm taking one of
my favorite bronzing powders at the
moment this is a bronzer blush a duo
from ELF and taking the bronze aside and
just applying it all over the skin with
a big bronzer brush and then I'm gonna
go in with a smaller brush afterwards
and use this to contour as well I
absolutely love the color of this
bronzer because it's nice and warm but
it does still contour and shape the face
at the same time so I just really love
this
to highlight my skin I'm gonna be taking
this eyeshadow from ELF this is in the
color enchanted and this just gives us
the most gorgeous golden glow I love
using my shadows for a highlight and
this is just such a beautiful eyeshadow
so I absolutely love this I'm also going
to be applying that onto the tip of my
nose too just to make my nose look a
little bit more button and like for the
lips I'm gonna be taking a lip pencil
and lining my lips and then I'm gonna go
ahead and fill in my lips completely
with this pencil this lip pencil is NYX
plum retractable lip liner I wore this
in one of my videos a couple of weeks
ago and you guys really wanted to know
what this lip color was and this was a
lip color I was wearing in one of my
videos and you guys really loved it and
I'm gonna be applying a little bit of a
nixed soft matte lip cream as well just
because this lip liner can be very
drying so just adding a lip cream on top
of it just makes it feel a little bit
more comfortable and does give it a
little bit of a reddish tint as well
once that's all opaque like I said I'm
gonna go in with a NYX soft matte lip
cream I decided to go for a kind of
burgundy shade because I wanted to give
it a slight ombre effect
so just applying this into the center of
the lips and making sure to Pat my lips
together so guys that is the end of this
makeup tutorial I hope that you enjoyed
it's been a while since I've done a
drugstore full face makeup tutorial I
love doing looks that are more dramatic
with drugstore products because a lot of
people feel that they can't do dramatic
looks the stuff that you can find in the
drugstore or with things that are really
affordable all of these products are so
affordable and I absolutely love each
and every one of them and I hope you
guys enjoyed the tutorial I created with
it if you guys would like to see more
