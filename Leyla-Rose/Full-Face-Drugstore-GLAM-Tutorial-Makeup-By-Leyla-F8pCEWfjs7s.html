skies
hey guys and welcome back to my Channel
today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this bold face glamorous look
using only affordable products
you see
so to get started I'm going to be using
this Kiko full-coverage concealer as my
eye primer this just has a very similar
feel to the soft ochre Paint Pot from
Merck the only difference is is that it
doesn't dry as much so I am going to be
setting this with a powder and I'm just
using a translucent powder and just
using a setting brush just to go over it
to prevent any creasing
then to start with my first transition
shade I'm going to be taking this
bourgeois chocolate bronzer and start by
applying this into the crease because
this will just give us that really nice
warm transition shade that a normal
matte eyeshadow can give us next I'm
going to be taking these sleek contour
kits in medium and just start to use
this as a deeper brown shade to use
within the crease this will just
slightly deepen it and prepare the eye
for the smokiness that we're going to
apply and then I'm just going to go back
into that previous brush and just make
sure that it is very well blended go
back into this color as many times as
you need to to make sure that is as
pigmented as possible
next I'm just going to be taking a q-tip
and some makeup remover and just
cleaning up the edge to make it look a
lot neater and then I'm taking the
Maybelline
lasting drama eyeliner in the brown
shade and just using my finger to blend
this all over my lid and this is just
going to give us that really nice smoky
effect and then I'm just taking a
synthetic brush and just blending this
color into the crease as you can see I'm
just applying a very small amount of
this and just using this to blend it
into the crease make sure you're using a
synthetic brush because this will just
blend a lot easier than a natural hair
brush then I'm just taking this Kiko
color sphere eyeshadow and just patting
this all over my lid just patting this
on top of the eyeliner to create a
really nice glistening effect
and then I'm just going back into that
blending brush to make sure everything
is blended out then I'm going to be
taking this berry M pigment and just
highlighting my inner corner to open up
my eyes to the inner corner will just be
nice and bright which will make the eyes
look nice and open next I'm going to be
taking the L'Oreal super slim eyeliner
and just start to do a really nice wing
I wanted to go for something very feline
like because this whole look is very cat
eye ish so I really wanted to make sure
that the wing was very nice and
elongated if you guys do want to see an
in-depth video of how I do my eyeliner I
will link that into the description box
then I'm just applying my lashes these
are the forty-seventh lashes by red
cherry and I'm just applying these onto
my lashline to create some extra drama
next for my face I'm going to be using
the maybelline baby skin primer and just
be applying this all over my skin to
fill in any pores and to go into all
them little fine lines and this will
just make my skin look nice and smooth
and the next for my foundation I'm using
the Loreal infallible matte foundation
this is the 24-hour one and this is the
first time I actually used this
foundation and to be honest with you I
would moisturize my face a lot more
because it was very drying so if you
have dry skin this probably isn't the
best foundation for you because I don't
have very dry skin and it was picking up
a lot of my dry skin apart from that it
was very flawless and I did like the way
it blended in after using my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge and
I always use this damp so I've just
dampened my sponge I'm just blending
this all into my skin and this actually
is a really nice foundation so I'm going
to kind of experiment with it and just
see what works best but this may be
using a different primer so that it
doesn't look that dry but throughout the
day it did look quite dry so I just
thought I'd give you a little mini first
impression of that next I'm going to be
highlighting my under eyes with my
Maybelline fit me concealer and just
going right underneath the eyes and just
making sure to highlight all of the high
points of my face I'm also taking this
down the sides of my nose just to narrow
my nose down
and I'm also highlighting the forehead
at the bridge of my nose and also my
chin then I'm just taking that same
sponge and just blending that in to my
complexion
and then to get into all the little fine
areas that the sponge can't reach as
always I'm using my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush this is like my favorite
brush in the whole world for concealer
because it just makes life so easy so
I'm just using that on the sides of my
nose and also on the little inner parts
of my eye and then I'm just going over
my under eyes and a couple of other high
points of my face with the Maybelline
age rewind concealer because this one is
a little bit brighter and I just wanted
to create a little bit more of a
highlighted effect on these areas then
to set that I'm using Lee soap &amp;amp; Glory
kick-ass powder and just using my sponge
to bounce this into my skin to set all
those areas and make sure that they
don't move next I'm going to be doing my
eyebrows and I'm just taking some
concealer and just highlighting
underneath my brow just to make it nice
and clear how we are going to be filling
them in and then I am taking this I
think it's a Rimmel pencil this is like
the first pencil I ever used using a
very light hand because this is so dark
and I don't like my brows to be too dark
anymore because they can be a little bit
harsh so I'm just using that through the
brow I'm just making sure to comb it
through as I'm using it
next I'm going to be taking this
Maybelline
lasting drama liner and just using the
black shade and applying this into my
waterline and also applying it
underneath my lash line and we are going
to be sort of smudging this out and
making a look a very dramatic and smoky
I'm using a little bit of that bronzer
and just applying some onto my brush and
just using this to smudge the eyeliner
and just to make sure that everything
looks nice and smudgy
you
you
you
I also went ahead and did a little bit
of a feline flick on the inner corner
but for some reason my camera cut it out
so you can go ahead and do that if you
want to I wanted to because I thought
I'd just kind of tied the look together
next I'm going to be bronzing my skin
and I'm using the revolution baked
bronzer and just be applying this onto
these sides of my forehead underneath my
cheekbones and also on my jawline and
then I'm taking that same sleek contour
kit that we used for our eyes and just
use it to contour my cheeks a little bit
to highlight I'm using the Kiko
eyeshadow but I'm just using this to
highlight this is apparently a dupe of
whisper of guilt from Mac I don't know I
never actually owned it but it is a
really nice cool just gold color and
then I'm just contouring my nose a
little bit with that same sleek contour
kit just to narrow it down a little bit
to line my lips I'm using a Kiko lip
liner and this is one of the retractable
ones and I wanted to go for a really
simple lip so I'm just lining my lips
with this and also filling it in and
then I'm going to go over it with the
NYX soft matte lip cream in London and
this just creates a really gorgeous
beige matte nude that isn't too much and
all the focus will be on the eyes
