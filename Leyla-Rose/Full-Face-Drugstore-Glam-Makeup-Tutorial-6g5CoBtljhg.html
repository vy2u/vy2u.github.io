today I'm going to be doing this all
drugstore slash affordable makeup load
so if it's not from the drugstore I will
be linking it down below so you know
where to buy it even down to the brushes
I tried my very best to use all four
cool brushes as well so a lot of morphe
Real Techniques and crown brushes things
that are not as expensive as the weimar
Sigma and back so I kind of stayed away
from those today I love doing this
drugstore glam so it's thumbs up if you
want to see more drugstore glam
tutorials and I'd also follow my social
media as well Twitter Instagram and
snapchat all of them a makeup by Leila
and I use them a lot so go follow me and
we can have a nice chat and we can be
friends and subscribe to my blog channel
as well because I am posting a lot more
vlogs on there so yes subscribe so you
know when I upload if you want to see
how I achieved this makeup look using
all affordable brushes and makeup and
just keep on watching so to again I'm
going to be priming my skin using my
Maybelline pore minimizer wait now
that's not as good it's the baby skin
but it does only the rise the size of
your pores so I just applied that all
over and now I'm going in with my
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless at
the moment this isn't available in the
UK I did buy this whilst I was in LA but
I believe they are bringing over to the
UK I'm not too sure about that but I'm
pretty sure sooner or later it will be
available in the UK I'm just applying
this all over my face and buffing it all
in with this morphe brush I love this
foundation it's definitely my favorite
Maybelline foundation out there it's
amazing so I'm just buffing this all
over to create a nice flawless finish
moving on to my eyes I'm taking the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and using it at my eye primer just to
cancel out the colors of my eye and also
to make my eye shadow to stick a lot
better and I'm also just making sure
that I set it as well just so that it
doesn't budge or crease for my eye
shadow I am taking the makeup revolution
eye hot chocolate palette and I'm going
to be taking this peachy brown shade
right here this is going to be my first
transition shade and I'm just applying
this in the crease making sure to build
this color up quite a bit using this
brush from crown brushes and I'm just
making sure to keep packing on that
color so it creates a really nice peachy
brown shade in that crease as this is
the first color we're applying you want
to make sure you blend this as well as
you possibly can that way all the colors
we apply next will apply a lot more
evenly next I'm just going to be
applying this matte brown shade it's
kind of like a medium toned Brown and
I'm just going to be applying that in
the deeper part of my crease using that
same brush just to slowly deepen this
area I'm going to be going in with one
more darker Brown and this color will
just help to prepare for that and make
that darker Brown apply a lot more
easily and also blend easier as well
then I'm taking that darker Brown and
just taking it on a slightly more
detailed brush this one is from morphe
and I'm just going to be applying it
into that really deep socket of our
crease this is just going to make our
crease look a little bit deeper and it's
also just going to give our eyes a
little bit more structure as well I
wanted to keep the lid nice and simple
so I'm just taking this matte cream
shade and I'm just going to be patting
this all along the lid you do have to
kind of pack this shadow on quite a bit
so as you can see I'm using these
patting motions and that will just Pat
on more color if you use more swiping
motions it's not really going to Pat on
that colors as you can see I'm really
kind of patting it on to get that
pigmentation
next I'm going to be creating that bold
wing this really does create the whole
eye look and I am taking this L'Oreal
super lino slim which is one of my
favorite eyeliners for creating a wing
just because it's so easy to use I'm
going to be first of all just lining the
top of my lid and then creating my wing
I always find it so hard to capture me
creating a wing on camera but this is
pretty much what I do I create the edge
and then I just connect the two lines
together and it's all about practicing
if you find it hard to create that wing
you can use a piece of tape that
definitely does make it easier if you
are a beginner next I'm just popping on
my lashes these are the Coco Goddess
lashes and these are obviously not from
the drugstore but they are pretty
inexpensive I think they're $6.99 in
dollars so they're not expensive in
pounds either so not too expensive and
they're my favorite lashes I just
applied that with some black lash glue
and now I'm just going to be applying
some mascara to really make my lashes
blend in the mascara I'm using is my
favorite you guys probably seen this a
billion times on my channel by now this
is the L'Oreal Paris full / sculpt and
I'm just really pushing that against the
false lashes to really make them join
together now for some highlighting I'm
taking the Rimmel wake me up concealer
and I'm just applying that on all the
areas I would like to bring forward and
also on the sides of my nose as well to
narrow my nose down and then I'm also
just going to be applying that on to my
chin as well and be blending it out with
the same brush I use to blend in my
foundation
I'm also just patting in my concealer
using my finger especially in the areas
that are a little bit harder to reach
with a larger brush and then I'm going
to be setting all the areas I applied
the concealer with my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder my favorite
powder of all time and I'm so happy that
it's from the drugstore because it's
amazing so I'm just using my Real
Techniques setting brush
just to set all those areas I like the
size of this brush it's very small so
it's easy to get up right under the eyes
next I'm going to be doing my eyebrows
I'm first of all just brushing through
my brows using this double-ended brush
from ELF and then I'm going to be taking
this eyebrow duo from NYX I believe this
is fairly new it's an eyebrow pencil on
one end and then the other side is a
concealer which is so handy so I'm first
of all just going to be applying this
roughly through my eyebrows and creating
a shape of what I want my eyebrows to
look like and then I am going to
gradually build up that color and make
it look quite dark I am also going back
into that double-ended brush from ELF
and just making sure to brush my
eyebrows through and then I'm also going
to be taking some of that concealer from
the double-ended NYX pencil and just
applying it with that elf brush just
because I find that I can create a
really nice detailed carving on the
bottom of my brow when I use it with a
brush
I'm now going to be finishing off my
eyes and I am applying this Rimmel
pencil this is the scandalized one and
I'm just applying it on to the waterline
first of all and then I'm going to be
applying it onto the bottom lash line
too and I'm going to be really really
smoking this out because this really
helps to create that just gorgeous
feline look that I'm going for and this
pencil blends so easily and this is just
my favorite black pencil I think one of
my favorite black pencils and taking
this teeny tiny pencil brush from morphe
and just making sure to smudge this
pencil whilst it is still wet and then
when it dries it sets in place so it
doesn't even really need to be set with
a powder which I love I'm just making
sure all of the harsh lines are nice and
blended and then looking nice and smoky
of course I'm just going to be finishing
off with some mascara on the bottom
lashes and I'm using the same mascara I
used for my top lashes for bronzer I'm
taking this elf duo and I'm taking the
bronze side and I'm just going to be
taking this big fluffy morphe brush and
just applying it around the outer
perimeter of my skin this just gives me
a little bit of color and I'm just
applying on the area's kind of where I'd
contour and I don't know I'm just not a
big fan of contour right now all about
the highlight and I'm taking this
goddess of love highlight from makeup
revolution and I'm just going to be
applying it onto the tops of my
cheekbones can you see this highlight
guys oh my gosh this is my new favorite
highlight it's gorgeous and for the lips
I am going to be taking this natural
retractable lip pencil from NYX and in
first we're just going to be applying
that all over the lips and then I'm
going to be going around the outer edges
with a dark brown lip pencil from NYX
also just to give my lips some
definition because this lip color is
extremely light so it needed a little
bit of something so I just went around
the outer edges to really give my lips
some definition and then the liquid
lipstick I'm using is this NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick I'm not really sure how
I feel about these I mean they are
really really nice but they are not very
full coverage in color like you really
have to apply a few layers if that makes
sense that is the end of this makeup
look guys I really hope you enjoyed this

hope you guys want to see more full face
