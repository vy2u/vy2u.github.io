today I'm going to be doing with you
guys a full face first impression video
I actually try out a ton of products
that I've never used before on my face
and I basically give you guys a little
first impression of it my saw my recent
makeup haul I will link it just here
just thinking you guys haven't seen it
yet these are basically all the products
I spoke about in that video and I
haven't had a chance to use them yet
because I've been so busy with Halloween
tutorials and non Beauty looks majority
of the products I used today were from
that whole there are a few things that I
didn't have to do a first impression on
for example I didn't have a new
foundation to try or concealer or powder
and a few other bits but apart from that
everything else is a first impression so
I kind of showed you guys what I think
of each product and if I think it's
worth it and if I think it's easy to use
and yeah I created this look with this
if you want to see how I created this
look at seeing my first impression on
some new stuff then just keep on
watching let's start off with my primer
this is the natural radiance primer from
Mac and I'm just gonna be applying this
all over my skin just to hydrate and
prime my skin at the same time for my
foundation I'm gonna be taking the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk and this is
in the color 6.25 to blend in my
foundation I'm gonna be using the elf
ultimate blending brush and this was one
of the brushes that I did receive in my
whole brush just blended everything in
sorry beautifully I'm just patting on a
little bit of extra coverage just
because this foundation I'm using is
kind of like a medium coverage and so
I'm just packing on a little bit more
coverage on the areas that need a little
bit more but so far I absolutely love
this brush it's really nice you guys
know I love the sculpting brush from
Real Techniques a little bit fluffier
than the Real Techniques one and but I
do really like it I could see myself
using this kind of brush a lot but just
applied a little bit of concealer over
my lid just because I wanted to cancel
out the natural color of my eyelid I
used the NYX HD concealer next I'm gonna
be taking the BH cause
takes party-girl palette I have not used
this I've only swatched a few colors and
there are so many nice you know bright
colors in this but I did want to create
kind of a little bit more of a natural
look as well so I'm gonna be taking this
matte Brown
I could tell from even when i swatched
the colors from this palette that they
were so pigmented even the matte ones
but these matte colors are beautiful
that I love this matte brown so much it
mean it's gorgeous then it's blending
beautifully it's not patchy or chalky so
I really really like it I'm gonna be
taking this elf eyeliner and shadows
thick and I'm gonna be taking the shadow
stick side and I'm gonna be using it as
a base for my lid this is like a golden
colors it's gonna make the gold eye
shadow I apply it a lot brighter and I'm
just gonna be applying this all over the
lid they do feel a little bit sticky but
I'm gonna set it and see how it feels
and kind of fill my eyelids like
sticking together a little bit so I
definitely feel like it needs to be set
and instead of using the elf baked
eyeshadow in the color and chanted and
that is just this color right here is so
pretty it reminds me of this kind of
rose gold of the cream eyeshadow anyway
so this will just hopefully intensify it
a little bit more so don't if you guys
can see the difference between the tube
as you can see it's just made everything
look a lot more vibrant I definitely
thought the baked eyeshadows work a lot
better with a face underneath that your
products go really well together and I
just love the color of these just to
deepen up the crease a little bit and
just to give it a little bit deaf
initiai I'm gonna be taking this dark
matte Brown that's just down here and
I'm just gonna be applying this into the
outer corner just to give it a little
bit more definition and just to smoke it
up a little bit just to put a little bit
into the crease and I do feel like it's
blending in really well with the other
colors I really like this palette and I
feel like B I've never tried BH
Cosmetics before and I just love this
today I felt like going for a wing and
using the BH Cosmetics and liquid
eyeliner and this is any color noir and
I am really excited because this is it
pen liner and you guys know I love pen
liner let's see how this turns out
because I don't like shiny formulas I
hope it comes out more map than shiny
and so we'll just see how it goes so I'm
just gonna apply this all over the lid
in a wing shape
I feel like I'm gonna have to go over
this with either a gel or another liquid
liner that comes out more matte
just because I personally prefer a matte
finish it's not like it's the end of the
world for me but because my eyeshadow is
shiny I like my eyeliner to stand out
and for it to be Superman oh this would
be great to sculpt out your liner and if
you like matte like me you can fill it
in with another liner that you love I'm
just gonna be applying at the balm
Schwing liquid liner on top so before I
move on to anything else I'm actually
gonna go ahead and do my concealer again
like I said in the beginning have any
new concealer or powder to try so I'm
just gonna speed through this part
because you guys have obviously seen it
and they're not new products I'll be
using the Dream Lumi touch highlighting
concealer from Maybelline and I'm just
gonna be applying this underneath my
eyes also gonna be applying a little bit
on my forehead down the bridge of my
nose just to narrow it a little bit and
also on my chin and to blend that in I'm
gonna be using the same brush I used to
blend in my foundation
next I'm just going to be taking my soap
and glory instant retouch powder and
just be setting all the areas we applied
that concealer now that my face is all
set I'm going to be filling in my brows
you guys know I love specifically a few
products to fill in my brows only hope
that these brow products I'm going to
try something else because I'm always
looking for good brow product my brows
today I'm going to be taking the elf
instant lift brow pencil and this is an
e color medium brown and I'm just gonna
be combing my brows through with the
spoolie end and just making sure to put
them in the position that I like I like
to flick them in on the inner corner and
then as it gets to the outer corner go
to the natural direction of the hair
okay so I just filled in one brow with
this and you do not need to put a lot of
pressure on this at all you literally
just touch it to the skin and it
instantly comes off so you definitely
need to have a light hand when using
this because I do feel like it was very
easy to go too far but this really
really like it though I could definitely
see myself using this pencil more it's
very pigmented which is definitely a
good thing but it does come off quite
harsh so if you are going for a natural
look go as light handed as you possibly
can I'm just gonna quickly set my brows
you guys know that I can't not do this I
don't have a new version of this so I'm
just gonna go for my usual
anastacio clear brow gel and just put my
brows into place now that my brows on I
am going to go for some lashes I've
actually worn these once before but they
are fairly new I only use this in my
doll Halloween tutorial so I hadn't used
it for a beauty like yeah this is kind
of a first impression but I just don't
have any new lashes apart from these
ones so these are the Eldora false
lashes in the number n105 they are such
an interesting shape and they're kind of
spiky and dole like that's why I use
them for that tutorial so I'm really
interested to see how these will look on
also gonna be popping on some mascara
this is the BH Cosmetics along with sexy
lashes lengthening mascara and I'm just
going to be applying this to my natural
lashes to blend into my lips once it'll
be using that same cream eyeshadow and
eyeliner duo and I'm just gonna be
applying the brown eyeshadow onto the
bottom lash line actually really like
both ends of this I feel that this is
such a smart idea it's quite a soft
brown and it's quite natural so kind of
blend that eyeshadow out using that soft
brown we used to apply it into the
crease next I'm just gonna be popping a
thick coat of mascara to my bottom
lashes to balance the top and the bottom
ones so I really like the way that my
eyes are looking now the lashes and the
mascara have definitely transformed it I
really like the mascara because again it
gives it that really nice dull I effect
and the obviously the lashes are very
different and I really like them I do
have other lashes I could have used I
wanted to use these because they are
very different and I just wanted to show
you guys a little first impression of
them they are definitely different for
me I never wear lashes like this I tend
to go more for wispy eyelashes or if
they are pointy they are never this
pointy and spiky so I'm not used to it I
actually really really like it my
bronzer slash contour I'm gonna be
taking the contouring blush and bronzing
powder in the color Fiji from ELF and
this is what it looks like and I
mentioned this at my whole and that I
was really excited about it I'm really
excited about this color because it
looks like a really nice natural grunge
so I'm just gonna apply this and see how
it turned out I'm taking this on Amy's
away about 101 goddess
it's so pigmented like we kind of went
everywhere okay so you don't need to tap
your brush in don't put too much oh
that's nice
yes yes Layla likey so this is super
pigmented I really like the color I love
that it's Superman because I like to use
bronzer sometimes that contour and
bronze at the same time and this is just
perfect I absolutely love this I love
that it's not too warm it just looks
like a really nice natural bronzy color
I love I'm gonna take a little bit more
of that powder on this elf contour brush
which is of course new as well and I'm
just going to
this to contort the hollow of my cheeks
I do feel like that contour brush is
better for cream but I did want to see
how it looked with powder it definitely
did work but it did make it look a tad
bit patchy and which I always get with
them kind of contour brushes so
definitely just go in with another brush
afterwards you're just gonna pop on a
little bit of this blush from that same
contour palette and just pop it on the
apples of my cheeks to highlight I'm
gonna be taking the elf baked blush in
the color pink tastic and I'm just gonna
be using that with the same brush and
just swirling a little bit onto my brush
and just popping it onto my cheekbones
this is pretty
my lips I'm gonna be taking the elf lip
definer and shaper and taking the define
and I'm gonna be using this to fill in
and also wide my lips as well this is my
color all around the lips decided to
just take a little bit of caulk lip
liner and just run it along the outside
to give it a little bit more extra
definition just because I'm really not
used to this I never really go for
colors like this alone and if I do I
always put a darker lip liner so guys
this is the finished look I'm actually
obsessed with how it came out I really
really like the lip color and just the
eyelashes and the contour I actually
love so many of the products that I
tried today mainly this I think has to
be the star of the show for me I am
living for this contour the highlight is
also beautiful but this contour though
amazing I think if you have a similar
skin tone to me you will love this not
only is the blush color a beautiful
blush color for other toned girls by
also absolutely
I'm loving this contour color do you
love everything the eyeshadow there's
not one thing I actually disliked I
think the thing that I found maybe the
hardest to use was probably the brows
but that's it and I'm just so super
happy so I hope you guys enjoyed this
