channel and doing the clap because I
can't stop cutting whenever I introduce
to you if you guys are all doing well
today so today I'm going to be doing a
first impression slash like trying to
make up a kind of video I've done one of
these before I think I've done a few but
ever really done one in a while so I
wanted to do another one begins I have
just received so much cool makeup
recently and I just really wanted to try
it it just looks like I created with the
products some of the products are not
new and then the majority of the
products are new just because I have a
lot of makeup but not every single like
aspect of makeup make sure you give me a
big thumbs up and make sure you want to
go below and let me know some products
that you want me to buy and try next
subscribe to my channel if you have
already and let's get on into this video
let's go okay guys why I need to a comic
start a video about clapping this just
oh my gosh no it's deafening a default
you know I'm going to take this off and
put this back on afterwards because it
has my neck he actually is a choker
keep it or even oyster eyes to my skin
today and I'm going to go ahead and
apply some more primer I like to prime
my skin a lot so I'm just going in with
the sparkle tinted under makeup primer
from laura geller
and i have tried this before and I don't
have a new primer to try today but this
is relatively new for me so you really
really like this primer and it's very
hydrating I'm very into like Shiba
hydrating primers lately just because I
don't know I just thought my skin's been
getting really dry okay so I have a
bunch of the iconic London pigment stick
so the color that I'm going to be using
is icon 3 and there are so many so many
colors so I think that's amazing
josh is calling me hello again has been
quite dry lately so the puddings are
quite dry feeling I'm going to take some
of these matchbox but to finish prime
oil just to make it feel a little bit
more under nice like hydrating feeling
basically so I'm going to do is just
apply some of this onto my skin
and then I'm just going to use the oil
on my beauty blender I have tried to all
four I haven't really used it that much
so I'm really excited to try it with
that I've got a couple of drops of this
onto the back of my beauty blender and
just blend this into my skin I would be
honest with you guys I have not found a
stick foundation that I actually like I
tried to make up for everyone I
understand alike and everyone was raving
about it so I kind of just gave up a
little bit I was like maybe stick
foundations just aren't to me so
hopefully I like this one are really
nice all this color as you can see it
matches my neck really really nice so
you're just going to put a little bit
more on the areas I need I just
remembered I didn't color correct today
I always color correct and I just forgot
so that's we're really going to make a
difference because I don't know
personally I subscribe or when I color
correct and just going to share it back
in with the Beauty Blender
okay so so far I really like the way
this looks on the skin I'm very glad I
applied some oil with it because I do
feel like it would have been too drying
on my skin so definitely better in line
but this is the first declination I've
ever used and actually really light
there so I don't have an actual
concealer to try for the first time
today but I do have a color corrector
and this is the Maybelline Dream
brightening creamy concealer in 14 I'm
going to use it as a color corrector
because the tone of it is something I
use more the color corrector for my
under eyes and I'm just going to pop
this under my eyes and also like right
here and I'm very like in a part of the
hollow of my eye because my under eyes
tend to get quite dark there and I'm
just going to use my beauty blender to
blend that in so that concealer / color
corrector is really nice I would
definitely say that it other Naseem is
it's a CAD drawing a little bit just
because my skin is quite dry right now
but it looks really really smooth just a
teeny tiny bit of a bit of dry skin that
have under my eye anyway it's just
sticking on up on that but many many
consumers would do that so so far so
good
I'm just going to go on top with my
usual
reinsert me because it's a go-to for me
so this is just going to conceal and
brighten then I'm just going to set this
using somewhat translucent powder and
this is the Too Faced translucent powder
so it's something that I really really
like about this foundation is that it
does show through your skin so that
basically it doesn't feel super super
cakey but the coverage is actually
really really good so but I'm going to
be trans a bunch of new NYX products
today
and I'm just letting you guys know that
they're actually launching today a good
day that this is actually going up onto
YouTube they have launched in the UK so
if you are probably in the US you've
probably already got them in stores and
stuff like that but mixes actually
launched these on their new website so I
will link them upside down below I'm
going to be using the love contours all
palette and I'm just going to open it
out and actually seen this properly and
this is amazing in here we have some eye
shadow colors contour colors and also
highlight colors as well if you coming
back to these colors later on to the
eyes but so now I'm going to go in with
this lighter contour shade and just go
around the outer part over my face and
let's just see how it looks
the other one looks really dark so I'm
not too sure about that so I'm gonna go
in with the light ones flat but oh I
didn't know I just wanted to be that
pigment in what okay so it seems to say
that is super pigmented so don't go in
it with your brush like that like I did
I think it was so light I just expected
it to not be pigmented but it's
pigmented to say that this palette is so
pigmented if the lens so easily like
even though it went on quite harshly and
pigmented this powder blends out really
really easily seasoned next we're going
to be trying out the benefit California
blush now I used to love benefits like
books anything really and I still do I
don't think they've released anything
new for a long time and this is just
sort of stunning first of all it's just
the summer vibes right this just makes
me one wanna go back to California - I
just wanted to be summer and three can
we drive
I think this is probably like my
favorite blush they have ever go out if
the coral blush for the gold Sheen and
that's probably one of my ideal blushes
anything that's got a gold undertone is
perfect for me because of my golden
undertone in my skin
plus the smell of this just smells a
spring such sunlight I don't even
understand how this can make me miss
summer but this really does it I'm
really scared now to put things on my
face are too intense but just going to
really tap off the excess to sort and
put on too much yeah I like this it's
very red I like a blush because usually
blushes just look way too intense on me
I do have to say though that initial
like last bit of gold after applying it
onto my skin it's not really there
anymore I don't know I still like the
color a lot and it doesn't feel like
it's going to be one of my favorite
blushes for the spring and summer wish
that it was consistently gold throughout
I'm going to try the next away.we glow
liquid highlighter and this is in the
shade crystal Blair now I thought I'd go
for this so that could be one of them
really nice champagne highlights I'm
going to pop this onto the tops of my
cheeks on a fit of the consistency isn't
really thick which is definitely nice
because it feels like skin underneath it
as you can see I just apply a second
layer of it and it's definitely
buildable so that is what the liquid
illuminator looks like I am loving this
honestly I just think this works so was
it a natural natural incredible glow and
I love it so much after it's done I'm
going to be moving on to eyebrows and
now next have just come out with a bunch
of new eyebrow pencils which is very
exciting this is a sharp and a ball
pencil and then on the other end we have
a spoolie so we're gonna try this and
see what we've seen come a little bit
closer I've brushed my hair up with the
spoolie and we're going to start filling
it in I don't have it for anything too
intense because I've been feeling a
natural brow lately and I've been
working to go for quite a straight style
so
just filling in the bottom part I do
really like these pencils but I do like
it when brow products are quite fine so
this is a little bit more about a
thicker edge so it's not quite like the
Anastacio one or even then NYX micro
brow pencil this is a little bit more of
a you know just like something to
disperse color a little bit more openly
instead of to do it in a more precise
way so I do like this but it's maybe not
the best thing for what I want to draw a
little brow hair they are very very
pigmented so you do not depress hard at
all which is really good because you
save a little product so my brows are
fully done now I'm going to be moving
into this palette again and we're going
to be using some of the eye shadows so
I'm not too sure what kind of look I'm
going to go for one of us will go into
this shade right here as my first color
in the crease
I might mix it with that contour shade I
used as well and just literally pop that
straight in the crease I just have to
say this like our SUVs are so pigmented
so pigmented so always watch like wanna
see it done anything so I'm just
blending this color into my crease and I
wish I put either on like the color or
just applied less of this even so though
it's blending so easily
I'm going to take this color right here
and this is just like a dark kind of
Moroni Brown but it looks very dark so
now I'm going to go in with some of the
NYX prismatic eyeshadows now oh my gosh
I'm talking everything today they come
in a bunch of different colors like
there are greens here there are like flu
round a very very intense colors I'm
stuck between the rose gold and the
copper so why not use bugs because
they're not I think this called the
shade 5 and just apply this onto my lid
oh my gosh this is intense Wow someone's
like too bright I did not expect it to
be that bright I'm just going to go over
over some of this rose gold one and then
just to add on top of that is on the
inner corner as we
some of the Knicks pigment and this is
the shade seven then I'm going to be
trying the NYX epic ink liner in black
noir and this looks amazing this kind of
looks like the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
the brush form look at this
finished off my eyeliner local although
I haven't had like the best eyeliner day
you know and that happens I hate when
that happens I'm just going to buy some
lashes and then finish off the eyes I'm
just using the same palette and then
we're going to move on to the lips
if so I have some lip liners now and I'm
so excited these are the NYX sway matte
lip liners just going in with a color
stand stool going to be going around the
outer edges using the color downtown
Beauty just to make the lips look a
little bit fuller and then on top of
that I'm going to be taking the urban
decay advice liquid lipstick I have
tried these like once but not properly
so this is kind of like a first
impression and I'm going to use my color
1 9 9 3 or 1993 so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video the majority the
products are actually really really
liked I do feel like the first
impression so like I said when you kind
of try them and you get more use to them
that's what I feel like you can really
make them shine because you know exactly
how to use them so yes I love this look
actually and I didn't like it when I was
doing the eyeshadow but now that the
full look is on I'm loving it so if you
guys did enjoy this kind of video then
