today I have a get ready with me for you
I'm gonna be showing you how to achieve
my hair my makeup my outfit perfect for
a date night and yeah if you guys like
these types of videos be sure to give it
a thumbs up and if you want to see how I
achieved it then just keep on watching
so guys I'm starting off with a fresh
face and I'm putting my hair away from
it and just moisturizing and priming
this is just a normal situation I will
usually like to make sure my skin is
nice and prepped my skin is pretty red
right now obviously I'm going through a
little bit of skin issues but also I
just had a facial like the day before
this so it was looking pretty red and
inflamed which is totally normal so once
I pry and I use my color correction it's
no more just because this really helps
to cut down on that redness my skin is
quite bumpy in this video and it's gonna
be very visible so if you guys notice my
makeup isn't sitting the best it's just
cuz my skin is just not at its best
right now so yep that's why but as you
can see my face does not match my body I
have a natural town because I just got
back from being away so I'm mixing my
foundation on my body to make sure that
it matches and then I'm putting it on my
face and making sure that it looks all
nice and blended in with my neck also so
once I applied my foundation I wanted to
blend it in today with a it's cosmetics
kabuki brush I'd never tried this before
and honestly I love this brush it
blended everything in so well
considering as well my skin texture and
just the way that my skin's been feeling
next I'm going in with some concealer
underneath my eyes and I used the Urban
Decay all nighter concealer this is
honestly my new favorite concealer I
love the formula of this it is very
thick so I did use a Beauty Blender to
apply this into the skin just because it
kind of takes away that extra coverage
and makes it look a lot more smooth I
applied this under my eyes and on my
eyelids just to brighten this area and
this also acted as my eye primer as well
so that when we apply our eye shadow it
blends in perfectly and I just applied a
little bit of extra underneath the inner
corners of my eyes and this just created
such a nice flawless effect and then I
did go in and set my skin with the
Rimmel insta matte powder I really love
that powder it's really nice and smooth
so once everything was all set in I went
in with some bronzer and the thing is
about my skin is that it's all very
concentrated like all of the acne around
my cheek area so it makes it really hard
for me to bronze without without it
looking patchy it's so annoying but I
can't go without bronzing so I did still
bronze my skin and then I took my own
estar SIA Beverly Hills contour kit and
just used some highlight shades on the
areas I wanted to bring forward for my
eyebrows today I'm gonna be taking this
brow primer from Benefit and just
applying it through my brows and
allowing it to dry before actually
filling in the brows it's funny because
when I actually get ready for things I
honestly get ready in the weirdest order
you guys are gonna definitely notice
that I just get really in the weirdest
order but yeah then I went in with a
brow pencil also from Benefit and just
use this to fill in my eyebrows and I
went in for something that kind of just
accentuated my natural brow shape so it
made it look more defined but it doesn't
look too unnatural at the same time so
moving on to eye shadow I am taking the
coloured raine my car remember the name
of this palette but I will definitely
leave it written down below as well as
all the rest of the products but this
involves a lot of warm colors and I
honestly love the way my eyeshadow
turned out I kind of went for this
spotlight eye so it kind of adds shadow
on the outer and inner corner of the eye
so first of all I'm just going in with a
kind of warm brown shade and just
applying this all over the crease
area not really focusing it anywhere
just kind of putting it everywhere I'm
making sure it's nice and blended and
then I went in with a darker brown and
started to apply this on the outer
corner and I started off first of all
with a blending brush and then I go in
with a pencil brush afterwards and start
to concentrate this color on that outer
corner and then also we're going to be
applying this on the inner corner to
create that halo effect around the eye
now it's not often I do these halo looks
but I do really like the way that they
turn out
so once I have that darker shade on the
inner and outer corner I'm also just
going to be using this shimmery gold
shade from the palette and just using my
finger to apply this to the center of my
eye I also went on top of this with this
Bobby Brown shimmery eyeshadow and this
just created a little bit of sparkle on
top of this and this is what creates
that halo effect and that really nice
spotlight on the center of the eye I
also just went in and applied a clear
brow gel through my eyebrows this is
also from benefit as well I just totally
forgot to do this beforehand next I'm
just applying some mascara to my top
lashes before we apply a force lashes to
our top lid and I'm just applying that
on the top lashes quite generously
little bit too generously clearly and
then I'm just applying some highlight
onto the tops of my cheekbones I told
you guys I do things in the weirdest
order when I'm actually getting ready I
don't know why and then I'm applying my
false lashes these are the Lily lashes
in mikonos definitely one of my
favorites and I just love the way the
false lashes just transform this look
into looking way more glam just because
the eye shadow look is really pretty
baidu feel like it need some kind of
definition on the lash line and I didn't
want it to be eyeliner so false lashes
really gives that and then I just took
some of that brown eyeshadow and just
applied it on the outer bottom lash line
just to connect it to the rest of the
eyeshadow and then finish this eye look
off with some mascara next for my lips
I'm going to be aligning them using this
suede lip pencil from NYX I wanted to go
for something that was a little bit more
darker and the pink toned but not too
dog it's still on the nude scale but
it's not like a really light nude if
that makes sense
so once I would apply this to my lips I
went in with a little bit of a liquid
lipstick and just kind of blended it in
and it's a really nice cool toned pink I
just really like the way that this
turned out so now I'm moving on to my
hair I'm just sectioning my hair it will
probably be in about three sections and
I'm just going to be basically using a
pretty small barrel just to call my hair
in different directions there really is
no method to this I do like to apply
some heat protectant to my hair
beforehand because my hair obviously is
lightened and it's tough
more prone to breakage so I go in with
this curly
Owen from Bellamy is there six in one
color and I take a pretty small barrel
it's not one of the larger ones and it's
also not the tiny one so it's kind of
like a medium-sized and I just go in and
call my hair inwards and outwards there
really is no direction to this I kind of
just switch it up some go out some go in
and I just do that all the way around my
head there really is no like definite
way to do this I just like to make sure
that everything is nice and cold I don't
like to touch it whilst it's been cold
because I like to let it cool down
before I touch anything so as you can
see once it's cold I won't touch it and
I'll just continue on with the rest of
the head so once the whole head is done
don't worry we're not going to stay like
this I am going to be brushing through
my hair and it should hold up really
well because of the heat protectant I
used actually holds it really well and
also because you've let it cool brushing
it through should be fine and then I'm
just taking some a volumizing product
from Bed Head and just putting this onto
the roots of my head just to give my
hair a little bit more volume at the
root because I was working with freshly
washed hair I just feel like it can look
a little bit flat sometimes at the roots
but my head does pick up volume really
easily okay so for my outfit I actually
went with two options the first one
being something a little bit more casual
but still glam looking this is
definitely up my street wearing some
trainers wearing something sporty
looking but with the essence of red in
it just to make it that a little bit
more romantic and then also the second
option is something definitely more glam
with the boots which are lace-up with
the big coat it just looks a little bit
more glam but I kept the same jeans on
just to let you know you don't have to
wear a dress for it to be feminine
looking I'm not big on dresses so this
was definitely fine for me so guys
that's the end of this video I really
hope you enjoyed it if you did
