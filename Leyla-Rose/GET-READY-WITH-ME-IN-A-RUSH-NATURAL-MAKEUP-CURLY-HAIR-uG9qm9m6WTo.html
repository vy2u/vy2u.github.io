so today I have a makeup and hair video
for you guys this video is a get ready
with me in a rush and you guys know that
I love doing these kind of videos this
one's a little bit different because I
do my hair fast and then my makeup
afterwards today's video is actually in
partnership with IG K and you must have
heard of them if you haven't then we
need to talk about it miss star of the
show is this spray and this is the new
normal blow high-speed air dry spray and
this actually allows your hair to air
dry up to 46% faster than if you didn't
use this brace so that's basically it
could allow your hair to dry almost
twice as fast without putting any heat
on it and if you guys didn't know I'm
super conscious about how much heat I
put on my hair I do still use it I say
fairly regularly but I'm very conscious
and I try to avoid it if I can so if
there's any chance where my hair can dry
naturally I'm gonna want to do it so
this spray is a lifesaver and I'm so
excited to show you guys how I a dry my
hair using the spray in this video also
I'll show you guys this super natural
makeup look as well which takes no more
than 15 minutes I'm gonna say this
literally takes like 10 minutes to do so
quick it's my go-to it's really fresh
and natural-looking and it just looks
like really glowy and natural and I'm
just obsessed so if you guys do want to
see this get ready with me in a rush and
then just keep on watching
so I have started off with no makeup and
my hair is currently in need of a wash
and it's straight so we have a lot of
work to do I've actually decided today
that we're gonna be doing a chilled get
ready with me and it's chilled but we're
kind of in a rush at the same time wanna
make sure that my hair dries as quickly
as possible even though I am air drying
it and also I want to go for something
really natural on the face and something
super quick as well is indefinite need
of a wash so I need to go do that right
now usually don't air dry my hair just
because it takes so long I've decided to
air dry my calls today I'm going to be
using the igk normal blow high-speed air
dry spray so I'm gonna be using this
today and I'm gonna show you how to use
it with curly hair it doesn't of course
totally dry your hair but it allows it
to dry a lot faster which is just
like save us is revolutionary this is
basically a hair dryer and it can oh my
god I should go wash my hair right now
and when we get back we can apply all
the products in and make sure my hair
looks nice and curly and we can allow it
to continue it's air dry process whilst
I do my makeup hey guys so it's in my
hair it's just been towel dry so I'm
gonna show you a voiceover so I can
explain to you what I do as I'm doing it
cuz farm forever flipping my head upside
down and off and down up and down and
all of that let's go okay so the first
thing I'm gonna be doing is using some
of the mistress hydrating hair balm from
IG k and I'm just gonna be using this in
my hair first we'll just apply some
hydration to my hair because it's
bleached and also because it's curly as
well I have a naturally curly hair
texture my hair gets dry very very
easily so before I apply anything I just
want to make sure that I've applied some
hydration into my hair so as you can see
I've just kind of scrunched this into
both sides and it's a little bit
different to how I would do if I was
blow-drying my hair because of course
we're gonna be using the igk normal blow
spray so this is a little bit different
to my normal routine so to make sure
that we use the normal blow spray evenly
all over the hair I'm actually going to
pop my hair into three sections so the
first section being the very bottom
layer of my hair the next being the
middle layer and then the last being the
top layer I'm going to be taking this
spray and this works kind of similar in
the way that you would kind of use a dry
shampoo so it has that similar kind of
method to it you kind of want to hold it
a decent distance away from your hair I
noticed that when I hold it too close I
was getting like little white patches on
my top so make sure you hold it a good
distance away because it's black
obviously it showed up way more but
there is no residue that is on your hair
which I absolutely love and because the
root of my hair is super dark you can
see you can't see any residue which is
amazing
but as I'm applying it into each section
I'm making sure to concentrate this on
the root because that's the area that
takes the longest to dry and I'm
scrunching my hair as I'm doing this so
I want to make sure that I'm
distributing this product evenly all
over the hair and then of course getting
to the final layer and just making sure
again that this is sprayed just evenly
every
so I'm going over kind of just each
strand and once I'm done I'm making sure
to scrunch just making sure to scrunch
as much as you can that's the main thing
with this just whenever you have your
hair curly even if you are air drying it
you want to make sure that you're
allowing those calls to form I do find
that when I air dry my hair anyway my
curls don't form as much like ringlets
as they would do if there was heat on
them it's kind of normal though because
humidity and heat does tend to make your
hair bounce upwards so I find that with
my hair type because I don't have the
assistance of a diffuser and a hair
dryer because of course we want to try
and avoid that heat you need to make
sure that you are continuously
scrunching it as the drying process is
continuing I've gone in with a little
bit more of that hydrating balm and just
using it to scrunch my hair after I've
applied that product just to make sure
that there is that hydration that's
gonna allow my hair to bounce upwards
the curls are starting to form but like
I said they're probably not going to be
as ringlets see as they would be I have
to continuously keep scrunching it
otherwise the curls will kind of like
not have definition as you can see it's
getting a lot drier near the root
because that is where I concentrated
more of the product gonna allow my hair
to continue to dry and then I'm gonna
bring all my makeup here so that we can
quickly do our everyday makeup in a rush
like it's gonna be super quick it was
really quick so the makeup has to be
really quick and simple as well gathered
all my makeup and I just want to add
slang to eat it way so I'm gonna get my
makeup done and I honestly just want to
go for something super simple so I'm
gonna go with the laura geller
sparkle hydrating moisturizing primer
I'm just gonna use this all over my skin
and I wanna see how quickly we can get
this done because this makeup routine is
like kind of like my go-to when I'm in a
rush I've done in a rush tutorials
before but they've been more glam this
is kind of like when I'm really in a
rush and I just don't have time like I'm
not in a rush right now but this is the
kind of makeup look that I would do if I
was in a rush
hey so next I'm going in with the
L'Oreal infallible anti redness primer
and that's because I still get breakouts
but also I've got a lot of scarring that
tends to come up with as red on my skin
so I'm gonna use this primer I don't
know if you
is private before actually this is
really green I didn't want to go in with
the color crackers I find that it can
get a little time-consuming sometimes to
color correct so I'm just gonna be using
a color correcting primer because it's a
lot quicker and as you can see it's like
cut down on the redness it's not totally
gone we're gonna go on top now with the
it cosmetics your skin but better at CC
cream and I'm using this in the shade
medium tan and I'm just gonna pump this
on the back of my hand first and then
just pop this on my skin
and I'm just gonna buff this into the
skin this is a little bit light for me
right now I can see that it's like
looking a little bit light but that's
okay because I want to go for a really
light coverage anyway and I'm gonna
bronze quite a bit because I really want
this to be natural like almost a no
makeup makeup look but not quite does
that make sense I honestly can't wait to
try the no more below spray when I have
my hair straight as well because
whenever I straighten my hair nine times
out of ten I have to blow-dry it
beforehand I cannot blow-dry right
straight but just rough dry it because I
find that if I don't straighten my hair
the same day that I've washed it it just
gets way too frizzy so this spray is
gonna help me out so much to just cut
down on the amount of heat I use when I
have to straighten my hair I really like
the CC cream because it applies coverage
but it allows my skin to come through
but if I do want to apply it any more I
can just take a little literally a teeny
bit more and just like Pat it on always
whenever you want to add more coverage
you always want to Pat you never ever
ever wanna rub now I'm gonna apply a
little bit of concealer I'm just taking
the collection lasting perfection
concealer and again I just I just don't
want too much of this I really just want
to go for something supernatural today
I'm just gonna use both of my fingers to
blend this in because it's a lot quicker
when you do that taking it up to my
inner corner but today I'm actually not
gonna be taking anything on my eyelids
because it doesn't work for everyone but
for certain skin tones and it all
depends on your eyes natural color but a
lot of the time you have this natural
darkness on your eyelid and it can look
shiny as well it's quite common for that
to happen but I actually really like the
way that this looks when I'm wearing
minimal makeup sometimes because I just
think it looks really natural and almost
like sunkissed and fresh but it looks
like that kind of on my skin tone
because it just looks like this neutral
Brown doesn't work on every single skin
tone though so bear that in mind but I'm
just gonna be sitting the under eyes
specifically my t-zone and my nose just
cuz these are the areas that get really
oily for me
I really want it to remain looking like
skin by the way I'm using the rimmel
insta-fix and mat and this is really
nice because I feel like this looks
matte but it looks skin like so I want
it to look quite natural King a really
pale like I just felt have lost a lot of
my color so I'm gonna go in with the Too
Faced natural face palette and I
honestly love this palette this palette
is so so pretty and I'm gonna go in with
the color sunny honey and I'm gonna use
that to bronze my skin favorite face
pallets lately I just love the
combination of colors like even one of
the blushes in here actually one of my
favorite blush shades and if you know me
I really don't like blushes so for me to
actually like a blush on myself is
crazies I have color you know I have to
hold my hair back contantly not gonna be
contouring today but I'm just placing
the bronzer in those areas because it
just kind of like it defines the face
but keeps it warm and bronzy at the same
time I'm just gonna go under my jaw line
just to define it and then take it down
the neck just because out everywhere in
my whole body my neck and my chest is
the lightest part of everything like
it's even lighter than my face and I
just don't know why like I have no idea
why my neck and chest are so light but
then my the rest of my body gets
naturally dark really easily I'm just
gonna use this bronzer to lightly
contour my nose like I wouldn't usually
use a bronzer to contour my nose but
because we're going for a really natural
look and I might apply some fake
freckles after this just like looks
really pretty and natural okay so I'm
actually gonna be taking the color pink
sand from that palette and that's just
this like muted pink I love this color
it's so pretty I'm just gonna pop this
on the apples of my cheeks and roll it
back and again I like wearing blush when
I'm going for like quite a natural look
because I think it just looks really
pretty and I like to do sometimes as
well it's just pop it on the tip of my
nose not too much not too much otherwise
you look like Rudolph and then
taking the color satin sheets from that
palette which is a really pretty color
as well I'm gonna pop that on the tops
of my cheekbones and then I'm gonna take
that same color and we're gonna pop it
on the tip of our nose and this is one
of my favorite things to do because it
just makes your nose look like a little
button super cute but take it tinted
brow gel this is one of the best things
to do when you're in a rush because it
just saves you a lot of time on filling
in your brows like to take off all the
excess so I kind of just like scrape it
off the brush I use this just to like
push all my brow hairs up but just look
at the difference like it's tinted them
and put them in the right position it's
made them look so put together in the
space of two seconds while I'm waiting
for that to dry because we're in a rush
we want to keep going I'm gonna take my
what is called an eyelash tweeze my lash
tweezer is cool an eyelash curler that's
it you take my eyelash curler and we're
gonna curl my lashes no lashes today
guys and that's cuz we're in a rush
Antone's at 10 I would still put lashes
on but this is like if I am in a proper
rush this mascara is insane like a
mascara has never made my lashes look
long before like my lashes aren't long
in my opinion so I'm just gonna go in
with a little bit of the Maybelline
total temptation a brow pencil and I'm
not gonna use a lot of this whatsoever
I'm just gonna use it to define my brows
a little bit more and then using my brow
is by under stars eeeh I'm gonna add
some fake frec whose cuz I really love
this when I go for a fresh look I just
use this just to like through all the
little thing for it goes on and then
I'll just use my finger just so I pop
them into the skin to make them look
less fake looking if that makes sense
and I'll just put these in random areas
I have a beauty mark here and I just
like
make it oh crap sometimes I like to like
make a look a little bit dark up I've
got a beauty mark all right there as to
make this look look even glowy ah
and just supernatural I'm gonna be
taking the Pixy glow mists and then just
spraying this all over and then again
for my lips I wanna go for something
supernatural looking much is gonna be
taking my go-to lip liner that I use in
every tutorial I know you guys sick of
seeing but it's the best it's like a
tiny stop at this point
my remote cappuccino it's just the best
lip liner especially to over line my
lips with I'm gonna be going on top of
that with the instant light lip con for
oil and this is really cute because it
just makes it look like a super natural
glossy lip it looks like my lip color
but a glossy version okay guys so this
is the finished hair and makeup look I
usually takes about two to three hours
to dry and it definitely did not take
that with using this bright if you did
