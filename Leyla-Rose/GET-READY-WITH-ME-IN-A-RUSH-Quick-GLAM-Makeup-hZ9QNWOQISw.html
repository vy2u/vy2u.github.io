channel happy new year and today I'm
gonna be doing it for my first video of
the year how to achieve this look that
I'm wearing it's a really simple glam
look but I'm basically gonna show you
how I kind of get ready in a rush so
this is kind of like my go-to makeup but
my rushed version because I am often
rushing so if you guys want to see this
makeup look and how to achieve it as
quickly as you can and then just keep on
watching okay guys so the first step is
gonna be priming your skin and color
correcting now this is something that
you can avoid if you have better skin
but obviously at the moment as you can
tell I've got quite a lot of hormonal
acne and it's just I can't avoid it
unfortunately at the moment so I have to
take a little bit of extra time to prep
my skin but you can just use one normal
primer as normal to save time I just
have to be extra because it just helps
my skin to be prepped better with the
condition that it's in right now so I
just color corrected and applied two
primers underneath that just to make
everything smooth and I'm going in first
of all with some foundation I'm using
the Finn T Beauty foundation and I
really love this one I think it helps
when you're in a rush to use a
foundation that you know works for you
so I'm using this one because it kind of
just looks flawless every time and I'm
using one of these spoon brushes to
apply it because this is the fastest
method of applying foundation in my
opinion it just blends it so fast and it
just smooths it all over your face and
if you have problematic skin like me
just going with a little bit more on any
areas that need an extra bit of coverage
and that's your foundation done next I'm
just going to be applying some concealer
underneath my eyes and using this as a
primer for my lids as well and as you
can see to apply it I'm using both my
hands and this can feel a little bit
strange at first but if you kind of
think about it you're getting two done
at once so when I'm in a rush I make
sure to use both of my hands as an asset
and then I'm also just going with some
powder and make sure to set it well and
I'm just doing this as I normally would
there I guess isn't a rushed way to do
this I don't end up looking like I'm
covered in powder so take your time with
this part just make sure everything is
set really nicely
next we're going to be applying art
bronzer and when I'm choosing a bronzer
when I'm in a rush I go for something
that's a neutral tone so what I mean by
this is that it's not too cool and it's
not too warm
that way it can kind of act as a bronzer
and the contour at the same time
now it's important to use something that
complements your skin tone so this one
is really nice for me obviously just
gonna mention that my cheeks do look a
little bit patchy just because I have a
lot of bumps on that area that's kind of
unavoidable but I do kind of like to
apply a bronzer with a big Brush as well
because I find that this really helps
okay so next for my quick method of
applying my eyebrows I like to use a
tinted brow gel first and apply it
through my brows to give them a color
and to make them look thicker without
actually doing that much to them so as
you can see it already looks more in
place it looks fuller there is a little
bit more we have to do with it but for
now whilst that's drying we can move on
to something else I think when you're in
a rush it's really good to just use your
time well whilst that's drying we're
gonna move on to our eyes shadow and
because our eyes already prepped we used
concealer for that that means we've
saved even more time and I'm just
applying some of the Browns from this
Too Faced palette into the crease and of
course it depends on your skill set when
it comes to eye shadow but generally
just applying one color into the crease
and mix just too for this but yeah just
applying the one color in the crease and
just making sure it's blended it looks
like you've made a lot more effort than
you actually have and then I'm just
gonna be cleaning up the lid with a skin
turn powder from my contour kit and I'm
just gonna be using that all over the
lid just to brighten it and as you can
see I'm not even going even to neat with
this I'm just kind of following my dad's
natural shape and again this gives a
really nice effect that goes really nice
with the eyeliner style that we're gonna
be going for today okay so next for our
eyeliner we're going to be going for a
technique which I love to use especially
when I'm rushing I'm gonna be taking a
brown liner you can use black if you
want but I find it Brown to be a little
bit softer and it doesn't go wrong as
easy and I'm just using it to create a
wing and just smudging it this is the
quickest way of creating that wing
effect and also you don't have to me to
meet with it I find that trying to get a
perfect wing just is way too stressful
in a rush situation it's going for
something a little bit more imperfect is
definitely something
better to settle for for sure and then
once I'm done with this I'm gonna be
applying some mascara to my lids you can
stop at this step but you guys know I'm
extra so I'm gonna apply false lashes
plus it literally takes me about 15
seconds to apply at full slashes because
I'm so used to it
so if it takes you longer obviously just
stick to mascara but I am gonna go ahead
and apply my lashes it's super duper
quickly next we're gonna be finishing
off the eyebrows now that the brow gel
is dry I've left the whole clip in for
this you can see honestly how quickly
you can do this I just added some brow
hairs in the very center and then I just
went along the bottom line of my brow
and kind of extended it slightly and
then just added the tiniest little soar
flicks of hair through my brow and that
is it that's all we're gonna be going
for today of course it depends on your
natural brow shape but this is what I
would go for and as you can see it
doesn't take long at all which is
amazing to add some pop of highlight to
our skin we're gonna be taking some
highlight it from a definitive Beauty
kilowatt highlighter duo and I'm just
popping that on all the high points of
my face I just find that this makes you
look really glowy I just quickly put my
hair in a cap because let's face it guys
when I focus on my makeup when I'm in a
rush ain't nobody got time for hair so I
just put a cap on obviously if you're
going for something more glamorous maybe
just go for an updo something really
quick but this is more of a daytime glam
for me personally and I just finished
off with a nude lip which of course you
can do in the car you can do on the
train wherever you're in a rush to and
that is the end of this video guys I
hope you enjoyed it you of course don't
have to take all of these tips
altogether you can use just a couple in
your makeup routine to make everything
quicker or you can try them all together
I hope you enjoyed this video please

rush and I will see you all in the next
one
