welcome back to my channel so today I
have a get ready with me for you I have
a video basically showing you me getting
ready for something I show you guys my
hair my makeup and my outfit I know you
guys love get ready with me so be sure
to subscribe and turn on post
notifications by clicking the bell also
like this video and comment down below
if you want to see more get ready with
me videos this summer and I'm not gonna
ramble let's just get straight into
getting ready together let's go okay
guys so the first thing that I'm doing
in this get ready with me process is of
course tying my hair up and putting it
out with my face and sorry but I'm using
my Minnie Mouse headbands I get so much
criticism on this but it keeps my hair
on my face because the weather in the UK
had been so generous this week I decided
to go on some SPF onto my face from the
body shop this is the body shop vitamin
E SPF 30 I believe and I love this
because it's really lightweight and for
someone that gets clogged skin really
easily as you guys know I have acne
prone skin so SPF scan really clog up my
skin but I really love this one
so I moisturize my face using that and
then I went on top of that for
moisturizing primer using the glam glow
glow starter in the golden shade and I'm
actually using this color corrector from
YSL and I really like this again it's
really lightweight it doesn't feel too
thick this is great if you want to turn
down redness but you don't want it to be
overly thick so I just applied that on
my skin and used a duo fiber brush from
NYX to blend that in and as you can see
it's really taken down those redness on
my foundation I am taking the NYX total
control foundation and this is super
thick I always forget how it's not thick
it's thin but it's full coverage I
always forget how full coverage this is
so I did put a little bit too much but I
blended in just fine and I do have a tan
right now because I've been out in the
Sun so I used a darker shade than normal
but I used my normal light concealer and
everything blended in great
which is fabulous I used this concealer
from Maybelline I haven't used the age
rewind concealer in ages and it was like
revisiting like an old friend it was
like ah so I just blended a tan with my
fingers and then I went in to set it as
well afterwards I used the soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder as you guys know
this is definitely again one of my
favorites but I haven't actually used it
in a little while so it was really nice
to revisit it and to use one of my like
Holy Grail products so I set my whole
face with this and then I used a Studio
Fix powder from Mac in a darker shade
this is in the shade C 8 and I'm using
this as my bronzer I find I love to do
this especially when I have acne on my
cheeks because I just find that it looks
a lot smoother because just the
placement of my acne it just makes
bronzer apply patchy ah but I find that
using a darker shade of powder makes it
look a lot smoother so this just really
helps with my texture even though it's
improving a lot it just looks a lot
smoother and then I take a slightly
smaller brush and just use that in more
concentrated areas kind of to contour a
little bit but it is quite warm so I'm
not going for anything too like overly
sculpted I'm just using it in those
areas and then I'm taking a highlight
shade from this highlight on contour
palette and just using it on all of the
highlight areas such as under my eyes
and I also use this to contour my nose
as well
I then went in with highlight and this
is the Maki highlight from Nicks and
this is a really interesting texture I
use this on the tops of my cheekbones
and I kind of have to apply this with my
fingers a little bit as well will kind
of just use my fingers to kind of press
it into the skin because I find that it
makes it look more skin like but it's a
really beautiful texture and really
natural looking if you press it into the
skin so I applied that on the tops of my
cheekbones and such a gorgeous color
like blinding but a really nice tone
then I went in with this Too Faced
palette and I believe it's one of the
peach palettes I can't remember the name
of it but I'll have it written down
below and I'm just using this to create
my eye look and I remember something
super simple I applied some of the peach
color all over my eyes and then some
bronze are into my crease I'm kind of
taking the bronzer a little bit higher
than normal which is why I applied the
lid color first and I don't know I just
like using this technique because I find
that it really I don't know just it it
kind of sculpts the eye slightly
different but yeah what I did wasn't
anything too crazy for this look I
really wanted it to look peach and
spring-like like almost with a bit of a
pinky tone but nothing too crazy
I also took one of the lighter shades
from that palette and just use that on
the very inner corner of my eye to
really make that inner corner pop and I
love the way this looks I love using
this technique especially in the spring
and summer because I just find that I
don't know it just creates that really
nice open eyed look and then I took this
shade from the Naked heat petite palette
and then I applied that in the outer
corner just to add a little bit of
warmth but also just to add a little bit
more definition just because that
bronzer just wasn't enough to really
define the crease
i next applied some eyeliner and this is
the next epic ink eyeliner and I'm just
using it to create a nice big wing I
kind of vary between liking a wing or
not I really wanted one for this look
because I just find I don't know
whenever I'm going anywhere I just like
to wear a wing unless I'm not really
doing all that much then I applied
mascara and my false lashes these are
from the house of lashes so mink
collection and I applied these and
they're actually really really
natural-looking you can't really see
them all that much and I did do my
eyebrows but I'm gonna link an eyebrow
tutorial down below cuz you guys already
seen me do it very recently I then
applied my lipstick I did my lip liner
which is Rimmel cappuccino as per usual
if I'm gonna wear a nude I'm 99% of the
time gonna be using this lip liner and
then I combined two liquid lipsticks to
create this really pretty pink peach
nude and I really really like it I think
it kind of just like complements
everything
okay so now that my makeup is done I
need to move on to my hair and this just
isn't cutting it so I am going to
actually go and wash my hair and have it
curly and today I'm gonna be using the
Maui moisture coal quench coconut oil
shampoo and conditioner to wash my hair
you guys I have 125,000 percent is that
a number no I have definitely found my
new shampoo and conditioner that I'm
gonna be using on the regular and this
is the reason why so Maui moisture
actually has five different ranges for
different hair types but I am using the
one specifically for curly hair their
products actually have no mineral oil no
silicones no SLS no sulfates and just a
bunch of other bad stuff that is
definitely not in it and I'm obsessed
with it it's vegan as well and it also
has pure coconut water and pure aloe
juice in it and you guys it is a dream
it smells insane it's supernatural
so the product I'm using right now is
the coal quench coconut oil health muthi
and I'm applying this in my hair as I
diffuse it just to really help with the
cows to you know like help form and
hydrate them and plus something to bear
in mind as well is this is the first
time I've had my hair curly since I got
it lightened and as you can imagine I
got it from a fairly deep shade of
brunette too as blonde as it is right
now so my hair is definitely feeling dry
but these products really really helped
with that you can definitely feel the
coconut oil without it being too overly
heavy and that's something that's really
important with curly hair you can have
too much oil in your hair at once
otherwise it can weigh down the coal so
I felt like this was just enough to
really hydrate my cars
I did recently do a curly hair video and
I mentioned that I hadn't had a silicone
free shampoo or conditioner that I loved
and I was actually asking you guys for
suggestions and now I have found Maui
moisture and I'm so so so I was also
looking for a sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner and I'm just so happy that I
found them us it smells insane you guys
it smells as good as you'd imagine
because obviously it has the rich
coconut oil papaya butter it also has
the aloe vera within it as well and it
just smells insane so despite my hair
being in probably one of the worst
conditions that they've been in in a
while because of me
sending my hair this product really
really helped with that as you can see
the calls still forming
I am still obviously learning how to
take care of my hair whilst it is blonde
and curly but these products really
worked well in my hair and there was
still parts of my hair that would have
quite formal curl properly and I used to
have this problem before when my hair
was blonde and that's literally just
because bleach really can straighten the
calls and really damage them but
honestly I'm so impressed with the way
that this range really helped with my
hair considering the condition that my
hair was in so hydrating and I just love
the fact that it allows you to have that
I guess coconut oil feel without it
feeling oily and with it still feeling
hydrating it honestly felt so
lightweight but really hydrating at the
same time which I love so as you can see
I've kind of just blow-dried my hair
with it using minimal heat though I use
the cool setting on my blow-dryer
because I don't want to obviously affect
my hair too much um yeah you can see
that the ends of my hair are still kind
of struggling to form carl's but that's
of course cause a little bleach but I'm
obsessed with the way that this turned
out and these products are amazing I'll
be leaving links down below if you want
to check them out they're super
inexpensive they're only around $8.99
each so that's insane so I'll leave a
link to those down below and you can get
them from boots and now we're gonna move
on to the outfit so for my outfit
because I was just going for something
rather casual but the weather was well
the weather was up and down and actually
rained this day but it was really warm
so I went for these ripped jeans and
these are from miss packets are of
course really really ripped but they're
really nice fit and I like the way that
they fit on my body and I paired that
with a belt from ASOS my bandeau top is
from pretty little thing and then the
jacket that I've have draped over me is
from the misguided and medicine beer
collection I also paired that with some
high-top vans and then some socks from
ID - just to add a little bit of that
Layla vibe through it you know if
something ever looks too girly I have to
add on some kind of trainers and then
some kind of sporty Jackie I'm honestly
just I'm just not capable of being
totally girly honestly so guys that is
the end of this video I really hope you
enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe to
