so today I have a get ready with me for
you and you guys know how much I love
get ready with me is I don't know why
it's been so long since I've done one
but I'm planning on doing many many more
especially for the winter seasons
because this is like my favorite time
for makeup and fashion and just I love
it so there's gonna be more of the
makeup hair and outfit get ready
memories so stay tuned be sure to
subscribe and thumbs up this video for
more videos like this for today's video
I decided to show you this pretty
neutral makeup look went for this makeup
look where I used like movie Browns on
the eyes and then also like a more
purpley lip and also these soft waves
and I also show you my outfit which I'm
super excited to talk about because only
do I love fashion but I've also found
this new amazing fashion app I'm
actually working on this section of the
video with 21 buttons
basically what 21 buttons is is an app
where you can find all of the outfits
that you love from your favorite
influences and they have the links so
I've just recently joined as well so be
sure to follow me my username is makeup
by Laila same as every other social
media basically what you can do on the
app is upload a photo and tag all of
your outfit pieces directly with these
little pop tags that come on to it and
that way you can link everything
individually on the photo which is just
a dream so I recently joined the app and
I've already uploaded a couple of
pictures I'm gonna be adding more
especially some exclusive pictures from
the outfit that I'm wearing in this
video I'm not wearing that fit just yet
I'm gonna get changed after this intro
who are you to bar or you do social
media or you just don't really want to
link your outfits you can actually own
commission from tagging as well as if
someone actually purchases the outfit
via the link you can actually earn a
small amount of commission as well which
is always a plus so if you do want to
see where my outfits from in this video
then be sure to go over to my 21 buttons
profile to be able to see all of the
links and be able to purchase directly
from there and yeah and if you guys want
to see the makeup and the hair
I have one right now as well and just
keep watching at this video and I think
that's all I have to say let's get into
it alright guys the first thing that I
do when I'm getting ready is definitely
to tie my hair up because just having it
all out my face it's so much easier so
once I have that I'm a Minnie Mouse is
on I just love this because it really
pulls my head back and it just it just
makes it so easy it's time to moisturize
so I'm taking my moisturizer from the
body shop as always and just applying
this all over my skin my skin's been a
little bit weird lately
I don't know why but I've just had quite
a lot of breakouts I think it might be
from the change at the weather so I just
want to make sure my skin is nice and
hydrated and also primed so I'm using my
Too Faced hangover primer or so I'm
using the Make Up For Ever step one
smoothing and I'm just applying it all
over my skin to make sure everything is
nice and smooth before foundation the
foundation that I'm using today is the
NYX total control foundation and I
actually applied this and I was like oh
my gosh this is way too dark but
actually when I blended it in it matched
totally fine with the rest of my body
and my neck my face is a lot lighter
because I use a lot of treatments to
keep my acne down because as you guys
know I used to have really bad acne and
this is quite an improvement compared to
what it used to be like so it does like
kind of other meit keeps my skin
exfoliated so my face is never turned
pretty much so that's why I like to use
a darker foundation so once that's
buffed in I go in with some concealer
and this one is the NYX HD foam
concealer sorry and then I also applied
a little bit of the NARS one as well and
I just mixed them together to create a
really nice matte under eye cuz I really
wanted to go for a nice matte base today
and I also applied some of that onto my
eyelids tagged as an eye primer so once
that's all blended in I wanted to set it
into place and I used my one heck of a
blot powder from soap &amp;amp; Glory this is
just a really nice all matte powder I've
been loving it lately and I just like to
Pat this into the skin to make sure
everything is nice and matte next I'm
gonna be bronzing and I'm using this
natural bronzer from Rimmel I actually
love the tone of this it's got a hint of
red which makes it kind of look like a
natural town which I love so I apply
that on the outer perimeter of my
forehead just on either sides and then
also generously under my
cheekbone as well and this just helps to
prepare for when I contour because I am
gonna be contouring a little bit today
this just adds a really nice amount of
color and I don't like blush on my
skintone personally so I like to go
quite heavy on the bronzer then I'm
taking the Bahama Mama bronzer from the
balm and I'm just taking that in the
hollow of my cheeks and also on the
sides of my forehead just to slim down
the face and also to give me a cheekbone
that I do not have and then I'm taking
this rhodiola instaglam powder in this
banana color and I'm just applying a
little bit of that under the eyes just
to add some structure to my under eye
area I love this powder it's so smooth
and it just glides on really nicely on
the under eyes and then I'm taking some
of these so Hollywood illuminator from
Anastasia and just applying it onto the
tops of my cheekbones for my eyes I'm
just actually keeping it quite simple
today I'm taking this peachy color from
makeup geek and applying that into the
crease
first of all and just make sure that
it's nice and blended out and then I'm
gonna go in with this more chocolatey
movie Brown and I'm gonna be applying
that into the crease and also all over
the lid so the eye shadow is actually
really really simple I just like to make
sure these two colors blend really
nicely together and then once then
really nice and blended
and extended I will apply the exact same
color all over the lid as well this is
one of my favorite ways to apply
eyeshadow especially when I want to look
put together but I don't want to put too
much effort in because honestly it
doesn't take long at all and I really
like the effect that it gives because
it's all matte it gives you the Isum
shape but it doesn't it's not just it's
just not too over the top and I just
really like that and then I'm just
taking a little bit of black eyeshadow
from makeup geek as well and just
creating a winged effect with the
eyeshadow keeping it quite soft it just
gives the eyes shape without actually
having to put on an actual winged liner
with eyeliner and then I'm taking some
mascara and just applying it all over
the lashes and I'm gonna be applying
false lashes today these are the dallara
faux mink lashes from Lily lashes and
they are gorgeous very fluffy and yeah
these were the first time that I was
using them so they were a little bit
stiff but I really do like them to
everything nice and fluffy and then I'm
just taking that same warm Brown that we
applied on the lid and I'm just applying
that on the bottom lash line and just
making sure to blend it out and then I
did take a little
bit of black and just applied it quite
close to the bottom lash line just to
give it a little bit of a smoky effect
and I did apply some mascara to the
bottom lashes as well as well as some
skin toned eyeliner to the inside of the
eyes just to open them off a little bit
I'm also just applying some highlight
color to the inner corner and I really
love doing this especially when I'm
going for something a little bit more
smoky I just feel like this really adds
that pop of brightness on that in area
whilst everywhere else is quite dark so
even though it's not too too smoky it is
a little bit smoky so I really like to
add that brightness there and pull my
eyebrows I'm not doing too much because
I actually had my eyebrows kind of
tinted from a product that I was trying
out and yeah I didn't really need to add
that much so I added some of the UH
Nastasia brow definer and I contoured my
nose a little bit which I'm gonna be
doing a nose contour routine very soon
cuz I know that you guys have been
requesting it because I have it has
changed a little bit and some ones have
contoured my nose I like to apply a
little bit of highlight on to the tip of
the nose it's the same highlight that I
use on the inner corners and now I'm
gonna move on to my hair before we
finish off the lips so what I like to do
when I'm creating my effortless waves I
like to call them even though they're
not effortless I like to apply it first
of all some heat protectant just to take
care of my hair because my hair is
lightened which makes it more prone to
breakage so I'm gonna be using the
Bellamy 16 one hair color and I'm just
taking this like average sized barrel
and the way that I personally like to do
waves is call my hair in different
directions so some of the curls I will
do inwards some of the curls I will do
outwards and honestly it just makes it
so much easier to actually do it because
there's no rule method to it you just
kind of take random strands and just do
big bits small bits it really doesn't
matter and I just do them in different
directions the only part that I like to
put away from the face and just make
sure that I do are the strands that are
closest to my face just because it does
frame the face a lot better so once
that's done I'm gonna be doing my lips
and I am using this Rimmel lip liner
which you guys notice my favorite is in
the shade cappuccino and then I'm gonna
be taking a Veronica liquid lipstick
from uh Nastasia this liquid lipstick
honestly just screams autumn fool to me
so I thought it was perfect for this
look and because I
something quite movie on the eyes I
wanted to kind of have something that
was a little bit more chromatic and
that's the finished hair I just like to
kind of rough it up a little bit and
I'll either keep it in the middle or
flip it to the side and for this I
decided to flip it to the side but that
is the end of this look guys I really
hope you enjoyed it if you did then
don't forget to give it a big thumbs up
don't forget to check out my outfit on
the 21 buttons profile my name is makeup

below where you can find me on the app
