channel so today I have a get ready with
me all you guys and I just love get
ready with me videos you guys already
know this I was actually getting ready
for a wedding and I went for something
it's super bronzy and glowy and I also
show you guys quickly my outfit that I
wore to I love something get ready with
me is if you guys love to watch them but
please give this video a big thumbs up
so I know you guys like to watch them
and subscribe if you haven't already and
without further ado and let's get into
this video let's go okay so I'm gonna be
going through this get ready with me
quite quickly just because I didn't want
it to be too too long and also because
it is a look that isn't super intricate
and I was getting ready of course for a
wedding so I wanted to be super glowy so
I ensured I moisturize my skin really
well and I used my body shop moisturizer
and now also the glam glow glow starter
and then I'm going ahead and applying
some color corrector because I do have
some acne scarring just cuz my scares
skin has recently cleared up but the
scarring is still there so yeah I'm just
blending that out with a brush and just
making sure that the residue of the
green is still there and then I'm
applying my foundation on top of it and
then the foundation I'm using is the ex1
invisi wear which is one of my favorite
foundations just because it photographs
so beautifully and because I was going
to a wedding I wanted to make sure that
my face didn't flash back and it just
looked really nice in pictures so I
blended that all over with a brush and
then I went with some concealer under
the eyes you can see that I'm using is
the NYX HD concealer and I love this
concealer I've been loving it so much
lately and I'm applying it just
underneath my eyes and blending that out
with a sponge and this just really helps
to highlight this area and I really want
this eye under our area and just general
eye area to look nice and right because
I think that looks great in photos and
then I'm setting my skin using the
Rimmel instument powder and this is
again like one of my new favorites I
love it it just makes everything super
duper matte and because I'm going for
quite a glowy look I wanted to make sure
everything was set into place and then
it didn't look greasy and I'm running
also the bronze I'm using is the Sun
bronzer from Rimmel and I love this
again it just gives such a like natural
bronzy look I am tanned right now I
applied a little bit of fake tan because
I was going
to a wedding and I just wanted to look
generally all over bronze like I am
quite tan anyway but just to give it
that little bit of extra a little bit of
extra tan and then I applied some
under-eye powder just underneath the
eyes to brighten it just to kind of
complement everything and I was applied
that underneath the cheekbones as well
to make the bronzer stand out and yeah I
just really like this kind of like a
bronzy complexion I have going on and it
goes really nicely it with the dress
that I'm gonna be wearing too so I'm
just applying it some brow primer into
my browser whilst I do my eye shadow
well I should I decided to keep
everything relatively simple I just went
for a really nice like a bronzy eye so I
just took some contour from my nose like
the same color I use on my nose and take
it into the crease of my eye I'm gonna
be doing a nose contour video soon but
this is something I really love to do
because it just looks really natural
when you do it like this but I'm gonna
be doing a video in depth on how I
contour my nose super soon so I'm just
contouring my nose currently and I'm
using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette to do this because it's just my
favorite contour palette ever and once I
finish contouring my nose we're moving
on to the eyes and for the eyes I'm just
keeping everything really matte and I'm
kind of creating a semi cut crease and
I'm using only matte Browns in the
crease and it doesn't really matter if
it gets into the lid because I'm gonna
be using some concealer to clean that up
and then yeah I'm just kind of like
creating a really nice like winged out
shadow look and then on the inner corner
I'm just taking the concealer and I'm
gonna be kind of just like blanking out
my eyelid and then putting a shimmery
gold on top of that so as you can see
I'm just taking some concealer now and
creating that semi cut crease shape and
I'm looking for anything too crazy with
it just like a little bit higher than my
eyelid just to really brighten that lid
area and I'm making sure that it blends
into the rest of the eyeshadow that we
created and then I'm going on top of it
with a color pop eyeshadow this is in
the shade amaze which is one of my
favorites and it's just a really nice
light gold color almost like a champagne
and I'm just applying that all over on
top of the concealer that we applied now
I didn't want to apply eyeliner for this
look I really really really love to
create a
winged out I using just eyes shadows so
I'm taking this kind of a dark brown and
just using it as an eyeliner basically
to wing out my eye and this just
complements the whole look really really
nicely and I am gonna be applying lashes
but I am first of all just gonna be
applying some mascara to my natural
lashes I sometimes like to do this
before and sometimes after false lashes
but for the lashes that I'm using I find
that they look better when they've
already got mascara on underneath their
and the lashes that I'm using which I
always get so many questions on these
are the Coco goddess lashes and these
are my absolute favorite lashes in the
entire world and as you can see I'm
putting mascara on these ones because I
really wanted it to look like an thick
and a little bit more chunky rather than
fluffy and I just really like the effect
that it gave and then I'm just filling
in my eyebrows as well nothing too crazy
just using my own Astacio brow Wiz as
per usual as you can see like I don't
really do that much to my brows I just
thicken them slightly and make them look
more shapely using the brow wiz and I'm
actually using the shade medium brown
instead of dark brown just because it's
a little bit softer with my lighter hair
color at the moment and then I finally
set them into place using the UH
Nastasia brow gel and that's just how I
get my brows looking OnPoint I've shown
you guys how I do my brows a million
times before but yeah and then I really
wanted to look nice and glowy to go with
the whole golden theme so I applied a
cream highlight and then I applied a
Nastasia so Hollywood on top because
it's one of my favorite golden
highlights ever and then I took a
lighter highlight like an icy highlight
and applied it on the inner corner of my
eye and also on the tip of my nose as
well just to really bring these parts of
my face outwards and to really make them
pop and then I set my face using the
pixie glow mist and this is one of my
favorite glowy setting sprays ever and I
finished off the look using a glossy
nude lip so I used my favorite lip liner
of all time this is remote cappuccino
lip liner it's just my favorite lip
liner and just goes the best with my
skin tone and then I applied this makeup
geek matte lip color and then I applied
the Gerard cosmetics hydro plump gloss
on top and I just really loved this lip
combination it looked so pretty also
lasted a really long time throughout the
night as well I only had to reapply like
once I think after I had eaten and had
to
drink so it lasted a really long time
right moving on to my hair I just kept
it really simple and I also didn't want
to show you guys too much of this
because you guys have seen me straighten
my hair about a thousand billion times
unfortunately I'm not the most like
interesting when it comes to my hair
especially when I know I'm going
somewhere just because I don't want to
fiddle about with it too much because my
hair is just it's it's a frizz bah so I
just wanted to do what I knew worked for
me and I made it nice sleek and straight
and honestly went really nicely with the
whole look anyway so I made sure that
everywhere was nice and straight and I
parted it in the middle guys I hope you
enjoyed this get ready with me my outfit
is actually from pretty little thing I
love this dress it fits so well the only
thing was I didn't have to pin it around
the cleavage area because it did come
quite low because it was a wedding I
didn't want it to be inappropriate in
any way so you may need to pin it but
depending on you and your body type it's
totally up to you but that's the only
thing I have to say but it was such a
beautiful dress
such good quality and it really wasn't
too expensive at all hope you guys
