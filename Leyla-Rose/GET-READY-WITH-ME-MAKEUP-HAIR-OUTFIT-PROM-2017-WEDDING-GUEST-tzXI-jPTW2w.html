so today I have a get ready with me and
I'm going to be doing my hair makeup and
outfit on camera for you guys this is
probably going to be one of the most
realistic get ready with me ever because
I'm getting ready at my friend's house
and we went to a wedding and literally
I'm like rushing to get ready and it's
just like how I would be getting ready
if there was no camera there so this is
me and my friend Ellie and I was getting
ready at her house so I thought I just
switch the camera on it's very realistic
I hope you guys like it anyway so I
thought I'd do a little commentary
because some parts are a little bit hard
to see because like I said I'm just
getting ready as I normally would I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and let's
get into it the first thing I'm doing is
just making sure my hair is out of my
face and this is probably the first
video in ages that I haven't worn my
meaning mouth is and you guys know I
love to wear it because it just keeps my
hair out of my face so easily so I've
gone back to my old roots and put a
bandana in my hair if you guys watch my
own videos you guys will know what I
mean and I'm just moisturizing my skin
and I'm using the body shop oils of life
mooster Iser I'm just putting that all
over and just allowing that to soak in
and then I'm just taking an under eye
mask this one is from Sephora these are
the ultra moisturizing ones and I put
them in a weird way so that I can do my
eyes whilst these are on just to save
time because like I said I was in a rush
to get ready ASAP so I kind of folded
them on the inner part of my eye and
allowed it to you know just so I'd have
this space but it wouldn't affect my eye
makeup some applying stomache concealer
as a primer and just rubbing that in
with my finger and making sure that it's
nice and set before I use my eyeshadows
so for my eyeshadow today I am taking B
Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette and I'm first of all just taking
this color right here and we are going
to be applying that into the crease and
I'm just going to be blending this out
and kind of smoking this out quite far I
really wanted my eyes to be nice and
extended but soft at the same time I'm
really extending this outwards that even
goes past my eyebrow and I'm just making
sure that it's nice and bust out and
really blended I want it to look kind of
smoky but not too much at the same time
so just building up that color in the
outer corner and the
crease and I really like doing this just
to very gradually build up that color
first of all you can just see how berry
picking of the background you're going
to see here quite a bit throughout this
video I'm next taking this darker shade
and just applying that into the outer
corner area like I said to add a little
bit of smokiness but I don't go too
crazy with it I'm going to eventually be
applying something a little bit darker
afterwards
I'm just applying it on this area just
to build up that shadow a little bit and
then I'm just taking this shimmery shade
and using this as a base before I apply
a color pop eyeshadow I really wanted my
lids to look super super sparkly so I
went on top of it with a super shot
through bridge dog eyes shadow from
colour-pop
and I'm just creating almost a half cut
crease effect on that inner corner and I
really love how sparkly this is next I'm
taking a mixture of truffled and
liquorice and just popping that in the
outer corner to add like I said that a
little bit of smokiness I'm applying it
on the outer corner of the lid and then
also in that little V area and just
making sure that it's going to be nice
and blended out also I don't want it to
look like this is over taking the whole
work because I am going to be applying a
smoked out liner and I really want that
to add to the effect so I took off the
under eye mask and I also just wiped
away the edges of the eye shadow to see
where we stand with the eye shadow so I
can do my smoky liner so I'm using just
liquorice now just that dark black shade
and I'm applying it with a small pencil
brush to create it I would have used an
angled brush actually forgot it at home
because it has to grow everything to
Ellie's house so I'm just using that to
apply it on the outer part of my eyelid
and then just gradually blending it
upwards to make sure that it blends in
with the rest of the eye that's why I
didn't go too crazy with applying too
much shadow on the outer corner just
because I wanted the liner to be a bit
more of a focal point rather than the
outer corner being too much so I'm just
making sure to blend that with another
brush and it looks something like this
and now I'm moving on to the skin so I
am going to be priming my skin heavily
first of all using a be glam glow always
forget the name of this it's the glowing
version of their moisturizers I think
it's called glow starter and it's just a
really nice Google wheat moisturizer
it's
be nice you've been in the back girl
okay so now I'm applying another primer
I've actually applied one moisturizer
and three primers for this and I love to
pro my face so much so I took the Too
Faced hangover primer to add just a
little bit more hydration and then the
benefit matte pore primer I think that's
what it's called just to make sure that
my makeup stays on all day and then I
color corrected using my usual color
corrector stick from soap &amp;amp; Glory and
just buff that into the skin it just to
remove all of the redness I have from
acne scars I have documentation I told
you guys this would be a realistic get
rid of me so I mixed together my two
favorite foundations the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless and also the ex1
invisi wear and I mixed it to get a good
color but also because I just love both
formulas and they work really well
together so I buff that into my skin
using a kabuki brush from morphe and
then I did go over this with my Beauty
Blender just because I find that this
can take up quite a bit so I thought
like this picks up all the excess to
make it look more skin like and it does
make it look more natural but I prefer
that because otherwise I don't know just
like it'll crumble off and then for my
under eyes I'm mixing together two
concealers the Maybelline fit me again
and then I also use the Maybelline age
rewind because they're two of my
favorite concealers and I was something
that had a really nice coverage because
I obviously was going to be in pictures
and stuff like that so I used my beauty
blender to blend that in and I just love
how brightening it was really really
loved that and it just gave such a nice
coverage on these areas I really liked
the way that my skin turned out I took
the Chanel tan de Soleil I always forget
the name as this a pretty sure I said
that wrong but it's a cream bronzer and
I just used it to create a nice natural
bronzed effect around my face and then I
will be setting that with a matte
bronzer afterwards but I just feel like
this really makes my face match into
myNet because I am fake tan right now
and I love creating a dark effect around
the outer perimeter it just looks so
much more natural I then set my face as
I always do using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder and then I took
my shade and light palette from Kat Von
D and I took the Brumby shade from it
and just went on top of that cream
bronzer
just to add more bronze enos to my face
and I feel like the camera doesn't pick
up how bronzy I looked but in real life
I looked I looked pretty dark because I
was wearing really dark tan as well I'm
standing right in front of the window so
there really feel like it it gave it
that kind of effect I also applied some
highlight on to the tops of my
cheekbones and then I moved on to my
eyebrows and I am NOT going to do this
on camera but I am going to leave it in
the eye right here I also went ahead and
applied my lashes as well really quickly
just because by this point I was running
out of time so when I got to my hair I
was in such a rush usually when I curl
my hair I don't take sections as big as
this but I didn't have time honestly
like you know when you just you know you
having fun doing your makeup and then it
gets to the rest in your like crap I'm
really running out of time so I just
took my Bellamy 6 in-1 hair colors and I
love these I always always use these I
am doing the standard curling method and
just taking pretty large sections
because mainly of the time and just
curling them away from my face so on
either side of this side I'm curling to
the right and then on the other side I
call to the left so that's pretty much
what I'm doing and then I just keep
taking sections down I'm gonna do is to
say that why don't you get to the top
section on the right side of my face
like when you look to the right it's
really really annoying because I don't
think the night before when I actually
like got my hair to go straight
I didn't straighten that area enough so
there's a few little I don't know the
wires like little it's just like there's
a lot of texture in the area of my hair
I did go over after I had finished
filming because in this light I just
couldn't see it and also in outdoor
light it wasn't as bad but when I went
over I realized what it was like and
yeah and then I fixed it but it is
really annoying but I did fix it before
the wedding it's just I was in such a
rush that it was hard to see as you can
see I'm just kind of like moving all
around oh gosh
rushing relateable hashtag alive okay so
as you can see I told you this would be
one of the most relatable get ready with
news ever
but this is the very last section I'm
just going it away from my face and when
I put it down and kind of see what I
mean it's just a little bit of texture
at the root of my head I didn't get to
get right there it's so annoying but I'm
just finishing off my lip color and
taking this Kylee Dolce K let's pencil
when I'm applying all over because I
really would have made that color to
last as long as possible and then I went
around to the outer edges of that using
this NYX lip suede lip pencil I think
that's what it's called and I just went
around the outer edges to really really
over line and then I went over that with
a NYX soft matte lip cream to make it
comfortable when this setting spray the
Urban Decay all nighter and that is
pretty much the end of this look guys so
that's my hair and makeup terribly sorry
about the texture at the top of my hair
like I said I did fix that afterwards
but this is what I went for and it's
just really simple and it looks really
pretty in pictures and I really like the
way that it came out and it's just
really soft and pretty and I love it so
this is my hair and makeup and then this
is my outfit funny story with my outfit
I know this is like such a different get
ready mean compared to my other ones
because there's so many little stories
within it but this dress I actually
bought a day or two before the wedding
because I had three other dresses that I
just didn't like and then I found this
one online for 10 pounds I'll try and
link it down below and I honestly loved
the way that it looked
it was just perfect for this wedding and
then the shoes that I have are from
misguided and I forgot to show my clutch
but the clutch that I had was from new
look I had a rose gold clutch that was
with it and that's that so guys I really
hope you enjoyed this get ready with me
I know it's not as cool edited as some
of the other ones but because it was
just such a rush I just didn't have a
lot of time to film it in that way so I
hope you enjoyed this anyway and it just
being a little bit chatty I really
missed you and I really hope that you
guys enjoyed and I love you all so much
thank you for being patient with me not
uploading as often a video will be
coming on my second channel soon
hopefully explaining a bit more about
this kind of stuff but I love you all so
much and I'm so grateful for your
support always and I'll see you guys in
my next video so prick you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
