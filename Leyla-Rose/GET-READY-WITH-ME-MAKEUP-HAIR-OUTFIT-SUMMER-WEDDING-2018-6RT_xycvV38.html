back to my channel so today I have a get
ready with me
I know another get ready with me I feel
like I've done so many of these lately
but I love these videos I know you guys
love to watch them so that's why I've
done another this is a hair make up an
outfit for a summertime wedding that I
just went to this week and I really
wanted to go for something super golden
and glowy because I was wearing in very
bright dress I don't wear bright dresses
I don't wear a lot of color actually so
for me to work quite a bright color such
as a mustard dress it was a big deal so
I decided to go with something it's
super golden and warm on the face and
then go for a really nice soft wave in
my hair if you love get ready with me
videos then be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
and be sure to turn on my post
notifications too and without further
rambling let's get on into this video
okay so the first thing that we are
going to be doing is prepping my skin
I'm just going in with a bunch of things
I started off with some serum and then I
went in with two primers I did the Too
Faced hangover and then the Too Faced
primed and poreless then I color
corrected and this whole process you
guys have seen me do many times I've
done a lot of base tutorials lately too
so I'll be sure to leave some base
tutorials down below in the description
and also on the eye as well if you guys
want to see something a little bit more
in-depth but I do feel the need to color
correct because I have a lot of acne
scars as long as I've color corrected
using some green concealer from YSL I've
gone in with my e^x one foundation it's
honestly one of my go-to for events it's
not the most long-lasting but it's super
flawless and it looks great in pictures
plus it still looks quite natural in
person I find that a lot of foundations
that look good in pictures on my
particular skin type ends up looking
really cakey in person so this is a
really nice balance for me where you can
still kind of see my skin coming through
and my skin isn't at the best right now
but it's a lot better than it was so I
feel the need to use less cover
than I would if my skin was super bad so
I'm just blending my and using a kabuki
brush from morphe and I'm just applying
a little extra coverage on my acne
scarring before starting my eyes for my
eyes I wasn't really sure what I was
doing at this point I knew I wanted to
go something golden but I wasn't sure
exactly what look I was going for the
colors in the soft glam palette went
great with my dress so I knew I wanted
to use the soft glam palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and then I just
kind of wanted to keep all of the warm
colors generally in the crease and all
over the eyes but I wanted the crease to
be particularly more warm than the lid
so I went in with this really nice
peachy color first of all to use as my
first transition color and I don't know
if you guys can tell but I'm really
extending it outwards I'm taking it even
farther than my eyebrow and that's gonna
really extend our eyes outwards and just
really look nice and glam which is great
for an event like this or if you guys
are just going up generally extending
your eyes outwards just looks really
pretty and it's a nice thing to do and I
love to do it then I'm going in with
this slightly darker warm Brown and I am
applying that into the deeper portion of
my crease and just making sure that I'm
applying it gradually so it blends
really seamlessly into that previous
color that we just applied and again as
you can see I'm kind of dragging it
outwards past the tail of my eyebrow
which is dramatic but because we're
using quite soft colors yeah actually
looks really pretty so I'm just dragging
it outwards towards my temple and yeah I
did take it really fine I realized and I
was like okay let's just let that fall
and then going in with this even darker
warm Brown I'm taking a flat brush and
just pushing this into the deepest part
of my crease it's slightly above my
crease though because we are going to be
doing a cut crease effect so you want
this to be slightly above the crease as
you can see I'm kind of carving out that
shape even more but I'm keeping it quite
soft I don't want it to look like a
really really harsh cut crease I want it
to look very soft so I'm making sure to
go over that with my previous blending
brush to make sure there are no harsh
lines then going in with this light gold
shade we're going to be using this all
over the lid and I'm actually using this
to carve out my cut crease now if you
guys have watched my other cut crease
tutorials you probably would have seen
that I go quite heavy-duty with
concealer before I apply anything to the
lid to cut the crease
and that's what I wanted a cut crease to
look really intense but I didn't want it
to look intense today I wanted it to
look a lot softer so if it didn't look
really precise and perfect that was fine
by me I just wanted to create that shape
whilst still looking quite soft so
that's something that I personally
wanted now before I continue on with the
eyes I wanted to apply my concealer I
realized this is in quite a weird order
but usually I would clean up the side of
my eye using a makeup wipe but today I
have already applied my foundation so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
concealer and bake it
I used a mixture of the Tarte shape tape
and also the Urban Decay all nighter
concealer this duo is so full coverage
and amazing I usually like to go quite
full coverage on my concealer because I
just find that it just brightens the
under eye so much and it just is so
effective and I do usually like to go
quite light as well and I am baking it
today which isn't something I usually do
it's usually something I do more so for
events because it just means that it's
gonna stay on a lot longer and
personally for me my most oily areas on
my forehead on my nose and cheeks so I
just wanted to make sure to bake my
forehead and also take this powder down
and allow it to sit on my nose whilst I
finished the rest of my eye makeup and
also it does catch any extra fallout as
well so it works as a duo job basically
so I'm just carving out that cut crease
one more time just to make sure that the
definition is there but it's not again -
to shop then I'm going in with some
eyeliner and I'm taking this one from
NYX because of the texture of the
eyeshadow from the UH Nastasia palette
it wasn't coming up super dark
whereas this this eyeliner is usually
really really dark but because it's a
pen brush not a lot of product was
coming out so I had to go on top of it
with the NYX matte liquid liner as well
and this just made it look even more
black so once I have this shape down I
went on top of it using the other eye
liner and the kind of eyeliner shape
that I went for was quite elongated and
again as you can see it almost goes out
past my eyebrow look it doesn't touch my
eyebrow if you're looking at as distance
it goes out quite far I realize that
this kind of shape point suit everyone
but for me I really wanted it to be
quite elongated and
because I wanted my eyes to be the focal
point of this look next I'm just gonna
be dusting away the powder that I left
on to bake I always had to be quite
cautious not to leave this on for too
long because I find that it can really
dry out my face because I just I have a
weird skin type where it gets dry as
well as oily I have no idea but I just
like to dust it away and don't leave on
for too too long so I dusted it away
from my under eyes before I applied my
eyelashes I am using the lash style
mikonos from Lily lashes and whilst the
blue is just getting tacky
I used the bad girl ban mascara from
benefit which is my favorite mascara I
think of all time like honestly I use
every day and I'm obsessed like it's
just so good so I'm using that on my
lashes and then I am using the false
lashes on top of that and I just feel
like the false lashes just complete this
look I just feel like an eye look isn't
the same without them and because
they're really nice and thick I'm fluffy
they just really densify that lash line
and it's the exact look I wanted to go
for then I just went over the crease
using glitter I actually didn't intend
to do this but then I was like you know
what hey let's throw some glitter in
there some gold glitter why not and this
was from NYX then I went in and finished
off the face so I took some of the hoola
cream bronzer stick and I applied that
all around my temple area under my jaw
line and also underneath my cheekbone
and then I went in with a little bit
this Rimmel contour stick as well in a
darker shade and just used it on some of
the more hollow areas so just where I
wanted it to be a little bit deeper and
I used the same brush I used to blend in
my foundation to blend this into my skin
and just buff this gently
I do realize I have already set my skin
I personally prefer doing it this way
just because I do have acne scars if I
didn't set my foundation my acne scars
would come through quite a bit if I
didn't set my foundation before doing
this so now I'm gonna be bronzing and
I'm gonna be using it the Laura Mercier
bronzer I really like this it's new I'm
not entirely sure of the name but like
always I will have everything down below
just doing a little bit of contouring
now nothing too major because I've
already applied so much face product on
to my skin I'm just taking a contour
shade and just using it on the slightly
deeper parts with a smaller brush and
then I'm just baking underneath my cheek
bone and I really love to do this just
because I really
fine this helps my contour to look nice
and sharp especially because I have acne
scars on this area so sometimes it can
look a bit muddy if I don't and then I
used a highlight shade from a contour
kit and use that underneath my eyes to
brighten that area up and also a little
bit on my forehead too and I did go in
after this and contour my nose as well
so finally I'm going to be doing my
eyebrows and you guys have seen me do
this quite a few times
I'm gonna be linking a video in the eye
right now where you guys can see me do
my eyebrows properly just because you
guys have seen it so many times and if
you want to see something a little bit
more in-depth then I will link that
video right there for you
but I'm just using an eyebrow primer and
then whilst that dries just dusting away
the baking from underneath my jaw line
the process when I get ready honestly is
just always everywhere it's so different
to a makeup tutorial and then I'm just
applying some highlight this is the
fancy Beauty hostel a baby highlight
it's honestly one of my favorites just
look at this glow I can't deal with it
it's so good and then of course to
finish with my eyebrows I'm just gonna
be using my uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
brow is just to fill in my eyebrows and
I'm not going for anything too crazy
just kind of following my natural brow
shape but just filling it in with a
couple of hairs and then going on top of
that using my own estas in Beverly Hills
clear brow gel okay so before I move on
to my lips I'm gonna do my hair faster
ball and I have straight hair at the
moment as you guys know my hair is
naturally curly but I'm just gonna be
sectioning my hair and doing really
loose waves it's actually really simple
when I'm pretty sure I've showed you
guys how to do this before another get
ready with me but just because it's a
hair makeup and outfit I wanted to show
you guys the process so every single
call that I do I call away from my face
I'm using I'd say like a medium barrel
this is the Bellamy 6 m1 I'm pretty sure
this is breaking now though I've had
this for years and yeah it's just
starting to like not heat up all the way
so I think I need a new Carling irons
let me know what curling irons are good
down below be there this one is a medium
barrel just because I like to call my
hair slightly tighter than I would like
it to stay through
the night because of course the coals do
drop and I don't know if you guys saw it
I just bought my car while I was doing
that car how did a bit like a chump
though so I'm just doing every single
call away from my face
and I wanted to make sure that the very
top section was a smaller section than
every other one I don't personally feel
the need to section my hair and say
loads in those sections because I wanted
quite loose waves yeah it's pretty
self-explanatory you guys just doing the
calls and just coming away from my face
but when it comes to the top section I
wanted to make sure that especially the
front you really want it to frame your
face nicely so just take extra attention
when you do this and I kind of like drop
it and like pull it a little bit just to
give it a really nice frame to the face
I don't know if that makes any sense
hair is one of those things I just can't
explain I do make up more than hair guys
okay so when I'm got changed into my
outfit I also used a lip plumper as well
which is what my lips look a little bit
hotter than usual I just went over my
lips using the cappuccino lip liner from
Rimmel some of this lipstick from
Charlotte Tilbury and then I went on top
of it with a nice gloss and honestly my
lips are so dry at the moment I really
felt like I had to go the gloss but it
went so well with this look anyway so
I'm really glad I did but I could not
have got away with a matte lip today
it's just my lips were so dry so also
for the outfit the dress that I was
wearing was from forever 21 I'm gonna do
my very best and try and find a link
down below because I did buy this in
store it was honestly a last-minute pick
I didn't know what I was gonna be
wearing for this wedding but it was
honestly like a really nice summery
color and I'm really glad I went for it
it was definitely out of my comfort zone
and not the kind of dress I would
usually wear so it's definitely out of
my comfort zone I'll try and link it
down below and I also wore some shoes
from Simmi shoes but I don't think I
showed it in any of these clips so I'm
just gonna leave what I wore down below
all length so you guys can see it so
guys as the end of this get ready with
me I am so grateful for all of you for
watching through this video I know it
was a bit of a long one for me but if
you guys do enjoy it get ready with me

makeup and outfit be sure to give this
