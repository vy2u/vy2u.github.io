channel so today I have a chit chat get
ready with me for you I'm actually going
out now and I'm running out of time so
I'm going to make this short and sweet I
created this look that's Victoria's
Secret inspired and I go from you know
feeling ill actually really go right now
and transforming into as close as I
could get to a Victoria's Secret Angel
let's face I'm not ever gonna be on that
level but hey this is my take on it and
I went for something that was wearable
for me and it's sparkly the skin is
super glowy and it just has that kind of
Victoria Secret glow and I do chat you
guys whilst I get ready
I forget to subscribe whilst you're here
so you don't miss any videos from me in
the future and like this video for more
chit chat get ready with me is because I
seem to always forget to do these I used
to do these all the time so let me know
if you want to see more down below in
the comments as well and without further
ado let's get on into this video so
before I do anything I'm taking the
Amanda Ross spa butter collection lip
butter with shear and I'm just going to
be applying this onto my lips by the way
guys if I'm coughing and I sound ill
that's because I am ill is another
goblet on my lips I'm going to be
moisturizing my skin with my everyday
moisturizer this is the body shop
bitumen II and I'm just popping this all
over my face and I just realized I don't
have a mirror in front of me so I'm
looking into my little screen where I
can see what I'm doing is I'm just gonna
allow that moisturizer to sit on my skin
for a minute and whilst I am waiting for
that sit I'm just gonna push my eyebrows
upwards and just pluck any stray hairs
because I need to actually go in and
probably do my brows but in the meantime
I'm just going to go and get like some
of the strays because it ruins makeup I
feel if they're not plucked so so I just
plucked a few of them and now I'm gonna
prime I'm going to take my Too Faced
hangover prime of the kids to be honest
with you guys I really can't live
without this one this is the most
hydrating primer I have that doesn't
meet
and oily so I boys have to put this on
it's honestly amazing and I'm going to
go with why benefit Porefessional just
to like Philip applause as well just
popping this pretty much all over just
to fill in the pores and I'm kind of
like pushing it into the skin just to
really make sure it's all sitting in
there nicely I really push that into my
skin and it always makes my skin look
red by the way I look so pale on camera
today don't know why I'm just going in
with some green concealer from it soap &amp;amp;
Glory just popping this everywhere this
is kind of just like a routine for me
because I just feel that when I don't do
it my redness is a lot harder to color
up and I'm just taking some of the 17
skin while concealer and just popping
this under my eyes just because it's got
a bit of a peach 10 so I find that this
will kind of color correct a little bit
there now moving on to the skin I'm
going to be using two foundations I'm
taking the Too Faced Born This Way and
once with the steel @ku glow and I'm
just going to be using mainly lip balm
this way but then I'm just adding a low
bit of the stealer in just because I do
feel that I need a little bit of glow
but going for a Victoria's Secret
inspired look because the fashion shows
last night I didn't see it but I
actually saw pictures and the makeup
always looks unbelievable so that's kind
of my inspiration for the day so I'm
just going to make sure to take this
down to my neck as well and I'm just
taking some of the Stila it's kind of
got like a little pipette I'm just
popping some of this onto the skin as
well just so I can kind of mix it all in
I'm just using my kabuki and just kind
of patting it in and then I'm going to
be going on top of that with my Beauty
Blender as all to take away all of the
excess this weird because I actually
feel like you guys haven't seen me in
ages but people that were watching my
vlogs would have seen me every single
day it's really weird if you guys didn't
already know I have been vlogging every
single day of December so far and I
wanted to my own horn or anything but I
have been doing pretty good like I've
been on time with everything I've been
uploading really long blogs so if you
guys didn't know about this or if you do
anything
your mind you want to start with you my
blogs I'm going to leave a link just
here and I'm just going to show you guys
a little preview my intro just on the
side of me right now and I have been
absolutely loving blogging it's just
been just so fun and I feel like you
guys are actually watching me are
getting to know so much about me that
you wouldn't get to know just your few
videos plus make sure you do subscribe
anyway because I'm going to be doing a
giveaway that's going to be announced on
this channel quietly giveaway I've got
loads and loads of prizes and I'm going
to be announcing you on here but one of
the rules is to be subscribed to my work
channel anyway so make sure you go ahead
and subscribe because I am vlogging
every single day and like I said I I do
feel like the blogs are really really
good and I'm really enjoying it I feel
like yeah I'm just making some effort
into it so that's why I feel like you
should go and subscribe
just taking my tea you blend up and just
patting this all over just to pick up
any of the excess just make sure it's
nice and blended and glowy looking so
yeah all the people that have been
watching my vlogs I'm pre Shirley can
vouch for me in saying that I'm doing
pretty well and everyone seems to be
enjoying it so much so make sure you go
and subscribe to that today is a chilly
day six of walk away so I've been doing
it for almost a week already and I'm
going to be honest with you guys I'm
going to be so sad when it's actually
over so a hundred percent on my caramel
blogging because I've just been enjoying
it like it's just been so fun so now
that my foundation is blended and I'm
just going to take my Maybelline fit me
and just pop this under the eyes I often
find that on the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show this skin just look glowy
but it and it looks structured but it
doesn't look too overly contoured which
is kind of my favorite thing to do
anyways I felt like it was too bright so
I just dropped the brightness down on my
camera a little bit and I definitely
prefer that so I'm really sorry if that
was too bright before blending in the
end with my Beauty Blender and I'm going
to be going in later with some
brightening powder under the eyes so I
didn't want this to be too bright anyway
because like I said I'm going to be kind
of highlighting with a little bit of
powder when I set it I'm going out off
and this as well so I'm quite glad with
you but something quite glowy and pretty
to set into place I'm taking my stupid
glory instant recharge powder and I'm
just popping that onto my face by the
way speaking of beauty calm thank you so
much to everyone
actually came and said hello I was
actually blown away I didn't vlog it as
well so if you want to go and see that
vlog just see if you're in it you might
be in it or if you just want to check
out and see what happened if you weren't
there then go ahead and check that out
it's taking the Kat Von D shade + light
pile and just mixing to go with the
yellow and the pink shade and just
popping that into my eyes but yet can we
just talk about my background like how
unbelievably Christmasy it actually is
I'm so so happy with that is the first
time I'm actually filming in front of it
and I love the way it looks on camera
looks so good for some reason though
there are little white spots that you
can see just there those are actually
Christmas decorations they aren't holes
in the tree because it kind of looks
like you're seeing through to the to the
back but it's not I promise they're not
holes in my tree and I'm finished with
my complexion I'm going to go in with
bronzing up blush and highlight to
actually bronze I'm going to be taking
some of my hoola by benefit I'm breaking
in a new one and just popping it around
the outer perimeter of my face and I'm
not gonna lie I really really want to
look grungy because I don't know the
Victoria's Secret Angels always look so
bronzy so this is quite important to me
anyway I'm just taking this in a big
fluffy brush and just making sure to get
this all around the outer perimeter of
my face for blush I'm going to be taking
the map warm store blush now this is
actually in the old packaging and when I
worked for Mac I realized that when they
changed the mineralized blushes to the
new packaging the formula change so I
started using warm soul much more
sparingly because this is my favorite
blush it ever ever used and there's a
makeup revolution blush that's very very
similar but this will always kind of be
my favorite so you guys know I'm not a
massive blush person so when I do wear
blush this is this is the one for me now
for highlight I'm actually taking - I'm
going to be taking the Maybelline master
strobing stick and just popping this
like on top of the cheeks because I do
feel that their glow almost seems like
it's coming from like within and then
I'm just going to do my Beauty Blender
and just blend the eros making sure that
that's all blended in and then just to
pop on top of that I'm a very high
I'm not going to put it all over I'm
just going to literally pop it just on
the high points of my cheeks I'm going
to be taking the rodeo instaglam compact
deluxe illuminating powder at number one
and this is actually really really nice
it gives it very like bay there glove as
well so just popping this on top of that
just to finish everything off and I'm
just going to be popping this or kind of
the tops of my forehead as well just to
give me that likes a profile glow okay
so I'm gonna be super duper annoying and
do my eyebrows off-camera link the video
down below and I'm also gonna put it in
an eye right now so if you just click
the either video should come down in a
little bar hey guys so now I've zoomed
in super close you can see my eyebrows
are done they still kind of need to be
plucked properly they don't look too
closely but I'm going to start with my
eyes now and the palette that I'm going
to be using today is the Christmas in
New York palette Marie macaroons are by
Too Faced oh just open now so you guys
can see what's inside it's stunning and
I'm going to be using lots of the brown
and cream shade first of all just taking
the shape which is called tiramisu and
I'm just going to be popping that into
the crease when I look at Victoria
Secret I definitely feel that all of
their eye looks look really simple kind
of taking the shadow like popping it in
here I don't know why I'm doing them but
it just kind of kind of happened you
know I didn't plan it
but kind of taking it all the way in
here but take some of almond mocha which
is this shade right here and I'm just
gonna pop that with the same brush I'm
just going to pop this in the crease I'm
just kind of pushing this in the crease
you can use a smaller brush if you like
but for me I find it totally fine using
the same brush as before but use a
different brush if you find that easier
that's all I'm going to be doing before
the actual crease now I'm going to be
moving into the lid and I'm going to be
taking a Mays super shark eye shadow
from colour-pop okay so I'm going to
take some of this on a flat brush and
just pack it on I know that everyone
always says that this applies a little
bit of the finger
agree with that I do feel that I find it
quite hard to be precise with my finger
so I'm just using a brush for this
eyeshadow is everything like it's got
glitter within it so it just looks
amazing I think this is an amazing
holiday eyeshadow because I just feel
like it looks so Christmasy I'm also
just going to take some of the makeup
geek New Year's Eve pigment and I'm just
going to be applying it on that inner
corner I'm gonna wet my brush before
doing so I just feel like this just
makes everything stick a lot better it's
none of my eyes feel super sparkly I'm
going to be going over some winged
eyeliner I'm going to go for hopefully a
wing that's not too thick I feel like my
hand likes to automatically go thick
what I want to do something they
accentuates the eyes without being too
much because I don't feel like Victoria
Secret wings are usually too much I'm
going moving on to lashes I'm taking the
Koko lashes goddess and I haven't used
these in a really long time we'll be
taking some of that tiramisu color we
put in the crease and I'm just going to
be popping some of this underneath my
eye then I'm going to take some of that
almond mocha and just push it right up
to the lash line because I think I'm
actually going to leave the inside of
the eye without black which I always do
but I think I might leave that today
this thing is a mascara I'm just popping
it on the bottom lashes not too much of
they're just a little bit also I'm just
going to quite a little bit onto the top
as well just to make them blend in I'm
just taking a little bit of the next
glitter liner and I want to put this
somewhere but I'm not sure where I don't
feel like I need it on the lid because
the lid is sparkly as it is I feel like
I might want to put it underneath like
on the inner corner
okay so I'm just popping max trip down
all along the lip I know Victoria Secret
models always wear like glossy stuff but
I'm actually going out very very soon so
just puffing like a pinkish lipstick see
I really don't like cut up I'm stubborn
and I can't be swayed from liquid
lipsticks I'm taking the other star C
liquid lipstick and the color crush and
just gonna pop that over it I'm just
gonna pop on teeny little bit of Kat Von
D bow and arrow cuz I can't seem to stay
away from the Sun that's more ideal for
me and I know it's matte I know it's not
gonna Victoria Secret style color this
is the kind of color I like to go for
and it feels quite realistic to me but
that look lipstick is going to dry now
and this is the finished look I really
hope you enjoy it I know this is so bad
I have to rush because I'm running late
and I've got so much to do still so if
you want to carry on with my day and you
