so the first thing that I'm going to be
doing is taking some concealer this is
the taut shape tape concealer and a
really light shade I really like to use
a light concealer because I feel like
this really brightens any eyeshadow
we're going to be applying and because
the colors were using are going to be
quite dull it will be quite nice to have
that
so the palette that I'm going to be
using today is the urban decay naked
smoky palette and I'm going to be taking
first of all this really light cool tone
based shade we're using this as our
transition shade with a blending brush
from urban decay also and I'm just going
to be blending this and applying this
into the crease to really prepare it for
the darker colors we're going to be
applying if blacks and grays aren't
blended properly they can tend to look a
little bit messy and smudgy I want this
to look quite blended so I'm making sure
to apply this really well into that
crease and making sure that it's blended
properly as well next I'm going to be
taking two colors from this palette I'm
mixing this matte grey with this matte
Brown together these both create a
really nice combination it's almost like
a dark cool brown and I really really
like the way this looks in the crease
this is really going to help to prepare
for the black that we're going to be
applying and I'm just applying this in
the crease and just making sure to
really really push it around making sure
that it's blended into that previous
color and also applying it into that
outer V that way like I said it will be
nice and prepared if there's no color
there before we apply black the black
just doesn't apply properly so next I'm
going to be taking some Mac black track
gel eyeliner and I'm going to be taking
this on a large pencil brush and
applying into that outer corner I'm
going to make sure to blend this very
very quickly with some more of that gray
brown shade and I'm just going to be
mixing that in and making sure to blend
the edges of this file line up really
well the reason why I chose eyeliner is
because I feel like it looks a lot
darker than black eyeshadow on its own
so I'm just kind of blending the edges
and I'm just taking a teeny bit of black
eyeshadow and patting you on top just to
set it but pretty much once you've
blended the eyeliner it looks really
nice and smooth and I really like the
way that it looks and I'm just cleaning
up the edges using a makeup wipe I just
find that this looks so nice and smooth
not only do I love the way that a clean
edge looks but I also feel like it's
really easy to see now if I need any
touch-ups I just go in and blend a
little bit and then I can add my lid
color the lid color that I'm going to be
using is the gray matte
we used in the crease the one that we
actually mixed with the brown but just
the gray on its own and I'm applying
that on the lid and just making sure to
blend that in with the darker shade
that's on the outer corner then I'm
applying at some liquid liner and just
applying a nice straight line along the
lid I'm actually not going to be winging
it out today I'm just applying some
eyeliner on the outer corner whilst it's
still wet I'm just going to be blending
out the edges and that way it blends
really seamlessly into the rest of the
eyeshadow I'm also just taking a teeny
little bit of black eyeshadow just to
make it blend a little bit smoother and
then of course I'm taking some of my
certified Phoenix lashes and applying
that onto my top lashline and applying
some mascara really sorry this bit is
out of focus don't know why moving on to
my skin I'm taking some of my makeup
forever
step1 smoothing primer and also my
nourishing primer as well and first of
all going in with the nourishing one and
then going on top of it with the
smoothing just cuz my skin was a teeny
bit problematic today had a few little
bumps on this I wanted to make sure I
primed it really really well the
foundation I'm going to be using is the
Too Faced Born This Way absolutely love
this foundation I'm just throwing this
all over my skin and just blending this
in with my Beauty Blender I love this
foundation for a full coverage I just
feel like it looks so flawless you also
do need a lot of it as well which I like
you can kind of just apply one thin
layer I'm applying a little bit more
today just because I wanted it to be
super super flawless I have done my
foundation routine not too long ago so
I'll link that down below and also you
can click the eye for that as well
I definitely explain really well how I
like to do my foundation in that video
I'm also going to be applying some
concealer under my eyes I'm taking the
Born This Way concealer from Too Faced
also I just realized that he's born this
way foundation and concealer and I'm
just blending that in also with my
Beauty Blender - I really like a nice
bright under eyes I'm using this in
quite a light shade and just applying it
in a triangular motion underneath my eye
to really lift the eyes and to brighten
it also I do want to make sure that my
under eyes look nice and bright because
I feel like with smokey colors it can
kind of look like you've been punched in
the face like it's quite easy to do that
if you don't apply enough concealer and
make it look nice and bright under there
I'm also sitting my face today with a
powder that's not the soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant research it's actually the soap
&amp;amp; Glory one heck of a block which I'm
really
right now I'm pretty much just sitting
everywhere with this and I'm using my
Real Techniques setting brush which I
haven't used in ages but I really liked
the finish it has a super matte powder
and I really like the finish that it
gives also something that was super
important for me was making sure that my
face was nice and warm because of the
cool colors we were using so I took the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
and I took the bronze II shade and
applied it all around the outer
perimeter of my skin I just feel like
it's very easy for my face to look
washed out if I don't apply a bronzy
shade so this has really helped my face
to look nice and warm and then I also
went in with the UH Nastasia so
Hollywood illuminator this just gives a
really nice subtle glow on the tops of
the cheeks
I used a fan brush so I definitely feel
like this makes it look a lot more
dispersed it doesn't look so precise on
the tops of the cheekbones this looks
really nice and glowy so I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows and one eye
off-camera because I'm gonna be doing an
updated eyebrow routine and very soon so
now I'm gonna do the other eye what I'm
gonna be doing first of all is just
taking some of this Rimmel kohl pencil
when applying it into the waterline and
also running it along the bottom lash
line too and then I'm gonna be doing
something that's super easy and just
taking some eyeshadow and basically
smudging it you don't have to be neat
with this I liked it looking a little
bit more at that kind of smokiness I
really like the way it looks especially
with the colors we used and of course
finishing off with some mascara from
Maybelline and then finally for one of
my favorite parts of this look I'm going
to be taking at night morphe lip liner
from Mac and just applying it around the
outer perimeter to prepare for this
really extreme lip color I'm going to be
using the lip color I'm using is this
melted matte lipstick from Too Faced I
have the color listed down below of
course with all the other products that
I used and I'm just running it all along
the lips it's actually a really really
deep purple it's not a black although in
some photos I did definitely feel like I
was wearing a black lipstick this is of
course totally out of my comfort zone
and I wouldn't wear something like this
out for me but because I wanted to
create something different I pad it with
a super deep lip color if you did want
to use this eye look you could pair it
with many many lip colors I would
probably suggest a nude and you could
even go for a nudie gray tone you could
go for Purple's
or even of course something as dramatic
as the one I'm wearing
but I definitely stick to the cooler
tones just because I feel like it suits
this kind of look really well so guys
