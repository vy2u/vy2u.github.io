I have a makeup tutorial for you guys
and pretty much I would say that last
year was probably the least creative
year for me when it came to makeup looks
but no no no this year this year I am
gonna be just pouring them out for you
guys and this is my first lip that came
up with I actually created this off
camera I was just feeling creative I did
it took a picture for Instagram and you
guys were like we want to see a tutorial
so I decided to recreate it for you guys
and it's basically this like bronzy
glitter cut cream I basically show you
guys I look just the products I used on
my cheeks and my lips just cuz I didn't
want this to be a tutorial or it's like
a full face but I'm honestly loving my
base so much and as you guys know I'm
suffering a lot with acne right now and
I have found the best foundation mi it's
actually really inexpensive and I
haven't seen many people talk about it
so I am so excited I'm gonna be doing a
video on that foundation just a review
of it like I don't do reviews but this
deserves a review so if you guys enjoy
makeup tutorials like this then be sure
to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel for more videos like this I'm
hoping to get back to posting roughly
two videos a week again at the moment
I'm only posting once to twice but I
wanted to get a solid upload schedule
with two videos a week plus be sure to
subscribe to my second channel because
I'm hopefully gonna be uploading that
once a week and yeah I'm just super
excited with all the uploads that Artic
honestly living for this look and if you
guys want to see how I achieved it and
it just keep on watching okay guys so we
are starting off by priming our eyelids
as usual this time I'm using an eye
primer and I find that using a tinted
one is quite important especially when
you're gonna be doing a lot of blending
and this one is Eden from Urban Decay
first of all what we are going to be
taking this shade right here and this is
gonna be our first transition shade I
really like to use quite a light warm
shade usually especially if I'm using
warm colors to use as a transition shade
I just find that this really helps
everything to blend in really nicely and
as you can see I'm like extending it
quite a bit and taking it up quite high
and that's because all the other colors
are going to blend into this one and I'm
next gonna be going into this shade
right here and this is just a slightly
darker version of this color and this is
going
be going into the deep Apollo crease
this has a really nice amount of warmth
to it and I really like that this look
is so warm so I'm just using that I'm
blending it into that previous color
before going into a slightly darker
shade and then I'm gonna be taking that
again into the deeper part of my crease
and you guys kind of get the gist of
this it's kind of like you go darker as
you go along and then you kind of just
like create that transition from dark to
light and one of my main tips for this
look is to go back and forth between
brushes and colors it's not a
straightaway process you kind of need to
go back and forth but just make sure
that you start off with the lightest
color and go into the darkest one last
to get a really nice blend so as you can
see I'm just like creating my shape and
I'm using lots of small stroking motions
this really helps because just because
you don't to take too much of that dark
color too high next I'm going to be
going into a concealer and we are going
to be using this to create that really
nice precise cut crease shape now
obviously you don't have to worry about
like keeping the color away from the lid
while you're doing your blending and
that way you can really focus on getting
that blended perfect and that's what I
love about this look so I'm just going
back and forth into more concealer I
like the concealer to be quite thick
when I do this and I'm just as you can
see it's basically like carving out a
shape I'm just going slightly above my
natural crease line for this but
obviously do whatever works for your eye
shape and I'm extending it to create
that kind of feel line cut crease I
really want it to extend outwards and
that's kind of the look with this as you
can see it's gonna go like almost past
my eyebrow if that makes sense and you
do want to make sure that it's as
precise as you can get it but don't
worry just take your time with this it's
honestly a lot easier than it looks and
then once you are done we are going to
be setting that with a foiled eyeshadow
also from makeup geek as well and I
really really like this color this is
really nice and it acts as a nice base
for the glitter that we're gonna be
applying on top of this so once I have
done that I just like to go around that
that corner of where we've cut the
crease please and just go in with a
little bit more of that dark brown just
to deepen it slightly before we apply
our glue glue like go-to adhesive for
our glitter so I use this good adhesive
neck's and just apply it all over the
lid and then I'm going to be going in on
top of that with two lips of cosmetics
glitters that I mixed together I will
have them written down in the
description box because I can't remember
right now in this moment and then just
going back into the crease again to
perfect it now I didn't want to apply
any eyeliner I literally just applied a
thin line of eyeliner just for my lashes
to sit on because I'm gonna be using the
loli lashes in Mykonos and this is quite
a thick lash style so you do want to
make sure that if you are doing a look
that's as glittery / light as this you
might want to just apply it like a thin
line of eyeliner as a base for the
lashes I just applied some mascara and
I'm also just wiping the side of the eye
just to make sure that it looks nice and
precise for the waterline I'm just gonna
be applying at some black eyeliner from
maybelline this is from the Gigi Hadid
collection and I'm just applying this on
my waterline and just below the bottom
lashline and I am smudging this using
that one Brown we used in the crease and
I'm kind of taking this quite low
because I really like that grungy effect
where it kind of comes down quite low
and I'm connecting this to the outer
corner as well just to tie it all in
together and I'm just finishing off this
look with some mascara on the bottom
lashes again I really like the way that
this looked and it kind of just like
focuses all the smokiness on that center
part of the eye and then I did apply a
little bit of highlight onto the inner
corner for my face I kept it pretty
simple I just went in with hoola bronzer
by benefit and I applied it all around
the outer perimeter of my face I really
wanted to keep this look relatively
bronzy and I didn't want to add too much
color to my face I honestly don't
usually apply blush but I just wanted my
face to look quite bronzy
for the lips I went in with my room or
cappuccino lip liner as you guys know
I'm obsessed with this I just use it
almost every day because it's just like
the perfect lip liner for my skin tone
and then I went in with some la splash
liquid lipstick and this is in a nude
shade and because of the eyes I wanted
to keep the lips glossy as well and I
thought it just kind of had a really
nice like continuity with the eyes and
stuff I don't know if that makes sense
but yeah then I went in with my thin tea
Beauty highlight I'm obsessed with this
right now this is in kilowatt and I'm
just applying it onto the high points of
my face as you can see I just oh god
this just ties the whole look together
honestly what would we do without
highlight honestly so that is the end of
this tutorial I really hope you guys
enjoyed if you did don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to my

you all so much and I will see you all
