channel today's video is going to be a
get ready with me this is just gonna be
a casual glamour I'll show you guys how
I did my makeup my hair and I also
showed you guys a little bit of my
outfit as well so if you want to see how
I got ready then please just keep on
watching
you
yes start off I'm going to be
moisturizing and priming my skin I'm
going to be moisturizing my skin with
the bodyshop vitamin E intense a
moisture cream and I'm going to be using
the natural radiance primer to make sure
my skin is nice and hydrated before
foundation then I'm going to be taking
the ex1 foundation this is the invisi
wear one and the color that I'm using is
in F 300 I'm going to be taking that
onto my skin and just dotting it
everywhere and buffing that into the
skin with my Real Techniques sculpting
brush
next I'm gonna be priming my eyes with
the Maybelline age rewind concealer I'm
just going to be blending that in with
my fingers and I'm going to be setting
that with a powder to make sure that it
doesn't move and that it stays on all
day
next time we taking the makeup geek
Vegas lights palette and I'm going to be
taking desert sands and I'm going to be
applying this into my crease first of
all to create a really nice warm crease
and taking this on a blending brush from
Sigma and I'm just going to be blending
this as thoroughly as I can
I also took creme Brule by makeup geek
also to help this color blend out a
little bit that way it just looks a
little bit more seamless and I took that
on a different fluffier blending brush
next I'm going to be taking that same
desert sands color and just buffing that
all over the lid to create a really nice
warm lid
and then on top of that we're going to
be taking makeup geeks Coco bear
eyeshadow and just patting this on top
of that desert sands color we just
wanted to really look nice and warm and
because this is a matte color you want
to Pat this on as much as you can I
wanted to create a really nice seamless
Brown effect so I make sure to apply on
the lid and also decrease as well
you
so once the eyeshadow is on I'm going to
be applying some force lashes these
lashes are from opv lash I'm just going
to be applying these on my top lash line
and just applying them with some glue
and some tweezers
we need tight lining my top lash line
and just making sure that the black
blends into the lashes this just makes
the lashes look a lot more natural
also going to be applying some mascara
as well and that way the lashes look
really natural and you can't really see
where they begin and that way they just
kind of look like they're coming from
your eyes which is exactly what we want
and then I'm taking some concealer this
is the Maybelline fit me concealer and I
wanted to create a really nice bright
under-eye effect so I'm creating a
triangle under the eyes as I usually do
and I'm also going to be applying this
on my forehead the bridge of my nose and
my chin
I'm going to be blending that into the
rest of my skin with that sculpting
brush again and I'm just going to make
sure that this looks really seamless and
there are no harsh lines anywhere so
that my face looks nice and flawless and
all the colors blend into one another by
the way I'm really sorry for the
lighting the Sun was going in and out so
that's why sometimes the lighting is
really good and then what it looks like
this that means the Sun has decided to
hide away and make my video that really
dark
I am then going to be taking aides hot
concealer brush and I'm just kind of
going into the little areas that the
larger brush can't reach and I'm just
making sure to blend in all those little
areas with that brush
I'm then just using my fingers to really
pop this into the skin I am going to be
applying another concealer so I wanted
to make sure this was really well
blended in before I done that this is
the Mac light boost highlighter pen and
I just wanted to apply this because I
wanted to create a really nice bright
under eye and I'm just going to be
patting that in again with my finger
just to make sure it looks nice and
blended and I really warm it into the
skin
next I'm going to be setting all the
areas I applied that concealer I'm going
to be using my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder you guys know this is my
favorite powder by now and I'm applying
this with my Sigma f-35 brush these two
are like a dynamic duo for me I
absolutely love the way this sets my
under eyes it just looks absolutely
flawless and it just lasts all day for
me so I just absolutely love this
combination and I'm going to be setting
in the other areas of the face also with
that same brush and then with a larger
brush I'm just going to be setting
everywhere just so that I can apply a
tiny little bit of powder just to make
sure that it looks nice and flawless and
that everywhere stays on
next I'm gonna be filling in my brows as
always I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow Wiz this is an e color dark
brown and I'm just using the spoon each
side to brush through the brows and then
I'm taking the pencil side and just
filling in my brows as I always do i do
have an in-depth eyebrow tutorial that i
have done before i will link that down
below if you guys do you want to see how
I do my brows in depth
I'm just making sure to blend that
product really well into my brows I
wanted them to look full but I didn't
want them to look too penciled on so I
wanted to brush them through a lot so
they still looked fairly natural at the
same time
and then to make sure all my brow has
stay in place I am using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills clear brow gel this is my
baby I don't know why I do without this
now I can't believe I ever did my brows
without it this without a fail keeps my
brows on for probably well over 12 hours
it doesn't even move when all of my
makeup fails this is still on point so
this is the most perfect eyebrow job
I've ever used and then just to perfect
everything a little bit more I'm taking
a concealer and just applying that
directly underneath the brow just so
they can clean everything up and
highlight at the same time then I'm
applying a black eye Kohl to my
waterline I wanted to create a really
nice soft smoky effect without applying
too much eyeshadow to the bottom
lashline so I wanted to apply mainly
black eyeliner
next I'm just going to be applying some
mascara to my bottom lash line and then
the eye look is practically complete I
just feel like the mascara on the bottom
lash line has to be done it just kind of
finishes everything off and then I'm
taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit in light and I'm taking the
color Havana and just applying this as
my bronzer I'm using this on a big
fluffy brush just to make sure that I
get all around the outer perimeter of my
face and then I'm taking the Mac contour
shade in shade star and using this to
contour my face with a Mac 168 brush and
I'm just making sure to do this in all
the areas I want to appear more sunken
in
then I'm taking Mac emphasize highlight
powder and I'm just going to be using
that to clean up my contour and also
just to brighten my undereyes a little
bit more also I absolutely love the Mac
contour and highlight powders they are
amazing I totally forgot about them to
be honest and I'm also using that shade
ster shade to contour my nose also
next time when we highlighting my skin
using my laura geller gilded honey
highlighter and i'm just applying this
on the tops of my cheekbones and also on
the tip of my nose as always i'm also
applying some of that highlights onto my
inner corner and to my brow bone this is
just going to kind of finish off the eye
look and just highlight these areas or
spoke
Oh
I'm just adding a few finishing touches
and just making sure the eyes are really
well blended and then we're going to
move on to my hair so for my hair I
didn't want to go for anything too crazy
I just wanted to straighten my hair
again my hair had actually been in
braids previously so that is why it
looks like this this is my normal cause
so I'm just applying some dry shampoo
this is the batiste dark brown dry
shampoo and I'm just gonna be sectioning
my hair
I feel like dry shampoo is a necessity
for me even when my hair isn't greasy
because I do use a lot of oil products
in my hair because my hair is quite
coarse and I feel like my hair does not
stay straight without oily products so
because I use lots of coconut oil I feel
like I need to apply dry shampoo in my
hair like twice a day pretty much so I'm
just gonna be straightening my hair I'm
using my GHD gold large straighteners
and I'm just gonna be basically going
over my hair I'm not gonna be doing it
too much because to be honest my hair
never really goes sleek straight so
don't bother too much with making it
crazy crazy straight anyway so I'm just
running over my hair to make sure I just
get all of these kinks out that were
there from the braids and I just wanted
to include this in because you guys do
often ask how I straighten my hair I
have dinner tutorial before but I just
wanted to show you guys me straighten my
hair basically
so once that's totally straight I'm
going to be moving on to my lips I'm
going to be applying Mac's tone lip
liner to my lips and I'm just going to
be kind of trying to create a cool toned
pink shade so I'm applying this all
around and then I'm going to be taking
Mac honey love lipstick and also I'm
going to be taking gerard cosmetics one
nine nine five
so I'm just patting on some of that
honey love and then I'm going to be
taking that one nine nine five shade
just to add a little bit of a pink eNOS
to it and because I wanted it to be a
little bit more matte I am taking a
translucent powder and just setting my
lips and then once that's on I just tuck
my hair behind my ears this is like my
go-to hairstyle I always do this and
next we're going to be moving on to my
outfit I wasn't sure if I was going to
put this in because the lighting wasn't
the best and stuff like that but you
guys always want to see the outfits that
I'm wearing this is a white ribbed crop
tee from Primark this was probably about
four or five pounds I love getting my
basic items from Primark I absolutely
love this top it's really nice and
figure-hugging around the chest area
feel like it doesn't hug my stomach too
much which I like my jeans I decided to
go for this pair from H&amp;amp;M these are a
light acid wash style skinny jean
for my shoes I decided to go for some
sneakers I absolutely love flat shoes I
love all types of trainers and sneakers
they are like my favorite things to wear
these ones are these black faux
snakeskin sneakers and I just absolutely
love them they have the zip detail on
either side of the shoe and I just
absolutely love these ones these shoes
are from new look I'm also wearing this
gold choker style necklace and this one
