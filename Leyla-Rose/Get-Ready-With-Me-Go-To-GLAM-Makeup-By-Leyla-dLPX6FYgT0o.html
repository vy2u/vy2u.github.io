today we are gonna be doing a get ready
with me I'm so excited because I just
love get ready with me that you pop the
camera around while I was getting ready
I went for this nice all matte eyeshadow
look if you guys do wanna see how I got
ready then just keep on watching to get
started I'm taking my natural radiance
primer from Mac and applying it all over
my skin and I am also gonna be spritzing
my skin with a bit of the mac fix+ to
hydrate my skin before foundation and
the foundation I'm using today is the
ex1 invisi wear and I'm just applying
this all over my skin and I really love
this foundation because it really gives
me a nice flawless coverage it's not too
heavy at the same time and I just really
really like it I'm applying that all
over with my Real Techniques sponge
and now beginning on the eyes I'm taking
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and applying
it all over my eyelid with my finger
this is just gonna prepare the eyes for
the shadows they're gonna be applying
I'm only gonna be using two eyeshadows
today I am taking the makeup geek creme
Brule eyeshadow and also Coco bear first
of all taking creme Brule I'm just
applying it into the crease and just
creating a nice warm crease so with this
you know just gives me a nice amount of
warmth and it does have something for
the Coco bear to blend into and the main
color is Coco bear because I really
wanted my lid to be nice and warm but I
did want it to be all matte as well so I
am taking Coco bear and applying a
little bit of this into the crease to
make sure that the lid blends really
seamlessly into the rest of the colors
and I'm just blending that really well
and then I'm gonna take that same color
on a shader brush and literally begin to
Pat it all over the lid and this color
is to die for it's absolutely stunning
and I just love the effect of an all
mapped eyelid I think it's just so
different to being shimmery and I'm just
really into matte eyeshadows at the
moment
next moving on to concealer I'm just
gonna be doing my concealer so I can
clean up the rest of my eyes and also
just to highlight the rest of my face as
well I'm applying that on to all the
areas I usually like to highlight so
under my eyes my forehead the bridge of
my nose and my chin and today I decided
to do underneath my cheekbones as well
to really bring out the contours of my
face I'm blending that in with the same
sponge that I used to apply my
foundation and just make sure that
everything looks nice and seamless and
just keep blending until all the
concealer is nice and blended in
next I'm going to be setting my face
with these soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder I'm going to be taking this on a
large powder brush and just applying it
all over my skin and then I'm gonna be
going in with some eyeliner this is
definitely the big attraction of this
look I'm gonna go for a nice big wing I
do want the line to be quite thick in
general so as you can see the wing is
actually extending out quite far almost
reaches as far out as the tail of my
brow and then I'm gonna be filling that
in so that looks nice and thick and just
do whatever I feel suits my eye shape
the best
I'm gonna be applying my favorite lashes
at the moment now as well I'm taking the
house of lashes ikonics
I love these so much I'm just applying
them onto my lid and just making sure
they're nice and adhered down these are
so stunning I think they're just such a
unique style of lash I just don't see
lashes like these anywhere so I just
love them
I'm also going to be applying some
mascara to my top lashes to make sure
that they look nice and blended into the
false ones
I'm also applying some black kohl pencil
to my waterline this will just give me a
little bit of drama without me being
smoky and I just really like applying a
black to the waterline and then I am
gonna be applying some mascara to my
bottom lashes to finish off the eye look
for my brows I decided to go for a
really natural brow I'm just running
through my brow at the moment with a bit
of the UH Nastasia clear brow gel I'm
pretty much flicking all the hairs
upwards to give them a nice bushy messy
effect and then I'm just gonna be
bronzing my skin I'm using the dark
golden mineralized skinfinish from Mac
just to give myself a nice natural
warmth around the skin applying that
with a big fluffy bronzer brush also
taking some of that on a smaller brush
to get into all the little contours as
well to highlight I'm taking me Laura
Gala gilded honey highlighter and just
applying them onto the high points of my
cheekbones and also onto the tip of my
nose as well all my brows I did feel
like they were a little bit sparse so I
went through them a little bit with the
UH Nastasia brow is in dark brown this
just will fill through any of these
sparse little gaps but I did keep this
very minimal because I wanted the brows
to be you know shaped but fluffy looking
so nothing too over-the-top
and then for my lips I decided to go for
the Kiko
retractable lip liner in my favorite
color I will leave the number down below
I think it's five before and I'm just
applying that all over the lips and then
I'm gonna be going on top of that with a
sigma lip base and this is just one of
my favorite lip combinations at the
moment I did decide to apply a little
bit of a liquid lipstick on top of that
just because it does help it to last a
little bit longer and it did lighten it
a little bit as well to finish off and
to make my makeup last all day I am
taking the L'Oreal infallible fixing
mist this is a makeup finishing spray
but it does extend the wear of your
makeup as well I'm just making sure to
shake this really well to allow the
beads to mix up the product inside and
then I am holding it twenty to thirty
centimetres away from my skin and
spraying it evenly all over to reach
every area of my face it absorbed really
quickly and it just felt really nice and
flying on the skin you guys know I
absolutely love the
I'm fallible Foundation so I'm so pumped
they came out with an infallible mist so
