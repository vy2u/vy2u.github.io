today I'm going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this glam smoky eye look
using no false lashes a look has been
requested for so long without using
false lashes so if you do want to see
how I achieved this look then just keep
on watching so I'm gonna get started off
with priming my eyes and I'm using a
concealer for this just because it's a
little bit more lighter than the primers
I usually use and I'm just blending that
in with my finger from my brow bone all
the way to my lid and then taking the
balm new tube palette I'm going to be
taking this matte Brown first of all and
we're gonna be using this as our first
color in the crease and I'm just going
to be taking this on a blending brush
quite a fluffy one so I can really blend
this color and just infuse it all over
the crease so it's nice and blended and
airbrushed looking and then taking this
dark purple shade I'm going to be using
this on a 2-1 7 Mac brush I'm just going
to be using this to build up that color
in the crease I'm going to go back and
forth between brushes to blend out the
color as much as I need to and then keep
building up the color to make sure it
looks nice and smoky in the crease
taking this dark matte brown I'm going
to be taking this with a shader brush
and just applying it to my outer V area
and I'm gonna be applying it on almost
half of my lid to really create that
lifted eye and I'm just going to be
patting it onto the lid and then
blending it out with another brush just
because this is gonna really prepare the
eyes for the black eyeshadow we're going
to be applying and it just makes
everything blend a lot easier then
taking a makeup wipe I'm just going to
be sharpening the edges of my eyeshadow
to really lift the eyes and just to give
it that nice sharp edge and then finally
taking this matte black shade I'm gonna
be taking that on the same two one seven
brush and just building this up in the
outer V to really give it that extra
smokiness you can skip the black if you
don't want it to be too intense but it
definitely does in terms of eye it's if
you really want it to be nice and smoky
definitely try and use a black taking
this shimmery brown color I'm gonna be
applying this all over the lid this is
going to create a really nice shimmery
lid look and it just kind of makes the
look look a little bit less intense and
a little bit more glam using a liner
brush I'm going to be taking more of
that matte black shade and I'm going to
be using it as an eyeliner just to give
a soft amount of definition along the
lash line and also just to smoke
everything out a little bit more next I
will be taking the l'oreal full / sculpt
mascara and i just wanted to show you
guys a close-up of this one so you could
see how just unique it is it's almost
like a comb so it really comes through
the lashes but the formula is still
really buildable so i do feel like you
can kind of build up how much volume you
really want so the more layers you do /
i do feel like you can really build a
nice amount of volume and you guys know
i rely on falsies so i definitely need a
good mascara if i'm gonna go without it
it really defines the lashes but I felt
like it also calls them a lot as well I
feel like it cold them up without
actually having to use an eyelash curler
so this is almost like an all-in-one
mascara which I always love I like how
small the inner part of the wand is so
you can really get into all the little
areas and really get to the base of the
lash
next I'm going to be applying my
foundation this is the l'oreal
infallible foundation and i'm just going
to be applying it all over my skin and
blending it in with my Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge and I'm just
blending this all over to create a nice
flawless finish just want to make sure
that it's nice and even all over the
skin next on we take in some concealer
and just using it underneath the eyes to
highlight and then I'm also going to be
applying in all the other areas I would
like to bring forward as well I'm going
to be using it onto my forehead the
bridge of my nose and onto my chin and
then to blend it in I'm gonna be using
the same sponge as I use to blend in my
foundation and I just want to make sure
that it's nice and blended into the rest
of my skin so there are no harsh lines
and everything looks nice and seamless
then I'm just going to be setting all
those areas we applied that concealer
and I'm just using my instant retouch
powder from soap &amp;amp; Glory to do this
I've gone ahead and done my eyebrows
off-camera by will link my eyebrow
tutorial down in the description box
next I'm just gonna be taking some cold
pencil and using it on my waterline to
really smoke out the bottom lash line
and then taking a fluffy blending brush
I'm going to be taking that dark purple
shade we applied in the crease and just
blending it on the bottom to really give
us that smokiness and then to really
really smoke things out I'm going to be
taking some more of that black onto this
pencil brush and push it across to the
bottom lash line also taking that black
on a liner brush the same one we use for
our liner I'm just creating a tiny
little inner corner flick on the inner
corner of our eyes and now just applying
some more of that mascara onto my bottom
lashes I love this mascara for my bottom
lashes as well because it's so small the
wand has such tiny little bristles you
can really get right to the base of your
lashes so really make sure there are no
gaps in between the lashes next I'm
going to be contouring using the NYX
contour stick and just using it on all
the areas I would like to define a
little bit more I'm applied it on this
sides of my forehead underneath my cheek
bone my jawline and also around the
contours of my nose I'm going to be
blending the end with the same sponge we
use to blend in everything else
and then to set that I'm just going to
be taking somebody mac mineralize
skinfinish in dark golden just to bronze
my skin a little bit more but also to
set the contour into place and then to
really sculpt out that contour I'm going
to be taking some loose powder and just
using it to bake underneath the contour
and then to highlight my skin I'm taking
Becca opal highlighter and just using it
onto my cheekbones and also onto the tip
of my nose as well to give me that
gorgeous glow and then I'm just dusting
away that powder using a big fluffy
powder brush for the lips I decided to
go for a nice neutral nude so that all
the focus could be on the eyes I'm using
Urban Decay's stark-naked lipliner and
then I'm gonna be taking some of this
Kiko nude lipstick and just applying it
right on top so guys that is the end of
