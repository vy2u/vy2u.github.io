showing you how to achieve this green
glitter smokey eyes I think this is
perfect for fall and I'm really excited
to be wearing this as we get into the
autumn time the first step of this look
is going to be priming my eyes as usual
as we're going to be using lots of
strong colors this is going to prep our
eyes and make sure everything stays on
and appears a lot brighter so I'm just
spreading that all over with my finger
and this is the benefit stay don't stray
I'm next going to applying this soft
brown color from the full exposure
palette by Smashbox with a really nice
big fluffy brush and I'm just going to
be blending this really really softly
into my crease
then I'm going to be taking
uninterrupted which is just going to
darken that color and make it look a lot
warmer
next I'm going to be taking a paraglide
pencil by Mac this is a really soft
pencil with glitter which is infused
within it and this is a turquoise green
color and I'm just going to be putting
this all over the lid and blending it
with my finger
next I'm going to be taking this
expresso brown color with a blending
brush and applying that deeper within
the crease this is just going to prepare
for the black that we're going to apply
and help it to blend into the other
transition colors we've applied so I'm
just going to be slowly applying this
into the outer V
and just blending everywhere next I'm
going to be taking the black color and
with a pencil brush I'm going to be
applying it into the outer V to add our
definition to the work and I'm going to
be taking this slightly above the crease
as well then I'm going to blend it out
with a blending brush and we are going
to go back and forth until we have our
desired amount of the black color
I'm then going to be applying some
liquid liner to the top of my lid and
this is just going to add some
definition to the lash line and prepare
for our lashes we're going to apply I'm
not going to be applying a wing because
it just looks quite elongated as it is
and I'm also applying a feline pencil by
Mac onto the waterline and also
underneath then I'm going to take that
same pencil we put on the lid and put it
on the bottom lash line and blend that
out
next I'm going to be taking this glam
crystals lineup by collection mm and
it's a really sort of Christmas treat
green and I'm going to be applying it on
top and this just gives it the final
touch I absolutely love the glitter and
it just brings out the whole look
so this is a really easy way of applying
glitter so I'm going to be applying on
the top lid and also the bottom lashline
as well
and I'm just gonna allow it to dry next
I'm going to be doing my skin I'm
applying my baby skin as my primer and
this is just going to add a really nice
finished look to my foundation so
instead of applying it to my bare skin
it's just going to make it look a lot
more smooth and as you can see I have
applied my lashes off-camera because
it's impossible to film while I'm doing
it so I'm going to link in the
description box my eye lash tutorial as
well next I'm going to be buffing in my
foundation with a really cheap ebay
brush which I absolutely love and I'm
going to be blending that all over the
face and as you can see it is a little
bit warmer than the rest of my face but
it matches my body so I'm just blending
that in and I really love this
foundation it's really really really
matte and ivory oily skin so it's just
amazing for that next I'm going to be
doing my eyebrows and I'm just filling
that in with my brow Zing's by benefit
and just going to be going through my
brow as usual
next I'm going to be applying my market
like boost under my eyes onto my Cupid's
bow and chin and I'm going to be
blending that out with my finger it's
just going to highlight the areas that I
want to highlight so that it can go
together really nicely with the
contouring that I'm going to be doing so
I'm just blending that in with my finger
I'm going to be setting it with this Mac
shaping powder and I'm going to be
putting that on top and that's just
going to set it and bring it out as well
and then I'm going to take this
sculpting powder by Mac and I'm going to
contour a little bit and I just want a
really really nice soft contour I don't
want anything harsh so I'm using a
bigger brush then I usually worked and
this is just going to give a softer more
diffused effect so I'm just going to be
buffing that underneath my cheekbone
then I'm going to be taking my highlight
which is a Bobby Brown shimmer brick and
I'm just going to be putting that onto
my cheekbones now I'm just lining my
lips with my usual lip liner sand beige
lip liner by NYX and I know it's really
boring now how much actually lose this
lip liner but I just love it so much if
any of you can find a different lip
liner that I can use instead of this one
please tell me cuz I need to wean myself
off it just in time just in case they
discontinued it so I'm just lining my
lips with that and I'm also going to be
applying one of my favorite lipsticks at
the moment and it's the nude one from
Gerard cosmetics it's one of my
favorites I'm getting as addicted as I
am to my lip liner so I also have a
discount code for that so definitely
check my description box to get a
discount on that lipstick and across the
whitening lightening and Gerard
cosmetics websites as you can see it's a
really nice nude with a slight peachy
undertone and it just goes really nice
with any skin tone and it's nice and
matte as well which is my favorite you
can't apply a gloss if you'd like but I
decided to keep it Matt
