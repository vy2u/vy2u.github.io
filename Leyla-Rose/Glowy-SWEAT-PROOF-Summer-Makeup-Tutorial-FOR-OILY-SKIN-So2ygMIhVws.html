so today I have a makeup tutorial and
today's is actually a skin based
tutorial I have not done a skin tutorial
in the longest so I decided to do one
today and this one is focused for the
summer especially those with an oily
skin type but if you have an almost kin
to this will work it's just super
long-lasting and it still gives you that
glow even though it's long lasting we
don't lose that gorgeous summer glow so
if you want to see how I go from this to
this and then just keep on watching ok
guys so I started off with absolutely
nothing on my skin just a delight to the
moisturizer and we're gonna be going in
first of all with a moisturizing primer
I personally believe that the key to a
flawless base is definitely the way that
you prep it so of course my skin is
cleansed and moisturize with a light
moisturizer and I do want to make sure
as well that I'm going in with some kind
of moisturizing primer I really like
this one for makeup forever because it's
moisturizing but it's lightweight at the
same time and that's definitely what you
want in the summer of course you can go
for something SPF as well if you know
you're gonna be out in the sunshine I
would recommend wearing SPF anyway but I
would definitely also recommend going in
really hard with the priming as well
when it comes to pore filling and
mattifying so I'm actually using two
primers for this the first one being
this matte primer from Benefit and this
one it's gonna help to mattify the skin
it goes on like a gel and it kind of
dries a little bit but it doesn't dry
your skin out it kind of almost goes a
little bit tacky and I really like this
primer but then I also like to go on top
of that with the benefit Porefessional
primer as well just to fill in the pores
and I'm actually quite careful not to
use too much of a pore filling primer
because it's silicone based too much of
it could kind of make makeup slip off
your face so I like to make sure that I
apply this mattifying one all over let
it dry and then I go in with a little
bit of a pore filling prime I'm also
actually quite careful with the areas
that I've put this in I like to focus
this on my forehead on my nose and also
on my cheeks because those are the main
areas where I tend to get open pores and
I need a little bit of smoothing I don't
apply this in I guess all over my skin I
like to be very specific when it comes
to pore filling prime
I find that when applying products
especially in the summer you want to
keep each layer as thin as possible so
when it comes to color correcting this
is necessary for me so that I don't have
to apply too much foundation and the
color corrector that I'm using is from
YSL and this one is actually super
lightweight and very thin so it's
perfect for the summer time because it
kind of takes care of the redness but it
really doesn't leave too much residue on
my skin and that is absolutely perfect
and exactly what I want so I'm just
using a kabuki brush that I use for my
foundation and I'm just using that to
buff that into my skin so once my
redness is taken care of I really want
to make sure that my skin stays matte
I'm one of the best techniques that I
know of is to apply a small amount of
powder not too much I know it doesn't
look small but using a wet sponge I'm
pressing this onto my skin before I
apply my foundation I did a video on
this quite a while ago I went too much
with the powder and it looked really dry
but I do this sometimes especially if I
know I'm gonna be in heat or if I'm
gonna be wearing my makeup for a long
time and a small amount of translucent
powder underneath your foundation goes a
really long way and it really helped so
once I've applied some powder onto my
skin only on the areas where I feel like
it's gonna get oily I'm going in with
one of my homegirl foundations and this
is the fenty Beauty foundation I really
like it I stopped using it for a while
because I thought it was breaking me out
but it turns out that it wasn't I just
was breaking out anyway so I'm using a
Beauty Blender to blend this into my
skin the reason why I'm using a Beauty
Blender is because like I said
especially when you know you're going to
be in heat the less product you use the
better and a beauty blender helps to
pick up all of the excess product so I'm
applying this foundation which has great
coverage anyway but allowing the Beauty
Blender to pick up all of the excess
product so that technically that isn't a
lot of product on my skin so I'm just
dotting the product all over my skin and
as you can see as I'm bouncing it onto
my skin you can actually still see my
skin coming through and that is exactly
what I want I want to blend in that
foundation so that my skin looks as even
as possible and if I can still see
little bits coming through I can go in
with a little bit of a concealer this is
the Urban Decay all nighter concealer
which as you guys know is a
really long-lasting concealer and I can
just dot this only on the areas that we
need it because if I'm just piling on
too much foundation all over my skin
it's more likely that it's gonna look
cakey and when I get warm or if I start
to sweat or anything like that
it's going to melt off my skin but if
we're keeping the amount of product
you're applying on our skin quite
minimal then it means that it's less
likely to look super cakey and like it
just won't be as easy for this for it to
melt your skin basically so I like to
make sure that my under eyes still look
a nice and bright because I find that
this makes you look super flawless so I
do like to make sure that you use long
lasting concealers so the ones I'm using
are from Laura Mercier and Urban Decay
and they're both known to be really
long-lasting so I'm mixing those
together and using my Beauty Blender to
blend that in on my under eye area and I
really like a nice bright under eye and
that doesn't change just because I may
not be wearing as much foundation as I
would be if it wasn't as warm I still
feel like I can get a same effect by
applying concealer under the eyes you
just want to make sure that you're
setting it correctly so the way that I
like to make sure that my under eyes are
set correctly is making sure that of
course it's all blended in correctly
with the Beauty Blender but then going
in afterwards and using my fingers to
blend it out and pick up any excess
product and make sure there are no lines
before I set it I'm going in with this
pressed powder - first of all just
really ensure that that under-eye area
is set you can go ahead and bake your
under eyes but personally for me I find
that this accentuates my lines a lot so
I'd like to try and avoid to do this I
only like to bake other areas of my face
when it's warm I'd prefer to leave my
under eyes just because mine can get
quite dry but you can do this if it
helps I'm going in with that same RCM a
powder and just using this on the areas
where I get oily only I don't apply this
all over my face I'm just using it as
you can see I've got really skin so it
gets oily in many places but I like to
focus this mainly on my forehead my
cheeks my nose and that's pretty much it
I think I go on my chin as well I mean
with chin look the oil is but it can't
do and I'm gonna leave it there for five
minutes and dust all of the excess
powder away this is just gonna lock in
all of the hard work that we've just
done
only thing I've got to say though if you
have dry skin don't do this if you do
this your skin is going to look dry
especially with all the other steps that
we took that's why that this routine
definitely is more suited for an oily to
normal skin type so be aware if you get
any dry skin - maybe not do this so now
that my skin is all matte and I know
it's gonna last a really long time I
want to make sure that I give that glow
to my skin so I'm using England revised
skin finish from Mac to bronze my skin
and this is really nice because it's not
totally matte it's not shiny but it's
not matte at the same time so it's
actually super skin like and this color
is really nice and bronzy so I used it
in all the areas to kind of still in my
face and give it some shape and then I'm
going on top with some pixie glow mists
to give some glow into my skin but firt
not actually to affect the longevity of
that it's gonna last so I'm just gonna
go and apply my eyebrows on my lip color
I'll leave a tutorial for my eyebrows
right up in the eye now and it will sit
down below and I'm just using a blush
from benefit and using this on the
apples of my cheeks just to give it a
little bit of color and then I'm going
in with a liquid illuminizer from NYX on
the tops of my cheekbones and then I'll
be going on top of it with a powder one
just because when you want to have that
glow it's better for me personally
especially for oily skin to create that
glow artificially so I'm using a liquid
illuminizer that I know dries and then
going on top of it where they powdered
illuminizer so your skin looks buttery
and glowy but it's technically matte and
it's gonna last all night which is
amazing and I'm going in with the powder
illuminizer which is from Anastacio
Beverly Hills and just using that on
other high points of my face so on the
inner corners on tip of my nose under my
brow bone just all the areas that I
really want it to pop when the sunlight
hits my face so guys that is basically
the end of this tutorial
I just want to lock everything in using
some slick spray from Urban Decay this
is an oil control one you can use an
all-nighter one any Sainsbury that works
for you just going ahead and lock it all
in and that is the end of this skin
