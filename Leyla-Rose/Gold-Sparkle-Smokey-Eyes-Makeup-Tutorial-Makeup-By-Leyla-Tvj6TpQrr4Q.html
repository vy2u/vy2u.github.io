today's makeup tutorial is going to be
this sparkly gold smokey eye look
so to get started as always I'm gonna be
taking my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
and be applying this all over my eyes
with my zoeva one for two brush and this
is just gonna spread the product nice
and evenly all over the lid to make sure
it's nice and even and it covers up all
of our natural pigmentation on our lids
for the eyeshadow today I'm gonna be
taking the makeup geek of Vegas lights
palette and I'm gonna be taking this
matte Brown with a little bit of a
yellow undertone shade and I'm gonna be
applying this as our first crease color
and we're just gonna be blending this
into the crease with a blending brush
making sure that it blends really
perfectly before like it's not blending
out just go in with a lighter brown and
just use it to kind of blend out that
shade but I just used it alone and just
make sure that it's nice and pigmented
so go over it as many times as you need
to to make this color really stand out
and then from that same palette I'm
gonna take the color platter Bing and
that's basically this really dark brown
it kind of almost looks like a blackish
Brown and I'm gonna be applying this
into the crease and don't really mind if
it gets onto my lids so you don't really
need to be too neat about this but I
don't want it to go too high up so I'm
going to be using that blending brush
that we use to apply the first shade
just to make sure that everything is
blending really nicely and yeah like I
said don't worry if it gets onto the lip
because we are gonna be covering that up
with some eyeshadow and get that so just
make sure to blend that as well as you
can going back and forth as many times
as possible
next I'm going to be taking this nyx
pearl mania pigment in this brown shade
and i'm just gonna be applying this as a
base for the glitter that we're going to
be applying this is just gonna give that
gold glitter a little bit of a bronzey
effect otherwise I find that the gold
glitter looks too pale on its own and
then I'm also just gonna be taking some
makeup remover on to a q-tip and just
use it to create a nice sharp point on
the corner of my eye and then I'm taking
the Mack reflex gold glitter and wetting
my brush with a little bit of mac fix+
just so that it's something for the
glitter to adhere to and I'm just gonna
be patting it on to the eye and then
once it's Pat I'm just gonna be sort of
spreading it over so it's a nice even
coverage all over the moon and I'm also
just going on top of that with a
blending brush just to make sure I get
all of the sort of left over glitter
particles taken off then I'm just
applying some mascara and my false
lashes today I decided to go for some
really thick false lashes and these are
a mixture of two oiler lashes and I will
put you names of them it down in the
bottom bar along with the rest of the
products as I always do so I'm just
applying my lashes and to make sure that
my lashes blend in with the rest of my
eye and making sure to apply some
eyeliner if necessary
I like to apply eyeliner on the inner
corner of my eye just to make the lashes
look a little bit more natural so it
just kind of makes the lash look like it
kind of blends into your eye a little
bit better
next I'm going to get started with my
face and I'm using the matte natural
radiance primer and I'm just going to be
applying this all over my face to
hydrate and prep it before we apply
foundation
and then for my foundation I'm gonna be
taking the laura mercier soup cream
foundation i love this foundation it's
absolutely perfect for a full coverage
and it just covers everything and it's
just so good when you want to look
absolutely flawless so I'm just applying
this with a damp Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge and I'm just making
sure to blend that in as evenly as I can
into my skin just so that I can cover up
all of my redness and all of the areas
that I need to cover up
to highlight I'm going to be using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm
going to be applying this under my eyes
onto my forehead down the bridge of my
nose and also onto my chair
and then I'm also gonna be blending that
in with the same sponge to make it look
nice and seamless and it looks nice and
blended with no harsh lines to get into
all the little areas as always I'm using
my Sigma 3d HD precision brush this is
my Holy Grail
concealer brush I just love it it's the
most perfect shave in the entire world I
love it
and then to set the areas where I
applied that concealer I'm just going to
be using the soap and glory instant
retouch powder and I'm just applying it
again with the same sponge just you
bounce that on top of the foundation and
this will just give it a really nice
matte finish this powder is translucent
and it just gives a really nice soft
matte to finish to the skin
and it really sets things really well so
I do really love this powder and then to
bronze up my skin I'm gonna be using the
mineralized skinfinish in dark golden
this is becoming one of my favorite
bronzers just because it's the perfect
shade for all their skin it's not too
orange but it's also not too Brown it
gives you just enough warmth whilst it's
not looking too orange at the same time
which is perfect so I just apply that
all onto the outer perimeter of my skin
and then I'm gonna be moving on to my
eyebrows and for this I'm going to be
using the brow archery pencil from soap
&amp;amp; Glory I've absolutely been loving this
pencil it's really really good I like
that it has a spoolie on the other side
of the pencil just like the anastasiya
one it's a little bit harder in
consistency it's not as waxy as the
anastasiya but it is really good and
especially because you can find out the
drugstore
it's amazing definitely the best
drugstore brow pencil on the market
and I'm also just gonna be hiding under
my brows just to give it a little bit
extra definition and to also highlight
my brow bone also
then to finish off the eyes I'm gonna be
taking a black kohl pencil I'm just
gonna be running that through my
waterline and also be applying it
underneath my lash line for some extra
smokiness when we apply this underneath
the lash line we are going to be smoking
out with some eye shadow so you don't
need to be too neat which is really
great and then I'm taking a really flat
definer brush this one is from Mac and
I'm just gonna be using that to really
blend into the lash line and to make the
bottom lash line look nice and smoky and
then to finish off just gonna be
applying some mascara to my bottom
lashes then to finish off the skin I'm
gonna be highlighting my cheekbones with
my Becca opal highlighter and then for
the lips I decided to go for a
completely matte lip I was gonna go for
more of a glossy one but when I applied
this lip liner all over the lips I just
thought it was the most perfect color
so I decided to leave it at that and
this is just a Kiko retractable lip
liner and it's just the most perfect
peachy color alone I didn't apply any
lipstick on top of this and it's
definitely a gorgeous color I've been
wearing this a lot recently so that is
why I ended up doing for the lips that
is the end of this look guys I hope that
