so today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial and it is this one right here I
asked you guys on Twitter which you guys
should go and follow me on there because
I feel like that and snapchat and
Instagram is up just go follow me on all
of them it tends to ask you guys on
social media what makeup look you want
to see first
and this is the one that you guys
basically voted for on Twitter you can
do polls so virtually all you got to do
is click the option and it gives me the
percentage of the top one basically I
mean that's how a pot works right what
does it go for something that I haven't
done before I mean I've done a bronzy
gold eye looks before but nothing on
this smoked level it is super smoky it
is so blown out and gorgeous and I love
this kind of makeup look you guys did
tell me in my last makeup tutorial that
you wanted to see more dramatic stuff so
I thought I would just go out and do
this this is just like it's just
everything it really is everything yeah
this is the makeup look that I came up
with and I love it and I hope you guys
love it as well so if you do wanna see
how I achieved this makeup look then
just keep on watching to start off with
I'm gonna be priming my skin with the
Too Faced hangover primer this is one of
my favorite primers ever is so hydrating
and it's just kind of plumped the skin
ready for foundation and I'm also using
the one heck of a block primer from soap
&amp;amp; Glory just to apply this onto all of
the areas that are a little bit uneven
in texture this will just kind of smooth
everything over and make everything look
nice and smooth for my foundation I'm
taking me to Faced Born This Way
Foundation and mixing in some of the
bodyshop bronze honey drops these are so
gorgeous
it makes your foundation look so nice
and bronzy so I knew it was perfect for
this makeup look I'm just applying this
all over and I'm going to be blending
that in with my Beauty Blender
next I'm just going to be taking some
concealer and applying it onto my
eyelids just to cancel out any of the
eyes and that true tones and also to
make the colors we apply on the lids pop
a little bit more and yet just make it
stick and blend a lot better to the
palate I'm using today is the morphe 35o
palette and I'm just taking this
beautiful warm brown shade and I'm gonna
start off by applying this into the
crease now the way that I'm actually
applying this is a little bit
differently compared to how I usually
tend to do eyeshadow I'm taking it a lot
higher than I normally would it just
because I wanted it to be really blown
out you really want to be able to see
this color poking through all the other
darker colors were applying and I'm also
taking it into the inner corner right
where my inner part my brow is just
because I do want to make sure that it
looks nice and blown out I am then gonna
be taking these two colors from the
morphe 35o palette is this fun orange
shade and also this ready brown shade
and I'm gonna be mixing them together
and applying that into the deeper part
of my crease I don't really want to go
for anything too super super neat
because the way that I'm kind of
blending them is just making sure that
it looks like a nice transition but it
doesn't have to look super neat at the
same time so just making sure that it
looks nice and blended before I move on
the next car I'm taking is this dark
brown and we're gonna be applying that
again into that deeper part of the
crease and around the out of the area to
really extend the eyes outwards and of
course it wouldn't be a smoky work
without applying a matte black so I'm
just taking corrupt from makeup geek and
applying this with a pencil brush onto
my outer corner I'm really sorry my
camera went a little bit out of focus at
this point but I'm just applying as you
can see into that outer area of the eye
and it's really gonna extend outwards
and really give it that smokiness and
then I'm also gonna be taking this a
beautiful gold shade from the palette
also and I'm just gonna be passing this
onto the lid and just swiping it all
over this color is to die for it's so
pigmented and it almost has a foiled
effect so I love this for my lashes I'm
gonna be taking me certified halo lashes
these are to die for these are so
gorgeous you're gonna see in a sec how
they look on the eye
they also
so wispy and gorgeous and I'm obsessed
so I'm just applying them onto my lash
line just to give my eyes to more
definition and I actually decided to
skip the eyeliner today so if you want
to apply some eyeliner go ahead but I
wanted this look to be so different what
I usually tend to do so yeah I skip the
eyeliner I'm just applying some mascara
to blend my natural lashes into the
false ones and yeah that's pretty much
that and I'm gonna move on to the skin
I'm just applying some concealer onto
the high points of my face and blending
the in with my Beauty Blender and I'm
just gonna make sure to set that as well
just because although I do want to go
for a slightly jewy look my skin is
quite oily sorry I'm gonna be setting it
I'm using the Too Faced primed and
poreless powder today I know right I've
skipped the powder I always use if you
watch me all the time you know I'm
talking about and I'm gonna be doing my
eyebrows off camera because you've seen
me do them about a thousand times but
I'll link the tutorial down below for my
bronzer I'm taking the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer in dark
chocolate I just realized how many
two-faced products I've actually used in
this tutorial
that was totally unintentional I swear I
just bronzed in all the typical areas
around the cheekbones and the forehead
just to give myself a little bit more of
that bronzy skin complexion and then I'm
also mixing my Anastacio glow key and
the so Hollywood illuminator to really
give a nice glow on the tops of the
cheekbones I'm also gonna be applying
this on the top of my eyebrows as well
so that when I turn to the side that
whole kind of cheekbone and just above
the eyebrow just goes really nicely I
love doing this because it looks so nice
and healthy and I'm gonna be finishing
off the eyes now I'm just taking some
coal pencil I'm running it's onto my
waterline and also below the lash line
as well I'm blending them out with a
pencil brush and some black eye shadow
and then I'm gonna be taking some brown
eyeshadow and just really blowing this
out this is what really makes this look
really different because I don't usually
take it down this far but I'm really
blowing this out and really smoking out
that bottom lash line and of course as
always I'm going to be applying a little
bit more black and applying some mascara
to finish off that look and because I
really wanted this look to look nice and
glowy I'm also going to be applying some
of that highlight I applied to my
cheekbones and I'm applying it to the
inner corner and also onto my brow bone
also which isn't something I always tend
to do but I feel like it really pulled
this look together
and then finally for the lips I am going
around the outer part of my lips using
the Gerard cosmetics underground lip
liner is like a cool turned gray and
then I'm applying at some of the la
splash liquid lipstick in this beautiful
really pale nude shade I wanted the lips
to be kind of that non-existent nude and
I'm going to be applying a gloss on top
as well because I thought would be
really nice and summery and yeah you can
go for a darker nude but I really wanted
this to look nice and sheer but really
nude at the same time so yeah this is
the kind of lips I went for but you can
kind of dressup the lip and go for many
different lip color so guys that is like
finished look I really hope you like it
