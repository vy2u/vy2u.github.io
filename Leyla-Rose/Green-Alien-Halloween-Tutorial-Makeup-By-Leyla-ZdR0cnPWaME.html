you how to get this Halloween tutorial
of the green alien this is something I
created by myself I didn't copy anything
I just made it as I went so the first
step that I did was applied my makeup
from a flash palette and I mixed
together the green color the white color
and a little bit of the turquoise so I'm
just buffing that into my skin or
applying it should I say with a
foundation brush the brushes that I'm
using a fairly cheap because the makeup
from a flash palette is quite a thick
formula so I didn't want to ruin any of
my expensive brushes so I'm just using a
random brush I bought from eBay so I'm
just spreading this all over my face and
neck making sure to make it look nice
and opaque we don't want it to look
patchy we want to make sure that it
spread it really nice and evenly all
over so I'm making sure I'm taking lots
of time to do this
next I'm putting the whites color from
the makeup forever flash palette and I'm
we're going to be doing some very heavy
duty highlighting so I'm going to be
highlighting and contouring quite
dramatically to make the structure of
the face look really sci-fi ish who can
look really structured so I'm doing a
really big triangle under the eye with a
pure white and I'm just blending that in
bite with patting motions and I'm just
taking that as far to the eye as
possible and I'm also taking that color
onto my eyelid
Amen just gonna further blend that in
with my finger just to make sure that
it's nice and seamless
next time when you taking this pure
white eyeshadow from my sleek matte
palette I think it's the bright one and
I'm gonna be just patting that on top of
the white highlight that we just applied
I literally want this to be the most
dramatic thing ever because it needs to
tie in at the very heavy contouring that
we're gonna be doing afterwards so I'm
just applying that with a big Brush and
then I go in with a smaller fluffy brush
just to concentrate it and to make sure
that I pack on more of that white
because I want it to stand out a lot so
I'm just very juggling with small
brushing motions just applying that
color on top of the greasepaint so it's
nice to set it under the eyes as well
otherwise it does a crease so I'm just
setting that
next I'm just going to be highlighting
my nose I want to create the effect of a
slimmer nose and something that looks
less human so I'm going to be
highlighting the bridge of the nose and
making it appear a lot slimmer than what
my nose actually is so I'm just going to
be applying it onto the bridge and
blending that in with my finger
next I'm going to be taking the same
brush and I'm taking the green color
from the flash palette and I'm just
going to be contouring the sides of my
nose so this is meant to look really
really dramatic I don't want it to be
completely blended in because we want
the effect to show a lot so I'm just
taking the lines down to each side of
the nose and I'm just taking it slightly
underneath as well I'm patting that in
with my finger and then I'm going to go
over the after with a green eyeshadow
first of all I just want to apply some
of that white matte eyeshadow onto the
bridge of the nose just to set that
color and to make it stand out a little
bit more
then I'm just gonna be going over the
sides of the nose this is just gonna
make the contouring look a little bit
more dramatic next I'm really gonna be
taking this green color with a fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna be blending
this all together with the greasepaint
that we put on on the sides of the nose
this is just gonna make sure that it
looks more blended out and diffused
rather than a very very harsh line even
though we do still want it to look quite
harsh
so as you can see I just went around the
hole of the nose and next I'm just
filling in my eyebrows so the way that I
sort of wanted to star my eyebrows was
as if a sort of messy bushy brow and I'm
just taking that same green color that I
applied as the contour through my
eyebrows and I'm just flicking it in
upward motions to create the effect of
green hair then I'm just filling in the
arch of my brow
next I'm just flicking up some black
eyeshadow and that's just gonna make it
look like a more of a deeper green
because before it was quite bright so
I'm just flicking that through
and this adding two different tones of
hair makes it look more like real hair
so that's after I've just sort of filled
it in a little bit more next I'm going
to be contouring with that dark green
and I'm just going to be applying it
with the brush that I used to apply my
highlights and I'm just focusing it
under the cheekbone and then I'm going
to take it around the whole perimeter of
the face just to do a bit of shading
next I'm going to be putting that matte
white onto the lid of my eye and then
I'm going to be drawing a dramatic cut
crease so this is just gonna give the
effect of more of a larger eye shape I'm
also going to be applying the black eye
shadow for the crease and I'm just going
to take it above my natural crease and
I'm going to wing it
out past my eye and for this I'm using a
angled brush just dragging that out
towards the edge of my eyebrow
and then just bring me the inner corner
down with a nova
then I just went back over that white
just to fill up to the line and that
just gives the appearance of vaporizer I
next I applied my liquid liner
off-camera I just did a winged liner and
it pulls the whole thing together then
I'm just applying some NYX glitter
liners on the white part of the
eyeshadow that I just put on and this is
just going to reflect the light a little
bit and make it look a little bit more
mystical so I applied a white color and
then I'm also going to apply a silver
color as well it's just nice to add two
tones because I think it just looks
really nice this is obviously optional
you can keep it matte but I think it
just looked to get looked really nice in
person so if you actually are going to
be wearing this look for a first dress
or something like that it's nice to put
on a little bit of glitter so I think it
looked really really nice
I also went ahead and put my lashes on
off-camera these are really really heavy
lashes I put two together and I will
write down what I used in the
description box below
everything will be listed down below now
I'm just putting on the NYX jumbo liner
in milk on the waterline I'm also
dragging it underneath quite a bit to
make my eyes look a lot wider and larger
and I'm also making sure to get it all
over my bottom lashes as well because we
want to create the appearance of that my
eye is a lot bigger than what actually
is next I'm going to be highlighting my
cheekbones to make them stand out a lot
more with a very light silver eye shadow
now I am just filling in my lips with
feline pencil by Mac and this is just to
line the lips and to act as a base and
I'm also going to be over drawing my
lips a fair amount just to make the look
and on top of that I'm going to be using
my Velveteen by Lime Crime in I've
forgotten the color black velvet is it
I don't know why this bit is blurred out
so I'm sorry that the camera went a
little bit blood but this is the part
where I apply some of the dots on the
face just to make it look a little bit
more tribal like I don't know I mean I
just imagine that aliens will have
markings on their face I don't know and
it just made it look a little bit more
artificial so you can't go without by
just I really like the effect of this so
I was really happy I done it so I just
applied it down the bridge of my nose
with the end of a thin brush and this
was using the white greasepaint from the
makeup forever flash palette and I just
basically applied it in round in areas
like on the top of my cheekbones over my
eyebrows and on my chin and what I'm
doing now is just drawing a black line
underneath that jumbo pencil to make as
if my eye is a lot larger then I just
went ahead and did some black dots as
well and this just created the nice
contrast so that it's white and black
not just white
so guys that is the end of this tutorial
