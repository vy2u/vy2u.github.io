going to be showing you this great
makeup tutorial as it's still winter I
thought we'd take some cool colors
before we hit spring so the first step
is going to be applying my eye primer as
usual I'm applying my soft ochre Paint
Pot from Mac and my eyes are a little
bit dry at the moment so I made sure to
moisturize my eyes before I applied it
just because it makes it go on a little
bit more smoothly yeah I don't want my
eyes are dry it must be because of the
cold weather so hopefully it will stop
being dry after it gets a little bit
warmer so I'm gonna be taking this eye
shadow from Mac this is a matte gray
color and I'm gonna be using it as my
transition shade and I'm gonna be
applying it into my crease and just
blending it upwards and I'm using a Tom
Ford blending brush and this is a really
nice brush because it just helps to
blend everything upwards because it's
kind of got a little bit more of a
tapered end so I'm just using a
windshield wiper motions and just going
side to side just making sure that color
looks as blended as possible
then I'm gonna be taking this slightly
darker gray from the Smashbox full
exposure palette and I'm gonna be taking
a fluffier more densely packed brush and
applying this into my outer corner
because we're gonna be applying a
slightly darker color we just want to
prepare that and make sure that that's
all blended so that we can apply the
darker color so I'm going back into my
other brush and just blending it out
further then I'm taking the black from
that palette then I'm just gonna be
taking a fluffy brush to blend that out
and then I'm gonna be going back into
the other blending brush to blend that
out further I'm just gonna go back into
that black one more time and create a
almost half cut crease I don't want it
to be anything too harsh so I'm just
kind of drawing a line just above my
crease and then just blending it out
with d-21 7 brush from Mac you just want
to make sure that's fully blended
outwards and that it has a nice clean
edge as well so I'm just taking some
makeup remover on a cotton pad just to
make it look nice and sharp then I am
blending out the edges with that
blending brush that we used out on the
first transition color then I'm gonna be
taking this a light shimmery silver
color and applying it onto our lid and
it's just gonna act as our lid color and
this acts really nice as a soft
watercolor
then I'm just gonna be applying my
eyeliner
I wanted the line on the eye to connect
to the fleck a lot more straighter
instead of it dipping inwards so you'll
see what I'm doing in a sac so I'm just
creating my normal wing as I usually
worked and instead of making like that
kind of Fleck I'm just gonna create a
thicker end on the outer corner and what
I like to do is just gradually build
thickness and that way you can make sure
that you get it even to the other one
next I'm gonna be taking my 48 lashes by
red cherry and these are just nice and
natural but they still give you a little
bit of definition and I'm just applying
them as close to the lash line as
possible and then I'm going to be taking
a mixed retractable eyeliner
and then I'm applying it on two of my
lashline and just underneath my eye then
I'm gonna blend that out with a small
brush and that transition shade that we
used first just to blend that outwards
then we're going to take a silver
glittery liquid liner and just apply a
little bit on to the inner corner and
then I'm will be applying my mascara
onto my bottom lashes
then I'm gonna be doing my foundation
I'm using my giorgio armani luminous
silk foundation and just applying that
all over my face with a angled kabuki
brush by Sigma
then I'm applying my Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm gonna be blending that
in with a real techniques brush
then I'm gonna be powdering my skin to
make sure that my skin stays nice and
matte
then I'm going to be doing my eyebrows
like I've said before in a couple of my
previous videos my eyebrows are growing
out at the moment so I'm just trying to
do the best as I can so I'm just
flicking my hairs through to make sure
that they stay in place and then I'm
going to be filling them in as well
because I don't want them to be too
sharp I'm using my brow bar to go and
I'm just going to be brushing that
through and just training in more solid
shape
then I'm gonna be bronzing my skin with
my Bobbi Brown bronzer as usual I love
this bronze out so much it's just the
perfect tone for my skin and it just
bronze is my skin just enough without
looking too orange so I love this one
then I'm going to be highlighting my
skin with my opal highlight by Becca I'm
just applying a very very small amount
of em next I'm going to be showing you
two different lip options that you can
try depending on whether you like it to
be a little bit more bold or a little
bit more soft like me so the first one
is going to be the bold lip option and
this is the more grey and matte lip
color so I'm gonna be lining my lips
with stone a lip pencil from Mac and I'm
just lining my lips with it and also
filling in my lips as well and I applied
a lip balm underneath because I'm going
to be using Taylor gray Paint Pot from
Mac and this can be quite drying so you
want to make sure your lips are hydrated
and I'm just basically gonna apply this
all over my lips with my finger and this
dries to a matte finish to create a gray
matte lipstick and it is absolutely
gorgeous and extremely long wearing so
if you like a bold lip color this is for
you and I'm also gonna show you another
option I'm showing you a blankety
lipstick with stone lip liner also both
from Mac so I hope that you guys enjoyed
