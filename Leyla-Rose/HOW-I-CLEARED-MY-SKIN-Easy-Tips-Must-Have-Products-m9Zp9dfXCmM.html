channel so today I am doing a very
different type of video I don't think
I've ever sat down and done such a
chilled type of video but I wanted this
to feel very natural so I'm kind of just
wearing my chill clothes got my hair
tied up and I'm also wearing very
minimal makeup as well so you guys could
see my skin because today's video theme
is all about skin and I'm basically
going to be explaining what I've done in
my life to transform my skin into what
it is now I wouldn't say my skin is
exactly where I want it to be yet but
I'd say that I have transformed it so
much compared to around last year if you
have been following me for quite some
time you would have seen that my skin
used to be pretty bad my skin has always
been a little bit of a rollercoaster
like sometimes it'd be really good
sometimes it'll be bad sometimes good
sometimes bad which i think is very
normal but nowadays I feel like I have
more good skin days than I do bad skin
days which I was not used to whatsoever
nowadays my skin will kind of break out
more so if I am coming around my
hormonal time so around my womanly time
of the month of course that's totally
normal cuz that's hormones and that's
something often we can't control and
only if I go against any of the rules
that I'm going to tell you so pretty
much I feel like in my life I have got
my skin under control I haven't taken
any medication I haven't done anything
out of the ordinary that you guys can't
also apply to your lives which is why I
wanted to share with you if you didn't
follow me from a long time ago and
you're relatively new to my channel you
don't know what my skin used to be like
I used to suffer with a lot of actual
breakouts I had a lot of bumps under my
skin especially on my forehead and my
cheeks and yeah I just suffered with a
lot of actual spots so I would get the
actual red blistery spots which were
really painful and then I would also get
go out heads which you could squeeze and
of course stuff would come out and then
there would also be deep deep spots
underneath the skin which was almost
like clogged pores that you couldn't
push it was like covered in layers of
skin and it would just create bumps all
over and it was just yet not palpable
you couldn't do anything about it it was
something that
to change overtime and basically I don't
really have much of that at all now if
you guys look at my skin at now you'll
be able to see that pretty much my skin
is relatively clear I still have quite a
bit of scarring which is totally normal
especially after suffering with
breakouts was so long you're going to
have some scarring and for me I don't
really do anything to deal with the
scarring I had don't use any special
mixtures to sort of fade them I just
don't touch my skin anymore I try metal
pop spots and I'm just allowing my skin
to regenerate on its own because I do
feel like relatively slowly my skin is
getting better and better first two
points are kind of a given the first one
I just think I need to talk about this
straight away because it was such a
massive one for me and that was diet and
lifestyle now something that's really
important I want you guys to know is
that everyone is not the same the first
that I've cut out and the foods that
I've noticed have triggered my skin to
get worse may not necessarily be the
same for you many different people and
so many different combinations of food
and drink and so many different
lifestyles there's not going to be one
quick fix of just cutting out a certain
product and that will work for you but
the triggers that I noticed in my life
were dairy red meat and generally sugary
products way that dairy works it has a
little hormones in it its main use is to
of course grow a baby cow into a massive
cow within the space of like six months
to a year so obviously there's a lot of
hormones in there that's going to help
grow a cow do you need to imagine how
that could potentially deal with bad
skin if skin issues can often be caused
by hormones often stuff that we can't
deal with so for me I felt like just by
cutting out dairy it made a massive
difference because I did feel like mine
was mainly hormonal people used to say
to me why don't you clean your skin more
you're not even good enough care of your
skin and I was I was taking such good
care of my skin and nothing was working
and I definitely feel like my lifestyle
had a massive massive massive impact on
it so dairy was a massive one and red
meat as well has a lot of hormones in it
it's the same kind of thing and also red
meat too much of it isn't good for you
either so I cut that out a lot like I
don't have red meat often at all now and
I also do cut out sugar if and when
possible I love sugar
of course lots of people love sugar
sugar is not good for you anyway of
course I noticed for me I have a massive
impact on my skin so yes
sugary drinks are definitely a no I just
like their the wise things
chocolate chocolate just breaks me out
it's crazy I don't know what is within
it the sugar the mixture of that of the
coca I don't know but it definitely
breaks me out and yeah just generally
very sugary products I will tend to stay
away from as much as possible
they were my connections with food and I
definitely noticed as well the more
exercise I was doing my skin improved
but only when I had a good diet so it
was everything kind of combined it was
like having a nice clean diet with none
of the things that triggered me off
having a really nice amount of fruits
and vegetables fruit is like my favorite
thing ever and that's my favorite source
of sugar because I just feel like it's
satisfied so I like to have a lot of
fresh fruit I also of course comes to my
second point drink a lot of water
drinking a lot of water is so important
so so important now I can't stress that
enough and I don't talk about for too
long because I feel like a lot of people
talk about this and you know how much
more you should be drinking if not do
some research roughly it's about eight
cups a day but it depends on how large
your body is depends on your lifestyle
it all does depend on you I just try and
drink as much as I can in a day it's the
third thing was definitely something
that I felt like I had to discover for
myself I did not see this anywhere I
didn't read it I didn't think that's a
good idea let me try this it just became
a thing where I just tried it and it
worked and that was that I realized that
my skin has memory now honey a bit like
what my skin definitely gets used to
products very easily so whereas some
people could stick with the same
cleanser the same moisturizer the same
toner the same serum and it'll be
totally fine my skin gets used to things
very very easily and I notice that if I
was using a cleanser for example and I
was using every single day for a whole
month my skin would get used to it and
the whole benefits of that cleanser
wouldn't really work as well as they did
when I initially started using it so I
noticed that I liked to swap and change
my skincare products as much as possible
because I felt that it kind of
my skin on its toes and that way I just
felt that my skin never really got used
to a product so every single time I used
it the pure benefits of the product of
why I obviously bought it and why I'm
using it is actually going to affect my
skin in the most positive way so if you
feel like you used a product and at the
beginning it was really really working
now you're like it doesn't work anymore
just feels like it's not doing anything
try finding another cleanser or another
moisturizer or something else try
swapping between the two so for example
what I like to do is use a cleanser for
about three days and then change it and
use another cleanser for about three
days and then if I have another one I
can use another one for two days and
then go back to that initial one and
just kind of keep my skin on its toes
it's never getting used to something
and also depending on how my skin feels
that day as well for example if it's
feeling dry I can go for a cleanser
that's better for dry skin if my skin is
kind of broken out a little bit I know I
have cleanses but I'd like to go forward
my skin is breaking out I've kind of
just one to get into less of a routine
and more of what my skin needs so that
was definitely something that really
helped me and I really hope that works
use definitely give it a try if you were
using something that was working and now
it no longer works is it tip number four
was just learning to understand that
breakouts are still going to happen even
if my skin is going really good I felt
like it would not only stress me out
which would make my skin wise because
stress is definitely caused to it bad
skin for me and you feel like you're
breaking out and you feel like it
shouldn't be like you're meant to be
having good skin right now don't freak
out just be really gentle with it I felt
like being too harsh with my skin also
made a lot of things worse so it's
really important to use all of gentle
motions not to be too harsh with it
don't use too many products with too
much alcohol in it nothing that's going
to dry out your skin and just make it
like a breeding ground for spots because
I felt like that was something I was
definitely doing I would freak out when
I would get spots and just being way too
harsh with it so just learning to
understand that breakouts are still
going to happen you're still human and
also if you have problematic skin you
are going to be more likely to get a
breakout compared to other people so
just it's just learning what works and
then
so just learning to understand that your
skin isn't going to be perfect forever
you're going to have a few breakouts a
month and although that will kind of
slowly decrease which I feel like has
happened in my life you just got to be
patient with it and just be patient with
your skin and not to be too harsh and I
felt like that was something that
definitely helped with just staying calm
and just treating it as if you kind of
didn't have anything but then just using
maybe a few little quick fixes that
worked good for it so when I felt like I
broke out and you know you get them
really bad spots and you're kind of like
I need this to be gone tomorrow
I had sometimes photo shoots or video
shoots and I'd be like I just can't have
this there I need to decrease I did find
a few things that definitely worked for
me and one of them was tea tree oil I
definitely found that teacher always one
of the best things for me I like to put
it on a little cotton pad and just put
it onto the spot before I go to bed and
I'd notice it would decrease in redness
the size would have necessarily changed
but it's very good for redness so I
really like tea tree oil for that
something else that I would very rarely
do it's not something I'd recommend
doing all the time just because I mean I
wouldn't want to get used to having
medication if I had a really large
inflamed spot especially if it didn't
have a Whitehead it was just a red bump
and it was just really hungry I would
take allergy medication so for example I
take Puritan so that's something that
you would take for example if you've got
mosquito bites or something like that
and usually I mean it didn't work all
the time but a lot of the time it would
decrease the inflammation and then of
course I would sometimes use spot
treatments that had alcohol in it but I
would not recommend using that too much
and also not using it everywhere but I
would use that too much if I like it
would dry out my skin and it would also
make my skin feel really really tight
and then I would break out more because
of the dryness I'm definitely not a
skincare specialist I'm just telling you
guys what worked for me like I said this
may not work for you whatsoever and just
something you guys what I did and these
are some of the quick fixes that I would
do to be careful of what you're using on
your skin is a quick fix I don't use
toothpaste a W sudha cream I don't use
any of that stuff because I personally
didn't feel like it worked for me your
style is a massive massive massive part
of this but skincare is
so so insanely massive as well I
definitely feel like that almost equal
in creating good skin can't have really
really good skin or transform your skin
without changing your lifestyle but you
also can't do that without a good skin
care now a good skin care routine
doesn't necessarily mean it has to be
the most expensive and I definitely feel
like I stand for that isn't a skincare
routine video I'm going to be talking
through some of the stuff that I've
always really helped me I'm just going
to be telling you and then of course if
you would like me to do and actually
talk through what I do during the
evening during the night and now I'm
just going to be showing you some of the
stuff that I use right now of course
this is the entirety of it just some of
the stuff that I really love and that I
feel has helped to transform my skin so
first of all I thought I'd talk about
cleansers because I definitely feel like
cleansing and acids have been the most
important part about transforming my
skin
so my cleansers that I love and I kind
of switch between three to four of them
so the first product is the Liz Earle
cleanse and polish now this one is
actually the rose and lavender version
this isn't the one I usually use I use
the normal one but I can't find it it's
in a green bottle if I I think I might
have run out or I just can't find my
extra one so this is what it looks like
this is the Rose version but I used the
normal version that's in their normal
green packaging so this was the product
that I felt like changed my skin the
most and when I started using this I was
like oh my gosh this is the best thing
ever my skin is transforming but then my
skin got really used to it I needed to
find some other cleansers that also
really worked for me as well so I really
like the red clean skincare clear calm
clear calm three clarifying clay
cleanser now this is the cleanser that I
tend to use when my skin is most
breaking out so I tend to switch mostly
between these two like I said there's
are there are other things as well but
I'm using I use exfoliator Zhai use
scrubs
I have masks like there's so much more
to my skincare routine but these two
have definitely saved my skin and I go
between these two and then another two
cleanses also my skin is feeling a
little bit dry I like to go in for my
vitamin E cream cleanser from the body
shop and I absolutely love this stuff
it's so good and I just really like it's
very gentle it's a nice morning cleanser
when I clean my skin in the morning
that's the one I use another massive
massive massive part my skincare routine
I think transformed everything for me
was using skin acid someone I definitely
recommend you to watch or read is
Caroline herons she is where I got the
majority of all of my information from
she's amazing
she's an amazing British blogger and
youtuber so I'll leave her links down
below please go and check her out
because she has all of this information
on there and a lot of the stuff that I
know today is because of her blog and
I've read it for literally like two
years now she's amazing and she's the
one that basically got everything about
acids from like acids I thank you
Caroline because without you I don't
think I've been using acids right now
they definitely transform my skin and I
had so many clogged pores and bumps
under my skin like not gonna lie still
have some I have three acids I like to
change in between the main two that I've
literally been using for quite a while
now are the pixie glow tonic which is
five percent glycolic acid and then I
also use the facial radiance pads from
first aid Beauty and I'm not too sure of
the percentage of acid in this see there
is lactic acid and glycolic acid so it's
a little bit different to this one so
that's why I like to switch between them
because of course this one's go I call
it and then this one has a lot of lactic
acid in it I don't know the percentage
of this one though but the next one that
I've literally just recently found
because I got sent its got sent to me I
absolutely love this one so much these
are the Nippon fab exfoliate glycolic
fix notes pads and I use this of course
only in the night I actually don't use
acids in the morning I don't know if
that's wrong but I don't use acids in
the morning I just cleanse and add some
serum because I feel like that's enough
for me and these are extreme and I would
say that they probably are the strongest
feeling acids that I have I feel like
it's definitely stronger than the other
two and I use this probably like once or
twice a week in the evening and oh it's
5% glycolic acid as well so this is the
same percentage as the pixi but for some
reason this feels so much stronger I
don't know why maybe it's just because
it's actually already soaked on the pad
but this is quite extreme so I use this
probably twice a week and again this
just helps with the texture
my skin it helps to just dissolve all of
the excess sebum and dirt that's trapped
underneath all the clogged pores I like
I said I'm not a skincare specialist I
can't explain all the science behind it
but that has definitely dealt with my
skin texture like I said please check
her out down below as well because she
is also who kind of helped with the diet
as well because I looked at some of the
triggers of diet and I definitely found
that looking at her stuff really really
helped so please check her out
forgot to mention her over the beginning
but she is amazing and I don't really
look at her stuff as much anymore
because my skin is so much better but
when I was in my worst time I would
literally look at her blog every single
day just to refresh my memory because I
was like I need to get rid of my bad
skin acids and cleansing which of course
gets rid of all the excess dirt all of
the stuff stuck onto the skin that just
kind of reveals really nice smooth skin
but just because we have spots doesn't
mean we have to forget about keeping our
skin nice and moisturized a difficult
for my skin is dry and now than it used
to be before I've been dealing with all
of my skin issues I like to make sure
that my skin is nice and hydrated so the
only serum and to be using at the moment
which I've been using for about a year
and a half now is the red clean skin
care and make a 3 optimum skin it's
theorum oil and then something that I
have found relatively recently like
within the last six months is the
bodyshop oils of life oil I use this
every single night without fail on top
of my serum and it just keeps my skin so
moisturized so beautifully supple and I
wake up and my skin just feels
incredible like my skin just can't feel
dry when this is on my skin so this has
definitely been the oil of my life pun
intended like it's literally the best
and I absolutely love this not only that
it's from the body shop and it's really
inexpensive as well and the very last
thing that I have to say to you guys is
basically to just beat the system with
it there's so much to get disheartened
about especially when you feel like
you're doing stuff and your skin's just
not getting better I can't explain to
you how I never thought my skin would
get better and I thought I'd have to go
and take medication and I thought I'd
have to I don't know I just thought it
was impossible to do on my own
but I've done it and I definitely feel
like my skin's in a really good place I
you feel like I've got to such a good
place of my skin I really hope you guys
like this video if you do want to see my
skin care routine please do let me know
I hope you guys like this much held kind
of video I don't think I've done a
chatty video like this in a really
really really long time I can't remember
the last time and I don't think I've
ever done a video without face makeup
one so Y a fellow face makeup for a make
up page I think that's definitely good
and I'm feeling so proud I've got to the
point I'm with my skin and I'm not quite
at the point where I feel like I feel
super super comfortable because of my
scarring but I'm getting that and I'm so
proud that I have and so thankful that
you guys have been so loving over it
like you guys have noticed that my skin
is changed and I'm so so happy so
literally had this for about two years
and a lot of it being on YouTube and a
lot of the time my skin being ridiculed
online and it was really hard but if I
got through it I definitely feel like
you can as well I love you guys so much
thank you for watching this video I
really hope you enjoyed and found it
helpful and I will see you in the next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
