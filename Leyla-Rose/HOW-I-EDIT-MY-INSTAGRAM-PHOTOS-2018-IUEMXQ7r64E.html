so today I have a super highly requested
video for you a video on how I edit my
Instagram pictures and this has been so
highly requested on my channel it's been
asked so many times on my Instagram page
be sure to follow my Instagram by the
way it's makeup by Lela so be sure to go
and follow me for just like a daily
inspiration fashion makeup just
generally right the Sun is going in and
out of the clouds so if it gets brighter
and darker that's what I was gonna get
straight into it if you like this kind
of video then be sure to subscribe I'm
gonna edit in the style that I've been
editing recently but as it's getting
into summer I probably will change so as
I go into my summer feed let me know if
you want an update and if you guys want
me to do a video also on how I take good
Instagram pictures like how I take
selfies and stuff like that be sure to
let me know because I'm just gonna show
you guys how I edit them and the apps I
use in this video I'm not gonna be
showing you guys how I take them because
a lot of the picture is in actually how
you take it as well there's no right or
wrong way to edit I wanted to believe
it's an art it's a creative form of
expression so it's honestly up to you
the way that you want to do it this is
just the way that I do some of my
pictures and if you guys want to see how
I do it then just keep them as you can
see in this little folder I have here I
have a bunch of photos I'm not gonna be
showing you all of them today I'm just
gonna pick a couple and show you guys
basically how I edit them there's a
couple of different pictures that you
guys will find on my feed and I guess
that's mainly selfies I love a good
selfie I'm not gonna lie and that's just
because one I don't really have anyone
to take pictures for me apart from my
mom but she works and it just never
really works out and I don't really have
like a photographer or anything like
that so it just ends up being easier to
take selfies or to use the self-timer
remote on my camera this little photo
just full with a couple of raw pictures
that I haven't been edited a couple of
them had gone through a smoothing out a
little bit but I'm gonna show you guys
that up on a raw picture before we get
into it and so yeah when it comes to
editing pictures I don't really shy away
from smoothing I just don't like to go
too far I don't like to change the
picture I don't like to change the way
that my face looks or to like change the
shape of it too much sometimes I'll use
a slimming feature or something of my
face
but you know to make it look more
realistic see when it comes to in real
life and in like the video it sometimes
it looks a little bit different when you
take a picture so that's the only way
that I will ever edit my pictures I
still want it to look realistic but I'm
not like shy to tweaking I'm not gonna
lie to you guys and say that I'd haven't
tweaked any of my photos but I
definitely don't like to take it too far
I never like to over edit my pictures I
don't wanna change my body shape I don't
want to change my face so whilst we're
on the topic of selfies I guess let's go
in with a selfie first of all so I have
like two selfies I guess I want to show
you the first one is not in sunlight and
then the second one is in direct
sunlight so I love to take selfies when
the Sun is setting in direct sunlight
because I think it looks so beautiful
then this is taken in just normal light
so it's daylight but I'm not standing
directly up against a window like I said
I can show you guys basically how to
take a good selfie and take pictures of
yourself not in selfie mode I can give
you guys a couple of tips and tricks but
I'll do that and another videos has
taken in normal why I'm actually sitting
on my bed which is just right there the
window is kind of like far away it is
decently bright I definitely feel like
on a nice bright day is the best time to
take a selfie you come to the side
because I thought would be a lot easier
if you guys to see what I'm doing right
here so this is my photography folder
and I'll just run through the apps that
we have going on here they're not all
relevant but I'll just explain what all
of them are so we've got face tune and I
you say tune a fair bit but not
necessarily for the reasons that a lot
of other people use face tune or in a
negative way like what you think though
I've got visco which is my main
filtering app I am joined to the disco
like membership program which I think
has like all of the filters and honestly
I just love it I'll show you guys the
filters I've been using lately but I do
love to get experimental and use
different ones we've got our brush which
is like the airbrushing app that I guess
that I use it helps to like even out my
skin tone make everything look nice and
smooth and it can like make your jawline
look a little bit more as well if you
wanted to do that then we've got Burnham
this is basically an app where you can
like figure out how you're going to post
things you can see the whole layout of
your Instagram and then you can
add ones on to see like what they'd look
like next sex app it's Snapseed I use
Snapseed a lot and just like bright in
certain areas because there's a
selective tool in there and yeah I'll
use it to kind of just like brought in
one area only and keep the rest of it
dark mixtures which is how I add
overlays to add like light coming in to
add a lot of green on my pictures and
then the bottom to you aren't really
important I use them for video and then
for Instagram story so the bottom two
you aren't really important I would say
that my most important apps would
definitely be facetune visco and
mixtures I don't use the airbrush one
that often but I also really like that
as well so if I was to say like my top
four I would say Phase two Nabisco
airbrush and mixtures so what I like to
do first of all if I'm gonna open up a
selfie open up my picture that I'm gonna
use so I'm gonna use this one right here
and usually I'll use the magic so let's
see what magic actually does if we just
leave it as it is and pretty much it
transforms your picture pretty instantly
so you can see the before and after it
smooths everything over it makes
everything look nice and like clean and
Adam you can see but it's my jewel line
a little bit so sometimes I'll do that
sometimes I won't it's really not a
dramatic change it's really subtle and
that's as far as I would go and you can
kind of go in and edit and I feel like
it looks too smooth because I don't feel
like I had bad skin this day that
everything looked okay I can take acne
off because I didn't really have
anything oh it enlarges your eyes as
well but again it's so subtle that I
just leave that on so yeah and then I'll
leave I'll leave this slim one on why
not because my head's in a bond I feel
like my hair looks like such a sucker
when my hairs in a bun
lighten or darken your skin turn and
sometimes I'll do the dog come one if I
need it let's see how that looks um
sometimes it can look a little bit too
dark and I just prefer it without so I'm
gonna leave it without for now just cuz
I find sometimes if I'm already looking
like my skin tone actually is then I'll
just leave it but if I look a little bit
washed out in pictures then I'll just
add it fine then it just helps
everything to look a little bit more
realistic I have all of the filters on
this coat you can buy them in packages
or you
just join the program like I have
because I use it so often I just joined
the program and but the filter that I've
been loving and using a lot is c4 so
I'll add it to about like halfway it
depends on the picture it really does
depend on the lighting and everything
but add it to about 5.4 and that just
gives it a really nice almost purple
tent and next I'll go to highlights and
I like to drag my highlights down quite
a lot just because I like my photos to
look quite muted I don't like it to look
to you over overexposed I like it to
look quite muted and also just like not
super bright and I'll add like a little
bit of fade and then I do love a bit of
green as well and then that's what gives
it that nice vintage grain effect so
much like how I would filter my photos
but then there is more that I would do
an Instagram as well as you can see it's
matching a little bit more with the
other pictures that are there and then I
will just save that to Camera Raw and
then I'll do the actual size just
because it keeps the resolution that it
is and then I will open it in facetune
and I don't always do this nowadays open
this picture up into facetune and this
is pretty much how it's looking
currently now if I want to be really
extra and make the background look super
white I'll go into the whiten feature
and I'll just literally run my finger
over the background and just whites in
everything a little bit because it
really does depend like when I posted
the last picture I didn't really want it
at all I just left it as it is because
I'm already against a white wall so that
is pretty much that that's but before
and after and as you can see it just
looks a lot brighter if you want to keep
whitening it you can do it a couple of
times and it will whiten it even more
but that's pretty much all I will do
sometimes I'll go in with the details
feature and just run it gently over my
eyes just to give my eyes a little bit
more detail it just kind of sharpens it
a little bit and then sometimes I'll do
that over like things like earrings my
nose ring anything that I want to just
like pop a little bit more if I'm
wearing like a necklace and I really
want it to pop I'll go with the details
tool because sometimes I'll go in with
the tones and I like pick from my hair
and I'll just like go over my hair a
little bit just because sometimes it can
a little bit like washed out and it just
adds a little bit to it so that's like
the before and after for that and yeah
that's pretty much like what I would do
and you can see it kind of like pulls
that little like button it's a bald but
like you know where your head like thins
a little bit on your hairline it kind of
just does that and yeah like that's
honestly like as far as I go to edit
very much all I would generally do on
facetune but I have been doing something
lately and I know that you guys have
been asking how I do it that's the RGB
split effect to the 3d effect and I do
that through the filters on face Jun I
go onto the filters tab and then I go to
lens and then I scroll all the way to
chromatic and that's how I get that kind
of effect I really love that effect I
use it a lot in videos and it's really
nice that I've got that for pictures as
well and so save that to my camera roll
I will then open it up into Instagram
and I do a couple of edits on here as
well so I like to go in farther with a
little bit of the Aiden I put it down to
about though you just cuz I like the
Aiden color again it's a little bit
purpley and warm and I really like that
and then sometimes I would just
brightness or sometimes do like this
like if something looks a little bit
strange I like fix the way that it's all
set up if that makes sense and then I
will often pull down the highlights a
little bit more sharpen it a little bit
and that's like pretty much good to go
like and then I'll save it to my draft
and then it will be like waiting pretty
much for it to be uploaded like that's
pretty much it as you can see on my
Instagram page I like to keep everything
quite neutral apart from these couple
when I was in the Maldives everything is
like a white black or gray background
and that's just how I like to keep it I
had a little bit of red going on around
Christmas just cuz rhythms Christmasy
but apart from that I like everything to
look really muted and neutral looking so
that's kind of my style I like it twice
and then the golden kind of tone of my
skin to come in there and yet that's
that's want to see the tone that I love
and I'm going to show you guys how to
edit this one I'm going to edit exactly
the same way this one has already gone
through the airbrush app just to like
smooth the skin and to darken the skin
tone a little bit because I think I
looked a little bit washed out in this I
can't remember so let's go to the
photography and let's put it into visco
the same thing I think I'm gonna put a
c4 on this one because I think that's
what I did now as you can see other
moment thing
looking kind of orangie I don't like
that so I'm gonna go into temperature
and just pull it down a little bit and
I'm go to exposure and just pull that
down a little bit as well yeah and then
I'm going to save that to camera roll
actual size as usual and I'm gonna pull
it up in facetune you want to do with
this because the backgrounds were
looking kind of different shades I want
to go in and just whiten everything just
cuz I feel like this is gonna look a lot
better as you can see the before and
after of that really just makes you pop
a lot more and then I believe because I
just felt like my background looked a
little bit messy I actually went in with
the D focus tool and I don't do this
very often to be honest with you but
just because I wasn't really liking how
it was looking I just kind of defocused
some of this like just the background
basically be the same thing as I do when
I whiten it and just go around the edges
but the erase tool just to make sure
that none of me actually looks blood if
that makes sense so that everything like
all of me my clothing looks nice and
sharp I don't really do anything else
apart from that that's pretty much all
good for me sometimes I like to flip it
and I do that using the canvas tool but
then sometimes it just looks weird just
sounds like let's keep that no more
saved I will open it up in mixtures and
like I said that's the other app that I
really love to use to add a nice green
to it so I open up my library crop it
I'll keep it on cropped and then I have
some favorites here and these are the
ones I generally love to use so I think
I used window-shopping fast or that one
I can remember which one I use but I'm
gonna use about window-shopping and I'm
actually gonna keep the things as it is
currently and just pull it down a little
bit so it's not too much and then I will
go to the little plus tool right there
and then go to favorites again and I'm
gonna add another layer and I think I'm
going to
sometimes I like to change the way that
this is you can change the blend modes
on this and I'll go to lights in and
then that makes it look kind of like
normal it looks like the normal picture
but just with the little scratches on it
I hope that makes sense it's really hard
to explain this hopefully what you're
seeing is enough and it kind of gives it
that distressed look and I honestly love
that I'll save that and then again I'm
gonna open it up in Instagram and I do
my final edits on Instagram again I'll
go in with Aiden and just drag it down
to about 35 or 36 right now but ya drag
it down to about there and I'm just
gonna pull down the highlights a little
bit turn down the saturation just one
more time
and my just like a just a little bit
once this adjust it it makes such a
difference as well and then I might just
shop in it one more time that is the
before and then that is the after as you
can see I know it's quite heavily
filtered but I really like that I do
sometimes take pictures on a
professional camera which is the Canon
5d Mark 3 that's the camera that I film
where's actually the camera I take
pictures with too so apart from that
whenever I use that camera which I
haven't really used in a long time apart
from that Rose picture I do exactly the
same thing it doesn't really change
considering me using it on a
professional camera any other type of
picture that I would ever have would be
a flat lay whenever I take pictures of
my nails anything like this this is
pretty much how I edit it and it has the
exact same kind of method to it I'll add
my filter which at the moment is c4 and
I'll just do all my filters this is
actually like the easiest type of
picture for me to edit so I'll just do
the same thing again and just open it
and face tune and then whiten the
background
and whenever I take a flat lay it
usually is on a white black or gray
background just so it makes it a lot
easier to edit then I haven't actually
posted this yet I might do those are
just gorgeous flowers that the bodyshop
sent me I would do the same add Aidan on
it
sharpen it a little bit
I don't need to thank Lee I'll just
sharpen it a little bit much how I would
do a flat lay the same way that I do my
nails it's exactly the same I just like
make sure that it's on a white
background
nice that is pretty much the end of this
video obviously I could show you guys
how I edit a ton of different pictures
it really does all depend on the exact
photo the lighting there is no definite
way to edit you really do have to use
your eye it's an art form at the end of
the day so the way that you edit it does
reflect on you so obviously like this is
just my general style and how I and I
really love it right now but it's
definitely gonna change pretty soon when
it gets to summer because obviously
you'll be out more going to different
places so if you guys want me to do a
summer one definitely let me know I can
do it seasonally because I just feel
like I'm constantly changing the way I
edit my pictures son is leaving me why
are you doing this to me anyway guys
