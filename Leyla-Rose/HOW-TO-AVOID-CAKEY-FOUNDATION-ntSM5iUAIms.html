so today I'm going to be sharing some
tips on how to avoid cakey foundation I
really hope you enjoyed this video I
love doing videos where it's all about
one specific topic make sure you like
this video if you want to see more like
this and subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already if you do makeup in a
way that I'm saying that I wouldn't
personally do I would recommend it
doesn't mean that you're doing it wrong
everyone is different and I'm not
bashing anyone's makeup techniques these
are just what I find have really helped
me and in my makeup journey so if you do
want to take on any of my little tips
and they'll be greatly if you don't
agree with them that's totally fine as
what makeup is totally free or rules
this is just some tips to help you guys
so I do hope you find it helpful and if
you do want to know some tips and tricks
on how to avoid cakey foundation and
just keep on watching the first step
that you want to do is have a really
really good skincare routine now this is
something that I neglected for a really
long time now that I do I have noticed
such an amazing difference in my skin
and I noticed that foundation goes on so
much smoother I still have a lot of
scarring from my bad skin but the really
good skincare routine has really helped
as well as having a cleaner and
healthier diet has really helped to but
if you guys would like me to do my
skincare routine for you guys on my
channels and make sure you let me know
because I could talk about skincare for
ages so definitely let me know the next
step is moisturizing really really well
and this is even if you don't have
particularly dry skin I personally don't
have super dry skin it does get dry at
times I would say I'm combination why
use a water-based moisturizer in the
morning every single time before I do my
makeup and I've noticed such a
difference when I do this just before I
apply my foundation not only does the
primer just cling on so much better to
it I just feel like everything just
moved on so much better especially when
all of my little dry skin patches a
totally moisturize so it's definitely
prevents that cakey looking foundation
that cullings
on to the skin and I definitely
recommend most arises in your under-eye
area as well because you shouldn't
neglect back otherwise your under eyes
can look really like greasy and dry and
that's very common especially this time
of the year so make sure you moisturize
that area as well as you can see so far
from these tips pressing is so important
and one that I love to do is multi
priming I'd like to make sure that every
single sort problematic area of my skin
is covered so what I like to do for
myself is fill out the dryness first I
have moisturize but that's all get
absorbed by my skin so I'd like to take
something that's a little bit more
heavy-duty like a thicker moisturizer or
a moisturizing primer and apply that all
over my skin and then I do like to go in
with a pore filling or smoothing primer
as well because I feel like this really
really helps to make everything just
smooth on prepping your skin is so
important I can't explain any time I've
had cakey foundation the majority of the
time it's not because I've applied too
much it's because I haven't prepped my
skin properly and that's something I
definitely love within this last year is
prepping is so important so definitely
give all these tips a try if you feel
like if your foundation just looks cakey
no matter what you do also another tip
is to apply your smoothing primer
downwards because this pushed all your
baby hairs on your face downwards and
that way it doesn't kind of stick up and
create a little bump so this one is a
must for me and that is color correcting
personally for my skin I have to color
correct my redness which is caused from
old acne scarring and I like to use a
green concealer on top of this to
correct that color rather than using a
thicker concealer over my foundation or
underneath my foundation even this color
basically clashes with the color that's
going wrong on my face and that
basically makes it a lot easier for my
foundation to do its job without little
things peeking through for any other
type of color correction make sure you
are using a different color so for
example for dark under eye circles use
peach for any darkness use the more
orangey tone color correcting is pretty
much a whole video in itself but for now
I think you guys get the idea so now
we're actually moving on to a real
foundation step that's how important
pressing is guys but for now we are
moving on to actual foundation so I'm
taking my foundation and ensuring that
I'm applying it little by little I like
to dot it around my face because I feel
like this is a lot better to kind of
like spread everything out without
taking too much and then I'm using a
brush today but you can use whatever you
like and use your fingers you can use a
sponge which whatever works for you the
most and you want to apply a small
amount at first and then if it's not
enough then build on slowly that way you
won't apply too much too quickly and
it's just
or easier to correct that and that way
you won't apply a mass amount of it and
then it ends up just the pink ATM you
just ruin all the pressing we just done
so even though today I used a brush to
apply my foundation it's really good to
have example UT blender or Beauty sponge
nearby because this does pick up excess
product and I find this really really
helpful to take away that product that
makes it look cakey
so once I've applied my foundation
sometimes if I'm not happy with it and
it looks a bit much I'll go over it with
a damp Beauty Blender and I just find
this helps so much to just make
everything look a lot more skin like
that's just picked up extra products
that was necessary and I also find a
Beauty Blender or a sponge a lot better
for the under eye area as well
I find that the under eye area can get
cakey very quickly so I definitely
recommend if you find that this area
creases and get very thick looking I
would recommend using a sponge if you
haven't already I do like you to brush
sometimes well a sponge is just a little
bit of a no-fail for me you just can't
go wrong with it so definitely try it if
you haven't so this tip is something
that's very obvious for lot of people
but I personally wasn't doing this and
I've noticed such a different why I used
to do was apply cream products after I
had set my foundation and I found that
this was making my skin look very very
cakey when I apply a cream bronzer a
cream highlight a cream just a cream
anything that isn't powder I like to
apply this before I set anything and
that way I personally feel like it ended
up looking a lot more flawless the
texture can get a little bit beady and
just cakey looking so once I've done my
cream bronzer or contour or whatever I
wanted to do that day then I'll go over
with a translucent powder like the one
I'm using now and just Pat it onto my
skin and I find this just looks so much
more flawless and just more skin like
instead of it adding an extra layer on
top of our foundation and I just feel
like this looks super flawless another
tip is to Pat powder into the skin
because I find that this looks really
flawless as well and then finally the
last tip is to spray setting or facial
spray like there is no tomorrow this has
changed my foundation game honestly
especially since I did that video where
I dunked my face into water I've been
using a lot more setting sprays and I
feel like it's that but just a little
bit Leicester
and I was never a fan of sayings brave
but now I am as you can see I went crazy
but it just makes everything lock in so
much nicer it looks so flawless and it
takes away any powder enos so if you did
go a little bit crazy with the powder
this takes that away a lot of the time
and it just makes you look more skin
like and a lot less cakey
so guys at the end of this video I
