so today I'm going to be showing you
guys how to cover up blemishes and spots
in something that happens to me all the
time and when I do breakout it could be
quite disheartening but it's quite easy
to cover once you know how if you do
want to see how I like to cover up
blemishes and spots and just keep on
watching first thing that I like to do
is make sure my skin is really well
moisturized now this goes for any skin
problem I would say that making sure
your skin is nice and moisturized it's
really important just because even with
breakouts and even though you may have
all your skin it doesn't mean you should
totally deprive your skin of moisture
just because you have a breakout it's
totally fine to put moisturizer on top
of it and honestly it makes makeup go on
smoother as well and I also do recommend
applying a moisturizing primer as well
as a smoothing one if you prime every
single skin problem that you have then
that way your skin will look nice and
smooth so I first of all apply a nice
moisturizing primer underneath my
foundation and then I go on top of it
with a smoothing primer I'm still yet to
find drugstore primers but I love as
much as the ones I am using in this
video so comment down below some
drugstore alternatives to the ones that
I'm using
ok so color correcting this redness and
the bumps are so important Green is a
really good color to help correct the
redness and also to really help with
them tiny little dots that I get as well
around my face so I only put this on the
areas where I do get the issues and then
I pack it in with my brush onto my skin
I always like to Pat this into the skin
rather than rub it because personally I
find that rubbing it moves around the
product to marketing also helps to build
coverage which will come in really handy
when we're trying to build coverage with
our foundation on the areas that need it
for now I'm going to be packing this
into the skin because it really helps to
maintain that green tone that way it
really does correct all of that redness
that foreign skin and as you can see it
still has a bit of a green residue but
once you apply a foundation on top of
this is going to even out your
complexion and it's going to look a lot
more smooth in tone and also a lot more
smooth in texture because it reduces the
appearance of them red spots for my
foundation I'm going to be taking the
Maybelline fit me today this is one of
my favorite foundations I like to use
when my skin is looking a little bit
rubbish and when my skin just looks like
it means a lot of extra coverage because
you can really build up this foundation
so I'm taking the same brush and as you
can see I am passing this on to the skin
especially on the areas where I get the
spots as you can see I'm really not
rubbing at this point because I want to
build as much coverage as possible
you don't want to rub on any of the
areas where there's spots because this
will not build coverage you want to
really pack and also go in circular
motions as you part to really blend that
product out and you can start to rub on
any areas that maybe don't need as much
coverage I would definitely recommend
not rubbing any foundation on areas that
have the spots on because I just feel
like it doesn't cover and you'll just
end up needing to apply a lot more
foundation or concealer on top of this
now I'm going to go in with a little bit
more foundation on top of this and just
because I need it on certain areas so
this is totally fine to do I prefer
doing it with foundation rather than
concealer and at this point I will only
rub and that is it just to really build
the coverage what I will do as well is
just apply my concealer as normal just
because don't really affect my spots
I just thought Pat this into the skin
but then when I apply my powder again I
like to apply my powder in a patting
motion especially something I prefer
doing anyway but I would recommend doing
this especially around the spotty areas
sometimes the surface of spots can be a
little bit too smooth so if you really
rub a powder on top of the face it can
tend to pick up the foundation but only
on the spot this happens to me all the
time this is quite common in people wear
foundation separates this is something
that may be happening to you so when you
do set your face
make sure to Pat and not rub as well and
if you do find that your thoughts are
coming through a little bit off you set
just go in with a little bit of some
actual printed foundation powder and
just Pat it on top of any areas where
you have spots to really perfect it and
this really really makes it look like
you have a really flawless finish also
really mattifying this area and making
it look less as possible really
decreases the look of bumps even though
there might be bump there so it really
plays with the physics of the spot after
all that hard work I would definitely
recommend just setting your skin because
that way you know it's going to stay on
all
and I just really recommend doing at
this point before you apply your bronzer
that way your foundation can just be
locked into place now when I apply my
bronzer and highlight and all of that I
really like to make sure that I am
avoiding any areas where the spots were
sometimes with contour you can't avoid
it but that's why sometimes I don't like
to go for a really strong contour
because if I have spots in that area it
could make it look dark and really make
the spots look a lot worse so if you are
going to be applying some bronzer or
highlight or anything like that just
avoid that area so as you can see as I'm
applying this highlight I'm applying it
only to the very tops of my cheek bone
whereas I would usually take it down a
lot further if I didn't have spots and I
just want to say the more intense the
highlight is and you put it over a spot
it really does exaggerate the way a spot
looks so definitely be careful with any
texture whilst applying highlight onto
your face so guys I'm going to quickly
do my makeup off-camera and that is the
finished video as you can see my skin it
does look much better than it did before
it looks really really nice and smooth
and you can barely see anything and that
is the aim so I really hope that this
video helped you guys if it did we don't
forget to like this video and subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
I will see you all next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
