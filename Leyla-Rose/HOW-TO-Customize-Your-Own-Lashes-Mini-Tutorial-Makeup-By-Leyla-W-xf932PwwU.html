today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to customize your own lashes and what
we're basically gonna be doing today is
I'm gonna show you how to transform your
lashes from how the left lash looks to
how the right one looks so basically
we're just adding lots of volume making
it look more layered and wispy the
lashes I'm gonna be using today are both
bijli the individual lashes are the pro
lash fine to full and this basically
includes lots of different types of
lashes from fine to fall and also the
eyelid number 100's and this is what
they look like before I'm just gonna be
applying some duo eyelash adhesive onto
the eyelash tray and I'm gonna be
basically taking lots of the individual
eyelashes and placing them on top of the
lash so you want to go on top instead of
underneath just because this is a lot
better and it will prevent the tiny
individual hairs from coming off when
you've removed the lashes so as you can
see I'm just placing the individual
lashes where I would like them to be and
you can go in any style this is such an
easy method like you will get the hang
of it and you will just love creating
all sorts of different styles and it's
just so fun because you can create so
many different ones so today's style is
just a really nice short but wispy lash
I kind of went fuller in the outer
corner to kind of pull my eyes out with
a little bit but I'm applying lashes all
over so this is just gradually
thickening the lash and just creating a
really nice wispy effect so when you're
done you just want to make sure to apply
some eyelash glue onto the lash band to
make sure that all of the tiny
individual lashes don't come off the
lash band
that way you can reuse the lash as many
times as you want to and then to finish
everything off all we're basically going
to be doing is taking some black liquid
liner and applying it all along the top
lash line and just basically covering
the lash band to make the lash band
blend into the actual lashes so it just
looks like a lash that you bought that
way and it's just an amazing technique
it looks really really natural you can't
even see where the lashes begin or end
and as you can see the before and after
speaks for itself that before lash is
really beautiful but the after lash is
just looks a lot more wispy it has more
of a layered texture to it and I
personally love them and I just wanted
to show you guys how they looked on the
eye so I hope that you guys enjoyed this
quick tip on how to customize your own
lashes I hope you guys enjoyed please
like this video if you did and please
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

next video take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
