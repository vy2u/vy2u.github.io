today I'm going to be showing you how to
achieve full up more defined brows and I
did recently grab my eyebrows it does
change depending on the makeup look but
this is the more universal way that I
like to fill in my brows firstly I like
to run a spoolie or a clear mascara wand
through my brows just to tidy things up
and put them in the direction that I
wanted to go
then I like to take a concealer this is
Bobby Brown creamy concealer in beige
this is one shade lighter than my skin
tone so it does give me a slightly
highlighted look and it just helps you
carve out the shape that I want to use
on my brow and this is just a really
good tip by applying the concealer fast
it just creates a more natural effect
instead of it looking too harsh I do go
over the concealer afterwards as well
just to create a little bit more
definition but of course this is
completely optional and you want to make
sure that the concealer is as close to
the hairs as possible as this just gives
it more definition next I'm going to be
taking my brow bar to go in the lightest
shade I'm going to be taking the lighter
shade from this palette and applying
this through my brows first the reason
why I like to apply a lighter shade to
my brows and not a black or brown shade
is because my eyebrows are quite full
now and if I do apply to dark of a
powder it just looks too much for my
face I've mentioned this before my face
is fairly small and it just can't take
too much of stuff like this from
learning from the past I just feel like
dark brows don't suit me so I have
learned that the dark eyebrows aren't
necessarily the best thing for my face
shape so I like to use a lighter brown
powder just to go through my brows to
define it slightly but not to be too
dark so then I like to take these
slightly darker shade from the same
palette and just use this to sculpt out
my arch and also use it in any other
areas that I need definition and the
brush that I'm using is a Mac 263 brush
it's short and it is quite dense so that
means it does pick up quite a bit of
product so is really good for powders
after i'm done with that i do like to
brush through with the Spoony again just
to make sure that i'm getting it through
to all the little brow hairs and then i
like to go over it with a tinted brow
mascara and what this does is just gets
in between all the little hairs keeps
all the hairs in place and also makes
the brows look more textured and what
that does is it makes the hair look
fuller so I really need this because my
hairs are quite thin and they're quite
sparse and thin so when i do do
makes them look a lot more full then I
like to go through with this Duty again
just to make sure everything is in place
and lastly I'm going to be going through
with a brow pencil the reason why I use
a very small amount of this brow pencil
is because I like to mimic the stroke of
hairs and what this does is it just
makes the look look natural as you can
see I'm going a little wisp emotions and
what that does is it just mimics hair
and it just looks so much more natural
so what I like to do is just use this
mostly on the arch area rather than the
front I usually like to leave the front
free and then I just go underneath with
a bit of concealer just to clean up
anything that we may have dropped down
there and then if necessary you can go
above the arch as well and just clean
anything that you want from above it I
don't like to do this too often because
sometimes is very easy to go too far
with that as you can see guys the
difference from the right to the left is
phenomenal I really like the way that my
brows are now I like them looking brown
instead of black because it can be too
harsh and this is how it looks with a
full face of makeup so I hope that you
