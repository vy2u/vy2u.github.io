so today I have a video all about brows
and it's basically my brow routine how
to get effortlessly perfect looking
eyebrows even though you know like we're
not really adding too much product so
I'm showing you guys basically the whole
process on how I turn my eyebrows from
this to the previous frame so if you
want to see it then just keep on
watching so the first step is basically
to brush those brows out as you can see
I am in desperate need of getting rid of
the excess hair on my eyebrows and the
way that I want to start this process is
to first of all brush all of my hairs
upwards at the very center of the brows
I want to go straight up and then I kind
of like to go diagonal as I get to the
outer parts and then I like to go in
with some cream concealer and to
basically map out where we're gonna stop
plucking this is an amazing step to do
if you want to avoid over plucking your
eyebrows you want to see where your
eyebrow is gonna look like so using a
concealer that's lighter than your skin
tone doesn't have to be too light but if
you want to really have that definitive
line then definitely go a shade lighter
so you can really see the concealer and
you want to kind of just like shape out
and basically sculpt this shape that you
want your brow to look like once it's
all plucked and you basically have your
guideline and it's really easy to see
your brow hairs this way it actually
highlights them even more in my opinion
and then I'll go in and basically pluck
them it's pretty self-explanatory at
this point I make the weirdest faces
when I like my own eyebrows I've just
plucked my eyebrows for years I've never
really threaded them I've never gone to
anyone else I've just always done them
myself
it definitely meant that I've had a lot
of brow issues in my lifetime like a lot
of weird eyebrow shapes but I think
we're good now which is great so as you
can see I just spend a couple of minutes
just plucking away all of the excess
hair and then once I am done with that I
like to trim my eyebrow hairs cuz I get
really long eyebrow hairs that was so
curly because I have curly hair and I
like to trim off the excess hair you
gotta be careful when you're doing this
not to trim too much you kind of have to
keep brushing them through and trimming
them and just being very slow and steady
with this you don't over cut them
because there's no going back you know
as you can see the difference in that
makes a massive difference alone with no
product in them so next I'm just gonna
go in and shave around my eyebrows it's
definitely a new step you can thread you
can do whatever works for you the book
I use an eyebrow razor to shave the rest
of my face I actually actually shaved my
face you guys I know it sounds a bit
crazy but I just go around to the other
edges of my eyebrow and just kind of
shave away any excess hair then to start
in the filling process I actually apply
an eyebrow primer to my eyebrows this
one is from benefit and I apply this
into my eyebrows just to make my
eyebrows stay in place and I can also
see if anything else needs to be plucked
or cut and then I going straight with
filling them in so the way that I feel
in my eyebrows now is I mean it's
changed over time but I like to go for a
more subtle shape I like something that
looks a little bit straighter on me but
of course go with whatever suits your
face I first of all just go along the
bottom part of the brow and kind of just
follow along and fill the bottom and
then I like to go in and create the
little brow hairs going back and forth
from the spoolie on the other side of my
eyebrow pencil this is from benefit also
and I really just like to slowly draw in
hairs and I find that this is the most
natural-looking way to do your brows
instead of colouring them in I find that
using whatever product you are using
whether it be a pencil or some kind of
dip brow product I just find that
drawing in little hair shapes always
looks the most natural and as you can
see it just creates a really nice like
color but it's not blockage and I love
that so we also going with the concealer
again and just go underneath the brows
just to clean it up I don't like putting
any concealer on the top of my brows
just at the bottom to really make it
look nice and sharp but nothing too
over-the-top is well I still want it to
look nice and natural so as you can see
that's pretty much all I do on my
eyebrows and it actually only takes me
about five minutes now to do my eyebrows
I'd say it used to take me absolutely
ages I think it was probably the thing
that took me the longest to do but
obviously I don't pluck my eyebrows
every single day aside from that just
whenever I'm filling my eyebrows in on
my makeup routine it does not take me
long at all and that's because I've
opted for definitely a more natural brow
shape but this would work for a lot of
brow shape I obviously have brow hair
already but I don't have the full list
brows in the world so it doesn't really
matter what eyebrows you have you can
make this work you just have to judge it
looking at your entire brow shape to
fill them in and to really follow your
brows natural growth to make it look the
most natural by
just like the bottom part to be nice and
structured because I find that that's
how I make it look at the most neat or
still can kind of natural on fluffy at
the top so as you can see I've done the
same thing on the other eye brow and had
them all nice and filled in I cannot
forget the most important step guys and
that would be clear brow gel clear brow
gel is my life if I didn't have clear
brow gel I knew what my eyebrows would
literally fail this eyebrow gel from
benefit literally keeps my eyebrows
intact all day long it's like hair gel
for your eyebrows and it's been saying
so I just go through and again following
my eyebrows natural growth and just make
sure that everything is nice and in
place and this just makes your brows
look so much fuller you can really place
your brow hairs where you want them to
go and with this eyebrow gel they stay
so that's the best part about this so
that's pretty much all I do for my
eyebrows you guys it's a really super
easy routine it's honestly nothing too
hard and I really feel like it's
something that all of you guys can
handle but this is what they look like
before let me just remind you and now
they're looking sharp but natural at the
same time and I absolutely love it
don't get me wrong sometimes I will
apply more but this is my kind of like
everyday eyebrow and I love it I hope
