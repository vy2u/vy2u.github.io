so today I have another haul for you
guys and this time it's a big one as you
guys know I am always always always
buying from misguided literally whenever
I go from online shop misguided is
always one of the number one online
stores that I go to just because they
are a for-sure win like I'm just forever
finding really cool stuff on there so
they were generous enough to let me pick
up some clothes and starting to focus
more on spring clothing because lo and
behold but finally in spring even though
it doesn't really feel like a I'm just
gonna wear spring clothes brace the cold
in the UK and I'm just gonna look as
permissible oh I have a bunch of stuff
to get through I only have one pair of
shoes so let me get started off with use
the most I'm going to show you guys it's
basically just this really simple black
boot and I don't know I really love
heeled boots I've been loving them
lately just because I've had so many
things recently where I needed to I
heels and for me I love wearing heel and
boobs they're kind of like almost
snakeskin effect but kind of like velvet
effect at the same time it's really
really nice they're just really simple
and classic looking but with a bit of a
twist to it so those and they're really
really nice I just tip it all upside
down aren't you a bunch of dresses and
as you guys know I'm not the galius
dresser like I really do like to I'd say
that my style is pretty like casual
street wear and then I sometimes like to
throw in a little bit of Garlin as' into
my into my style I suppose either like
to dress down on dresses or what takes
things really basic and then keep them
really casual and like add accessories
to them so I've got a bunch of dresses
today so I'm going to show you all the
dresses first I guess to start off with
let's start off with this super basic
dress I think mini dresses that a
long-sleeve like this are so basic but
so necessary is even if you don't like
wearing dresses I just really like stuff
like this because they're so simple you
can stall them up with belts with
accessories to start them up with a lot
of different layers which I love so I
could wear this with like a jacket pad
on top of this just
drape over it just to make it look a
little bit more something you know
because it is so basic by the way all of
the links to these will be down below
and also all of the sizes that I picked
out as well and we so random when I'm
picking my sizes but I'll have them all
or in down below next I picked up this
one and this is this race a dress now
I'm not gonna like the material of this
is a little bit thinner than the other
t-shirt materials that I have from
misguided so I would definitely say to
just be worried about the kind of
underwear that you're wearing underneath
this unless you want it to show but for
me I would probably wear this as more of
something to layer on top of things and
then to have things layered on top of
this as well is racer la stadium on it
and I just love the colors and the print
I've really been loving like this cheque
kind of print recently to the print it
does a lot for itself so you could keep
it really basic I just love printed
oversize to t-shirt effect dresses I
think they're really cool-looking with
the theme I also have this baseball
style oversized t-shirt dress and I
really really love this this is Portland
Oregon on it and again I love the colors
as you guys know white black gray and
red are just my thing so this is just
perfect for me I love the print of this
and you could totally dress this down
and just have this like with it like
denim jacket on top of them I'm just so
excited to start styling dresses more
because I just feel like for spring and
summer this year especially I want to
make them work just because even though
I'm not the girliest it doesn't mean we
can dress down dresses if that makes it
tough to move my favorite dress out of
all of them this is in this crushed camo
style and it's gray you guys this is
just me on every single level like if I
could put me into a jumper dress it
would be this so it's almost in the
style of a sweatshirt of course it's
long enough to be a dress so it is a
little bit shorter than the other dress
it'll this in a particularly small size
so it's a little bit too short
for me I really wanted to dress this
down to have with leggings to wear on an
everyday basis or I could wear as a
dress as well but probably wear shorts
underneath it just because like you know
when you lift up your arms just because
I got it in a smaller size because I
didn't want it to be too oversized on
the other areas of my body
honestly the print of this is just
everything and I just cannot wait to
wear this so next we have this red camo
style dress and
I just you guys you guys this is so
pretty as you guys know I love camo and
then of course with like this deep red
color it's just so nice I definitely
would love to wear this with like a belt
or something like you know those really
chunky belts that you put like almost
like a corset style belt I think it
looked great with this and because it's
a high-neck I'd like to keep it simple
with jewellery like I would probably
wear maybe earrings or something like
that but no necklaces and maybe like a
corset style belt I think that would
look amazing with it this is like a
really comfortable breathable materials
I think this would be great for the
summertime it's like just thin enough
where it's I could not see-through or
anything if you pick the correct
underwear but it is really breathable so
for summer or if you live in a really
hot country this is amazing next up we
have this probably the most feminine
dress out of them all I love this but
unfortunately it's just slightly too big
for me so I think I'm gonna pick this up
in a size down just so it's a little bit
tighter for my body I think I got this
in a size 8 so I'd probably get it
instead in a size 6
but it's this really pretty
off-the-shoulder frilled dress in this
beautiful baby pink color I honestly
love this I think this would be perfect
for like a summer wedding or you could
totally dress this down as well and wear
this to like a barbecue or something
like that as well but there's just
something so classy about this dress
obviously it shows the shoulder and the
collarbone so it's really romantic
looking as well as you can see on the
Tryon it still looks okay this just me
like wanting it to be like getting like
a glove the weather just needs to get
better so I can wear all of these
clothes and then finally the last dress
that I have to show you is this and
honestly this is a real different style
of dress for me but it really fits with
my collar aesthetic as you guys know
love white black grey but the style of
this dress is really really different I
don't think I own anything like this
it's short sleeved but it's got this
striped detail on the arm and I think
that's such a nice touch adds just that
a little bit of sportiness to this
whilst it's still looking really
sophisticated and then it's got that
curb to hem at the bottom which i think
is so pretty and I think it really
enhances your shape which i think is
really nice honestly love this and it
just came out so nice so obsessing
I honestly loved this so much and
finally I have two items that are not
dresses one of them being just a plain
oversized black denim jacket I have an
oversized black denim jacket already but
it has print on it and I just really
wanted a simple one just because this is
so nice to throw on top of dresses to
store it on top of just general outfits
if you want to just drape something over
and you guys may notice and all of my
pictures and stuff I love to drape denim
jackets like halfway down my shoulder
and even pinned up a little bit there
and I just love the way that that looks
yeah I'm definitely going to be doing
that a lot in the spring just because
it's enough to keep you warm but when
it's getting warm I like you can get
away with it so I really like that and I
just love denim jackets I just feel like
I will forever love denim jacket and
then finally this is nice guy this is a
really lightweight hoodie jacket but
it's cropped again it's got the red it's
a little bit of an orange II red and
then it's got a white stripe in the
center and obviously it's got hood and
it's just this really lightweight thin
material almost like satin ish in the
spring and summer especially if you live
in the hot countries this will be
perfect because it just like keeps you
warm but it's wearable at the same time
and I just love this print so much I
think it's sick so guys that is all the
clothes I have to show you today from
