biggest haul ever I don't know how I'm
even going to get through this I'm not
gonna say much because literally I'm I
can't go through them and describe every
single product so I'm going to group
them all and kind of say as much as I
can without this video being
ridiculously long so I'm just gonna jump
straight into it just a little
disclaimer all the products that I have
bought was spent using my own money that
I worked very very hard for and I worked
full-time and instead of spending my
money on alcohol whatever usual 18
year-olds are doing I would much rather
put it into investing into my kit and
just generally making myself happy with
little bits and bobs for makeup because
it is my passion at the end of the day
so the first shop that I online shop
that I got some stuff from was love
makeup duct code UK or comm I'll put the
link in the description box because it's
an amazing website that stops loads of
American brands and things that you
can't get in in actual stores here in in
England and I'm sure for a lot of other
countries as well you can't get certain
products so the first things that I got
from love makeup calm are the OCC
obsessive compulsive cosmetics lip tars
they're amazing I've already got one but
I did want to get some more so the
colors that I've gotten them were annika
which is a really really nice light pink
nude I also got shrimp it which is
trumpets trumpet trumpet I also got
trotters trumpet economically free but
it's like a really really nice few sharp
pinky purple I also got vintage which is
a dark burgundy red and I also got Mary
Ann which is more of a a medium toned
beige nude so those are amazing they're
an amazing finish and they dry too like
a a Mac kind of finish they're really
really nice from love make up.com I got
some sugar pill and Lime Crime goodies
so I really have some of these loose
pigments from sugarpill but Goldilocks
is by far the most popular I believe and
I needed to get it into my life it is
absolutely incredible it shines like the
Sun it's a brilliant brilliant gold
pigment and
it's just amazing it's the most
beautiful yellow pure gold also I got
poison plum which is again an amazingly
popular
pressed eyeshadow from sugarpill I think
it's again got to be one of the most
popular it's a really nice mutt vibrant
purple and purple is my favorite color
so I am just so excited to use this i've
swatched it and it is absolutely
gorgeous it's so pigmented and also from
Lime Crime I got from the Velveteen
collection I believe this is in the new
boo itched collection this is wicked
which is a dark really really dark
bright like burgundy red so that's gonna
be lovely for the wintertime and the
last thing from love makeup calm is this
sigma f84 angled kabuki this is my
favorite brush at the moment it's
absolutely amazing a blending foundation
and so so so quick so also on line I did
a nice NYX NYX shop again we don't find
these in many stores in England so I
just got it directly from the NYX store
again I'll put a link in the description
I got quite a few goodies from there
only so the first thing from NYX NYX I
don't know which one is the best one to
pronounce I'll just say NYX because
that's why I'm you say Oh some butter
glosses and soft matte lip creams I've
already got some of these but I just had
to build up my collection because I
absolutely love the bottle glosses those
are my favorite lip glosses ever and the
first one I got is tiramisu which is a
beautiful beige nude
I got peaches and cream which is this
lovely coral color whoops and I got
meringue which is this lovely babydoll
pink also from the soft soft matte lip
cream collection I got London and Buenos
Aires not very good at pronouncing that
but it's just this coral nude and beige
nude so those are really nice to add to
the collection as well I also got two of
the NYX finishing spray I got a jury one
and a matte one these are absolutely
amazing I really really do love this
this matte one makes my makeup stay on
all day long it is absolutely amazing
and this makes my makeup look jury but
it doesn't really last as long though I
got five lip
I got these are the retractable ones
he's absolutely amazing because they're
gonna last on your lips all day the one
that I'm wearing at the moment as well
this is sand beige this is a really nice
darker tone new so I like to rim it
around the light in you just to darken
it a little bit also I got with the name
of this one dark red which is really
nice to put around some of the dark
burgundy colors that I've bought and
just generally dark dark Reds also I got
plum which I featured it on one of my
Instagram pictures beautiful color it
comes out really really nice and I can
literally put this all over the lip it's
beautiful
also I got natural natural is literally
like a normal node you can put it all
over the lip or you can just Rim it on
the outside it's quite light so I would
say if you are going to put it all over
maybe put a dark lip liner around there
and also I got Ruby which is absolutely
beautiful I think this will go perfectly
with Ruby wou from Mac I'm really
excited to use it so haven't tried it
yet and also I got two of the Black
Label lipsticks these were a bit of a
mistake
picking the lipsticks on there was a
little bit deceiving because they came
up with a lot darker than I am actually
wanted so I got a nutmeg and sand and
they are absolutely too dark for me but
it doesn't matter I'm just gonna put
them in my freelance freelancing kit
anyway so that's fine so that's all I
did online also what I am got around
that time I went into John Lewis and I
got some Naz and Laura Mercier I got the
NARS translucent crystal light
reflecting powder I absolutely love this
because my skin gets quite oily but I do
like a a nice radiant finish so this
helps your skin to look matte but it
does also radiate the skin as well so
that's really nice I also got from Naz
Greek holiday lip gloss it's beautiful
it's like a nude with gold shimmer in it
which is perfect for a nude lover like
me and I also got a blush called luster
which looks like this it's like a gold
orange with a gold Sheen and lastly I
got for Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer
it's the illuminating one and this color
is in golden radiance it's more for one
I have a tan to be honest but generally
it is so gorgeous it looks so radiant on
the skin and if you've got really really
not more skin I say this is perfect for
you because it just covers the majority
of everything and it just radiates the
skin as well so it's absolutely gorgeous
so that was all I got from other brands
now it's time for the Mac Hall there are
a ridiculous amount of products in here
I'm not really going to talk much
through about these if there are any of
these products that you want me to talk
a little bit more in depth leave it in
the comments below and I promise I will
do an in-depth review on it but because
there's too much to talk about
I can't really do it right now so
through an abundance this Victoria
Secret bag and it's full so let me just
hiss fight before this video ends up
being too long so first I'll go through
some foundations that I bought I put NC
40 Studio Fix which is what I usually
use and what I'm wearing now and it's
nice for a full coverage and to help
control oil this is usually what I wear
at work it does usually last but it is
quite thick and it does sometimes break
me out a little bit but it is always
good to have also I got much moister
number 5 this is a lot darker than my
skin but this is mainly for when I'm
gonna go on holiday and if I have a tan
I love matchmaster as all this is
actually my favorite foundation from Mac
it's absolutely gorgeous I also got four
other Studio Fix colors these are not
for me these are for my kit I am
building up my freelance kay at the
moment so these are just for my
freelance kit so I got NC 15 NC 25 NC 42
and NC 43.5 so just a little bit of
everything so I can mix it all together
and the next time I go I'm gonna get
some of the n-double used to have more
of a pink tone as well next I've got
some blushes I got 5 brushes from there
I got peaches which is a pestle orange
which is really nice for my tone or even
a little bit darker it's really really
nice for a nice pop of color onto the
cheeks I also got something special
which is a cream blend blush this is
really good for a drier skin so again
this is going in my kit this is a really
for myself I will use it if I wanted to
use it but generally they offer my care
I also got spring machine which is a
nice pink tone with an a gold Sheen so
this is really nice for again an olive
tone I also bought style which is good
for Asian skin
that looks absolutely amazing on Asian
skin so I bought this again for my kit
it's like an orange and again with like
a gold sort of Sheen to it and the last
one is harmony harmony is a matte beige
tone this is really good to contour for
a much fairer skin so this wouldn't be
the best for me I'm probably gonna leave
this again for my care also I got to
mineralized skin skin skin finishes skin
finishes one is dark and one is medium
dark the dark one I probably like using
it for bronzing so I probably will be
using this for myself and if I need it
for my care I'll take that as well and
medium dark is a good powder for me it's
just a nice all-over powder really I
also got some pan I shadow so these
aren't the ones in the little compact
cases these are just the pan to pop into
a pro palette they're still in the boxes
because I haven't bought the palette
yeah I do have palettes but I forgot -
believe it or not after all this stuff I
bought and should you forgot to buy the
palette to put it in so I have to wait
until I NEX card to get these so they're
still in the boxes so I got corduroy
which is a nice warm dark matte amazing
that I think it's a matte Brown yeah I
got twinks which is a really nice I'd
say it's like a shimmery Brown I
commonly see from the packaging but it's
quite warm I also got expensive pink
which is like a rose gold tone it's
really really lovely I can't wait to use
this one actually I actually want to use
this in a tutorial for summer so let me
know what you think also I got honesty
honesty is like a cool toned light brown
with a lot of shimmer in it has like
gold shimmer in it so this is really
really nice for any skin tone really but
on a darker skin it's really nice for a
light color on the lid we've got green
smoke which is a quite a dark smoky
green it's got a hint of green and a
hint of gray in there as well so it's
nice very green smokey eye
I got gleam which is a really really
nice pink orange shimmer which I like to
use on the inside of the eye and the lid
it's absolutely a brilliant color so I
can't wait to use that on some of my
clients I also got para disco which is
like an orange coral color this is
absolutely amazing on an Asian skin so
this is going
really really useful as well for my
freelancing and obviously just
recommendations for you guys as well if
you guys do you want me to do tutorials
to suit different skin and also all that
glitters which is a favorite from every
everyone I don't actually have this so I
thought I just grabbed that as well
next are a lot of eyelashes I bought
four pairs of the 48 lashes these are
quite full and quite a round shape so
this is really good if you want a long
lash that spreads out the whole eye and
it doesn't elongate to one side it is
quite full so I'd say if you've got
quite a small line these aren't really
and the best but these are really really
nice on just like a nice smokey eye so I
got these just to use for work really I
also bought two pairs of number fours
the number fours are amazing these are
my favorites for Bridal this just gives
a really really nice
wispy look and it's quite natural as
well so I got this for my bridal clients
and I also had I had two pairs of 36s
but I used one the other day so 36 is
they're quite similar to the floors but
the elongates was the end so these are
quite good for Bridal as well I also got
one pair of number 7s these are really
nice for a nice dolly look or to put on
someone with quite long lashes already
just sit in between the lashes so these
are amazing these are quite a big
favorite in the store and two pairs of
34s which are really really long and not
very full to be honest they have natural
and synthetic hairs in there as well so
it has brown running through it and it
also has black running through it so
those are really nice as well next I
have some eyebrow pencils I bought three
but I'm using one at the moment so I got
three spike toys I've got some lip
glosses the lip glosses that I bought or
love neck guitar which is this really
really nice peachy nude with a gold
Sheen I got nice buzz which is a plush
glass I got ample pink which is again a
plush glass very very popular and I
bought nymphet which is a pink tone with
a lot of gold running through it so
really excited to use these in my
freelance
I also bought some pigments for my kit
these are a must if you're a makeup
artist pigments they are so
multi-purpose use blah-dee-blah they're
amazing honestly I don't know what I'd
do without them now that I've used them
in store I don't know what I'd do
without them in my freelance kit so I
got naked which is a brilliant natural
shimmery and kind of all over the lid
and it's a really really nice highlight
as well for a darker skin vanilla is a
amazing multi-purpose product I love to
use this on every skin tone it has a use
for absolutely everyone
I might do a video of all the uses of
vanilla pigment because I could think of
literally over 10 uses for this probably
even 20 actually and I also got tan
which is again amazing color for loads
of different skin tone so hopefully I'm
gonna help um these are gonna help me I
mean to work on my freelance I also got
strobe cream which is a really really
important and part of someone's kit it
does really help for a dull skin it
helps to revitalize and give the skin
quite a lot of moisturization and make
the skin look really nice and glowy
underneath foundation as well I also
bought a Giro glue because I haven't
actually had one of these for absolutely
ages so I really wanted to get one of
these it's perfect to have in your kit
as well and I also bought two lip
pencils I got sore and strict down one
is a pink and one is a nude Brown I got
one lipstick considering lipstick is
like my favourite part of anything I'm
surprised only got one I got all fired
up which is part of the retro matte
collection I love the retro mattes I'm
slowly getting them they're amazing I'm
not really a bright lip kind of kind of
girl but I am trying to adventure a
little bit more so this one was for
myself so I'm hopefully going to wear
that let me know if you want to see that
any tutorial also I bought one mascara
for myself I bought extended play
gigablack lash this is an amazing
mascara for the bottom lashes it's
complete Coop's it's completely transfer
free and it does not crumble so I need
that for the bottom of my lashes because
it always always transfers no matter
what and that's what the brush looks
like it's brilliant last but not least I
got some brushes the brushes that I
bought are
the one line one which is a
square-shaped foundation brush it's
quite flimsy so this is really really
good for applying concealer under the
eyes or generally all over the face
foundation this is I wouldn't use this
on myself I'm more gonna use this on for
my freelance I also bought a 168 as you
can see I've used this one this is my
favorite blusher brush I love to put
blusher and bronzer on the apples of my
cheeks with this and it's so soft I also
got the 188 because I needed another one
this is just really really good I love
to blend and concealer with this and
just blend all over to be honest so
that's definitely one of my faves I also
got the 2 1/2 which is like a mini
version of the foundation brush that I
just showed you this is amazing for
carving out eyebrows absolutely
incredible so that's going to be really
useful as well
and I also got two small brushes I got
the 2 6 6 and the 2 1 1 this is a really
short and stubby eyeliner brush this is
perfect for creating a really defined
look because it's so fun but the brush
isn't gonna go everywhere so it is
really good to create a really thick
nice line and I also got the 2 6 6 which
is my favorite brush for eyebrows of all
time I will never ever change my mind
about this it's absolutely amazing and
the brush fibers just make it so easy to
fill in your eyebrows and I also love
this for doing liner as well
oh so guys that is the end of my haul I
hope that recorded it or I would hate to
think that that did not just record so
