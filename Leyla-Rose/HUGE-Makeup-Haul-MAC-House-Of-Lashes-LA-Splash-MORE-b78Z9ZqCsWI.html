going to be doing a haul with you guys I
am so excited because I have been
purchasing makeup like crazy recently so
I have so much to talk about and I'm not
gonna go too into depth I always say
this but then I always end up trying
about makeup for so long so I'm gonna
try and show each bit as briefly as
possible I have a lot of stuff and I've
just been purchasing a lot of makeup
from different companies so there's not
just like one specific brand I just have
a ton of different brands right now so
I'm really excited and I hope that you
guys are excited too so I'm walking
around bought too much I will have
everything linked down below to
somewhere where you can purchase it
whether it's in the UK or the u.s. let's
just jump straight into it
majority of these were online orders so
a lot of the time I was kind of picking
out things and I wasn't really sure why
I wanted did decide to make a order on
Selfridges online and I don't know why I
decided to pick Selfridges because I
didn't actually pick anything that's
exclusive only to Selfridges I realized
that they were selling NYX products and
I wanted to pick up some next stuff and
the next website basically had nothing
so I decided to just purchase it from
Selfridges instead so I picked up six
new soft matte lip creams I picked up a
bunch of different colors I'm only gonna
show you guys some swatches this is in
the shade Cairo or Cairo I don't really
know how to pronounce that but it's just
a really nice soft nude shade and it's
really pretty and I used it today
actually on top of a lip liners this
just kind of lightened up the lip liner
and I just absolutely love this this is
one of the shades I picked up so picked
up Abu Dhabi as well which is a darker
kind of spicy yet nude like a medium
brown nude and I really like this this
is just a really nice natural lip shade
also picked up cans which is this really
pretty move nude shade like an a pink
move nude kind of in between all three
and this is really nice I really wanted
to pair this up with Wow and saw on the
planner also picked up Prague which is
this really nice magenta shade I don't
know why I decided to get this because I
don't usually wear shades like this but
I just kind of thought I didn't really
have anything like this in my collection
so I decided to pick this up and this is
just a really pretty like kind of deep
magenta shade and I also picked up two
super dark ones I picked up Copenhagen
and also Transylvania
Copenhagen is more of this really deep
wine shade and then Transylvania is a
very very very dark pop pool and i
noticed when i swatched this on my hand
that Transylvania is a little bit patchy
probably cuz it's so dark but I really
like Copenhagen and I'm hopefully gonna
find a way to use Transylvania and then
the last two NYX products I picked up
were these two butter lipsticks I have
not been able to get hold of these in
the UK for ages for some reason they
never stopped them on the UK NYX website
and then when I saw them I was like okay
I need to buy at least like one or two
so I picked up one in the shade sugar
wafer and then in the other one pops
your wafer is a really light peach nude
and then pops is a little bit more of
kind of like a brown emotive nude and
excited to choose these first and I
really wanted them to smell like the
butter glosses but they don't smell like
them I don't know if it's just the batch
I had do y'all smell like the bug losses
because I really wanted these two
smaller kebab losses that was the main
reason I got them and then the last
little thing I picked up from Selfridges
I think powder I have been wanting to
try it for so long
during this product being raved about on
YouTube for so long I decided to pick up
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder and this is the loose one and I
used it today and if you really liked it
but I haven't really had a really nice
amount of time to test it yeah my skin
still isn't right at the moment so I
really feel like I can't really test
anything on my skin kind of feels like
this so I'm hopefully gonna love this
I'm sure I won't because everyone pretty
much does so you guys will definitely
see this being used a lot more in videos
it's probably been a while since you
guys have seen me have a little matte
cool because I did used to work for Mac
I do feel like I have a ton of Mac
products I don't ever really feel like I
need to pick up anything else I was
running low on fix+ so I decided to pick
up a new bottle so that's this the main
thing I went into Mac all just to pick
up another bottle at fix+
this is my favorite hydrating spray to
spray this before and after makeup just
because it really like helps makeup to
just look nicer fresh shredded to pick
up a wall lip liner as well because I
saw I was in stock and I just haven't
been able to pick it up for like yes
because of Kylie Jenner I just obviously
that little gravy train has slowed down
so I decided to pick one up so this is
just
the classic while lipliner you guys have
obviously seen this before so I won't
even bother like going too much into
this but this is just a nice kind of
like movie shade of lip line I don't
really have a lip line in this shape so
I did really want it for a long time and
then the last couple of things I got
from Mac with just some lipsticks I did
it back to Mac because I just had a ton
of Mac empty so I was like why not and
so I picked up three new lipsticks that
are fairly new that I don't actually own
and I just decided to pick them up so I
picked up Stone which is you guys know I
love stir that blindness this is
basically stuff that line up in a
lipstick and this is really pretty it's
just like a nice cool toned Brown grey
turned brown it's like a great brown
basically and then I also picked up whoa
lipstick as well and this is the same
color as well lip liner any lipsticks
again it's like ink move nude shade and
it's quite a deep color but again it's
perfect for fall and winter so I really
wanted to pick this up also picked up
naturally transformed really pretty
flesh trying to nude this is looks like
it's gonna be really nice for my olive
complexion and it really has that nice
fleshy tone to it
it's quite dark as well it's not too
light so it's gonna make your lipstick
too pale so it's a really nice nude
shade and all three of those lipsticks
are in the matte formula I also did some
shopping in the drugstore as well I
picked up two pairs of Eila eyelashes
one in the number one to six which if
you guys have been watching my channel
for the last couple of months you guys
know that I was using these so much at
one point then I also picked up the Isla
149 lash and these say exaggerate on
them these remind me of quite a wispy
style a flash I've never tried these
before so I'm really excited this just
looked really nice and just simple but
it should be purchased the collection of
a stroke liner this is one of the
blackest and most matte liners I've ever
tried so I really do like this to go on
top liners that are a little bit shinier
because just super mattifies everything
and it just makes it look really bold so
I don't like this to sculpt out my liner
I like to use this just to go on top of
them so I repurchase this and I've
literally been using this as eye
must have been about 14 so I've been
using this for a long time then I also
decided to purchase these scandaleyes
waterproof remote liner if you guys saw
me talk about the nude version of this I
was looking in the drugstore for a black
version and then I finally found it I'm
gonna be excited to try this
I have not tried it yet and I'm just
really excited to see if it's as good as
the nude one and it just actually stays
on my waterline and then it was three
for two so I decided to pick up a lip
liner as well I picked up the Rimmel
under my spell lip liner and kind of a
nice why interment which would be nice
for this time of year and the last thing
I picked up from the drugstore what
these Real Techniques sponges last Real
Techniques sponge that I used to death
finally fell apart and I just have to
throw it away so I decided to pick up
this two pack think this was ten pounds
whereas one is usually $5.99 so I think
you saved like a pound and I'm always
using these almost every day as well as
my norm Beauty blenders as well so I
liked I just thought just get two
because I'm always doing tutorials like
may as well have okay so I also done
quite a bit more shopping online this is
a love makeup coat at UK shop you guys
know I love that website and again a lot
of my makeup of this you guys aren't
already seen some of these in some of my
previous videos because I bought these
about two weeks ago I pick it up four of
the liquid lipstick lip couture from la
splash and the first one is personally
my favorite because you guys know I love
nude shades this isn't the color
innocent vixen and this is just a really
nice pretty peach toned nude it's not
too overly picky though it's quite light
so I do feel like I do need to put a lip
liner around this otherwise my lips just
kind of disappear a little bit and so I
absolutely love this and I just love it
the formula of these are amazing they
are super waterproof the only thing is
that when I start to eat it kind of gets
a trim around the inside of your lips
the only problem with these and I do
feel like if you apply too much of it it
does start to kind of fall up and
crumble away we do not need a lot of
this but yeah innocent vixen is
definitely one of my favorites I totally
didn't mean to get two shades that were
very similar but I picked up one in og
glish and one in cryptic og ghoulish and
cryptic are very very similar
you guys probably won't even be able to
tell the difference from far away they
look pretty much the same they're both
called
nudes but the only difference is that Oh
G ghoulish is just a little bit more
gray toned and a little bit darker
whereas cryptic has a little bit more of
a pink to it and it's just a little bit
lighter
I'll slip could sure when I picked up is
in the shade and malevolent and that's
this shade right here this is a very
very very deep purple shade does the
only one I actually haven't try it on my
lips yet v swatch this and it does look
very similar to the other one I picked
up the only difference is this is a
purple undertone and this is a red
undertone this one is the la splash
smitten lip tint waterproof mousse and
Sabonis I haven't really noticed a
difference between the two formulas but
yeah I did use this in and get ready
with me not too long ago and I
absolutely love this color it's almost
like the deepest burgundy thing you
could possibly get picked for us going
into the winter time and I just
absolutely love this so I'm definitely
gonna be wearing this one a lot more in
the last product i picked up from love
makeup was this beauty blender cleanser
in the solid one I noticed that with my
Beauty Blender
it just doesn't the stains just don't
come out so I wanted to get the actual
cleanser that is meant to come with it
and they actually send me a little small
one as well which is really cute I also
placed an order on house of lashes
finally am i right how long have I been
doing makeup and I have never tried
house of lashes lashes so many people
talk about the lash style iconic I was
like okay I need to pick up top one
iconic
and one north very first just because I
wasn't sure what the shipping was gonna
be like I didn't get charged any
shipping fees or anything when it came
to my door just the shipping when you
initially pay for it it wasn't too bad I
think it was like five pounds maybe um
I'm not too sure but it wasn't too bad
and I decided to pick these both up
first just to see how I liked them and
then if I loved them I'll probably get
the 3-pack one I think you can get like
three of each of these for a lot cheaper
so I'll probably do that later but I
just so I'd see if I like them but I
have not used these yeah I'm just so
excited you guys are definitely gonna
see this in tutorials and I didn't want
to touch these until I showed you guys
in this haul and I also picked up a
house of lashes glue because the only
clue I ever really use on the eyelid
glues duo and that's pretty much it but
I've heard really good things about it
it actually smells like like floral it's
weird like you don't blush don't really
smell
fishy this smells floral which is really
nice and this is just a clear white
adhesive so I'm really excited to try
these and I will probably be placing
another order very soon as I'm finally
onto the last part of the whole I did a
makeup revolution haul straight off
their website makeup revolution are not
only super cheap but they do a lot of
juice for high-end products which I love
specifically they do a lot to face dupes
and you will definitely see lots of them
in this hall are there blushing hearts
and I picked up four of these these are
basically boxed blushes are like pretty
much dupes for Too Faced I have not
tried the box to heart blushes from Too
Faced personally the only two-faced
product I actually own is the chocolate
bar palette it's up in four shades so
I'll just quickly show you guys these
shades I picked up one of them is this
triple baked blusher in candy Queen of
Hearts and that's this shade right here
this is definitely the most pink out of
all the ones I picked because if you
guys know me I don't wear a lot of pink
shades I also picked up another triple
baked blush in a peachy keen heart and
that is this one right here this one is
personally one of my favorites it has
kind of like a pink stripe going through
the middle and apricot shade on one side
and then a gold so you could use the
gold as I'm high life so picks up a
triple baked blush in the shade a peachy
pink kisses and this is again actually
this is quite pink as well we didn't
really realize this is pink again but a
nice light shade of pink with a little
bit of a peach Sheen to it that one at
the bottom is particularly my favorite
shade but the one just there because
it's pink and it has like a gold Sheen
to it and then the last one I picked up
is probably more of a highlighter for
some people this is definitely gonna be
a highlighter on my skin tone this is a
blusher in the shade iced hot and this
is gorgeous I mean I'll just swatch this
one for you so you guys can see that
it's makeup revolution look cute enough
to send me like this whole song this is
a song why did not purchase this and I
also did not purchase this either they
gave me a free palette and this free
whole blush and some please I did not
purchase they just sent these to me as
like a free gift which i think is
amazing like how amazing is that this
says it's called the ultra blush palette
sugar and spice test
so this is just a test oh there's the
free sample pilot that they sent me so
there has kind of like three different
looks in it and I'd say like these are
mainly yeah pretty much all shimmer but
how cute and the palette is all rose
gold and black Beijing is one of the
best ever like look how cute that is
those who purchased three lippies from
makeup revolution as well one I bought
as an accident and then the other two I
liked one of them and then the other one
I don't know if I'm really gonna wear
but such as life of ordering online I
ordered two salvation velvet lip
lacquers and I thought I was purchasing
three but one of them is actually a
gloss and I didn't mean to buy a gloss I
thought all three were velvet lip colors
first one is this shade right here it's
just like a really nice pretty coral
pink this was an accident I honestly
thought this was gonna be more of a
mauve pink because online it did look
more mouth oh well I'll still use it
anyway and this one which actually did
intend to buy which I really wanted it's
basically the same short shade as rebel
lipstick from Mac and this is the shade
color of this oh it's called velvet
ripple um so yeah this is meant to be
like a similar shade of rebel by Mac and
I am so excited because this is super
matte as well which I love so I wanted
to purchase another nude liquid lipstick
as well but I accidentally purchased a
lip gloss which I did not mean this is a
salvation intense like us this isn't
matte this is actually a gloss spin
lastly what I'm the most excited about
is I purchased three pallets from makeup
revolution now if you guys haven't seen
these before you were probably gonna get
so excited because the moment I saw them
I got very excited I'm not gonna love
the first one that I have to show you
I'm just honestly so damn excited to
show you others what does this remind
you of okay so I'm gonna do a video
dedicated to dupes but not only does the
packaging totally I feel like it's
pretty out in some ways I don't know I
mean I love the fact that I don't if you
guys can see this but it's like melted
chocolate oh my gosh babson that I still
love the chief this is my favorite
makeup palette wife I love this pretty
much got it spot-on I've known you guys
gonna be able to see that but look at
the difference this is the I heart
chocolate palette from makeup revolution
I picked up three of these in different
shades I also picked up naked chocolate
which is like white chocolate how cool
is that I absolutely love this and I
don't know if this is a dupe for any
pallets that you may have but this is
just mainly quite neutral and natural
shades it has a mixture of mattes and
shimmers just like the previous
chocolate one and then I also picked up
one last one which is another juice is
there salted caramel palette and again
it's gorgeous total dupe for the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette from
Too Faced and I was just so excited
because I actually don't own that yeah I
probably will end up picking up anyway
actually have more of these online this
is only three out of five I believe so
I'm so in love with these look how
pretty they are just as they are they're
stunning
so guys that's the end of my haul I hope
you guys enjoyed as you can see I had a
lot to go through so I didn't want this
