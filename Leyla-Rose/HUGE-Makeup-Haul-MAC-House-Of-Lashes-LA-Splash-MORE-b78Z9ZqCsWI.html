going to be doing a haul with you guys I
am so excited because I have been
purchasing make up like crazy recently
so I have so much to talk about and I'm
not gonna go to into depth i always say
this but then I always end up trying
about makeup for so long so I'm gonna
try and show each bit as briefly as
possible I have a lot of stuff and I've
just been purchasing a lot of makeup
from different companies so there's not
just like one specific brand I just have
a ton of different brands right now so
I'm really excited and I hope that you
guys are excited too so I'm walking
around bought too much I will have
everything linked down below to
somewhere where you can purchase it
whether it's in the UK or the US let's
just jump straight into it majority of
these were online orders so a lot of the
time I was kind of picking out things
and I wasn't really sure why I wanted
did decide to make a order on Selfridges
online and I don't know why I decided to
pick Selfridges because I didn't
actually pick anything that's exclusive
only to Selfridges I realized that they
were selling Nick's products and I
wanted to pick up some next stuff and
the next website basically had nothing
so I decided to just purchase it from
Selfridges instead so I picked up six
new soft matte lip creams I picked up a
bunch of different colors I'm hopefully
gonna show you guys some swatches this
is in the shade Cairo or Cairo I don't
really know how to pronounce that but
it's just a really nice soft nude shade
and it's really pretty and I used it
today actually on top of a lip liners
this just kind of lightened up the lip
liner and I just absolutely love this
this is one of the shades I picked up so
picked up Abu Dhabi as well which is a
darker kind of spicy at nude like a
medium brown nude and I really like this
this is just a really nice natural lip
shade also picked up cans which is this
really pretty move nude shade like an a
pink move Newt kind of in between all
three and this is really nice I really
wanted to pair this up with wall and saw
the planar also picked up Prague which
is this really nice magenta shade I
don't know why I decided to get this
because I don't usually wear shades like
this I just kind of thought I didn't
really have anything like this in my
collection so I decided to pick this up
and this is just a really pretty I kind
of deep magenta shade and i also picked
up to super dark ones i picked up
copenhagen and also Transylvania
Copenhagen is more of this really deep
wine shade and then Transylvania is a
very very very dark purple and I noticed
when I switch this on my hand the
Transylvania is a little bit patchy
probably cuz it's so dark but i really
like Copenhagen and I'm hopefully gonna
find a way to use Transylvania and then
the last two nics products I picked up
with these two butter lipsticks I have
not been able to get hold of these in
the UK for ages for some reason they
never stopped them on the UK next
website and then when I saw them I was
like okay I need to buy at least like
one or two so I picked up one in the
shade sugar wafer and then in the other
one pops your wafer is a really light
peach nude and then pops is a little bit
more of kind of like a brown motive nude
and excited to choose these first and I
really wanted them to smell like the
bottom losses but they don't smell like
them i don't know if it's just the batch
i had do your smell like the bog lost is
because i really wanted these small
Ichabod bosses that was the main reason
i got them and then the last little
thing I picked up from Selfridges if a
powder I have been wanting to try for so
long to hearing this product being raved
about on YouTube for so long I decided
to pick up the laura mercier translucent
setting powder and this is the loose one
and I used it today and I do you really
like it but I haven't really had a
really nice amount of time to test it
yet my skin still isn't right at the
moment so I really feel like I can't
really test anything my skin kind of
feels like this so I am hopefully gonna
love this I'm sure I walk because
everyone pretty much does you guys will
definitely see this being used a lot
more videos it is probably been a while
since you guys have seen me have a
little mad cool because i did use to
work for mac i do feel like i have a ton
of mac pro oxide don't ever really feel
like I need to pick up anything else I
was running low on fixed plus so I
decided to pick up a new bottle so
that's this the main thing I went into
Mac all just to pick up another bottle
at fix+ this is my favorite hydrates
brave to spray this before and after
makeup just because it really like helps
make up to just look nice him fresh
shredded to pick up a wall lip liner as
well because i saw i was in stock and I
just haven't been able to pick it up for
like yes because of Kylie Jenner as
obviously that little gravy train has
slowed down so I decided to pick one up
so this is just
the classic world lip liner you guys
have obviously seen this before so i
won't even bother like going too much
into this but this is just a nice kind
of like movie shade of lip line i don't
really have a lip line in this shape so
i did really want it for a long time and
then the last couple of things I got
from Mac with just some lipsticks I did
it back to Mac because I just had a ton
of mac empty so I was like why not and
so I picked up three new lipsticks that
are fairly new that I don't actually own
and I just decided to pick them up so I
picked up stone which is you guys know I
lobster but blindness this is basically
stuff that lineup it in it lipstick and
this is really pretty it's just like a
nice cool toned brown grey turned brown
it's like a grey-brown basically and
then I also picked up whoa lipstick as
well and this is the same color as well
lip line up any lipsticks again it's
like a move nude shade and it's quite a
deep color but again it's perfect for
fall and winter so I really wanted to
pick this up also picked up naturally
transform really pretty flesh toned and
new this is looks like it's going to be
really nice for my olive complexion and
it really has that nice kind of fleshy
tone to it it's quite dark as well it's
not too light so it's gonna make your
lipstick too pale so it's a really nice
nude shade and all three of those
lipsticks are in the matte formula I
also did some shopping in the drugstore
as well I picked up two pairs of Isla
eyelashes one in the number 126 which if
you guys have been watching my channel
for the last couple of months you guys
know that i was using these so much at
one point then i also picked up the ILA
149 lash and these say exaggerated on
them these remind me of quieting bespeak
saw a flash I've never tried these
before so I'm really excited this just
look really nice and just simple but
it's repurchase the collection file
stroke liner this is one of the blackest
and most Matt liners I've ever tried so
I really do like this to go on top
liners that are a little bit shinier
because just super mattifies everything
and it just makes it look really bold so
I don't like this to sculpt out my liner
I like to use this just to go on top of
them so I repurchase this and I've
literally been using this as I
must have been about 14 so I've been
using this for a long time then I also
decided to purchase these scandal eyes
waterproof remote liner if you guys saw
me talk about the nude version of this I
was looking in the drugstore for a black
version and then I finally found it i'm
really excited to try this have not
tried it yet and i'm just really excited
to see if it's as good as the nude one
and it just actually stays on my
waterline and then it was 342 so i
decided to pick up a lip liner as well I
picked up the Rimmel under my spell lip
liner and kind of a nice wine in Turin
which would be nice for this time of
year and the last thing I picked up from
the drugstore were these real techniques
sponge is lost Real Techniques sponge
that I used to death finally fell apart
and I just had to throw it away so I
decided to pick up this two-part think
this was ten pounds whereas one is
usually 599 so I think you save like a
pound and I'm always using these almost
every day as well as mine own beauty
blenders as well as I liked I just
thought just get to because I'm always
doing tutorials I may as well have okay
so I also done quite a bit more shopping
online this is a love makeup khodet UK
shop you guys know I love that website
and again a lot of my makeup of this you
guys would have already seen some of
these in some of my previous videos
because i bought these about two weeks
ago I pick it up for of the liquid
lipstick lip couture from la splash and
the first one is possibly my favorite
because you guys know I love nude shades
this is in the color Edison vixen and
this is just a really nice pretty peach
toned nude it's not too overly picky
though is quite light so I do feel like
I do need to put a lip liner around this
otherwise my lips just kind of disappear
a little bit and so I absolutely love
this and I just love it the formula of
these are amazing they are super bowl to
prove the only thing is that when I
start to eat it kind of gets up rim
around the inside of your lips the only
problem with these and I do feel like if
you apply too much of it does start to
kind of ball up and crumble away we do
not need a lot of this baguette innocent
vixen is definitely one of my favorites
I totally didn't mean to get two shades
that were very similar but I picked up
one in OG glish and one in cryptic OG
ghoulish and cryptic are very very
similar you guys probably won't even be
able to tell the difference from far
away they look pretty much the same
they're both
tone nudes but the only difference is
that og ghoulish is just a little bit
more gray toned and a little bit darker
wherever as cryptic has a little bit
more of a pink to it and it's just a
little bit lighter I'll slip could sure
one I picked up is in the shade of
malevolent and that's this shade right
here this is a very very very deep
purple shade does the only one I
actually haven't tried on my lips yet by
i've swatched this and it does look very
similar to the other 1i big tub the only
difference is this is a purple undertone
and this is a red undertone this one is
the LA splash smitten lip tint
waterproof mousse and to be honest I
haven't really noticed a difference
between the two formulas but yeah i did
use this in and get ready with me not
too long ago and i absolutely love this
color it's almost like the deepest
burgundy that you could possibly get if
it for us going into the winter time and
I just absolutely love this so I'm
definitely going to be wearing this one
a lot more in the last product I picked
up from love makeup was this beauty
blender cleanser in the solid one I
noticed that with my Beauty Blender it
just doesn't the stains just don't come
out so I wanted to get the actual
cleanser that is meant to come with it
and they actually send me a little small
and as well which is really cute I also
placed an order on house of lashes
finally am i right how long have I been
doing makeup and I have never tried
house of lashes lashes so many people
talk about the lifestyle iconic I was
like okay I need to pick out of one
iconic and one nor fairy first just
because I wasn't sure the shipping was
going to be like I didn't get charged
any shipping fees or anything when it
came to my door just the shipping when
you initially pay for it it wasn't too
bad i think it was like five pounds
maybe um i'm not too sure but it wasn't
too bad and i decided to pick these both
up first just to see how I like them and
then if I love them i'll probably get
the three pack 1 I think you can get
like three of each of these for a lot
cheaper so i'll probably do that later
but i just so i'd see if i like them but
i have not used easier i'm so excited
you guys are definitely going to see
this in tutorials and i didn't want to
touch of these until I showed you guys
in this hall now I also picked up a
house of lashes glue because the only
clue I ever really use on the eyelid
lose duo and that's pretty much it I've
heard really good things about it it
actually smells like what floral it's
weird like you don't blush blue actually
smell
fishy this smells floral which is really
nice and this is just a clear white
adhesive so I'm really excited to try
these and I will probably be placing
another order very soon as I'm finally
on to the last part of the hall i did a
makeup revolution hall straight off
their website makeup revolution I'm not
only super cheap but they do a lot of
dupes for high-end products which I love
specifically they do a lot two-faced
dupes and you will definitely see lots
of them in this hall are there blushing
hearts and I picked up four of these
these are basically boxed blushes are
like pretty much dupes for two-faced I
have not tried the box to heart blushes
from Too Faced personally the only to
face products I actually own is the
chocolate bar palette it's up in for
shade so i'll just quickly show you guys
these shades i picked up one of them is
this triple baked blusher in candy Queen
of Hearts and that's this shade right
here this is definitely the most pink
out all the ones I picked because if you
guys know me I don't wear a lot of pink
shades I also picked up another triple
baked blush in peachy keen heart and
that is this one right here this one is
personally one of my favorites it has
kind of like a pink stripe going through
the middle and apricot shade on one side
and then a goal so you could use the
gold as a high life so picks up a triple
baked blusher in the shade peachy pink
kisses and this is again actually this
is quite Pinker's while we didn't really
realize this is pink egg am but a nice
light shade of pink with a little bit of
a peach Sheen to it that one at the
bottom is particularly my favorite shade
but the one just there because it's pink
and it has like a gold chain to it and
then the last one I picked up is
probably more of a highlighter for some
people this is definitely going to be a
highlighter on my skin tone this is a
blusher in the shade iced hot and this
is gorgeous I mean I'll just wash this
one for you so you guys can see that it
is super kick me taking you guys see
that makeup revolution look cute enough
to send me like this whole song this is
a song why did not purchase this and I
also did not purchase this either they
gave me a free palette and this free
whole blush so please I did not purchase
they just sent these to me as like a
free gift which i think is amazing like
how amazing is that this says it's
called the ultra blush palette sugar and
spice test
so this is just a test dog this is the
free sample palette that they sent me so
it has kind of like three different
looks in it and I'm say like these are
mainly yeah it pretty much all shimmer
but how Q and the palette is all rose
gold and black Beijing is one of the
best ever like look how cute that those
who purchased three Libby's from makeup
revolution as well one I bought as an
accident and then the other two I like
one of them and then the other one I
don't know if I'm really gonna wear but
such as life of ordering online I
ordered to salvation velvet let blackest
and I thought I was purchasing three but
one of them is actually a gloss and I
didn't mean to buy a gloss I thought all
three were velvet lip colors last one is
this shade right here it's just like a
really nice pretty coral pink this was
an accident I honestly thought this was
gonna be more of a mouth pink because
online it did look mom oh oh well I'll
still use it anyway and this one would
you actually did intend to buy which I
really wanted it's basically the same
short shade as rebel lipstick from Mac
and this is the shade where's the color
of this oh it's called velvet rebel um
so yeah this is meant to be like a
similar shade of rebel by Mac and I am
so excited because this is super matte
as well which I love so I wanted to
purchase another nude liquid lipstick as
well but I accidentally purchased a lip
gloss which I did not mean this is a
Salvation intense lack of this isn't
matt this is actually a gloss pin lastly
what I'm the most excited about is I
purchased three pallets from makeup
revolution now if you guys haven't seen
these before you were probably gonna get
so excited because the moment I saw them
I got very excited not gonna lie the
first one that I have to show you I'm
just honestly so damn excited to join
bothers what does this remind you of ok
so I'm going to do in video dedicated to
dupes but not only does the packaging
totally I feel like it's pretty out in
some ways i don't know i mean i love the
fact that i don't if you guys can see
this but it's like melted chocolate oh
my gosh absently love that i still love
the Chiefs this is my favorite makeup
palette by file of this be pretty much
got it spot-on I've known you guys gonna
be able to see that but look at the
difference this is the i hot chocolate
palette from makeup revolution i picked
up three of these in different shades i
also picked up naked chocolate which
is like white chocolate how cool is that
I absolutely love this and I don't know
if this is a dupe for any pallets that
you may have but this is just mainly
quite neutral natural shades it has a
mixture of mats and shimmers just like
the previous chocolate one and then I
also picked up one last one which is
another juice is they're salted caramel
palette and again it's gorgeous total
dupe for the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette from to face and I was just so
excited because I actually don't own
that yeah i probably will end up picking
up anyway actually have more of these
online this is only three out of five i
believe so i'm so in love with these
look how pretty they are just as they
are this stunning so guys as the end of
my hole i hope you guys enjoyed as you
