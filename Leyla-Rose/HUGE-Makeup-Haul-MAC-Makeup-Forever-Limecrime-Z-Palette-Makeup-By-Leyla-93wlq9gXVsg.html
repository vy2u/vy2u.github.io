another haul with you then loads of
unnecessary money great just want to say
again I really really don't want to brag
I don't want to make anyone feel bad
about this or you know feel anything
any hatred towards me it's just you know
I spend this with my own money I enjoy
buying makeup a lot of it is not for
myself as works for my kit and yeah I'm
a hard-working girl so let's just jump
right into it so I can't even carry it
it's worse the last time okay sorry it's
always bad when they give you the big
math bag so it's a common garden which
is a pro store it's in central London
and it's 100% my favorite store that I'd
like to go shop in it's got all the pro
products so it has more than just the
normal basic line it has all the pro a
little it's a has all the pro pigments
it has everything that is not available
in normal free-standing stores and
normal department stores so the stool
that I work in don't have half of the
stuff they have in there so I'm always
like a kid in a candy shop when I walk
in there so yeah I am just gonna jump
straight into it I just get a couple of
things online a couple of days ago so I
thought I'd just include them as well so
I'm going to do them first the first
online shop that I ordered from was a
shop that you've heard me talk about
before it's love makeup Dakota UK they
basically have loads of stuff that isn't
available in retail stores in the UK so
we have stuff like sugar pill lion crime
Z pal a brush guards loads like glitter
Kryolan you name it so it has loads of
stuff that aren't available and are also
available so I'm always shopping through
there and getting stuff for them the
first thing that I got was in utopia by
Lime Crime this is the new Velveteen
lipstick lips lip cream lipstick it's
basically a cream and it dries into a
matte finish and this is like a really
nice magenta color and it's it's amazing
it's really comparable to flower
fabulous in a liquid form which turns to
a matte and you can basically just like
talk to her lips and it doesn't come off
so it's just incredible and the color is
amazing I also have this featured in a
tutorial coming up
keep your eyes out for that one next I
bought something that I haven't bought
ever and everyone else has one and I
don't so I think what I love to see
palette the reason why that I wanted to
buy this is because I am planning on
buying some makeup geek shadows and also
I have a couple of things lying around I
want to pop in there and I've always
wanted one another I bought it I will
probably be buying lots more so I
haven't put anything in there it comes
with some magnets as well which I think
a really really clever so anything that
you do pop that doesn't have either
metal or it doesn't have a little magnet
at the back they come provided so I
think that's really really good and yeah
I'm really looking forward to that's a
really nice size and this retails at
about 20 to 21 pounds so that was really
good last thing that I got from love
makeup is the Aussie and a foundation
palette so this is really good I got
this for my kit and this has one two
three four five six 18 slow counting and
this has 18 colors in it so you're gonna
get a bit of a shine here but yeah it's
got Asian different colors and I think
it's really really good for your kit so
if you if there's any colors that you're
unsure of you don't have in your care
it's amazing to have these to mix
together it's good for contouring it's
really good it's similar to the
graftobian I've also heard good things
about this one as well and I saw this on
that website and I've been wanting to
get it for a little while so I thought
that I would now that I'm doing some
shopping for my freelance kit so this is
really good I'm quite excited to use
this I used it a couple of times and
myself and its really good for
contouring so this is amazing I'm
looking forward to this it's quite thin
as well which is good obviously you
don't get a lot of product in there it's
not for you no use on yourself so much
because it is quite you know thin you
just want to take it just to mix
together to thin whatever you going to
be using it for it's you know in small
amounts because you can see how thin is
the next place that I shopped at is a
place called the next place that I've
shopped at online was the Guru makeup
Emporium I'd never bought from this
store before because I've just never
really got around to it I never owned
anything makeup forever before but as
its approaching Halloween and I've
always wanted one anyway I thought I'd
get myself
and make up forevers flash palette now
if you haven't seen this have you been
hiding under a rock all your life
because this is one of the most raved
about things online every artists
professional anyone has either had this
used it when they're gone and they've
had they've had it like it is amazing
and now I know why there are the
creamiest textures as you can see I've
already been in there I posted up a
picture not long ago when I first got it
I was like oh my god forget this I have
to try it yeah they're the most
creamiest things ever oh my god it's
just like heaven on little this 12
colors in here it has a two shimmery
color so it's got a gold and a silver it
has a coral a light blue a pink a yellow
a brown a white a red a blue a green and
a black so this is really good you can
mix anything with this you can get
foundation colors mix for this you can
get lip colors you can do eyeshadow
bases they're meant to be waterproof I
believe on we're all too resistant or
something
so these it's meant to be incredible so
this is a good addition to your kit it's
amazing for Halloween so for my
Halloween tutorials that are going to be
coming up in the next couple of weeks
I'm going to be using most likely this
and a couple of other things as well so
oh my god I'm so excited to use this for
loads of different stuff not just
Halloween based using it just generally
as an artist learning how to create
different things with it so I'm really
excited to use that and let's get on to
the Mac haul so the first thing that I
have pulled out is this travel bottle
there are two in here this is really
good for either cleanser or toner or
whatever you like to use when you're on
the go in your kit so I like to try to
use a brush cleaner in this this is
really handy because if you need to
clean your brushes in between customers
or clients or generally if you're on the
move and you don't have time and you
don't want to bring loads of huge
bottles with you these are really good
and you can fill them up with whatever
you want so I think I'll probably use
makeup remover in one of them and
probably brush cleaner in the other but
yeah you can use it for what you need
really you can get these from anywhere
but I saw them and I just saw chucked in
next I got three of these mineralised
loose foundations these are incredible
I've used them obviously in the store I
work in I've used them a lot and I've
never actually bought any so books
for my care to the colors that I've got
are extra light medium and dark so I
just sort of got three sort of middle
colors and then you can mix them
together or you know just three sort of
different colors you don't need to be
getting all the colors but oh my god
these are amazing they reflect light
really beautifully so even though it is
a powder they reflect the light
they have 77 different minerals and they
are really good for dry and oily skin
they're good for any skin they sort of
come to hydrate but they still do absorb
oil really nicely so I'm just going to
show you what it looks like in one of
them I couldn't I just literally came
and filmed straight away so everything's
still in the boxes so that's what it
looks like and the powder obviously
comes through there it's a really nice
milky powder comparable to bare minerals
but I honestly prefer these so these are
absolutely amazing so next I got some
full coverage foundations these are
really good for my kit because they have
no SPF in it whatsoever so they look
really really nice on camera they're
quite thick but they can be thinned down
so it's good as a multi-purpose
foundation to have so when you have a
kit you don't want to be having millions
in different types of foundations in
your kit you want to stick to two or two
three or even just one so this is really
good because you can work with this so
I'm really excited to have some of these
I do have one already what I'm actually
going to do which I might film if you
are interested is I'm gonna put these
into one of the palettes that I bought
so I bought basically it's slot palette
so they have empty slots and you sort of
just you pop them and pop them in and I
think that's a really good way of
creating space in York instead of having
loads of loose things so I have nw20
nc15 NW 35 and NW 45 so I'll just show
you how it comes so it just comes in a
little clear top thing it's similar to
the old style of the mineralized
skinfinish is and it's just like that so
there's a lot in there and it's really
really creamy the next thing I pulled
out which I'm really really excited for
are three Pro lip palettes so I am so
excited for this these are really really
good for all I care or you can just get
them generally for yourself as well so
this is called six modern
groans so as you can see it comes with a
couple of different shades of nudes and
browns and this is really good for
having in your kit because you could
sort of mix around it and it's better
than having to carry around loads of
bullets of lipstick so I'm gonna go for
these sort of form of lipsticks more
than the other bullet form because it
just wastes so much space and this is
the editorial read so this is really
nice because it's got loads of different
shades of reds and this and then lastly
I bought the pink so these are
absolutely amazing they've got some baby
Pink's and they also have some hot hot
pink and a purple shade next I bought
some face and body foundation I have
bought some of these as well for my kit
already but I have C 1 and C 9 the
reason why I don't like getting loads of
them in between is because they are just
so easy to mix especially when they're
quite liquidy so when it comes to stuff
like this I just sort of get c1 is the
lightest cool color and then c9 is the
darkest cool color so this is what it
looks like this is 120 ml and it comes
in a really nice form like this these
are really easy to work where this next
I've got some Studio Fix foundations I
got the colors nw15 NW 25 NW 45 and NW
35 so I don't know if you remember last
time when I bought these I bought the C
colors and then this time I bought some
n:w colors so the ends of NCS and we'll
yellow tone and NW so more pink toned so
now I just sort of have four or five
from each tone and they're very easy to
mix together and yeah it's just nice to
have a couple of each one so I've got a
few darker shades as well which is
really good next I got some more
eyelashes as per usual I do love the Mac
lashes I got four pairs of the 36 lashes
they are just a really nice wispy style
lash which extend towards the end
these are definitely a favorite for my
kit because they look good on absolutely
everyone you have to extend the eye
whilst not looking too unnatural so I've
got four of those because I just love
them I also bought two number 7s which
are a really nice dolly style looking
lash that's what they oh God that's what
they look like and these are just really
really easy to pair up with any look and
any eye shape they just gives the lashes
some more definition and make them look
more spiky so these are quite easy to
wear on any eye
so that I read you love those and lastly
I've got one for myself I mean I do
deserve something for myself I bought a
pair of number-two lashes these are
really nice wispy and long perfect for
me I love these with just a really nice
nude iron nude lip with nice long lashes
so these guys are really nice I'm going
to be wearing those soon next I've got
some lip liners and a chroma graphic
pencil I got the lip liners in cherry
night moth and stone and cherry is just
a really nice bright cherry red as you
know like it sounds well I think it's
really really nice and it just pairs up
with a nice matte red or any red really
but it's quite versatile you can use it
with any red so that's why I like that
one and I also got night moth which is a
really really dark one in color at very
very dark and this is just really easy
to manipulate lipstick so if everyone a
manipulate a lipstick into looking a bit
more pinkish you could just pop a little
bit of this underneath I also bought
stone which is a really nice 90s star
lip liner it looks quite greyish and
it's nice paired up with the nude so
it's nice for this 19 years I've that's
been going around recently
and the Kurama graphic pencil I bought
is in NZ 15 to nw20
this is a nude eye pencil so or you can
use it anywhere else as well obviously
but this is basically used for the what
I'm going to use it for the waterline to
brighten up the eyes if you don't want
to use white sometimes white can be too
overpowering especially on a darker skin
tone so this is just a softer version of
opening the eyes without making a lip
too posh so guys next I got some
sculpting powders and some shaping
powders so these are to contour and
highlight I also got some pro palettes
as well to pop them into which I'm going
to show you in a sec so these are to
highlight and to contour so I got three
shades to highlight and three shades to
contour so it all fits into one palette
so I got the shaping powder in emphasize
this is a really light under-eye
highlight or pilot for the cheekbone
whatever this is really bright so this
is going to be good for a lighter skin
tone or if you want a really bright
under eye highlights I also got the
shaping powder in soft focus which is
more of a banana shade which obviously
is very popular at the moment this has
been really nice mixed with a little bit
of emphasize just to brighten it up a
little bit and I also got a little bit
of walnut light which has
orange undertone which is really good
for correcting dark under eyes so if you
have dark under-eye circles
mixing a little bit of this with a
little bit of the maybe the yellow one
those are really really good for
counteracting under-eye circles and the
contouring powders that I bought are
sculpts which is this really cool toned
Brown like a cool brown and then I got
shades star which is a little bit warmer
and it also is I mean it a bit good for
my sort of skin tone or anyone really
but it's a little bit warmer than the
last one and then I also got definitive
which is very dark and it's going to be
good for a darker skin tone so those are
really good just to create my own sort
of sculpting palette which is good for
contouring when I am doing my freelance
work so that's gonna be all in one place
I'm really excited for that so as I was
in the protis draw I wanted to get the
brown script because this is an amazing
color so really wanted to get this one I
also got texture which is a really nice
warm brown this is a really nice
transition color it's a little bit
shimmery but you can get away with it I
also got Brown which is a really nice
dark brown it's good for filling in
eyebrows for people with darker hair
like myself or just generally a dark
brown for the outer corner it's really
really nice I also got roll which is a
nice toned down orange so this is good
just to warm up any look I've got some
bright oranges but I don't have anything
that's a little bit more toned down like
this one so this is an excellent
transition color just to warm any smoky
eye up I also got dazzle ID which is a
really nice highlight for under the brow
and inner corner it's very bright and
very pigmented so it should be used in
very small amounts but this looks
amazing with any skin tone also I got
black type which is a very very light
cream color and it's really really nice
for a base color it's really nice all
over the lid it's also very nice for the
brow highlight as well if you want them
matte brow highlight so this is really
really good though I also got the pro
palettes that I was telling you about so
basically what Mac do they do these
empty Pro palettes that you can use on
their own so you can place things in
there on their own and fill them up or
you can place an actual insert in there
and they do various different types of
inserts you can get eyeshadow inserts
like this one
so as you
see this is inserted into this and it's
magnetic so you just pull pop each
eyeshadow in now for blush you can also
have a 12 and a 24 I think of the empty
one so basically what you can do is you
can melt down lipsticks you can put in
foundations you can do whatever so they
also have a customizable one as well so
I bought two of those and I also bought
two different inserts so one of the
inserts that I've got are for the
contour and colors that I bought so for
these sculpting and the shaping powders
I bought this one and this is basically
just to slip in each of them and it's
going to fit into the palette and that
means they'll be nice and safe inside so
it'll be easy for me to use and I also
bought one of the customizable ones as
well so what I'm gonna do with this one
is I'm gonna use the full coverage
foundations and I'm gonna pop them into
here this just makes it really really
easy to carry around everything you can
also put some in here you don't have to
put obviously the full amount in there
and they will just stay nice and safe
and you can have a really nice color
range as well so I'm probably gonna do
the top row of the full coverage
foundations and I'm probably gonna do
the bottom one as something else I'm
thinking I'm gonna do the bottom ones as
the Bobbi Brown foundation sticks
because I love the formula but the stick
form is really annoying so I'm gonna put
some of them in here I already have two
sticks and I'm thinking of buying some
more I also got the toe kwatak Mac
fragrance I've been meaning to get this
for ages this is a really nice smell
that sort of smells quite fruity and
floral E and sweet and everything I'm
not good at describing fragrances i'ma
make a biased I'm not made for this kind
of stuff but it's really really nice
it's got a nice summer scent I know I'm
going into the wrong time of year for me
to have this but and why not keep that
summer scent all year round this is
really really nice and it also comes in
a smaller form as well by I got the
larger one last but not least brushes so
a Mac cool cannot be complete without
buying more brushes of course
so the brushes that I got are one face
brush so I bought the 190 I bought
another one of these for my kit because
I literally go through so many of go
through them
I literally used so many of these these
type of paddle foundation brushes these
build the best coverages and I really
like these brushes I know some people
hate them but sometimes it's a quick
applying more coverage that's why I love
these ones so I bought one more it also
brought one more two one seven because
who can have two million what two months
Evans I mean these are the best brushes
ever so it might just brought another
one I also bought a two for two I
haven't used one of these before and all
my colleagues have been telling me this
is amazing for the lips so I bought one
of these to use for the lips as it fits
perfectly with a Cupid's bow so everyone
says to use them like this so yeah I
might try that as well I also bought
another - one - this is the one that I
have used previously to carve out my
eyebrows and yes it actually is a really
really nice brush and I do love using it
but the one that I'm using it did get
ruined pretty quickly and so I still
have it but I did want to buy a fresh
one and keep it a little bit more safe
so I probably be keeping this one for
myself
I also brought another - one for brush I
love using this for the lips for a
smaller lip shape or even generally
throw on your more lip shape this is a
really nice shape just to put lipstick
on and it grabs a lot of product as well
so because it's so firm it is amazing so
I love using that I also bought a two on
line brush this is a pencil brush I like
using this to build up darker colours in
the outer corner because it's so fun you
can generally build up as much color as
you want
and it would be so opaque I love this
brush I think it's one of the best and
it is very very firm and it stays firm
as well and also I bought the 2 6-3
brush I bought two of these one is for
my kit and one is for myself I've never
bought this brush before this is
apparently one of the best brushes for
eyeliner and eyebrows so I was like oh
my god why haven't I used this yet it's
basically shaped exactly like the two
six six but the two six six is a lot
more of a sort of spread out brush like
the hairs on as fine whereas this one is
literally so thin can feel that this one
is more synthetic hair and the other one
is made from natural hair so I wanted to
try this and I'm really excited so yay
oh my god guys I always feel so tired at
the end of doing this because it's so
draining talking constantly I really
hope you're not bored with me but I'm
bored of myself so I just need to go and
put this makeup away and grab a tea and
watch some Netflix
because that's my life right now so guys
