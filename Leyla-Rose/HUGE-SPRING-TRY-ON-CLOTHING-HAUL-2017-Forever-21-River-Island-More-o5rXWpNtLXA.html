so today I have a lot of my hair out and
you can see this is how my hair
naturally is I conceal it very well so
if you're new to my channel you would
probably never know that my hair is
curly but it is I don't know let me know
what you guys think down in the comments
I'm right now by tomorrow or the day
after I'm going to be sick of it and I'm
going to show you again anyway today I'm
going to be doing a clothing haul it's
been a while since I've done one Ds I
think the last one I done was in summer
of last year so it's been a long time
and I've been buying quite a bit clothes
lately I tend to buy clothes quite
consistently throughout the year so what
I've got so far is just what I bought
within the last week or so and it's
quite a lot of stuff so I'm going to be
showing you guys what I bought today the
majority of the stuff is suitable for
spring in my country because where I am
it's not really cool yet summer for us
tends to get a little bit warmer in the
UK it's just not that great so so I'm
just going to be showing you guys what I
bought today if you like these kind of
videos and make sure you give it a
thumbs up and let me know if you want me
to do more of these because some of you
I love buying clothes and I just want to
show you guys all the clothes I'd buy if
I'm doing it too often I might be
putting some on my vlog channel so make
sure you subscribe to my vlog channel as
well because I do put a little extra
uploads on there as well they aren't
just vlogs so make sure you go and
follow that to channel as well as well
as all my social media and if you're not
subscribe here as well what are you
doing subscribe and let your on into
this clothing haul okay so first of all
I'm going to get started off with some
stuff I got from River Island and the
first one is this bag that I've already
started using it's this faux leather bag
and it's a backpack style bag thing I
really really like this bag I've already
been using it and I just think it's so
handy especially for this time of year
cause I just feel like I know it just
can carry all of your essentials it's
got a bucket at the front and then it's
got a pocket a bigger compartment at the
back and yeah I really like it's got
some zip detail at the bottom as well
that's not actually a rosette it's just
zip
decoration and I just really like the
way that this fit I think it's a really
really nice size as you can see it's
just you know not on mini backpacks but
it's a decent size you can actually fit
normal things in there you guys are
going to see throughout just everything
to be honest my room my clothing
everything I tend to buy usually is
monochrome white black grey those were
kind of colors I like to go for I have
some exceptions like with greens news
and some light pinks and burgandy's but
very very few of them I don't tend to
wear lots of them whatsoever so I'm a
very intim on Akram at the moment so
from River Island on that same trip I
bought two pairs of sunglasses from that
this is one of the pairs of glasses that
I've got from River Island I just think
they're so cool I think it would look a
lot bail without the tire had to be
honest with you this is just a really
nice reflective silver with a silver
frame as well as I got it in rose gold
as well and it's exact same frame but
it's a different color I just think
these are so fun I love the style of
emitters have any that have this kind of
rounded top shape usually the kind of I
don't know what this little bit of metal
that goes across it's called the
majority of graphs that have goes
straight across
rather than carved like this so I also
got it in this rose color it looks
really really pink but then when you
turn it to the side it looks a little
bit more gold and then the actual frame
is rose gold as well so got both of
those from River Island I love these and
I also went to metal and now if you're
on UK you're going to be like Mattern I
was at four home stop and there was
actually a few decent bit so I'm going
to show you guys what I got from there
because I don't know I was quite
pleasantly surprised by what stuff I
actually found in metal and the first
item I have to pull out is this bomber
jacket now I love bother jack is to be
honest they're just so so nice and this
is a really nice detail when it has
black and white stripes on the arms on
the bottom of the hem and then also the
top hat near the neck as well I really
like these for the springtime because I
just feel like it's not warm enough to
go out with nothing but you do need a
life jacket and I just like bomber
jackets to have as a life jacket I also
picked up two sports bras from Matalin
as well and I'm not gonna try on disease
because I don't know I don't feel like
I'm at the fitness stage to show you
guys my best stomach with a sport bra
because we've all just got this plain
grey one obviously I'm obsessed
grade like white and you can never
really have too many sports bars I find
especially if you go to the gym often
and then I also got this book right as
well and this is just like a pattern I
don't even know what kind is it looks
like really close-up of palm trees so on
that same trip when I went to River
Island I also went to Miss Selfridge as
well and picked up a really nice t-shirt
and some rings but I cannot find the bag
that I put the shopping into that
obviously I didn't take up a lot so if I
find it I'm just going to insert a try
on here I believe it was like a band
print T because I really wanted one of
them also for what some new trainers as
well and I bought these nmds I'm in love
with these in love
these are definitely my new favorite now
these I actually bought from JD online
and I believe these are actually from
the children's section and that's
because my feet are quite small that I
can sit into the children's sizes I
believe the children's sizes go up to a
size 5 so I think if you're in UK size 5
you can still find these but they were
quite low on stuff on it all of them so
I'm not entirely sure I'll try and find
a link and leave them down below so
though then finally the last place that
I shopped out with forever 21 I actually
bought quite a few things from there the
first thing I might will tell you is
this chopped I'm wearing because I'm
probably going to forget it basically is
one of these are like crewneck jumpers I
don't know if that makes any sense but
it's a Silver Lake CA on it California
it's really sleazy on the inside and I
love it so I got one of these because I
just love these types of jumpers I've so
many of them and I'm going to get old
because they are so so comfy and even
though for a lot of countries you would
have wear this in the spring you would
in the UK because that's what it's like
it the first thing I thought out is this
pair of heels and basically I just I
just needed a pair of heels really I
wanted a comfortable heel but that also
had a decent amount of height I don't
know how I'm gonna show you this
properly so the next thing I pulled out
is another sports bra and this one is
gorgeous so basically have a slight like
v-neck as it goes down and in the back
is sort of a crisscross back
and it also is made out of this net
material which is really really
comfortable
I love this top so the next stop I have
is another print t-shirt and again it's
got the contrast hem it's white and
black and then it has currently with
little bits of food on it and I just
think it's so late I hope this is
substantially latoque the next piece
that I've pulled out the black cropped
Jean piled with a really nice neck
detail it has this lace up front and
then on the arms and the bottom of the
hem it has these stripes and I think
this is really in for this time of year
very spectator or anything like that
it's got a really nice loose fit to it
so I really like that okay compression
kept in google putting me all next I
pulled out this camo t-shirt but it's a
really nice light camo I don't think
it's too dark so I think it's really
nice for the spring it's got a really
nice just it's always like camera colors
but a pastel version the green is like a
really nice pastel car key and it fits
really nicely and I feel like it's a
nice kind of jumper to tie up in a knot
at the front I love doing that with
t-shirt so I just really like this if I
picked up this white jumper it's really
nice because it's quite tight on it
really hugs the body nicely and I really
like it it's slightly cropped it's not a
full-length jumper but it's not super
cropped either where it goes above my
belly button so I really really like
this also the back detail is really nice
it's got this really nice tied up
detailing right behind the nape of the
neck I have quite a few body shoots
which I really like to wear because I
feel like it fits your body really
nicely I got this one which is a really
nice soft feeling body and it's very
very casual since I got this in grey and
then I also got this in a white cream
color as well it's not a total pure
white is slightly cream so I also got
some more button-up body suits this one
is a vest with a racerback detail and
this is again a queston material feel
quite stretchy but very breathable so
it'll be really really nice for the
summer time when shorts or you can wear
jeans this one is really really loose
and stretchy so I thought this is going
to be more of a again I'm very very
casual one something I just wear to go
and run errands or something like that I
think this one's just a bit too casual
to wear out we'll see how it
is on and I accessorized but generally
this one the feel of it and just the way
it looks is a very very casual looking
at top picks up another contrast t-shirt
which seems to be a very common spoon
full spring for me and that is this like
a white one and then on there it says
California cruising the SOI looks so
cute and I think that's really really
nice for the springtime I bought this
gray v-neck crops desktop in a way I
kind of wish it wasn't as crops as what
it is because I do like crop tops but
this is just a bit too short for me I
wish it was just a bit longer because it
fits so well so I'm going to be looking
out on forever 21 for a slightly longer
version of this it's ripped and it just
fits so well I just love the way that
this feels it's quite sick and it just
feels really good quality so if I could
find something like this that's a bit
longer I would love to wear this more in
the summer because I just feel like this
kind of vest top is what I'm looking for
so now anywhere you can get these but in
a full size please let me know because I
really want to buy some of these in
white black and gray of course another
contrast t-shirt this one is just
totally plain and it's ribbed and it's
just comfortable and again it's just
really nice and casual and light for the
spring and summer so very very happy
about that and it's why I'm black which
are my favorite colors and then I also
got this really flowy pretty top and
this is something that I probably would
have wear in the spring this is more of
a summer top for me because I just feel
like it's not appropriate for the UK in
the spring unless it's really hot and I
have a really nice Razorback detail
there so it's just really nice it's
quite flowy and I think this would look
so nice to the bikini underneath and the
last piece of clothing that I have is
this cropped denim jacket I don't have
any denim jacket
so I bought this one and I really really
like it a few rips on it it fits really
nice the arms are slightly rolled up
okay and then I also got three pairs of
sunglasses from forever 21 because they
were so cheap I cannot get over how
cheap they were I think they were
roughly around like 5 to 7 pounds
maximum which I think it's just so cheap
guys unbelievable
so the first pair that I got was these
and these are really cool because
they're circular the frame just comes
out slightly on the outer
of the frame and you think it looks so
cool simple leaves which are slightly
bigger and they have this blue
reflective thing to it with some light
it doesn't look that reflective when you
hit the light properly they are so blue
I just love it and I do when I look out
it does look blue at all but obviously
on the outside it is and then finally
the last tip I got is probably one of my
favorite and that's this one and there's
slightly more square and again they kind
of have a retro look to it either the
sunglasses the cat is looking me like
I'm absolutely insane right now like
what are you doing so guys that was all
that I bought this time if you guys want
to see more clothing hoards and let me
know down below in the comments I hope
you enjoyed I don't want it to be too
rambling where I talk about the clothes
because it just would have been way too
long otherwise so I hope you enjoyed it
me and boo we'll see you next time bye
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
