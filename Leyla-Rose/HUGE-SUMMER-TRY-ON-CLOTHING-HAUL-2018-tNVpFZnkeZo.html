channel so I'm in a very different setup
right now I'm currently in my living
room in my new apartment and if you guys
are confused then you probably aren't
subscribed to my blog channel I'm gonna
leave my vlog channel in the eye right
there if you guys want to subscribe and
watch my videos about moving out I'm
gonna post it to so far but more is to
come and yeah just it's been a hectic
month or so but that's why I've been
pretty absent from the channel as well
because everything's just been really
hectic so yes that's where I've been
pretty much and this is my new living
room I'm still trying to figure out
stuff I'm still trying to figure out
like how things are gonna be as far as
like filming setups and stuff so please
bear with me whilst I find my feet
because I'm such a perfectionist like I
probably am NOT gonna find something for
a while but we're just gonna move around
until we find something so I'm just
sitting in my living room I'm just like
leaning on my couch just yeah but it's a
really nice like summery vibe inhale so
if it's a bit echoey in here I'm sorry
it's quite an open space I'm not too
sure how it's gonna stand until I edit
this so I pull the jeans I do have my
microphone but I don't know how it's
gonna sound so hopefully everything's
all good and you guys like this setup be
sure to comment down below if you guys
do and you want me to film more videos
because it's just relaxed you know I'm
just like on the floor just a really
chilled to set up and I'm just gonna
tell you guys if some clothes that I've
picked up lately and some stuff I think
is gonna be perfect for summer so if you
guys like try on whores especially for
the summer I want to do quite a few this
summer be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
let me know some stores that you think I
should be shopping at down below and
let's get into this summer okay so I
don't know what to go in and for go in
for thighs go into bus I shopped out
quite a few places some are online
somewhere actually in store but I will
have everything linked down below if
things aren't in stock I will try and
find alternatives and the closest thing
to that go up the most stuff from this
guy
Nasty Gal so I reckon all do those buzz
the item from misguided is this
off-the-shoulder crop top and this you
can actually see from far away but there
are red stripes and then on either side
of the red stripe there's green which is
kind of like a little bit Gucci esque
I'm not gonna lie like I'm not massively
into designer stuff personally but when
I saw this actually come in person I was
like oh there's green on it and it
actually reminded me a bit of Gucci so
if that's your vibe then it's gonna be
good but I just bought this because I
really like stripes if you can already
tell I think they're really nice and
they're definitely in for this summer so
yeah I think this is really nice I love
off-the-shoulder tops and it's got the
kind of like thrilled hem at the top and
misguided I actually picked up two pairs
of bottoms now you guys know I buy
trousers from misguided I keep trying
with misguided to love their bottoms but
they never fit me so I'm not entirely
sure how these are gonna fit me I don't
know if I'm too sure I'm quite full
which isn't like super short and it's
not to like I like I guess it's like a
below average but they're they're just
always too long for me anyway these are
the first pair of bottoms I tried
they're very out there for me
they're basically cargo pants and it's
red with navy and black which is so out
there for me I don't wear stuff like
this and I also got this pair of cargo
pants as well from misguided and these
are this kind of like a khaki color it
has this chain detail which I think is
so cool it has like a military vibe to
it very like it's cool I don't know I
just really like it time this has a belt
loop which I love because I have a small
waist so I have a feeling that this is
more likely to fit me because I can put
a belt on it and I can just kind of
manipulate it a little bit more so I
picked this up and you guys know I'm not
the girliest and I don't really buy a
lot of pink stuff but when I saw this I
was like oh my gosh okay because it's
because it has the red on it just the
contrast of the red and the pink is just
so cute I just knew I had to pick this
up so this is a croc t-shirt and I just
I love it it says 1990 on it I love the
contrast hem with the actual color of
the top I'm doing well with my colors
guys if you guys have been following me
for a while you know I do not wear a lot
of color so I
I'm doing well reasons I also picked up
this kappa top and this is on misguided
as well I think I've got this in a
larger size oh no it's in a small but
it's quite oversized as you can see it's
pretty large on me and you can wear it
as is or you can tie it up I imagine
I'll probably be tying it up because
it's me and then finally the last item
of clothing from misguided is this um
bro navy jacket now if you guys watched
my misguided medicine bear whore you
oversaw that I picked this up in bread
it was quite small for me so I actually
picked this up in a medium yes instead
of a small this time so it could be just
be my oversized but I really love the
style of it I really love Umbro and I
just love the vibe of this it also picks
up a couple of accessories I feel like
it's so hard to show you by the
accessories
oh okay let's say you could leave the
sunnies and I have don't really I
haven't bought Sonny's in a while I used
to buy them all the time but not it's
summer again I just feel like it's just
necessary you know oh my gosh everything
looks like one you know so with this
color do a little bit more of an oval
shape and I just really like the look of
these I already have these kind of like
yellow tinted glasses in more of an
aviator style but when I saw these I was
like oh my gosh this is so nice because
it doesn't take up your whole face and
you can kind of just like sit them on
the edge of your nose and it just kind
of like adds to it you know the next
door that we have is nasty out of this
mesh dress let me see I would definitely
have to wear something underneath this
it's see-through pretty much so you have
to wear something underneath this I know
a lot of people like to wear like just
stuck a bra or something but that's
totally up to you I personally wouldn't
but it is what it is quite see-through
to just bear that in mind it's not like
a t-shirt dress actually as men should I
picked up this simple t-shirt that says
sugar on it I really like just the red
on the white I think that's really cool
this was really pretty and simplistic
but I just like the one and the red at
the same
timed of this tesha which says paradise
on it again it's red white and blue
which I really love those colors tick I
thought but this is an overly crop top
so you would definitely have to wear
something underneath this I would wear
like a sports bra that comes down and
then probably with something
high-waisted personally myself but it's
totally up to you I know everyone's
different when it comes to how much of
themselves that they want to show but
personally I don't like things being too
overly cropped I also picked it up which
I'm super happy about these are actually
inside out because I've already tried
these on I was really interested to try
these because I just really I've just
been looking for a good pair of mom
jeans and I really really like these -
these are some mom jeans that I picked
up from Nasty Gal
and they are obviously very ripped but I
really really like these and I think
because they're so ripped they're really
nice for the summer time I know not
everyone likes ripped jeans but I really
do so these are mom style they obviously
don't shape to your body whatsoever so
you kind of lose your shape that's the
whole point but I really like the way
these fit with a belt on I just really
really like it and they just fit the way
that I would want mom jeans to fit and
then finally we have a faux leather
jacket it's the way leather jackets all
the time I'm really glad that I picked
up another one and I'm glad that it's
faux leather because I don't really feel
the need personally to like buy leather
when it's unnecessary like I'm not a
beginner anything okay so next let's get
into I got from up an outfit and the
first thing that is peeking out of this
bag all these sunglasses and when I saw
these I was like I need these like in
every way now you know that saying like
how life looks with verse tinted glasses
these glosses would fulfill that saying
earnestly love this and I love it
they're so big and Circulo so definitely
a cool accessory to have for some us
from Urban Outfitters I picked this off
and honestly when I saw this I just knew
I needed to pick this out kind of like a
blue tube or a strapless I don't know
what these
what does this even sound believable and
it's this really pretty yellow tartan
print
I'm obsessed like I really have started
to love yellow but especially the kind
of more muted type of yellow so it's not
super bright this would look good on a
lot of skin tones but I really think
that like tans to deeper skin tones like
yellow is a really nice color so I
really love it the way that this looks
on my skin tone and again this would
look incredible on a lot of deeper skin
tones so we're going to open up it is
it's always dangerous because I just
love everything in there but when I saw
this I was like okay the last thing that
I picked up from Urban Outfitters I
didn't get that much from there because
money this top right here it's an it's a
t-shirt that says infinity on it 1994 to
1995 at the bottom I was born in 95 so I
was like that's me this is just really
nice obviously has the prints on it and
I believe Japanese print on the bottom
of it as well which is beautiful and
then I also went in to Topshop on that
same shopping trip and I picked up this
skirt now I've been looking for this
kind of skirt for ages and I wasn't able
to find one that fit me really well but
I ended up picking up the Topshop okay
just a skirt I really really like this
it is fairly short but not too
over-the-top like I felt like even
though it was quite high-waisted it does
fit me really nicely I do feel like I
have to wear a belt though because again
my waist is quite small so yeah but I
really like this and it's a really
pretty denim miniskirt so I'm glad I
have that as well it's kind of like a
must-have I believe in your in your
closet it's up another one of these
frilly boob tubes but this is just a
simplistic black one just because again
like these were the boob tube so pretty
I wanted just a normal black one because
I just feel like these are so like
diverse you could just wear these with
so much and then also from Topshop I
picked up this champion Teesha I bought
this in a size medium I wanted this to
be oversize that's why I picked this up
in a medium and you guys know how I feel
about you know the contrast baseball
style t-shirts and then obviously it has
a printed champion on it so I love it
and I
they think it's pretty and I'm excited
to wear this one in the loft store buy
went into was actually put in there now
if you guys have been hard to pull them
back I'm kind of like quite new to it as
well I would say that stuff is so nice
and it's quite inexpensive it's kind of
like a cheaper version of up and alpha
it's a little bit but they don't really
carry other brands up and pull them bare
they kind of just their own branded
stuff but the vibe is very urban outfit
so if you haven't tried them I
definitely recommend going and looking
at them desktop is actually this vest
that I'm wearing and it's just this
really pretty a v-neck striped ripped
crop top and I just think tops like this
are just my favorite because they're so
easy to wear they look so summery and
like I said I love stripes I just think
they looked so nice then I also picked
up this body suit as well from pulling
back I thought this was so cute it's
just a ribbed white bodysuit with this
rainbow detail and I just thought so
pretty again very easy to wear very like
simplistic and minimal but I love the
little color print that's on it I also
picked up this cropped vest top and I
think again this is really nice because
the whole hem and the straps are thicker
and they are striped again which i think
is really nice and it says crystal piers
on it and it's just really pretty
finally you guys I'm almost done I got
two pairs of socks from pulling back I
really love stripey socks so I got these
white socks with a rainbow on it and
then it was says what these a mustard
striped socks as well because I do love
my socks I'm not gonna lie but that is
actually the end of this hall I feel
like I had so many clothes so I didn't
go into everything so much but I didn't
want this rule to be too long the for
