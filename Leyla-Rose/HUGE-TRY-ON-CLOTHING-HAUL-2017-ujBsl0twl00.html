I always do the clap especially when I'm
in my bedroom I don't know why I would
do the clap so today I have a clothing
wolf you guys and I'm so excited just
because I have been buying clothes like
crazy lately you know what it is but
ever since my life changed it's a little
more like myself especially in my sense
of style now more than ever the last
couple of months have been at finding
myself for sure and I'm going to be
doing a lot more fashion videos
especially on this second channel so be
sure to subscribe to my second channel
if you haven't already just because I am
going to be doing more books on there I
know keep saying it I've just been my
headspace just hasn't been clip I'm
getting into it and I'm so excited
because I have so many ideas it's just
bringing them to past it's been quite
hard I'm going to try my very best to
leave all of the details down below and
try and link everything that way it's
easier for you to find less on into this
video just be sure to give it a thumbs
up if you enjoy it and let's go okay so
the first item that I wanna show you
guys I love this I haven't had the
chance to wear it yet see when I've seen
this on my Instagram which wasn't follow
me on Instagram just because I've been
posting so many outside pictures and
stuff like that on there recently so yes
be sure to follow me this is the first
item that I have to show you and it's
this mesh top with this red print like a
logo on the front front has this red
black and white detail and it says what
feels like the end is often at the
beginning and I love that so seeing for
my life right now and I just love it
it's just so nice it's an oversized top
I bought this in the size 6 but it is
oversized this would be really nice to
tie it up as well I've wear something
like a like a brawler or something
underneath there I think I've been
really really pretty also bought this
item from a sauce and this is a t-shirt
dress and what I love about this t-shirt
dress is not only as its it really
really nicely but the details on the
shoulders are just everything it has
this lace up detail where it's like the
sleeves are laced on and I just think
that's such a cool like edgy way to wear
a t-shirt dress it's basic this is
nothing on the front nothing on the
backs you can style up how you want but
the detail on the arm just really add to
it and I love
so I want to definitely pick it up I
also went into Topshop and I bought a
couple of stuff from there I've been
loving logo t-shirts lately and you're
going to see a theme with that example
so many logo t-shirts and t-shirt
dresses I think they're really like on
point right now I just want a lot of
places have been making a little good
one so one of the first ones is this
really cute stripy top and it says on
the front of it no very month with roses
on it I feel like we're against a book
I'm just so popular but like I like to
resist before everyone's I get crazy
about them my name is Lila Rose people
okay this is basically a white and black
stripy top and it says no very much on
the front it's like kind of a high neck
top it is cropped but it's quite loose
actually really like the thing of this
so from Topshop I got this really cute
logo t-shirt and it says you just turn
on it three times
je t'aime je t'aime je t'aime and it's
written in this orange color and the
actual teacher is this gray like I think
it's called green mole like distressed
gray and this is again like is kind of
like a box t-shirt so it doesn't fit
tightly to you it is slightly cropped
but it covers everything when I'm
wearing high-waisted jeans so this is
just a really nice simple top just
everyday kind of wear today and I also
got this top which is very different
from me let's see if I actually were
this avoid because I've been liking red
and it's cute little pocket on the front
and it says heartless on it not that I'm
heartless whatsoever
completely opposite I just thought it
was really cute like a really cute style
or the top this would be really nice tie
up again
cuz I like to tie up every top honestly
I don't know why I just dunno I also
picked up some stuff from JD I'm still
waiting on my sponsorship from JD
because I order from them so much and I
JD please hit me up there and hit me up
of a sponge in the first item that I
picked up from JD was this top now don't
kill me but I actually don't know how to
say this Brown I think it's at least I
hope that's how you say it is this
long-sleeved cropped t-shirt and it's
kind of like the baseball style where
it's got the white face and then the
arms are in navy the Elise logo on the
front of it and then it's got at least
going down the arm I really hope I'm
saying that
it's really just kind of its kind of
simple but I just really liked it and it
is quite a short crop so I feel like I
have to be wearing definitely my waisted
jeans to me I mean I don't wear anything
but I really jeans but you know I'm so I
bought that and then I also picked up
this from supply and demand supply them
and have actually been killing it lately
I don't know what it is about their
clothes but I just love their staff if
this body suit and it's actually in this
is like faux velvet if that makes sense
and it says New York supply and demand
I'm a friend and I love that the New
York is in this kind of like gothic or
one of some newspaper style writing I
love that and that's why I decided to
pick up just because I really like the
fun and if it's okay bodysuit I think
doesn't fit super super well if it
doesn't cover my body probably as much
as I'd like it to be but I liked it for
the print more than anything else and I
like that it's that so velvet - I cannot
wait for there to be more hoodies in
store like I haven't been able to buy as
many videos as I want because it's still
summer here in the UK the web sucks
literally very much more like winter the
moment anyway but this is the one that I
got from Annie - and I just love this
city so much not only is it super
comfortable it's the half zip one so the
victim of go all the way down but the
zip goes up to about that basically you
can zip up and down its Navy and then
the detail of the arm and the chest are
white and this pretty much peachy pink
color and it's just really nice I really
like it I just I can't wait I'm just
going to be living in goodies for the
rest of my life especially when I guess
the winter you will find me hibernating
in my bedroom in a hoodie watching
Netflix most likely oh damn I forgot
this is also from Topshop as well I knew
this would happen I knew I tried to pile
everything up into like shops piles
where I got things from and I still
messed up this is also from Topshop as
well it says Milan on this oversized
t-shirt and it also has this little up -
if it's a Jaguar or a leopard this is a
Jaguar and it is 1979 on it I just
really like tops with this stripe detail
I don't know why I just really like them
and yes this was from Topshop as well
and it's by the brand tea and cake
apparently I've never heard that before
but apparently order envy so the rest of
this is all online and I bought a few
things from this Pat for the first time
I've never bought anything from there
before I placed an order because I'd
seen on their Instagram side and
following them they had a lot of really
nice logo t-shirts so I bought two logo
t-shirts the first one you may have seen
this onto my Instagram and this is a
Romeo t-shirt this fits really nicely I
like the arms because they're kind of
like rolled up so they're really like
feminine cut on the arm it's just a
normal really nicely fit t-shirt
it was then picked up this one which
says for like ever funny because the way
that I actually imagine this being said
is like for like ever I don't know why
I'm just like adding punctuation is that
even though there is none but that's
where I imagine it being said but I love
this this looks so good tied up and the
reason why because I actually bought
this in a medium because it didn't have
a small and it just fits perfectly on me
when I tie it up so again you don't have
to tie up I just like to do that book as
an extra I just really like it it's just
a simple logo tee also from this pack I
got this heartbreaker cropped hoodie the
cropped hoodie and it says heartbreaker
on it - the valves and yes that's pretty
much it from our class I picked up this
blah t-shirt I just love logo features
as you can see I bought so many of them
because like this is my mood forever you
know but this is how I feel in like it's
just a really simple oversized t-shirt
it's not super oversized but it isn't
fitted and yes I really really like it I
have this off the shoulder top and it's
that kind of like stretchy material
which is why I look so small guys I am
NOT a child
trust me I'm not that small it does
stretch even though I am like I am
pretty small I'm not that small I
promise and so I got this in black and
then it was I got this in white as well
and it's just some really good basics to
have in my wardrobe
it's really feminine because as the
frills on it but I feel you could also
edge this up by pairing a completely
oversized jacket over this and some
trainers or timberlands or something
like that and then I also picked up this
bomber for my Sorek bus as well it's a
really light bomber like it doesn't feel
heavy
it's in black and white obviously like
it been a real trend of that going on
over here
and it just has a simple white stripes
going down the arm and I just I love how
simple it is and it's just a really nice
jacket to power on top of anything
really then also for my short bus I
picked up these leggings and I love the
detail on these leggings again it was
super hard to show this on camera just
cuz the way that my rim is I really just
have no space to show you guys what
anything was the bottom half which is
super annoying not these leggings it has
this lace up detail going up the leg and
I just think this is so feminine but
edgy at the same time and I am loved
there I think it's so pretty and again I
don't know what I would pair this word
honestly I think the possibilities are
endless but these are leggings so yeah
just wear them how you'd like they do
fit really nicely but I do find that
they don't stretch enough and you know
what kind of leggings just like hold
everything a little bit too much like I
feel like I lose shape a little bit
around like my bar I realize that makes
sense it's just fair enough like it
sucks everything in but I run my
photographer gonna lose a little bit of
shape so that's one thing just to
remember but I wouldn't have been able
to have gone up a size in this so I'm
happy with the size that I've got there
just the type of material that it is is
a little bit restricting but I still
love them regardless is in this so
gorgeous and then finally the last
little pile of clothes I have are from a
pretty little thing and the first thing
that I have to show you is again a logo
t-shirt of course
and it says iconic on this one it would
be red but why am I forgetting my colors
it has a rose and blue on it with this
little star in the center and I just
really really like the style of this I
think it's just really iconic I'm
kidding this one's quite oversized I've
got this in a size small and it is
pretty large so again you could tie it
up or you can leave it as it is
depending on your style and how you
wanna wear things I guess surprisingly
for me I picked up two skirts what has
happened to me I just feel like I don't
have any skirts the loss of our skirt
was I think when I was in Washington DC
going to the White House because I was
like I don't think I can roll up in
jeans honestly I don't work out often
but this first one is amazing it's just
this really
nice lace up again like the lace up
detail at the front it doesn't actually
have anything behind it so don't worry
like everything's covered but I really
like the detail of this is kind of upset
body core material so it does cling on
which is really nice I think this would
be really nice pad with a logo t-shirt
like kind of tied up or something like
that that's kind of how I would want to
wear it also picked up a denim skirt as
well and this one is kind of different
for me it has gold buttons going all the
way down the center again I bought this
in the hopes I won't let myself down and
I won't wear it
I really hope I'll wear it but we'll see
it's just like a faux denim material and
it's black and it has the gold detail
down the front Ashley doesn't button
which makes it easier to put on because
it can get a little bit pipe - this
isn't stretchy whatsoever and it fits
really nicely and it's really feminine
let's just see if I can wear it because
I I'm trying guys I'm really trying to
be girly and then the last item of
clothing is this dress I got and it's
this t-shirt dress that says girl power
on it with this little rose and I think
that's so cute so adorable I love it
I've been trying to wear more t-shirt
dresses just because I think it's like
wearing a dress but not really wearing a
dress you know I'd love to be able to
wear just like a dress for day to day
but I just don't think that would happen
I do wear dresses obviously like
occasions and going out in the evening
and stuff like that but if I haven't the
choice go engineers like usually I'll
pick two jeans so I'm trying to get more
comfortable in dresses so I bought that
and that is all the clothing that I
actually bought guys by did buy four
pairs of shoes so let me go get my shoes
and I'll be like that okay so the first
pair of shoes that I got off from I'm
sorry first and times look at these
they're amazing so basically I don't
wear heels often as well obviously
because I do I do sometimes but I'm
trying to wear them a lot for going out
look I really go anywhere if I am gonna
go somewhere then I want to work here a
little bit more so I picked up these and
these are just like can we just we need
to promise speak for themselves they're
just these amazing lace-up boots they
are pretty high as you can see so I
don't know how often I'd be wearing
these
I have them now they are now mine and
I'm so happy that I do
so the reputable trainers surprise
surprise it's me guys I'm still planning
on doing wearing a collection that will
be probably going up on my second
channel but we'll see let me know down
in the comments if you would want to see
that on this channel it's not then I'll
be putting it on the second channel so
be sure to subscribe to that channel so
the first pair of trainers that I
thought bring back so many memories
because I used to wear these back in the
day and these are white air forces I had
a black pair as well I think I don't you
bought this in child sizes because my
feet are that small I just looked so
much like these just bring back so many
memories like the way these back in the
day and I got some white horses again
just because there's some simple white
shoes I don't have many white shoes so I
wanted to get pair of white trainers
I was stuck between these ones and the
high-top version I decided to go for the
low top just because they are easier to
wear with like rolled up jeans and I
could still wear them with jeans on if
that makes sense and then I also picked
up some humor Fenty's now these are the
black ones shiny black like final
dude look at you these are amazing so as
you guys may or may not know I have a
slight trainer collection obsession and
I don't have any black creepers I have
nude whites as the white Fenty's and I
now have black so I really wanted a
black pair of creepers and then I saw
these when I was out and I loved that it
had this like wet finish like vinyl I
just love these so much the only thing
about these is that they make most
people come ask their madam if anyone
else things like that but I think it's
because of this like it's so chunky but
I do love them so then the last pair of
trainers that I thought are these high
pop bands and oh I love you so much so I
love my low top bands so much that I
decided to pick up a high-top version
just because I'm constantly wearing my
bands and I just wanted to have like
another option so I bought a high tops
pair and I love these so so so much so
I'm so glad that I picked these up
they're quite self-explanatory but yeah
I bought these from office as well
the sin TS as well alright guys that's
it for this try alcohol I really hope
