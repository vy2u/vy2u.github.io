today I have another clothing haul for
you guys and I know that you guys have
been loving my clothing hauls this year
I thought I would wrap up this year with
another clothing haul because there's
going to be many more in 2018 I'm gonna
have probably another video or two
before the end of the new year but this
is the last one before Christmas so I
hope you guys enjoy this I know you
should have been a little bit weird
lately with just like subscription boxes
and stuff like that it can often get
like that in December so if you haven't
seen my last video I'm just gonna leave
it on the I just that I have been buying
so many clothes lately I actually bought
a lot more than this but not all of them
were like great I guess I'm just kind of
showing you guys the majority of the
stuff I've been purchasing and you guys
know I love hauls and if you guys love
them as well be sure to subscribe
because I'm gonna try and do a haul
every single month on my channel in 2018
thumbs up and comment down below if
that's something that you would like to
see because as you guys know I'm
obsessed with clothes shoes just
everything like that so be sure to let
me know down in the comments if that's
something you would want to see in 2018
but I think this is my last one for 2017
so yeah let's get into it the way I've
done my hair in braids and I am NOT the
best at braids it's like the best I
could do so if you've seen the baby
hairs flying everywhere my head is just
full of babies today I'm gonna be
showing you stuff from a bunch of
different stores I bought from misguided
pretty little thing Nasty Gal and also
miss paps so those are the four online
stores that I got clothes from this time
as you guys know I'm usually obsessed
with a sauce but deduction podge is
anything from a sauce this time which is
kind of an achievement for me okay so
the first thing I guess that I will
mention is the hoodie that I'm wearing
right now it is basically this red
hoodie you're gonna see a theme of red
just because red is my favorite color in
the entire world as you guys know I'm
pretty monochrome with everything like
my room and just like everything in my
life is usually black white and grey but
red is definitely my favorite color and
I just love red so I've been buying a
lot of red so everything you see a lot
of that in this haul this hoodie is
actually from Miss PAP and I love
it fits so well the inside is super soft
and it's kind of one of them slimline
hoodies so it means it kind of like fits
your body enough without being too tight
and I love that and I just feel like it
suits like a woman shape so nicely
majority of other hoodies that I get are
usually super oversized would fit a man
basically so pretty much this is it's
nice to have a change that is something
that fits me a lot better so this was
from this pub and actually loved it and
it says given to me Paris on it really
like the design in the font and
everything black and red just so good
together and then I actually picked up
two cord is that I called like a
coordinating tracksuit kind of sets the
first one is actually really different
for me and it's definitely like pushing
my like actual boundaries because I
don't usually wear stuff like this
actually both of them kind of are the
first one is red of course like I said
guys the majority of the stuff in this
haul is red pretty much but this cord is
basically the tracksuit bottoms which
kind of fit like leggings I couldn't
really get the bottom shot in camera so
I kind of just show you guys the top of
it but these are basically fit kind of
like leggings and then it comes with
this top half which is basically like an
off-the-shoulder like kind of sweatshirt
but it's glam looking it's really
interesting I don't anything like this
it's off the shoulder it obviously has
the stripe detail going down the side
just like the legging track suit but the
arms actually flare outwards which i
think is super interesting I don't have
anything like that I don't know it just
kind of gives me like a it gives me the
red emoji vibe with the god that's in
the right emoji dress I don't know why I
know she's wearing a dress but it kind
of makes me feel like that and I also
got this orange cord tracksuit set as
well now as you guys know I don't wear a
lot of color so this kind of thing is
purely for probably chilling this is a
really nice kind of orange it's a
lighter tone of orange and I just really
like it so it comes with a cropped
hoodie and then of course the matching
chucks you bottoms and it's quite
lightweight and it's just really comfy
and I kind of got this more as a chill
thing to wear when I'm at home I want to
look cute at the same time so I picked
this up as well and it's just so pretty
because I got a couple of things from
misguided a lot of them I'm not going to
be showing in this
although because they just didn't work
out this time so I have two things to
show you from misguided the first thing
it's definitely one of my favourite
pieces in the whole whole thing and this
is this bandanna style t-shirt now this
is just so cool when I saw this I was
like I'm definitely getting that just
cuz you guys know that I love to wear
bandanas I've been wearing bandanas
since I like yes but pretty much I've
been wearing them on my channel whilst I
do my makeup for years anyway so I love
to wear bandanas and when I saw this I
was like oh my goodness it's red and it
looks like the bandanna print and I just
freaking love that it just looks so nice
and what's really interesting is that
the front part of this t-shirt kind of
comes down in a triangular shape just
like kind of the style of a bandana I
personally would prefer this tied up as
you guys know I love to tie up my
t-shirts and it's funny because there's
the shape of the triangle like it coming
down to that point actually makes it
really easy to tie up so yeah ooh looks
really pretty when it's tied up and I
just love this t-shirt and then I also
picked up this really interesting jacket
I like an all-white I don't know what
you call this kind of like a tracksuit
top there may have been matching bottoms
on the website I just got the top and it
has a red shirt I wore two red stripes
going down the side and I just really
like this it's really different I don't
have many white jackets or hoodies
actually no I do have white hoodies but
nothing like this so I decided to pick
this up because it's just it's quite a
statement piece actually like to wear
this it's quite like oh that's different
but I just think it'll be really nice
especially as we get into warmer weather
eventually when we get into warmer
weather this will be really nice to wear
as well that was all I got from
misguided and I also picked up stuff
from Nasty Gal
and this is the first time I have ever
picked up anything from Nasty Gal my
tight life first piece that I got was
this mini dress and it's basically this
like black contrast dress and it's
really pretty it's a teeny little bit
see-through go definitely be nicer for
the summer obviously it's not really
suitable for this time of year for where
I live but it's really pretty and it fit
really nicely by all of the stripes that
go along
then I also got this off the shoulder
top and this is one of my favorite
pieces as well just because it's so
different it's basically this off the
shoulder long sleeve top with this
button detail going down the middle I
love anything off the shoulder I just
think it looks so feminine so pretty
like I just love anything off the
shoulder I just love the fact that it
has this like button detailing and it's
ribbed and jump alike so it's like it
will keep me warm but it also has that
little like off the shoulder which i
think is really feminine and really
pretty I also picked up this really
interesting like I've never seen
anything like this as well I'm with
branching out with colors guys I really
think you guys should be proud of me
because I used to never buy anything
color so I think we should be proud of
me I guess you can go a cami and it's
basically Brown which is a weird color
for me to wear green white and so it's
basically it's just really it was really
interesting to me and I thought that
this would be really nice in the summer
again it's ribbed and it has a v-neck
line and I just thought was really
pretty and also the the like straps are
super thin and I just saw it and I was
like oh that's so different I really
want to try wearing that so I don't know
how often I'll wear it just because the
colors are definitely different for me
but it's nice to have this option in my
wardrobe if I ever do feel like stepping
out of my comfort zone 'mother off the
shoulder item from Nasty Gal this is a
velvet off-the-shoulder
bodysuit now it's kind of simple but
again it's really pretty just because I
don't know it's just kind of like a
basic but the velvet makes it look
really classy and just really pretty I
really really like velvet right now the
last ticket yet up here so you know that
it's so gonna like stay off the shoulder
and it's not going to fall or it's not
going to come up as well and I just love
the kind of a crushed velvet look I
think that's so pretty
the last piece of clothing that I got
from Nasty Gal and maybe the jump around
Christmas Day I'm not too sure it's not
very Christmasy but just the sizing of
it and just how comfortable it is makes
me want to wear it on Christmas Day and
that is this striped jumper right here
it has beige gray and black and white
and I just think that's a really nice
color combination I'm actually loving
stripes right now I don't think I've
bought
thing else that has stripes and I really
like horizontal stripes on clothing so
yeah I really like this and it's just a
really nice basic almost oversized fit
to it but it's really comfy and snug and
it's really nice to just have these kind
of jumpers in your wardrobe especially
if you live in a cold country like me
you can play from Nasty Gal
I've got one pair of shoes because it
wouldn't be a little haul without at
least one pair of shoes in here and this
is actually not a pair of trainers this
time but it's actually a pair of boots
now I saw these and I was like okay so
I'm not the girliest but if I'm gonna
wear boots I may as well do it the right
way and mice love these I was like oh my
gosh
obviously it has like the red floral
detail which I love red floral
embroidery on anything I've seen them on
a lot of items like jeans on tops on
shoes as well and I saw this and I was
just like I like these not only are
these really comfortable they fit my
foot like a glove which is so good but
they give me the height whilst looking
comfortable but also like a little bit
edgy at the same time I just I love
being able to feel comfortable but
feminine also and that's something that
I really like to do whenever I I style
anything I never like to step so far my
confidence don't that I don't feel like
myself anymore lastly the last doll that
I purchased from was a pretty little
thing but the first item is this jump up
right here and I flip in love this I
know has green on it and I'm like green
Lela really do you ever wear green I
honestly love this style of writing so
much almost like an oversized sweatshirt
that's been cut but these look so nice
with like high-waisted jeans or anything
high waisted just because the crop is
quite high it also has the word forever
going down the arm as well which i think
is so nice and I just I'm loving this
green color that lime green I love it
king of lime green I also picked this up
everything is just so messy because I've
already done the trial this is basically
a polo neck crop top and it's really
tightly fitted and so gorgeous I love
this the little detail at the front it's
really simplistic but it just says motto
in this like little fire fun I just
think it looks really cool and then also
on each sleeve it has that
name lime-green flame I was like this is
some different also call that same style
of top like this exact same fit but in
this I mean I want to say it's red but
it's actually classed as orange on the
website I would say it's like a red
orange I have no idea what this says
anyway if anyone knows what this says
and like confirm for me the language as
well I just think it looks really nice
and I really like the style of it I love
the stripes going down the arm and I
don't assume really uncultured because I
just feel like you know when people just
like get things in other languages like
they get tattoos and they don't even
know what it says I feel like one of
those people right now so someone please
educate me on what this actually also
from pretty little thing I decided to
pick up this basic red t-shirt and I
really like the fit of this they do this
in loads of colors but I just realized I
was like I don't have just like a normal
red t-shirt basically just a normal red
cropped t-shirt it gets a little bit
looser to the bottom part so it kind of
like doesn't fit you snug for you really
lock the fit and the color of this so I
decided to get that as well
and lastly from pretty little thing I
picked up this coat oh my goodness I
could cuddle with this coat all day long
this is literally it makes me feel like
a teddy bear
basically this cropped puffer style
jacket but it's made from this like faux
fur I would say it's like a deep shade
of red to maroon and it's so amazing
like you are gonna be mine and it is so
soft so if you're anyone ever sees me
wearing this and they want to hug me I
totally understand because it's so
huggable guys all I picked up in this
