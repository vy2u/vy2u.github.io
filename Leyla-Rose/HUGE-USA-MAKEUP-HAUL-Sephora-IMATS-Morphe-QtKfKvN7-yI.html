channel I am so excited to be filming
today because I have not filmed since
New Year's Eve you guys didn't already
know I just got back from a trip from LA
and it was literally the greatest trip
I've probably ever been on in my life I
had the greatest time I did vlog so a
vlog will be coming very soon it's just
we literally took I'm not kidding about
500 clips of all the things that we were
doing like just taking videos of the
scenery just so many clips so I really
want to take my time and edit them
together nicely to put on my main
channel here so when that is done I will
let you guys know I really want to edit
it really nicely so that's why it's not
here yet I just got back literally a
couple of days ago and I'm still super
jet lag probably look jet lag so that's
what my hairs up in a bun but jet lag
was worth it because I had the best trip
and I've also got a ton of makeup I did
a lot of shopping while stars out there
so I thought I would show you guys a
haul because I bought so many things I
think you guys would be really
interested to see so if you guys would
like to see the makeup I picked up
whilst I was out in LA then just keep on
watching so the first job actually
shopped out was a drugstore and I went
to Rite Aid which is actually a pharmacy
I didn't see an altar whilst I was there
which was so sad I saw one whilst I was
in the car on the way to the airport to
go home and I was just like why didn't I
know there was one here so definitely
next time I'm gonna visit an altar first
thing I kind of went in to a drugstore
looking for was the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation they do
not have the matte and poreless in the
UK so I knew I had to pick them up I
picked up two shades big and I'd really
like this foundation considering lots of
people do save really good things about
it
so I picked one up in two three eight
rich tan which is probably more of a
light to tank I think this is too light
for me right now I also picked one up in
310 which is in the Sun beige which
should probably match me a little bit
better right now but I have tried this
once or twice and I do really like it so
far but it was whilst I was away and my
skin obviously it wasn't like used to
its normal climate whilst I was out
there so I'll definitely try this more
in the UK and let you guys know how it
kind of deals with my skin now I also
saw a huge covergirl section and I was
like there's just so much to choose from
so I thought I'd pick up one product
covergirl I picked up the covergirl
outlast stay fabulous foundation because
I was sure I heard someone talking about
this I can't remember who but I do
remember that someone was just saying
good things about it I picked this up in
the shade 842 which is really light I
think this is better for me in the
winter and but this says it's a lasting
power of a primer coverage of a
concealer and blend ability of a
foundation in one also I picked up the
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
now I'm not sure if you can get this in
the UK it's just I've never seen it in
this particular packaging before so I'll
definitely check in boots and Superdrug
just to see if you can pick it up and I
really really like this mascara whenever
I was on wearing false lashes I was
using this mascara and I really really
liked it also from Maybelline I picked
up the Baby Lips lip gloss and this is
because I really like the Baby Lips lip
balms I was using it on the plane and I
just really like it because it has a
hint of color annette and this is meant
to be the same kind of formula but more
of a lip gloss wore this on the plane
back and i just really really like this
because i feel like they're very
moisturizing plus they come in different
colors and scents and stuff like that so
i just picked the nude one of course
because you guys know I love nude the
last two things I picked up from the
drugstore was from Physicians Formula
now I hear people talk about this all
the time it's a brand you just cannot
get in the UK so I was like okay I just
have to get it but they're like no I
can't get my hands on it in the UK at
all so I decided to pick up a highlight
and a bronzer now both of these products
I love I've used both of them the bronze
that I picked up was the bronze boost at
beauty balm and I don't know why it's
called a beauty balm because it's not
like a cream does have a little bit of a
sheen to it but it's not shiny in any
way I really like the color of this it's
very soft and just applies beautifully
very smoothly and this was not a cheap
brand it was like I think maybe fifteen
dollars for this so this was pretty
expensive I can't remember all of the
prices because they didn't keep all
their receipts but I just remember
looking at this and being like this is
really expensive so it wasn't cheap at
all I feel physicians woman would be
really cheap but it really wasn't but
this in the color liked to medium and
apparently this has an SPF of 20 it's
pretty cool please stop trying to show
you but it just keeps flopping and the
fixer upper key I'm not sure this is the
highlight that I picked out
and it has like this little pearlized
texture like little balls almost sitting
on the top of it almost pink but then in
some lights it looks gold it kind of
reminds me of mac mineralize skinfinish
in soft and gentle kind of that kind of
color and i really really like it
because it's nice and bright so that was
all I picked up from many drugstores out
in the US I'm definitely gonna do my
shopping the next time I go because
trust me I'm going back to the US as
soon as possible
also took a trip up to Burbank and went
to see the morphe store now morphe
invited me to go and just have a look
and go pick up a few things and I pick
it up some morphe stuff and I also
picked up a few various brands from
there as well because they also stock
other brands within their store so I did
quite a bit of shopping there so I show
you guys all the morphe stuff I got
first and then some of the other branded
stuff that I got from that store too
first of all I picked up three more feet
palettes now I love the multi palettes
but I do not have enough of them so I
decided I wanted to get some more
palettes to include in some more
tutorials cuz I know that lots of you
guys do shop at morphe and I just
thought why not because they're so cheap
and they're just unbelievably pigmented
so I decided to get some more palettes I
could use more often in more tutorials
best palate I picked up was this one
which is the 35 P palette so this
palette contains lots of Papa's moths
brownie power pours and a few like
lighter colors as well that would go
really well with this this palette I
picked up was the 35k palette and I have
already dug into this because it's one
of my favorite morphe palettes I've ever
seen the reason why is because it's half
warm tones and 1/2 cool tones absolutely
me I'm more of a warm person but I do
like to do tutorials including cool
colors this is a really nice palette if
you guys like to switch between cool and
warm because it kind of has a really
nice selection of both half of the pilot
is warm and half of the pilot is cool
you can mix and match use all cool or
warm it's just a really nice idea and I
really really love this palette then
lastly guys I got it I got the one I
wanted for absolutely ages they had the
3500 in stock you haven't had at the
3500 then where have you been you've
been hiding under a rock you need to see
this look at these colors guys it's a
mixture of orange
warm Browns warm beige is just a bunch
of warm colors and I just absolutely
love this as you can tell I've already
dug into this naturally being in the
more few soul I knew I had to pick up
some brushes they don't want to pick up
too many because I think I have all the
things I have I have way too many
brushes picked up two of their elite
collection I think this is their elite
collections the first one is this a 15-9
brush and I just feel like I'm gonna
really like to use this to pack on my
under eye highlight or you can use it to
apply your actual highlight to your
cheek bone brush is amazing and then I
also picked up another one for
foundation this is the morphe 56 brush I
love my kabuki brushes and this brush is
so unbelievably soft I'm just so excited
to use this is probably one of the
softest kabuki brushes I've ever ever
felt in my life
the m555 brush again I don't really know
I use this for it's a little bit dense
so this isn't a part of their elite
collection this is just one of their
normal brushes but it's just like a
really rounded kabuki brush Elfi m5 ten
brush because I thought it would be a
really nice brush for highlights m5o
full brush because I've heard this is a
really nice blending brush for the
transition of the eye so I decided to
pick this up as well it's just a
traditional kind of blending brush shape
but it's a little bit tapered towards
the top and then I picked up a little
bit of a smaller one as well this is the
m41 to a little bit more tapered and
it's a little bit more like a pencil
shape so this is better to blend out the
crease color that's right in there in
the crease m56
one brush which is this one right here
and this one was kind of just for an all
over the lid one or two apply stuff onto
the brow bone and I just thought this
would be really good for carving
underneath the brows the first thing
that really caught my eye were these
lashes from flutter lashes and but these
are not mink these are synthetic so I
was like yes I need to try these because
these really caught my eye these are the
provocative style of lash and this is
the SS like I've never seen these before
online or anything I don't know they
were just in the morphe store they're
just super long super wispy but they're
kind of like separated at the same time
I just really really like these lashes
and I can't wait to try them also
stocked eye candy and that's like a
glitter come
I picked up a few glitches I picked up
this pop one in sour grape and this is
just a really pretty bright purple
glitter this one in sugar cane and this
is almost like a brown and a gold mixed
together so it was almost like a duo
glitter got two different colors within
it this one which is in the color
raspberry blast and this looks like a
reddish brown shade also picked up the
liquid sugar and this is like a glitter
adhesive now you guys know that I love
the LA splash of liquid lipstick so I
did see that they had some more of that
liquid lipsticks within the stores is
the la splash smitten lip tint mousse in
the shade Chand just a really really
nice movie pink color and you guys know
that I love mo you pink so this is just
like my dream it's really really really
nice the LA girl let paints and this is
their glazed
super intense color extra Blasi finish
this is in the color I can't find it I
think it's that is it clewd I really
can't read this by the Cluedo dude I
don't know we really like this I only
ever tend to wear glossy nudes so that's
why I picked up this shade and I really
really like it a brand that I had yet to
try was Jeffrey star so I decided to
pick up a few of his products this is
the villa lip scrub in a strawberry gum
only other lip scrub I have this from
lush and this is a lot bigger than the
lush one it smells absolutely amazing
this smells like strawberry lace is
strawberry to Strawberry anything it's
really really strong and so nice it's
also edible of course and it tastes
amazing so it's really really nice oh
it's just so good it takes me back to my
childhood two of his below that could
lipsticks the majority of the colors I
actually wanted went in stocks first
we'll all that quit lipstick that I
picked up was this one this is in the
color I'm nude now this is a very very
light nude so this is probably gonna be
better for me when mixed in with other
liquid lipsticks bread crumb which is
basically the most prettiest read ever
dude take a trip to Sephora I'm so happy
I had to bring the bag home because it
was just proof so I went to Sephora
just for myself one of the things I just
knew I had to guess who
as I saw it was the Catalan D shade +
light contour palette this has just been
just on my want list for absolutely ages
think I've used it more than once but so
far I really really like it but I
particularly have been loving is this
yellow one of course to use underneath
the eyes just to brighten I like this
color here for bronzing and then I also
like this one here for actually
contouring so there was also something
on my list that I knew I wanted to get
like I went into Sephora looking for it
I wanted to try the Too Faced hangover
primer for ages I told you guys already
that I really wanted to try this and
I've used it a few times and I loved it
and I regret not buying - because I
don't think there's any way you can get
this in the UK now I can get Bobby Brown
in the UK and the only reason I picked
up something Bobby Brown is because I
have not been able to find this anywhere
so this had nothing to do with me being
in the u.s. it was just I needed this
highlight this is the Bobbi Brown
highlighting powder and bronze glow and
this is just everything put on a little
bit of this Tay mixed into something
else but this is so unbelievably
gorgeous it's not like one of those
really bright gold it's more of a bronze
but it's just unbelievably beautiful I
love this so so much there's tar deist
clay paint the liner now I haven't even
taken this out the box so I have not
tried this yet so I don't really have a
review on this but with a little brush
and also a little tube full of their
product and the last few products I
picked up with some of their Tarte East
lip paints picked up one in the shade
namaste and also one in the shade TBT
Asli added a little bit of shopping at
IMATS the lines were just so big I'm one
of those people that just hates to queue
I am just I just don't like it you pick
up quite a few things I'm very excited
for so I
bulk bite like bulk bulk buy on lashes i
picks up a ton of the Koko lashes four
pairs of the goddess lashes and the
reason why I picked up so many is
because they look amazing on Amanda and
Singh and she is one of my favorite
people I just love watching her I love
her makeup style and these really remind
me of the House of lashes iconic as well
which you guys know I love those lashes
I think I picked up three or four of the
Queen B lashes I'm already wearing one
on my eyes today that's basic
I'm wearing today and these are just
really long and wispy volumous lashes
and I absolutely love these lashes in
the style diva and this is even more
wispy than these ones they're a little
bit shorter and a little bit less
volumous than the queen bee 1/2 ton
wearing today lashes in the style Misha
and that's these ones right here like
the bees are so separated and I just
feel like this is gonna look really nice
for just a nice brown smokey eye some in
the style risque these are almost like a
few chunks of hair on a lash band but
these are a lot thicker so these would
be better for a lot more of a smoky eye
they kind of have just the tiniest gap
between them and it just looks really
nice I don't know if I'm explaining it
really wrong but it just looks like a
little gap in between each chunk of hair
I don't have that make sense to picked
up some foxy lashes and that's this pad
right here oh it's kind of like
crisscross II I don't know it's really
hard to explain they're quite voluminous
and thick as almost criss cross against
each other so this is really interesting
and I don't think I have any lashes that
are like this vixen which of these right
here this is just super dramatic super
dark like spiky I love these I'm so
excited to try these I stopped off at
dose of colors and I went to buy a bunch
of vesturport loads of liquid lipsticks
and lip gloss and some lashes bought 2
pairs of the showstopper just because
these were the lashes I liked the most I
think these are kind of just feline
lashes they get longer towards the outer
corner and of course I picked up was in
the color undressed which is this one
right here just a really pretty beige
nude 7 liquid lipsticks because I don't
own a dose of colors liquid lipstick and
I just knew if I shops once I would shop
real good plus see I picked up one of
their new shades as it suede which is
this one right here this is just like a
great tyrant nude san which is a really
nice light beige nude with a little bit
of a peachy undertone profile which is
one of my personal favorites it's just a
baby pink nude color and I just
absolutely love this one this is
probably my favorite dose of colors
liquid lipstick everyone's favorite dose
of colors stone this is a really pretty
Mobe pink nude
I really really love this and then
because I didn't want to just be boring
and by only news I decided to pick up a
few of their brighter colors as well re
me and bury me too because I do have two
different versions of this Merlot which
i think is how you pronounce it this is
kind of like a fiery red with a little
bit more of that pink undertone this
reminds me of all fired up from Mac and
I love that color so I'm really excited
to have this in a liquid lipstick form I
just love this kind of color so guys
that is everything I can't believe I
bought that much stuff to be honest I
thought I was gonna buy more so I think
I did well I don't know but I hope you
