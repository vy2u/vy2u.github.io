today's video is going to be a little
bit more of a talking video I realized I
have been doing makeup tutorial after
makeup tutorial after makeup tutorial
recently and I wanted to do a little bit
more of a talking video something a
little bit more chilled actually I love
doing makeup tutorials for you guys and
that will always be the main thing of my
channel I do want to incorporate a lot
of different stuff into my channel also
so I do just want to slide in a couple
of different stuff here and there too
and a lot of you guys have been
requesting my haircare video and the
products that I like to use please
showing you guys how I wash my hair or
anything like that because honestly my
hair care routine is so simple it's
literally easy to explain to you in five
minutes
so I just wanted to talk that through
there's no point of really showing you
you guys didn't know I have extremely
curly hair naturally and I do have a
tutorial on how I like to wear it Kylie
when I have it naturally curly I will
link that just above a little suggestion
box it's gonna pop above if you want to
see that video then click up there
because I do actually show you how I get
my hair to go curly from wet and also do
have another tutorial on how I
straighten my hair from Karthi also and
that is a pretty simple tutorial also
and I will also link that video at the
top now as well so if you do want to see
either of those videos I do recommend
you go see them
just because I'm not going to be showing
you anything as a tutorial today I just
wanted to talk to you guys about you
know the products I used to take care of
my hair how I got it to grow how I just
like to keep it less frizzy just you
know products that I love and just
generally how I care for my hair so
let's just get into the video so I'll
tell you guys a little bit about my hair
before I get started as I just mentioned
my hair is extremely curly does my
natural hair color completely now I
haven't dyed my hair in at least three
years I haven't dyed my hair in the last
the shore my hair has just been very
very hard to grow for the longest time I
have what if my hair to be long down to
my waist almost and it's been really
hard to get my hair to the point that is
the first thing I'll explain to you guys
is hair conditioner and shampoo I
personally don't have a favor of either
when I wash my hair I pretty much use
anything like I don't have a particular
favorite main characteristics that I
like to look for in a shampoo
conditioner or just that they are quite
softening usually I like to get argan
oil or deep conditioning shampoo and
conditioners just because I feel like
that works the best on my hair it's not
super conditioning my hair will just end
up looking really dry very frizzy and
there is something that I personally do
not want
so as for hair masks I only have
particularly one hair mask
I have loved in the past I have tried
something from a couple of different
brands but this particular one has
worked really well for me especially in
the summer this is the invader Sun care
off to Sun hair mask I bought this
before I went on holiday last year and I
still have it and it's still going
strong I like to use this once a month
just because it is very luxurious this
is just a very moisturizing for your
hair but like a very small amount of
this goes a very long way I don't like
to put this near my scalp because I do
feel like it's not necessary I like to
focus this on the ends of my hair and I
feel like it really does rip hair
breakage and dryness and I feel that it
does make you feel very healthy this is
amazing last I have used this for almost
a year now and it's lasted me a really
long time just because I don't use too
much of it because I do have other
things I like to do more so than this
but this is like my luxurious treatment
I like to do once a month a product I am
a huge fan of this is an extremely huge
part of my life and in my skincare
routine I am gonna be doing this
skincare routine very soon let me know
if you guys want to see my skincare
routine because my skin has definitely
improved a lot in the past couple of
months so let me know down below if you
guys want to see my skincare routine but
like I said coconut oil is absolutely a
for me I use this all over my body my
face my hair everywhere this is my life
basically it is organic coconut oil this
is raw untouched and just a hundred
percent organic so I only would put
something like that on my face and hair
just because you wouldn't want anything
that's not pure and this actually comes
in a really hard
chunky substance but because it's been
so hot it's actually turned a little bit
more liquefied recently but then when it
does get colder it goes hard again
depending on the temperature and my room
gets very hot this does go quite liquidy
you could put it in the fridge if you
want to but it would go way too hard and
I bought this from Costco and a
double-park and it was literally only 11
pounds very cheap very inexpensive I
love to use this on the scalp of my head
to help with dandruff I like to apply
this as a conditioner and mask on the
top of my head and also on my ends and
then I will wash it out I really feel
like coconut oil has changed my life
especially with my skin as well which I
will tell you guys in my skincare
routine but I just honestly feel that it
really does hydrate my hair hydrates my
scalp offshore I make sure to never use
too much of this into my scalp of course
it's gonna make your hair completely
greasy if you apply too much of it but
the smallest little bit just massaged
into the scalp and then washed out is a
really great way to hydrate your scalp
and prevent dandruff another oil I love
to use is pure argan oil this is
fantastic especially for the ends of my
hair it prevents frizziness are hundred
percent this is fantastic when I have my
hair straight just because I like to
apply it before I go to bed and in the
morning it will just have been all
soaked up and it's just really really
hydrating and I just absolutely love
argan oil this one is the Mia flora rock
and argan oil and while we're talking
about deep conditioning things one of my
favorite serums I love to use is the
organ 5 organoid super smooth serum and
this smooth conditions and reduces frizz
this is basically a serum that has argan
oil in it I use this every single time I
straighten my hair so I put it in my
hair from wet and then when it's dried
my hair would just be a lot less frizzy
and this isn't oily at all although it
has
within it it doesn't have an oily
consistency and it's just really good to
use before you straighten your hair just
because they won't have your hair
feeling really greasy and I'll have a
bun
it's just really safe and I really like
using this when my hair is straight not
so much when my hair is curly just
because I feel like my hair routine kind
of changes when I have my hair cut me
speaking of when I have my hair straight
I always make sure to protect it with a
heat protectant spray and I actually
forgot about this for a real long time
and I've started using this within the
last six months definitely feel like
this is really protecting my hair it's
made by the brand of GHD so it's made
for their straightness and I just like
its really trustworthy another one that
I do love is the Tresemme one that's the
one I used to use before this but since
I had this and I realize I had it I was
like let me just finish this before I
buy another one but I do really like
this and this is basically just a
thermal protector for weak and damaged
hair and I just like to spray this all
over my hair before I put any heat on it
another product i absolutely love is the
bedhead mega Whip whipped marshmallow
hair texturizer this is amazing for one
this smells amazing like I'm not joking
this literally smells like a bag of
candy this is basically my replica for a
gel and this is really good to keep all
of the baby hairs out of your face
without it feeling hard this has more of
a waxy texture rather than a gel so I
really like this because it still means
that your hair can move and it doesn't
look like it's stuck in one position I
really really love this product it's
really great and it actually is a
texturizer so you can use this if you
have short hair to kind of like texture
your hair I just use this almost as a
wax because it's not as waxy as a wax
but it's not as hard as a gel it's kind
of in between and it smells amazing so
hair is greasy or it looks flat or dull
and I just want to give a little bit
more extra something to it
I love the batiste dry shampoo and this
one is the hint of color in dark and
deep brown prevents it from looking
greasy it makes it look really nice and
full demised as well so I like to use
this before I back comb my hair and it
just gives you a little bit instant
volume and just takes away from that
greasy flat looking hair
this is really great and I love that it
has that hint of Doc Brown is this so
affordable you can get it from drugstore
for literally four or five pounds and
it's just you know a really nice size it
lasts a really long time and it's just
really a versatile you can use it for
volume rising or for just refreshing
your hair I love it so this is amazing
that I use this pretty much every day
and then lastly average talk to you guys
about two products you may have seen
before if you watched my Carly head
video is above two of the best products
I've ever used she make my hair hardly
ever I think I've been using both of
these products for about five years now
especially when I used to wear my hair
curly a lot these used to save my life
both from bedhead and this one here is
the rebound called really cool cream
like a cream that defines your calls and
it just kind of takes away from that
frizz and it just really works so I
apply this in my hair from what and it
just makes my hair transform into this
amazing color Lee head it's amazing
this one here is the foxy curls hi-def
Karl spray and this is also from bedhead
and this is great because it kind of has
a little bit more of a sticky texture so
it kind of finishes off the cuff so I
don't usually use this straight from
when it's wet it's more when the cold
start to get their definition I like to
apply this when it's almost like semi
dry and then it kind of just Springs all
the cars upward so this is really really
good to make your cars pretty nice it
defines the guys I hope that you enjoyed
