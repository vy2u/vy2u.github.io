today's video is going to be another how
to be a pro video today's video is how
to highlight to your under-eyes like a
pro in this video I'm gonna be teaching
you guys how to highlight your under
eyes how to brighten them the shape to
use I always tell you guys like my
favorite products I like to use to
highlight my under eyes how to prevent
creasing just you know everything that I
feel is necessary for highlighting your
under eyes basically so I hope you guys
enjoy this video so if you guys do want
to know how to highlight your under eyes
and like a pro then please just people
so before I do anything within makeup I
always like to make sure I prep that
area first
especially with the under eyes it's just
gonna prevent creasing it's gonna make
sure that the under eyes are all nice
and hydrated and it just means that the
area is gonna end up looking a lot
smoother rather than applying and
nothing before applying your concealer
now what I like to do is always apply an
eye cream just because I find it really
helps to prep the area helps to make
sure that everything is really nice and
moisturized and I just fill the eye
cream is the best way to prep my under
eyes the eye cream that I like to use is
the vitamin E eye cream this is just
gonna prevent dryness it's the skin
absorbs it fairly quickly so it doesn't
leave anything greasy it's not oily and
it's not going to create creasing if you
know it means it's not gonna make it
crease more so this is a really good eye
cream to go with whatever eye cream or
eye primer that you know works for you
and that you know isn't going to create
creasing and you know is going to
hydrate your under eyes when I apply my
eye cream I just like to spread it
between two of my fingers and then I
just like to Pat it under my eyes in
like an upward motion just in the areas
where you're going to be applying that
cela I also like to apply this onto my
eyelid as well so while that is sinking
in what I will do in the meantime is
apply at my foundation I'm just going to
be priming my face and applying some
foundation because I like to do my
foundation first before I do my
concealer just because the concealer can
go on top of that and create that really
nice and bright effect
so I've just applied my foundation all
over with my Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge once you're happy with
the coverage of your foundation we're
going to start moving on to the
concealer always like to make sure is
that I don't apply too much foundation
under my eyes I like to keep it fairly
thin the layer I mean I don't apply
nothing there but I just sort of use my
sponge and just kind of go under it with
whatever's left on my sponge I don't
like to apply too much because too much
product can cause unnecessary creasing
and also if you're on the drier side and
you get dry skin it may cause your eyes
to look a little bit drier it really
does depend on what type of skin you
have but I know with me if I applied too
much foundation there and then I put
concealer it just looks really cakey and
I know it's gonna crease so I just apply
a very thin layer of foundation and it
does depend on what foundation you're
using as well using something like a
face and body which is a very watery
foundation and you apply that under your
eyes it's likely anything you put on top
of it now is going to crease because
it's got that kind of watery consistency
so just have that in mind but if you're
applying a foundation if you know it's
got a jury or a water-based consistency
and you know it's not a long-lasting
formula
try not to apply it under your eyes
because that can cause creasing comes to
picking a shade over concealer to
highlight your under eye you want to go
for something that is two to four shades
lighter than your actual skin tone as
you can see in this one is probably
about three or four shades lighter just
because I like to go for quite a bright
under eye this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 20 this is one of
my favorite concealers so I thought as
we are doing a concealer base tutorial
today I wanted to use this one and this
one is a medium coverage go for whatever
coverage you know works for you I rarely
ever go for a cream concealer something
like the Kiko full coverage just because
this is just too heavy for me whenever I
try this it makes my under eyes look too
dry or it looks too Creasy it just
doesn't work for me this may work
perfectly for you again just pick the
concealer that you know wipes for you
for me I like to stick to a medium
coverage usually sometimes I go through
the Mac Pro Longwear which is classed as
a medium coverage but it can go to a
full and so I like to go for our medium
build
concealer coverage when it comes to my
undereyes just because I know that works
for me like I said you just got a trial
and error a couple of different
concealers and just see which ones work
for you this one particularly works for
me really well so when it comes to
creating this shape of the concealer
that you want to use to brighten your
under eyes this works on pretty much
everyone for whatever age skin tone it
doesn't matter this particular shape
works it's nothing new to YouTube you
guys have most likely seen this shape
before but it is the triangular shape
that goes upwards what this will do is
automatically lift the face so where we
place that light concealer it's gonna
lift the face upwards and it's almost
going to give us a mini facelift without
actually having to do anything so this
is in my opinion the best way to
highlight your under eyes you don't
necessarily have to cover it all in
concealer you can just dot it in that
shape if that's what you'd rather if you
want to go for something more natural
but in general that rather than a
rounded shape just tends to lift the
face upwards a lot better so I'm gonna
start off by applying this to my face
and I like to get this right up to my
upper lash line but you can of course go
a little bit downwards if that works for
you and I'm just gonna take this up
just literally swiping that in an
upwards motion so as you can see if I
look straight on you can see that it's
lifting upwards and I want to take that
all the way to the inner corner of my
eye I personally like to drag it
downwards onto the bridge of my nose
because what this does is narrows down
my nose so that I feel is enough
concealer I don't like to take it too
far down this way because when you do
blend it out it does end up coming down
low best you don't think it done too far
otherwise it's gonna be all the way down
here and it's not gonna highlight the
area that you want to as you can see the
difference already you can see that it
is gonna lift on my face I'm gonna blend
in this side of fur so that you guys can
see the difference between the two it'll
be using the same sponge I use to blend
in my foundation you can use a sponge
you can use your fingers you can use a
brush but one thing I do recommend
whatever you were using I recommend you
using patting motions instead of rubbing
under the eyes just because when you rub
I used to do this a lot when you rub you
get this kind of smears under your eyes
and it doesn't look as airbrushing
flawless and stuff like that the best
the best way that I'd recommend is to
Pat because it's gonna be patting the
product into the skin and it's gonna
look a lot more flawless whereas when
you rub it you're kind of rubbing the
product in different directions and that
way it just doesn't look as flawless
doesn't it something I definitely
recommend is when you're blending in
your concealer to prevent creasing is to
look all the way up into a handless as
you can see I have a hammer and I'm
gonna look all the way up that way you
can blend in all of the creases before
you set it so I'm just gonna be using my
bouncing motions as I said before and
you want to try and keep this product in
the place that you applied it
and don't worry if you need to do this
concealer face everyone always laughs at
me when I do this when I go but it kind
of stretches out that area and it just
makes it a lot easier and I can't help
but do it
that's just like that a habit of mine
okay so once you've got to this point
and your concealer is semi blended in
something you guys probably see me doing
a lot of my videos is use this little
and weird shaped brush this is from
Sigma this is the 3d HD precision brush
and it kind of come in like a sponge
really can't reach into that tiny little
area so a small brush that is shaped
like this is very handy so I'm just
gonna be going into them areas and just
using them same kind of patting motions
just making sure that this is very
thoroughly blended into my skin
at the moment it's blending into my skin
really well and everything is looking
really nice and just blended and it just
looks really nice I really love this
concealer because it's not too heavy at
all
it's not too out there which I love and
I can still get that really nice
highlighted under-eye without looking
too crazy and as you can see the
difference from this I had this eye I
just look a lot brighter I look more
awake generally when it comes to setting
your under eyes you want to work quite
quickly especially if you're working
with a concealer that sets fortunately
this concealer does not set so I can
take my time and talk to you guys but
you are actually setting your under eyes
and recommend that you kind of apply
your concealer and set it as quickly as
you can to prevent it from creasing and
drying in increasing way but for this
concealer it actually doesn't set on my
skin so I can take my time and but what
we're going to be doing now is talking
about setting powders comes to picking a
setting powder I'd highly recommend that
again you trial and error with the
setting powder that works for you I have
found a setting powder that works for me
it is the Mac prep and prime CC powder I
have a few others that I love as well
but this is particularly the one I love
to use for baking my under eyes I've
also heard that the Laura Mercier
setting powder is amazing as well so I
would be trying that one out soon you
want to make sure and there are three
things that are not within your setting
powder one thing is that you want to
make sure that has no like reflecting
particles especially if you're working
with flash I have this NARS crystal
reflective loose powder it's great for
just everyday wear but once a flash hits
on it that light reflecting particles
just it creates this flash bag that
looks white in photos so it looks very
obvious and it's quite hard to hide if
you know anything so you want to avoid
anything like reflective glitter that
kind of stuff is really going to come up
in flash photography also another thing
is HD powders they are not made to use
with
Photography again HD powder is kind of
flashback also another thing is SPF you
don't find that often in setting powders
but that's just another thing SPF often
does flashback so this is just three
things to be wary off doesn't
necessarily react or all people but it
is known for those three things to
affect your under-eyes in flash
photography it's one I know it works for
me it's completely translucent but how
this is like yellow tin which I really
like considering I have a yellow
undertone in my skin and again you want
to look upwards when you are setting
your eyes for this I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to bake your under eyes
it's something that I have been wanting
to talk about on my channel for a little
while just because it's kind of been all
the craze recently although it is an old
technique that's been going for years is
something that has definitely become
done recently that makes sense I'll be
taking this pink sponge this is one I
always use this is from Mac this is just
one of their little sponges it's
probably about 4 or 5 pounds you can
just use any sponge don't worry about it
whatever sponge works for you and you
basically just want to dip it into the
powder want to take as much powder as
you can onto that sponge and you want to
make sure before you set to that all of
the creases are smooth you don't make
sure there's any creases cuz once you
set it and there's a crease if you're
not going to be able to get it off you
know make sure there's no creasing
before you begin
and anywhere I apply the concealer I'm
literally just going to be applying
powder like that and not touching it I'm
just going to leave it to sit on my skin
so at this point this is what it looks
like you look absolutely crazy really
great thing if you want to prevent
creasing if you want to create this
really nice under eye that is not going
to move it looks absolutely gorgeous in
photos your under eyes just look really
nice and bright so I'm gonna do my other
side and I'm gonna let this set until I
finish the rest of my makeup so just put
on my red lip and I put a little bit of
concealer on some other areas of my face
as well so we're gonna wipe away all of
this powder you want to use quite a
fluffy brush so we can get rid of all of
the excess powder so I'm gonna be
brushing away the powder with a powder
brush just making sure to get rid of all
of the excess powder I'm just dusting it
away from my face
wanna make sure that all of the powder
is dusted away but at this point as you
can see my face is looking really nice
and lifted I haven't applied any bronzer
any contour so as you can see when you
do contour and you you know bronze your
face everything just looks really
structured your face is gonna look
lifted and everything just ties really
well together so I'm gonna apply the
rest of my makeup and then I will come
back and chat to you guys so guys I now
have all the rest of my makeup on I hope
