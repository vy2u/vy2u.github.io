today I'm going to be trying to you guys
a little bit about eyebrows and the
reason being is because I posted a
picture on Instagram I will pop the
picture up here now just to show you
guys what picture I'm talking about if
you don't already follow me on there but
I showed you guys a transformation
picture of my eyebrows and my eyebrows
were really thin about two months ago as
you can see from the top picture my
eyebrows were really thin they had a
little bit of thickness toward the inner
corner of my brow but the rest of it was
very thin because I used to go for them
really arched Instagram kind of brow as
my taste in makeup grows I just end up
preferring much more to go for a more
natural softer more fluffy brow and the
kind of bar that I'm wearing today I'm
wearing a bit more eye makeup so my
brows are a little bit stronger but from
a day-to-day we're just being England to
brush a little bit of color through them
or just a bit of a brow mascara or
something like that
I love that kind of look and I just love
them the hairs all kind of flick upwards
and it just looks really nice and
natural that is my kind of preference
now and so you guys really wanted to me
to talk about how I grew them so quickly
so I started to grow them from the from
mid-january up until now I'm still
growing them out I'm not happy with my
brows at but because they grew so
rapidly everyone was like I need to know
what you did just a little disclaimer I
did not do anything a revolutionary
that's gonna change your life I mean I
wish there was a little potion or trick
that you could apply onto your eyebrows
and then it would just come out but it's
just never happened so far we have not
found anything that could do that
I just use some really simple technique
and I just thought I'd explain to you
guys what I done because you guys we
really wanted to see it well what to me
may not necessarily work for you as
quickly or as efficiently and it may
work a little bit may help out but it
might not work as well as it did for me
because we all have our own growth cycle
something that works for me may have
been much more rapid and quicker than it
would be used so the first tip I have
for you is something that we are all too
stubborn to listen to you when we are
trying to grow our eyebrows out do not
touch your eyebrows it may sound stupid
it may sound obvious you are going to
want to pluck them back to a natural
shape if you are not going to touch your
eyebrows yourself and you're going to
get them done by a professional the best
thing to do is to listen to their advice
they are going to shape your brows at
the end of the day they're most likely
gonna pick the shape before your
eyebrows and it's best to listen to them
if they tell you not to touch them to
just try your best not to touch them if
there's no hair down here you know
that's not going to be useful in
creating your shape but when you start
to play them out it gets so tempting to
go up and up and up and then you end up
affecting the shape that could
potentially be a better shape for your
face when you are growing them out there
are a couple of things that you can do
to prevent yourself from being tempted
to prevent them from looking more
obvious there are things you can do but
the best thing is to try and leave them
as much as possible next there are a
couple of remedies that you can do that
will help the hair growth to kind of
come through it helps the hair to feel
more healthy so in that sense they're
not gonna break it makes your house feel
nice and thick this may work for you it
may not work for you is completely down
to your body's type in the way that your
hair grows and but what I did do is I
was exfoliating my eyebrows as much as I
could and not too harshly you want to
make sure that you're not exfoliating
but you partially because obviously if
it's very evening it's gonna pull extra
hairs out and you don't want that so
what I would do is when I would
exfoliate my face so I exfoliate my face
two to three times a week I would take
that exfoliator and just rub it over the
eyebrows very very gently you don't a
rub otherwise again it's just gonna take
our heads that aren't ready to come out
and you just want to very gradually go
back and forth getting any of the hairs
that are kind of dead and they're ready
to come out and that will promote their
next
gross to come through I don't know if
any of you ever have this but I
sometimes get a little ingrown hairs
very small that they turn into spots and
I sometimes get them around my eyebrow
area and that's from flocking and
removing hairs and when the hair grows
back
it grows bent and that stops the Hagar's
from coming through and that creates a
spot and that sometimes happens around
my eyebrow area because I have curly
hair my eyebrows are also curly and they
just kind of cult in noise just gonna
help the surface of the eyebrow to be
nice and smooth all the pores are gonna
be unblocked everything's gonna be
unblocked especially they have follicles
where they're all kind of blocked and
that will just promote hair growth even
more so that really helped for me I
noticed a big difference when I was
doing that when I first wanted to start
growing out my eyebrows just before
about two months ago I asked my
followers on Instagram what I should do
and a couple of you guys were saying she
use a clear mascara wand or a spoolie or
something like that and apply coconut
oil and I think it was another oil on
Tibet cotton but exactly what it was
we're just saying to apply oils and to
brush it through the brows and that
would promote the hair growth so it
definitely gave it a try throughout the
beginning of me growing up my eyebrows
the first month I started doing that
ended up using coconut oil and argan oil
and that was just kind of making my hair
really nice and thick I would apply the
coconut oil onto my eyebrows before I
went to bed they say to also apply it
onto your eyelashes as well pepper has
itself
they're like thin hairs that they feel
thin whereas obviously some people's
hair they do feel thick and coarse
whereas my eyebrows are not like that
they don't have a natural texture of
food and thick so I did feel them start
to feel thicker when I started doing
this and it does improve thickness when
they feel thick obviously they start to
look more full yeah I just really found
a difference with the coconut oil it
didn't really really help they did also
say another oil as well and that did
help I think it was called liberal or
something like that but I didn't end up
using that but just the main thing how
all of this is to just let them grow but
let them grow into the natural shape
obviously you can remove the tiny
but nothing too drastic didn't I
literally did not touch the table I
didn't touch the top at school I only
literally took a couple ones here and
there there are vitamins you can take as
well for skin hair nails I didn't feel
like I really needed to do that but you
can go ahead and do that if you want to
do guys even though this was a really
really easy video I just wanted to tell
you guys because you guys really wanted
to know what steps I took to wearing out
my eyebrows unfortunately at the moment
there is no secret magic thing that can
make them grow within a week or anything
like that but I just found that being
consistent with their just doing the
same thing over and over again and I
really did see a difference just be
disciplined try and forget about the
brows but you've got to remember the
outcome so hope you guys enjoyed I'm
going to be doing a eyebrow tutorial as
well I'm gonna film it I will head up
soon and I'm gonna show you guys how I
like to naturally fill in my eyebrows
and then I'll also do a more dramatic
one well yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
