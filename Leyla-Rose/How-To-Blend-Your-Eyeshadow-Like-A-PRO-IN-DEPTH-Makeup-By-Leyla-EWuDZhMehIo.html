today I'm going to be doing a different
type of tutorial it's pretty different
but I'm really excited about it because
I'm gonna be doing kind of like a series
of more in-depth tutorials on how to do
like different types of makeup
techniques do today's is how to blend
eyes shadow perfectly eye makeup has
always been a passion of mine so it has
been the first thing that got me into it
I used to look at Arabic makeup loads
and I used to think I really want to be
able to do that and just all the colors
blending into one another blending is
one of the hardest things to grasp about
eye makeup I think my eye makeup has
been just progressing and progressing
and progressing for a really long time
and it doesn't just happen overnight by
honestly for like these tips which I've
picked up all honestly help you so I
hope that this video helps a lot of the
time these kind of tips just go without
saying and a lot of youtubers including
myself almost expect you guys to know
how to do it without having to say it
and I feel like I want this video to
clear up all of that and it's going to
be really easy and really easy to follow
and just a lot of explaining of why I'm
doing it is a talk through so it's gonna
be basically me telling you and showing
you how I'm blending it step by step by
step because a lot of the time we just
tend to say now you're going to blend
this color into the crease but I'm not
telling you exactly how to blend it so I
want this video to be very specific on
how I get colors to blend into one
another and how I get my eye makeup
looks to just blend perfectly these tips
can be used for any eye makeup look
obviously I've gone for a neutral one
but this goes for any makeup look that
you ever create I use these tips a day
to day no matter what makeup look even
if it's from the most natural all the
way to extremely dramatic one using lots
of black and bright colors I still use
these tips this isn't how to create this
look this is just how to blend your
eyeshadows you can apply these
techniques to any makeup look that
you're going to create it's going to be
perfect for beginners and even if you're
not a beginner and you just want to
brush up on your blending skills I
honestly feel like this is going to help
you guys because these are the tips I've
picked up after a really long time so
guys I'm going to jump straight into the
video if you do want to know how to get
your eyeshadow to be
perfectly blended then please just keep
watching in the video okay so as you can
see I've already started this eye and
I'm going to be showing you all the
steps on this I just here okay so the
first step is to make sure that you're
applying a base a base honestly really
really helps if you're not applying a
base underneath your eyeshadow there are
a couple of things that aren't really
going to work you have a naturally
pigmented lid so if your lid is a little
bit darker the colors aren't going to
come up the same and it's also going to
interfere with the blending process when
your eyeshadows kind of blending out
you're going to be able to see it your
eyes natural pigmentation coming
underneath it and we don't want that we
want to make sure that we can just
basically start afresh and almost create
our new eye shapes so canceling out your
natural shadows and just going to make
sure that the colors come out a lot more
pigmented and that everything looks a
lot more blended the base also helps
everything just to blend a lot better
anyway it makes the product stick to it
a lot better and it's going to make sure
that it stays on a really long time and
then it doesn't crease the base that I'm
going to be using is the soft ochre
Paint Pot from Mac and I'm going to be
applying this with my finger and just
blending it literally all the way from
my brow bone and take it all the way it
to my lashline and you want to make sure
there's an even layer of this all over
and you want to blend it quite fast
because this product does dry and the
warmth of your finger will almost
naturally blend everything in a lot
better just because it's kind of warming
up the product as you go so the next
step is that you want to make sure that
the eye base isn't sticky if the eye
base feels really really tacky then the
eye shadow is going to stick to it in
certain places where it's less dry and
then it's not going to stick as well on
the areas that aren't as dry usually
this evenly dry is going to make sure
that everything blends a lot easier mine
is completely dry so I just wait a
couple of seconds before I apply
anything else some people like to apply
a translucent powder all over after they
apply their base I personally prefer not
to do that because I do like it to be
slightly tacky I don't like it to be
tumor at the same time of it being
sticky so I like it to be somewhere in
the middle but if your primer is a
little bit more of a sticky formula then
you may want to go over with a
translucent powder or a skin tone I
shadow just to make sure everything is
matte one of the key things about
blending your eyeshadow is making sure
that you have good brushes to work with
good brushes don't necessarily mean they
have to be expensive brushes brands like
Sigma and lo Ava are really really great
do different sets of brushes for the
eyes that have recommended for different
things so if you check out both of their
websites they are amazing I will have
some links down below it's really
important to get to know your brushes
something like this which is a fluffy
brush that isn't very dense and that
will kind of move around quite a bit
isn't going to pick up as much product
the less densely packed the brush
actually is the less product it will
pick up at once this brush is ideal for
blending out the product or even for the
first transition shade that you're going
to use and then also on the flip side is
really important to get to know your
eyeshadows also if you've been playing
with eyeshadows for a long time you
would know that certain brands and
certain fields of eyeshadow aren't
recommended for a really good blend
certain eyeshadows can feel chalky and
feel almost cheap feeling and they don't
really blend as easy as a much better
quality i shadow the formula that you
want to look for is something that has a
smooth formula that feels almost a
little bit creamier than a really hard I
shadow that feels like chalk it chalky
eyeshadow isn't going to blend that
easily a palette that I'm going to be
using today is the Smashbox full
exposure palette this is my favorite
palette and it just has a really good
range of mattes and shimmers and they're
all neutral
especially when you're starting out you
want to get into the habit of using the
lightest color that you're going to be
using in the crease first and slowly
gradually building off to the darkest
color I'm going to start by applying the
lightest color and I'm just going to be
applying this into my crease and what I
love about doing this method is that
once you've got this lightest color it's
not too scary you start to apply it into
your crease and you know that you're
going to be able to blend this out and
it's just going to be really easy to
gradually build up the darker color
where you want it whereas if I went in
straight with a black now it would be
really hard for me to blend out I'd have
to go in with lighter colors and darker
colors and then I would just end up with
a big black splodge and that's not what
we want we want it to go from light to
dark ah and then in the crease we want
it to be the darkest shade so you want
to precise
we place the comment where you want it
you don't want to have to be blending
out black and it being all the way up to
your brow so starting with the lightest
color is definitely going to help you
with this another tip that you want to
know is that you want to make sure that
you're not applying too much onto your
brush so when I take it onto my brush
this is basically what I am doing I'm
patting it into the product and I tap
the excess off it seems really stupid
but it really really works what this
makes sure it does is that it's not
carrying any extra product there's not
just a big chunk of eyeshadow sitting on
there it means all the product is
embedded into the brush and that means
it's going to be really easy to apply on
to the eye another important thing is
that you want to make sure that you're
using a light hand a good tip is to hold
the brush at the end of the handle if
you're holding it all the way up here
you're going to be pressing way too hard
and that is not going to make things
blend really easily holding it at the
end of the handle is just going to allow
the brush to do its work and then you
can go side to side or in circular
motions whatever you feel is easier for
you and just allow the brush to blend it
out at the end of the day when
manufacturers create these brushes they
are created to blend these fluffy
brushes are going to help you to blend
out your product and this will end up
being nice and blended you don't need to
push hard it's a myth if you feel like
you really need to dig into your eye
that is not necessary just literally I'm
just touching it and blending it you
really don't need to press hard and even
though you may feel like you really want
to get things blended out and more about
how fast you're going rather about how
hard you're pushing so you want to
gradually build up this product
you see I'm going very very lightly but
I'm going back and forth quite quickly
and I feel like that is a lot more
effective than going because that's not
going to blend things out another huge
tip is that you want to build up product
gradually you don't want to take loads
of product on your brush put it on and
then really struggle to blend out you
want to take a bit by bit by bit haven't
gone into the darker shade yeah I've
literally just stayed in to that first
shade that I showed you and I'm just
very gradually building up more and more
in the crease so that it looks
intense and at this point I think
side-to-side motions help me that most
but do whatever motion you feel is most
comfortable some people like to do the
round motions like that which I do do
but I like to use that more when I'm
using it in the darker colors which I
will explain to you soon but I like to
go side to side and just make sure that
I'm getting into the crease and then
taking it outwards and just pulling it
outwards of course the shape is up to
you I'm just showing you today how to
actually blend out but I will do other
videos soon on different shapes and
stuff like that another great tip is to
have a brush that is completely clean
throughout the whole application of your
eye makeup or you can use this clean
brush for is just to help you blend
everything out feel like you've taken
things too high what this will do is
just help you to create a really nice
soft effect
okay guys so we're going to go into the
next shade and like I said I just used
this color just here and now I'm going
to go into this slightly darker warmer
brown and I'm going to be taking a
similar form of brush this is just a
slightly more tapered brush you can see
on this side it goes from light and then
it transitions into the darkest part
into the crease this is just one form of
smoky eye you don't have to go by this
I'm just showing you the method of how
to actually blend it so I'm going to be
using this brush that's more tapered
inwards it almost goes into a point at
the very top and what this will do is
it'll be a lot more precise and I'll be
able to apply that Brown into the inner
part of my crease and again I'm using a
very very light hand as you can see my
hand isn't all the way up here I'm not
pushing too hard I'm just using a really
nice light hand and applying this into
the crease you don't want to take this
color all the way up again because we
want this color to blend into the color
we just applied so you want to just go
back and forth and keep it closer to the
natural crease of your eye so where your
lid stops you want to keep it closer to
that point and again we're just using
our nice light hand and you don't apply
too much product at once you just want
to very gradually keep building it up
and then at this point you may feel like
the colors aren't blending together as
much go back into your clean brush that
has nothing on it and just help them to
colors blend really nicely together
and then as you can see everything just
starts to blend into one another and it
just looks like the darker Brown is
starting to transition into lighter
brown and then the lighter brown is
transitioning into your natural brow
color so it just looks like it's
blending into one another slow and
steady wins the race take your time with
this don't put on too much color at once
next I'm going to be going into this
chocolate shade and what this is going
to do is it's going to start to create
this nice dark smoky effect and it's the
same principles as the next two colors
you want to be slow with it don't apply
too much so I'm making sure to not take
too much product on my brush and I'm
also making sure to tap it off as well
just so that all the excess is taken off
I'm going to create a little bit more of
a V so I'm going to apply onto the outer
third of my eye but like I said I'm just
showing you how to blend it don't worry
too much about the shape because I'm
going to be doing a video soon on how to
create the best shape for your eye so
like I said before I'm just going to
apply some on the outer corner of my eye
and I'm just using the tip of this brush
just to pull it out very slightly but
you want to go in little stroking
motions I'm going to go in little
stroking motions just because you don't
end up with a big fat line going that
way you want to just stroke it outwards
so that it's almost tapering this color
outwards back into that brush that I
used to apply it my light brown and just
use it to very slightly blend that color
into the previous one and don't be
afraid to go back and forth between
brushes because that really does help to
create a really nice blend
then again you can go back in with your
clean brush and just make sure that
everything is really nice and blended
together you want the color to stay in a
certain place and you don't want to push
it up too high or you can do is just
keep your brush in that place and just
round it so just let's really go in
circular motions so we're not pushing
that color upwards we're just keeping
the brush in the same place it's almost
in the socket of my eye as you can see
and I'm just going in round motions and
what that round motion will do is blend
out the product but it won't push it up
too high like the other motions that go
back and forth like that that is more
likely to push the product upwards
whereas going like this is just going to
very slightly blend the product but not
take it up too far and when you want to
build up in that eyes shadow I always
recommend to kind of Pat it on just
because patting does build up a lot more
than kind of rubbing it because you're
rubbing it is more likely to take the
product away okay so once you're happy
with that Brown I'm going to show you
guys just to show you how to apply the
darkest color in the world of course I'm
going to show you how to apply a black
and how to make sure that your black
doesn't end up everywhere we don't have
ruin this good work that we've done as
you can see where we currently are is
that our brow bone blends into the
lightest Brown that we applied and then
you can see that it's going into the
soft brown and then at the moment the
darkest color is that dark brown we just
applied and you can see all the colors
transitioning into each other so next
I'm going to be going into the black
with that pencil brush and I'm just
going to be taking my black and making
sure especially because we're using a
black that were not taking too much we
want to make sure that we're very
gradually applying this and I'm just
going to apply into the outer v of my
eyes to just this V area here it might
help to look straight but because I want
you guys to be able to see I can't
because it's going to put the mirror in
front of your face might want to look
forward just so that you can see where
your crease is and where you want to
apply the black but I'm just going to be
looking down just because I want you
guys to get a good view of this I don't
apply too much we want to make sure that
we blend out this black first before we
apply any more the brush that I'm going
to be using to apply this is the zoeva
two to four brush and this is just a
very slim blending brush so like I said
before we don't want to move this
product too much upward so I'm that
you're going to put the brush on the
product and go in circular motions and
I'm not pressing too hard you can go
anti-clockwise or clockwise rotate
between the two honestly it does help
because as you can see the color is
gradually blending but it's not ending
up all the way up here because if we
were pushing it outwards black would end
up all the way up here so if you just
want to keep the brush there and just go
in rotating motions and that has
completely softened the black and it's
starting to look really nice and dark in
the crease and now you want to build up
a little bit more black making sure to
take off the excess of the brush and
just applying a little bit more onto
your brush
you
I'm just going to be applying my lid
color the lid color that I'm applying is
just this color here and then what I
usually do is I don't have foundation on
but I actually do have some foundation
on today so what you can do to clean up
the eyes is just apply a little bit of
concealer I'm going to be going in with
my Sigma 3d HD precision brush and I'm
just going to be using this to clean up
the edge of our eyeshadow and like I
said you can do this with no foundation
on and then just clean this with a
makeup wipe or some makeup remover on a
q-tip but I'm just going to be using
some concealer because it does do pretty
much the same thing so guys I have
applied the rest of my makeup apply my
eyeliner and my lashes some of the most
important things is to not give up
you're not necessarily going to get it
right on the first try especially if
you're a beginner when you're starting
out you're going to have a lot of failed
attempts this is how I've picked up all
of these tips I have learned these you
know not from listening to other people
but from just learning from my own
mistakes and you guys are going to pick
up your own tips as well from making
loads of mistakes and we're all
different we all do eye makeup
differently as well as the rest of our
face as well so some of these tips might
not feel natural to you but this is just
the tips that I have picked up and these
are the kind of steps that I will always
take and the advice that I will always
give on trying to create your perfectly
blended eye so the most important thing
this is just to take your time when
you're getting started don't rush your
makeup because I just feel that when you
rush you end up doing things wrong and
then you end up having to fix that you
end up spending so much time trying to
fix what you messed up because you were
rushing you end up taking more time than
just taking it slow just take the look
step by step just break it down just say
okay this is my first step then that's
the next step then I can go back with
that brush and blend this out and just
remember practice makes perfect I
honestly I can hold my hands up and say
that I practiced my butt off when I was
sewing out I really wanted to
and if you put your mind to anything you
can 100% achieve this even if you just
want to do makeup for fun if you're
doing makeup for your career this is
going to benefit you just keep at it
