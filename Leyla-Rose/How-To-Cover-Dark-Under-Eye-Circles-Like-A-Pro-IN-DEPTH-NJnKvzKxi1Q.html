Channel today I'm going to be doing
another addition to my how to be a pro
series been a while since I've done
another house would be a pro video but
today I really wanted to show you guys
how I like to counteract and cover dark
circles or eye bags under the eyes now
personally me if you follow me you'll
probably know that my under-eye circles
aren't really really bad I don't
personally suffer with very very bad
ones I just got back from a trip from
the US all the way on the west coast so
I'm suffering still with jetlag I
haven't been able to sleep properly my
sleeping pattern is totally messed up so
my eyes are definitely a lot darker than
they usually are so I took that as an
excuse to do a video on how to cover
them up I show you guys how to
counteract conceal set and brighten the
under eyes basically this video isn't as
long as my other Pro videos but I really
wanted to do another addition to this
series because it's been a while and I
want to get into doing more of them how
to be a pro videos that I do on my
channel are intended to be long are
intended to have a lot of talking
because it's meant to be a lesson what
is a lesson without talking I may repeat
things a few times but that's just
helping you guys you maybe understand
things some people don't get it the
first time so sometimes repeating things
just helps I have had quite a bit of
complaints on my other how to be a pro
video so I just wanted to give a little
disclaimer kind of sad I have to do that
but this video actually isn't too long
compared to my other ones but if there
aren't any in the future that I've a bit
of talking in it it's just because
talking helps beginners and this is what
these videos are intended for whether
you're a beginner in general in makeup
or if you're just a beginner within this
particular subject or technique we're
talking about so if you guys would like
to see how to cover up under-eye circles
like a pro just keep on watching but I
already have foundation on all of my
skin and I don't have anything on my
under eyes which is why I look so weird
right now foundation on everywhere apart
from my under eyes which I usually do so
I'm looking a bit strange right now but
I would be counteracting someone's
under-eye circles especially if they had
a dry skin the majority of the time I
would use an eye cream every single eye
cream I use under my eyes just makes my
eyes crease a little bit more so I'm
gonna skip it but if you feel like your
under eyes get a little bit drier you
can go ahead and apply it some under-eye
cream or
or just some sort of eye primer
underneath the eyes that you know that
is going to help prevent dryness I'm
going to move straight into color
correcting now usually I don't need to
color correct but sometimes when
darkness appears on the face you want to
counteract it with a car that is
basically the opposite of the tone
that's on your face for example you may
see videos on the internet of people
putting green on their face bring orange
on their face putting red on their face
what they are trying to do is counteract
the opposite color that is sitting
within the colors of their skin now it
can be a little bit confusing if you
have never heard of counteracting colors
before we want to determine what color
is the best to counteract that color
underneath the eyes what I have found
the most successful for under-eye
circles is an orange or peach toned
concealer so for me today the color
corrector I'm going to be using is a
concealer from mac is the pro can sue
and correct palette in medium deep are
you taking this orange tone concealer
and that is going to be my color
corrector for today my under eye circles
are not too bad I'm not going to be
taking too much of this color corrector
you have too much of that color
corrector on it's going to be quite hard
to cover that up with a flesh toned
concealer so I definitely say less is
more if you do feel like you need more
it's easier to build then take away
we're doing all the steps that I take on
one side of my face that you guys can
see the difference between the two and
that way you can just see how much this
process just really helps under-eye
circles going to be taking a little bit
of that orange tone concealer on my one
for two zoeva brush picking a little bit
up of this orange tone concealer and I'm
just going to be patting a very small
amount of it very gradually on the dark
area of my under-eye I don't want to
take it in a huge triangle like a good
concealer you only really want to put it
on the areas that are really dark I'm
just applying it underneath that whole
under-eye section but I concentrate the
majority of the product on the more
darker area so mainly my area is just
that curve there and also right
underneath the lid as well so right
underneath here just going to be taking
that same brush and just buffing this
color outwards so there are no harsh
lines because if there's a really harsh
line it's going to be very hard to cover
up afterwards with concealer you want to
make sure this is really blended out
it's enough they once I've kind of
blended that in and that's all pushed
into my skin I'm just going to be using
my finger a little bit just to make sure
it's really pushed in there and there's
not a lot of product really sitting on
the skin worst area definitely tends to
be this pot right near my inner tear
duct and just curving downwards where my
eye bags downwards so I'm just going to
be applying another thin layer just on
that area we don't apply it all over the
whole thing just on the area that's the
worst and again I'm just going to be
using my finger just to push this into
the skin times it doesn't matter how
thick a conceal you apply underneath
your eyes sometimes that darkness just
shows through anyway and when you see
that through your concealer that means
that you'll be better off applying a
color corrector now our next step is
going to be applying our concealer
personally when I'm doing color
correcting I like to go for quite a full
coverage concealer underneath the eye
just because a full coverage is more
likely to cover up that orange and you
don't wanna go for something that's too
lights of a coverage because that peach
tone is still going to come through your
under eyes today I'm going to be taking
the Maybelline instant age rewind eraser
and concealer that's really good for the
under eye area for one and also I really
like this because it really has a nice
full coverage and also it has a really
nice flesh tone to it so I'm just going
to be applying a really nice amount of
this underneath the eye covering up all
of the orange we applied personally I
like to apply in a triangle motion
because it really lifts the eyes and it
creates the illusion of a more lifted
face and also it will take away the
appearance of that round under-eye if
you're just applying your concealer in
just a round motion it's just going to
highlight that roundness of the bag so
you really want to create that nice
triangle effect and I'm just going to
apply quite a bit of this because I like
a lot of concealer but you do not have
to apply it this much if you don't like
a lot of concealer underneath your eye
you can blend this in with a sponge you
can blend this in with a bra
it really does depend on your preference
for me today I'm just going to be using
my finger because I really want to push
this into the skin
I wouldn't recommend using a brush to
buff it in because that will mix in the
orange color we used underneath the skin
what you want to do is push this on top
of the product we used we don't want to
be mixing it together
already look at the difference and use
less concealer that's what you like but
for me this is the kind of look that I
personally prefer and I like but I do
need to set it because it does look a
little bit strange until you set it into
place plus it feels a little weird and
if you don't set it it is going to move
about and it's just not going to look at
my concealer I'm going to be taking my
personal favorite setting powder this is
the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
this is a pressed powder you can bake
your under eyes if you like with the
loose powder you can use your favorite
setting powder this is just a powder I
know personally that really really works
for me so I'm just going to be applying
this and setting my under eyes using the
morphe e49 brush
oh that is all set into place and
already you can really see such a
difference this side just looks so
lifted it looks like my face has had
like almost a little facelift and you
totally can't see any dark circle you
can't see any bags it really does make
such a difference when you use that
triangular shape because it totally
draws attention away from that little
circle that sits underneath it not to
mention the orange really really really
helps to take away from the look of the
darkness right there underneath the eyes
so one extra tips I just want to let you
guys know that you can do is apply a
brightening of banana shade powder
underneath the eyes sometimes when this
inner part of my eye looks really dark I
like to apply a brightening powder just
on top powder that I used to set my
under eyes is a translucent powder so it
didn't add any brightness to this
under-eye area but you can do is take a
powder like this one from the kat von d
palette just look like a little bit of
that yellow color right underneath the
eyes just will we get that darkness I'm
just going to be dusting away any excess
powder just because sometimes when you
apply quite a bit of powder like I just
did some excess can still the top of
your skin and make you look a little bit
cakey I wanted to show you guys the
difference before I show you guys what
it looks like with a full face now
comparing the two sides of the eyes it's
pretty clear to see that this side is
super dark and this side just looks a
lot brighter plus my face looks a lot
more lifted it just gives a very
different effect and it's definitely a
technique I love to use guys this is how
it looks with both sides as you can see
no darkness showing through which means
mission accomplished by correcting is a
really good idea if you suffer with
really dark under eyes or if you're just
like me and sometimes when you don't get
enough sleep and just the normal layer
of concealer just doesn't cover it
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
