channel today I'm going to be showing
you a long awaited video it is the
contouring video now if you guys watch
my videos a lot you would know that I
don't tend to contour a lot in my videos
but contouring isn't necessarily a
necessity for a lot of my looks it's now
become a really popular part of the
makeup world and a lot in the industry a
lot of very well-known celebrities such
as Kim Kardashian have been rocking this
for years now and it is something that
in my opinion has got blown out
proportion a little bit contouring is an
amazing aspect of makeup it can help to
enhance certain features and to hide
others so there are many ways to go
about contouring in contour very lightly
with bronzer or you can go all the way
using cream and powder products today
are decided to do cream and powder
products to create a full contoured face
look meaning the face that knows
everything I just decided that I would
do that because I don't tend to do that
much in my videos whereas you guys see
me very likely contour with its
contouring powders and bronzers all the
time and I thought I would just show you
the more full-on version of doing a
contouring look so just to let you know
guys it's definitely something I
wouldn't wear for a everyday or even a
lot of evening looks it's definitely
something very strong and especially for
me I feel like my face can take too much
of it and even now I feel like a little
bit overwhelmed with how strong it is
and just for me I just feel like my face
is quite I asked quite a small face and
a lot of the time I only like to contour
very lightly on some areas I do like
contouring my nose
sometimes depends whatever type of mood
it strikes me and what I'm doing a
makeup bag so guys if you would like to
know how I achieve a full-on contoured
leg and please watch fun so guys before
we put any of the makeup on we want to
make sure that our skin is prepped
properly because when we're applying a
lot of makeup onto our skin it clogs up
into our pores and it just doesn't look
nice so you want to make sure that it
looks as smooth as possible so first I
applied my moisture infusion serum by
Mac which I always apply and then I
applied my normal moisturiser which is
the dramatically different moisturizer
by Clinique and then I'm going to go
over with a primer and I'm using my Dior
CC primer but because it's just nice and
light but it gives you a nice airbrushed
finish next I'm going in with my Giorgio
Armani foundation as I usually would the
only difference is that I'm not going to
be applying a lot of it today I'm just
going to be applying one very thin layer
and just blending that in and this
matches the rest of my body before
anyone says anything it's someone always
comments on it but yes this does match
the rest of my body I promise and I'm
going to be blending all this in with a
flat morphe brush which I've been
absolutely loving at the moment so I'm
just gonna make sure to blend everything
evenly just have a nice even layer all
over the skin and I know a lot of people
tend to do foundation a little bit
differently when they contour some
people like to use a darker foundation
and the light foundation to contour but
I prefer having a normal base underneath
it and then I usually like to highlights
with a concealer I'm using my Maybelline
fit me concealer in a lighter color than
my skin it's probably about three shades
lighter than my natural skin tone maybe
even four but I'm just going to be
drawing a very straight line down the
side of my nose and it's going to be
covering my nostril a little bit what
that is going to do is it's going to
narrow my nose down because I do have a
slightly wide nose at the bottom but not
at the top so that's just gonna make it
look a lot more straight and I find that
on certain noses it can be a
a bit harder to contour so I'm just
going to be highlighting the inner part
of my forehead and then I'm going to
take that down to the bridge of my nose
as well and because my nose like I said
it gets bigger towards the end than it
is on the bridge I'm going to take it
down about half way and then when it
gets to the bottom I'm going to draw a
little circle and that will almost give
the appearance of a turned-up nose
instead of turning down then I'm going
to take Mac light boost which is a very
light highlighter pen and just apply it
on the very upper point of our cheekbone
and I'm going to blend that all together
with a real techniques sponge and I'm
just going to be using lots of bouncing
motions just to Pat that into the skin
because we are using a lot of products
if you use a brush I just feel like it
doesn't blend in as good
and I'm going to leave that until it's
almost semi blended in so it's not
completely blended in because we're
going to be setting that with a powder
and I feel like sometimes when you allow
it to be semi set instead of fully set
it just looks a lot more smooth under
the eyes so I'm just using my finger to
get into the very small corners of my
eye
next I'm going to be using my finger to
do the other small areas like my Cupid's
bow and as you can see I've just applied
some on the very tops of my Cupid's bow
so I'm just blending that in with my
finger and then I'm also going to take
my sponge again and blend it in in my
forehead in little circular motions then
I'm going to take my finger and I'm
gonna be patting that into my nose
because I don't want the lighter area to
get all over the rest of my nose I
wanted to be in a very specific
placement so I'm just very going to be
patting that onto very small areas then
I'm going to be taking my Mac CC powder
in the yellow color and I'm going to be
packing that on quite thickly to make
sure that's nice and set and I like to
use this instead of my banana powder
because it's just a lot smoother and
it's less chalky than the banana powder
so this is just a really good dupe for
that or it's a lot better in my opinion
I prefer it
and I'm just going to be blending it in
with that same brush and that just gives
us a really nice bright under-eye lip
then I'm going to be setting the other
areas that we highlighted with that same
powder next I'm going to be taking my RC
ma palette and taking this dark
foundation color you can take any cream
color that you want I'm just going to be
using a very small domed brush and using
it to apply it to my hollows of my
cheeks and as you can see it's quite a
dark color so you don't to applied too
much of this and I would say this is
about five shades darker than my natural
skin tone and I'm going to applying it
to the sides of my forehead to make my
face shape look a lot more narrow then
I'm going to applying it to the very
inner part of my Cupid's bow and also my
jawline because my jawline is quite
defined I have quite a large jawline so
I just like to try and cover that up as
much as possible
then with a smaller brush I'm going to
be going very slightly down the corners
of my nose and as I said my nose gets
thicker towards the bottom so I like to
go a little bit more closer together
like I want the two lines on either side
of my nose to get closer together as it
gets to the bottom so as you can see I'm
just going to be applying a little bit
more just like a third up from the
bottom and what that does is it gives
the appearance of that turned up nose
again and then I'm going to be shading
at the bottom as well and what that does
is just makes the nose appear shorter
then I'm just going to be blending that
in with a rounded morphe brush and we
need to make sure that we're blending
this really really well because we don't
want it to look unnatural we want all
the colors to blend together but still
be in the right placement so I'm just
going to be blending that in to my
hairline just to make sure that it looks
nice and natural and you want to make
sure that all the colors have no harsh
lines you literally want them to blend
into each other and then as it gets to
the cheekbone you just want to make sure
that you're blending upwards instead of
downwards because again you don't want
to make the color the dark color in the
wrong place so you can see I'm just kind
of flicking it upwards to prevent it
going below the line then I'm just using
my finger again for the smaller areas
and then when it gets to the nose I'm
just using that small dome brush again
and I'm going to be using that too to
blend the lines on my nose
it really is different for different
shapes of noses and faces so you want to
try and analyze your face as much as
possible what works for me might not
work for you I've found that using that
little line at the bottom of my nose
really really helps to make my nose look
a little bit more turned upwards instead
of turned downwards and also just
blending things in with my finger just
to make sure that everything is really
blended in because the nose contour
can't be too harsh otherwise it's really
really a pyram
next I'm going to be taking a contouring
powder just to go over that contour on
my cheekbone and that just makes
everything look a little bit more
exaggerated you don't have to do this
when you don't use this it looks a
little bit more natural I just feel like
it creates a new dimension to the
contouring and I just think it it pulls
the whole thing together
next I'm going to be taking that same
yellow powder that we use under the eyes
and I'm just going to use it to kind of
buff everything together and that just
gives everything a really natural look
then I'm just going to highlight the
tops of my cheekbones just to make
everything look nice and pulled forward
and it also gives us a really gorgeous
glow as well and again I'm just doing it
half down the bridge of my nose and then
I'm gonna do a tiny little circle at the
bottom and that just makes our nose look
a little bit more of a button nose
instead of more turned outwards
so guys as the end of this contouring
video as you can see this is what it
looks like with a full face of makeup I
honestly feel like contouring should
never be used unless you're wearing a
full face of makeup because it just
feels really strange otherwise there's a
lot going on on your skin and your skin
doesn't look very structured and without
any other features to kind of bring it
out I just feel like it looks pretty
weird so with a full face of makeup I
think it looks amazing so I really do
like how it looks now but in an in
general I just feel like really softly
called grow your face there's a lot
better than being too harsh for there
even though I used a lot of heavy
products it does still look quite
natural and it just enhances my face in
the right way without looking too strong
and I do love a strong cheek contour
sometimes with creams and powders you
have to be careful at how strong they
are hey guys I really hope you enjoyed
