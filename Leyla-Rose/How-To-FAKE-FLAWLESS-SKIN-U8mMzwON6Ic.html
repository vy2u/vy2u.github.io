channel I'm finally back in my office
I've decided to start filming in here
more because the lighting is way better
for makeup videos honestly I was trying
to do it in my bedroom and my makeup
just always looked patchy and the
lighting was just weird so I'm hoping
that this is a lot better this time
today's video is actually a video I
didn't plan on doing but my skin just
flared up I've had a breakout recently I
don't know what's going on with my skin
whatever imperfections that you may have
you may feel empowered by being totally
bare and showing it to the world or you
may feel really empowered by covering it
up I am not judging anyone for wanting
to cover it or to not wear it I'm not
saying which is better and which is not
honestly it's all down to you and how
you feel I do go out with no makeup on I
go to the gym with no makeup on I go out
with no makeup on but I do feel
self-conscious sometimes so that a lot
of you guys may suffer from skin issues
as well and although you can take the
very best care of your skin which I do I
really really do some things within your
life stress hormones diet lifestyle any
lifestyle aspect can affect your skin
the weather as well can definitely
affect it so I'm gonna be showing you
guys today how to fake flawless skin and
honestly my skin is not flawless in the
slightest the skin texture right now
it's so bad it definitely looks
different in different lighting so bear
that in mind is really wanted to use
this time when my skin was having a
woman to help you guys like I said
though you don't have to fake flawless
skin
I feel like deep down we all would love
to have saw the skin and although it's
often unachievable I don't think there's
many people out there that do have
flawless skin truly I mean there's a few
people I know and I just look at them
like I just but if you're like me it's
totally fine to not have perfect skin
it's normal to have skin imperfections
and we're gonna rock it you can rock it
like I do when I go to the gym when I go
out with no makeup on or we can fake for
the skin as well you can do both you
don't have to sit within one category
I'm just showing you guys that when you
want your face to look flawless you can
do it I just honestly just wanted to
make this video to not only empower you
guys but Tim power myself as well and to
prove
to myself that I can go onto the
Internet in front of hundreds of
thousands of people and show you guys
how to cover my ok which is not always
easy to do when you put your face out
there but hey anyway enough rambling I
just wanted to Chuck that little nugget
of inspirational chat before we actually
got into the make up make up washes off
please bear that in mind so don't take
it too seriously and I just love you

far and I hope you enjoyed this video

and thumbs up so I know that you love it

that you have in might help someone else
looking in the comments or me as well on
how you achieve flawless skin anyway
without further rambling let's get on
into this video let's go okay guys so as
you can see my skin is just not doing
its best right now there are a lot of
red bumps and a lot of them are deep
underneath the skin which definitely
tells me that it's not my skincare
routine and that it's something to do
with my lifestyle or hormones because
yeah it's it's like really deep under
the skin but I like to do before I prime
is moisturize my skin and then I like to
pry my skin with two primers I would
definitely recommend you guys doing this
if you want to get the most flawless
base possible I like to go in with a
hydrating base first of all just to make
every wear nice and smooth and just
smooth down any dry skin and then I like
to go in with a pore filling primer
around the center area of my face and
this just helps to deal with any open
pores and just to smooth that area in
general because this is where I get the
most skin texture okay so next we're
going to be moving on to color
correction and I would definitely
recommend you guys doing this no matter
what is discolored on your skin in my
case there's a lot of redness because of
those red bumps underneath the skin so I
use a green concealer I have done videos
on color correcting before but generally
you want to go with the opposite color
to whatever tone is on your face so I
like to apply a decent amount of green
concealer to help counteract that
redness apply it and blend it in but
don't blend it away so much that I'm
removing the green tin I'm moving on to
my foundation and as you can see like
the way I apply it is
and I'm just like rubbing it over the
skin and I find that this is better
rather than applying it in little bits
like I like to kind of spread it all
over the skin and then blend it now I am
using circular motions for the moment to
blend in my first layer but generally if
you want to build the most flawless base
possible you want to use a lot of
patting motions as you see me doing here
as it comes to certain areas of the face
I don't need as much coverage so you'll
see me doing more circular motions but
especially when it comes to this second
layer as I'm doing now you'll see me Pat
it into the skin and this helps to build
as much coverage as possible and I
prefer building coverage with foundation
rather than concealer personally now I'm
just going to be moving on to creating a
flawless under-eye as you guys have seen
me do before I'm just taking a normal
under-eye can see that as I normally
would I'm actually mixing two because I
really love to do that and as I apply it
I like to apply it in an upside-down
triangle shape and I also apply this on
the tops of my eyelids as well now this
has actually been the only area I've
been applying concealer recently I used
to apply it on my forehead and my chin
but I found that if I had acne it would
sometimes draw attention to that area
unnecessarily so I like to keep all of
the brightness on the under eye area and
before I set it I like to spray my face
with a setting spray and then I will go
in to set it and I'm using a powder
which I love and it actually has
smoothing properties within this powder
it's from soap &amp;amp; Glory I actually love
this and I like to Pat the powder into
the skin to really make sure that I'm
setting it into place but I'm also not
rubbing around the foundation and I'm
taking away any coverage I want to make
sure that I'm really packing it on to
the face rather than rubbing it away
also I am going to be applying a pressed
powder as well I'm using the studio fix
powder from Mac
afterwards I'm just gonna be applying it
only on the areas where my skin gets a
little bit harder to cover so basically
my cheeks my cheeks are so hard to cover
sometimes so just gonna be applying that
on there also I just wanna let you guys
know as well a little tip the more flat
your face looks meaning the less light
that is reflecting off it the more
flawless it's going to seem so basically
the more shiny products that you have on
your face the more attention it's going
to draw and the more intense your skin
texture is going to
so I would definitely recommend if you
do have bad skin texture like me stick
to a matte base and apply highlight if
you really really want to if you have
skin texture in the area where you want
to apply it I would honestly recommend
staying away from it I know it's odd but
generally it's it's kind of just the way
to make your face look as flawless as
possible so I just applied a matte
bronzer on the areas where I wanted to
add some color and to define my face but
I skipped highlight because I know that
it would make my face look not as
flawless and then I just finished off
with some setting spray and this is how
it looks with a full face of makeup I
really hope you guys found this helpful
this is just my routine that I use to
fake flawless skin like I said at the
beginning of this video it's just makeup
I still love myself without the makeup
just sometimes it really helps to be
able to know how to cover it but yeah I
hope you guys like this video if you did
