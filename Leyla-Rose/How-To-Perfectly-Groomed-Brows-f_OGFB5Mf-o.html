today I'm going to be showing you guys a
DIY how to get perfectly groomed brows I
have plucked my brows on my own for
years and I have finally found a way
that really prevents me from over
blocking my brows and I just really
wanted to share it with you guys and
also just all of my tips and tricks on
how I do my brows it's very simple and
it's a lot easier than you think so I'm
going to be showing you guys how to
transform your brows from a big fluffy
mess into a beautiful brow masterpiece
tip again I'm gonna be taking a spoolie
brush and just brushing through my
eyebrows I'm gonna be doing this a lot
throughout the whole tutorial because it
just keeps the brows in place and then
I'm going in with some concealer this is
a cream concealer and I'm just using a
flat brush to carve out the shape of the
brow that I want and this is key this is
definitely the biggest step in the whole
tutorial because this really prevents
you from over plucking and that was
definitely something that I used to do I
used to over pluck but this just acts as
a guideline and you can clearly see the
kind of shape that we want to go for and
you can still see the brows we want to
take away as well and again I'm going
back into that spoolie just to keep
everything in shape just so that we
again don't over block I'm going to
start to pluck now and this is of course
self-explanatory I'm just pulling the
skin just to make sure that the hair
comes out really easily and I personally
prefer to pluck rather than thread or
wax just because I do feel like with
plucking I have more control and with
threading I've tried before and it's
just a little bit awkward doing it on
myself so for doing my own brows I
definitely prefer to use a tweezer but
it's totally up to you if you feel more
comfortable threading or waxing you can
go ahead and do whatever you want but I
definitely recommend it for your first
time going with tweezers just because I
know it takes more time but you do have
more precision
also I'm just going to be taking some
nail scissors and trimming some of the
hairs they like to droop downwards I
have quite curly brow hairs as you can
probably tell and so this really does
help and it helps to maintain a nice
shape instead of just plucking out the
ones that call downwards and again I'm
just going through the brows just to
make sure that I can see exactly what
I'm doing and I am brushing the inner
corner of my hairs upwards and I am
going to trim those a little bit as well
because I do find that the hairs right
at the top do you get quite long
sometimes I'm just trimming them
slightly
and then I'm just trimming some of the
other little hairs as well the ones that
just feel like it ruins the shape a
little bit and then I'm going in with my
tweezers again and I am going to be just
plucking the hairs on the top of the
brow and also in between the browsers
well I do have a few little hairs I just
like to pluck those just so that
everything looks nice and neat
you
and then finally I'm just running
through some clear brow gel this is the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills clear brow gel
and this just really helps to see where
the brows are going to sit I definitely
recommend using a clear brow gel if you
like to go for a natural brow or just
run everyday because you can definitely
like sculpt your brows without actually
having to put anything through it and so
this just really helps throughout this
process just to see if I've missed
anything because I will be using this
brow gel on an everyday basis so it is
good to just see where the brows are
going to sit with a clear brow gel and
then just to finish everything off again
and just to see if I like the entire
shape I'm just going underneath and
sculpting out the bottom of the brow
with some concealer and if I have missed
anything I can go over and pluck it but
if everything is perfect then this will
just highlight and lift the brow as well
so guys that is the end of this tutorial
I hope that you enjoyed something a
little bit different and I really really
hope that this helped you because I am
so much more happier with my brows now
and I do the same process every other
week or whenever I need to so it really
is helpful that I can do them myself and
yeah like I said I'm just really happy
with the outcome and I hope that you
guys can use this too and be happy with
your brows as well and I just wanted to
show you guys a little quick before
again so you guys could see what it
looked like before and then I'll show
you guys what it looks like after again
