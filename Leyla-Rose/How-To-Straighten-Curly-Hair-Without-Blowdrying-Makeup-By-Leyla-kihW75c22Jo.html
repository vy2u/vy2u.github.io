today I'm going to be sharing with you
how I straighten my hair this was
requested when I done my curly hair
routine video which I will pop the link
in the description box for you so that
you guys can find that video that's how
I do my hair when I have it naturally
curly and this is how I have it when it
is straight obviously this is a really
simple tutorial some people may not
benefit from this because it's such a
simple tutorial my hair is practically
always frizzy so I thought that I would
just show you this really easy technique
that I like to use instead of having to
blow-dry your hair straight I am all
full when it comes to blow-drying my
hair straight I cannot do it I have like
zero coordination so I basically take a
different step to prevent my hair from
going into tiny little ringlets and then
having to brush my hair through that and
then ending up with this big fat afro
which always happens with me so this
just prevents that stage it just cuts
out but say that it cuts down the frizz
in half so even if you don't have curly
hair you just someone from frizz this
might really help you I'm not I have a
professional at all you might be
thinking what the hell is she doing but
this works for me I find zero breakage
with this my hair has completely grown
since I've been doing this instead of
brushing my hair through and tugging it
and yeah I hope that you guys enjoy
anyway if you want to see how I
straighten my hair and please keep on
watching so before I begin I just wanted
to talk to you guys a little bit about
why I look like a six year old girl and
the reason being is because you guys
have seen my hair my hair is very curly
very coarse and when I let it dry it
does spring up and turn into these
really bouncy curls and when you brush
through them cause it just turns into
frizz so what I basically done last
night is wash my hair applied all my
hair products to my hair and then
literally tied my hair into these really
tight braids on either side of my head
so when I take out the braids it's gonna
reveal these kind of waves instead of
them really ringlets écoles so it just
makes it a lot easier for me to
straighten I hate to blow-dry my hair
straight like I can't do it I'm really
uncoordinated like that like I don't
going like that trying to do it unless
someone else does it for me it just ends
up looking
frizzy again so I just find this is the
best way that works for me I can do it
straight from frizzy as well but it just
takes a lot longer okay guys so we're
gonna get started off by removing the
braids from our hair and we're just
gonna start to unravel the braids from
the bottom and once the braid is
completely out its about half as frizzy
as my hair would usually be which is
pretty amazing considering how curly and
frizzy my hair naturally gets so
obviously this isn't a solution to
remove frizz completely but it's
definitely a lot less frizzy ah it looks
just a lot flatter so what I like to do
is just section my hair and have a small
section and begin to comb that through
with my tangle teezer
and obviously this was already combed
through before I have put it into the
braid so I'm just going over it just to
make sure there are no tangles and then
I'm gonna be taking my GHD gold heat
protectant spray and I'm just gonna be
spraying this over each section and
allowing it to dry before we straighten
and then the next part is pretty
standard but just gonna go over with my
ghd's these ghd's are amazing these are
the larger ones so there are three sizes
of GHGs I believe and this is the bigger
one so it basically covers a larger part
of hair which is really good for someone
with a lot of hair like me so what I
like to do is just go from the top and
just take it down to the bottom I'm
gonna start to speed through this
because it does take a while and then in
between each section I like to just comb
it through just to make sure I've gone
all tangles and just to make sure that
I'm making sure that everything is
really nice and straight so I'm just
gonna whiz you through the whole head
because it is basically that over and
over and over again it's very standard
but what I like to do is in between I
like to make sure that I'm constantly
combing it through and that just
prevents any hair from tangling up
I'm also making sure to straighten the
back of my head as well just to make
sure there are no kinks and making sure
to straighten as tight to the root as
possible
so as you can see the more you go it
starts to have that nice sleek straight
appearance then I'm gonna be doing my
top layer and I'm just gonna be going
over it the same as I would the rest of
the hair and making sure to brush
through it just to make sure that it all
looks nice and straight so now once I
finished straightening the top section I
just saw place it where I want to when
it's firstly washed I like to put it in
the middle and then when it starts to
get greasy out I always tend to like
flip over because it's easier to conceal
that it's a little bit greasy but don't
like to wash my hair too often because I
have mentioned before that my hair is
quite a coarse hair type it gets quite
dry very easily and I feel that when I
wash my hair more often it just starts
to dry out and my hair doesn't have
enough time to absorb my own natural
oils you guys want to know all the
products that I use generally how I got
my hair to grow I will just stand up a
second show you where my hair is so my
hair is arms all the way down here so if
I can't even show you guys it's all
we'll be doing a haircare routine or
just generally what I do for my hair
when it's curly and straight if you guys
want me to do that for you I will
definitely do that so leave me a comment
down below if you guys want to see a
haircare video I know this was a really
simple video but you guys really wanted
to see how I done it is of course
without any hair extensions so you guys
know that I love my bellami hair
extensions I've been using them for
years so if I do ever want any longer or
more volumous hair look I will tend to
pop in my Bellamy Lily hair extensions I
do have a discount code for them so I'll
pop that in the description box if you
do want to use a discount code on any
hair extensions or these six in one
color so I'll pop that
as well if you have any more hair
tutorial requests please do let me know
because I would love to share with you
guys the little tips and tricks that I
picked up even though I'm not a
professional hair person thank you so
much for watching this video I hope that
you enjoyed please give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
