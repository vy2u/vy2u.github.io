channel today's video is going to be a
really quick and easy tip on how to
change any lipstick formula into a super
matte one I wanted to show you guys this
tip because I really feel like it's
great if you do have products that you
love the color of but you just don't
love the fact that it's too glossy then
this will definitely help with that I
just find that if you do have lipsticks
that you love but you'd like to make
more matte then this is the step for you
so the first step is going to be
hydrating your lips I personally love
the EOS lip balms because they are
fairly matte and they don't make your
lips feel too glossy you don't want them
to feel glossy underneath the lipstick
so use a lip balm that doesn't have too
much shine and make sure they go lips
are super hydrated next we're gonna get
started with lining our lips you can use
whatever colorful your lip color that
you like this will work with absolutely
any shade from the lightest to the
darkest I decided to go for a nude
because that's just what I wanted to use
and I'm just gonna be lining my lips as
I usually would and I'm just filling my
lips a little bit with the lip liner and
also lining around the perimeter of my
lips also
then as for the lipstick shade I decided
to pick something that was very sheer
this is the mac mineralize lipstick and
pure pout and I love this color but it's
just a little bit too shiny for me so I
thought this would be an absolute
perfect one to show you just want to
apply a really good layer of this
especially if it's quite each share one
that way you get the most pigmentation
possible I personally feel that this
works the best with satin lipsticks but
I wanted to use a shinier one just to
show you then we're gonna take some
translucent powder this one is the Mac
CC prep and primer powder you can use
any type of translucent powder just make
sure that it doesn't have any pigment in
it and I'm gonna take a big fluffy brush
and just begin it to Pat this onto my
lips I like to do this in layers so just
Pat them on and then continue to apply
some afterwards keep applying until you
have your desired amount of madness I
feel like the more you go the more may
it becomes and I just really like the
way this looks so I like to go quite a
bit until I'm happy with how my ears
so as you can see guys this gives off
the best matte finish that's completely
kissable transfer proof it's amazing and
it doesn't move which is incredible I
hope you guys enjoyed this tip I use it
all the time and I hope that you guys
will love using this tip too I hope you
