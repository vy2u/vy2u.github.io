today we are doing another how to be a
pro kind of video and this is how to
wing your liner like a pro this is
specifically on winged liner this is
just going to be how to kind of wing
your liner the kind of easiest method
how to do it tips and tricks on how to
get the most stability how to create the
most definition and yeah just a little
bits and bobs that helps and I'm going
to tell you guys a couple of things that
you can do now before I begin because to
be honest I didn't talk a lot through
the video because doing my liner and
talking at the same time it's really
really hard
I also messed up so I show you guys how
to fix when you mess up so yeah we're
all human I messed up we all mess up and
we will have then days I thought I'm
having a bad makeup day do you ever have
them days where you just feel like
nothing kind of sits right yeah I'm
having that day I'm so yeah it was a
good day I guess to film the you know
how do you align ugh this is the worst
thing to mess up on but I showed you
guys how to fix it so yeah I'm going to
tell you guys a couple of things first
general thing that you want to do is
lift your eyes upwards
that's what winged liner intends to do
it's kind of that feline effect and when
you look at a feline or cat's eyes like
an actual cat and animal their eye kind
of turns upwards and that's what winged
liner does for our eye shape so before
we begin as well let's talk liners so it
really does depend what liner you're
using can use any eyeliner to create
this look but depending on which liner
you use it's going to create a different
effect every single time I use the
liquid today and in my opinion a liquid
is going to give you the most definition
the most bold line the most kind of
effect because it's a liquid and it
dries and it dries to this and it
doesn't do anything else but this liquid
that I'm going to be using is the super
liner perfect slim from L'Oreal I highly
recommend liquid liners like this
because it almost feels like a pen the
nib is extremely thin so it's really
good for beginners because you can start
thin and gradually thicken it pen liners
are incredible because it almost feels
like you are holding a pen I believe
that when manufacturers create these
they create these for beginners because
everyone knows how to hold a pen liquids
are the most kind of defined way of
doing your eyeliner in my opinion is it
just kind of gives you that instant
definition you don't really have to do
as much as the other types of lineup of
course different types of liquids that
you can get you can get this one this is
a Lime Crime one an old one that I
bought a while ago and this is more like
a brush so it's almost like a brush
inside a liquid and I found this one
quite hard to use so there's that type
of liquid and then there's also this one
here which is from the balm which you
guys have seen me using multiple times
and this is almost like a little bit
more of a nib and I like these as well
but the easiest one to use in my opinion
are the Pens other different types of
liners on gels gels are also a really
good option because this will give you
great definition as well but the thing
about these and that is but the thing
about gel is that it's going to give you
a different effect every single time
depending on which brush you're using so
what's great about these is that you can
buff these out to create more of a
smudged effect so these are a little bit
more versatile but for this start of
eyeliner I would say that these are more
difficult to use because are harder to
clean up because the majority of time
they are waterproof so they can be quite
hard to clean up when I made my mistake
today you guys are going to see what I'm
talking about
it would have been a lot harder to clean
up if I was using a gel so these are
more recommended if you're used to
creating a line go ahead and try them
because you might find these easier this
is just my opinion I personally have
found it harder to use these but you
might find it a lot easier so it just
what works for me and what I've noticed
works with the people that I've taught
in the past doesn't necessarily mean
that it's going to work for you to try
out all forms of liner also of course we
have pencil pencil is not the
recommended form of applying a winged
liner but you do it if that's what you
want obviously a pencil is not going to
create as much of a defined line as a
liquid this is going to create more of a
smoky and smoldering coal effect rather
than a defined wing of liner so a pencil
is quite easy to use in the sense that
you know it feels like a pencil but you
could replace this for the pen liner
that I was telling you about earlier and
it has a very similar
to it so definitely try you know
different forms of them but this is not
going to create this kind of definition
and of course lastly you can use a black
shadow with again a different brush but
that is not going to be as harsh if you
want this kind of effect but you donít
to be as in-your-face you're using a
black eye shadow is a great option for a
more natural but still defined effect it
might recommended one to you is the pen
liners just because if you are a
beginner and you can never get the liner
right I think that you'll be able to get
it with the pen liners that L'Oreal one
isn't very expensive it's really easy to
use it dries in that and I think it's
really easy to clean up as well it's not
waterproof but you can always go on top
of it with a waterproof eyeliner to make
sure that it stays on but I personally
never had a problem with that I don't
really care about waterproof liners I
would just rather get you know that line
to be perfect first but I'm going to
show you guys the tutorial of how I do
my winged liner there's not a lot of
chatting through it as much as the other
one because it's not as much to talk
through with it but just like to tell
you guys where I like to start how I
balance my hand you know where I start
to draw my line from I just kind of go
into it so if you do want to know how to
get this wing and then please keep on
watching so like I spoke about before
you want to pick the learning you're
most comfortable with
and the line of the item the most
comfortable with and I highly recommend
to you guys is the L'Oreal super liner
perfect slim it's very nice and the nib
is perfect like I explained before so
I'm just going to jump straight in the
tutorial I want to show you guys how to
do it freehand so I'm not going to be
using a piece of tape so if you guys
want to use a piece of tape and just
line it up with your bottom lash line
you can completely go ahead and do that
it's a very good way for beginners I
think the best way is to start in the
middle of the lid because it's kind of
like the largest area I'm going to start
doing the middle of the lid and then I'm
going to go on to the inner corner of my
eye and then I'm gonna join the up to
the outer corner of my eye and just
almost line my lid first before I do
anything I wouldn't recommend just kind
of just going in and lining a lid
straight away white recommend for you to
start doing which is a really good tip
for any style of makeup if you want to
get precision and just be able to
balance
kind of steady yourself and just allow
you to be able to create as a nice
straight line holding my liner like this
using my first two fingers and my thumb
and just using it to kind of like that
like you would hold a pen I don't
actually hold that like this if you hold
a pen like that you just want to kind of
hold it and you can use that finger as
well I want to keep my pinkie free so
make sure that your pinkie is free to do
the balancing for you and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to place my
pinkie on my cheek and then I'm going to
begin what that will do is just give you
complete balance you won't feel like
your hand is shaking if I don't have my
pinkie there you know my hand will kind
of shake if you're you know something
jogs you we're going to have a lot more
control than if you didn't so I'm just
doing that to make sure that there's
going to be no jolting and I have just
complete control over this eyeliner on
this island it's almost become part of
my hand and just be able to move it
along really really easily and just a
really good way is just getting used to
placing your pinkie on your cheek and
then beginning so I'm just going to
start on the middle of my lid and you
want to start as thin as possible so I'm
literally just creating a very thin line
I kind of can't talk while I'm doing
this or I'll just be silent for the
moment so this little tiny line we've
just done I'm going to draw in from my
inner corner and just connect it
okay so so far we've just got a really
thin line coming from my inner corner
and then it's going to the middle and
now I'm just going to do the same thing
on the outer corner and you have to
worry too much about the shape for the
moment cuz we are going to thicken this
okay so at the moment what we're seeing
is just a really thin line at the lining
at the rim of our lash line and that is
exactly what we want and what we're
going to do now is gradually thicken it
until we're happy with the thickness so
for me I like to go for quite a thick
wing because it just flatters my eye
shape a lot better than a thin line
upwards but also the smaller lid space
you have so where you look forward the
less lid space you have the thinner your
wing should be because I've got quite a
lot of lid space I can do it quite thick
and it doesn't make my eyes look really
you know small or anything like that so
you know I like it small as well I like
to go for a thicker wing so if you've
got a smaller lid space I'd be a little
bit you know wary with how thick your
making is you just got kind of analyze
your eye and just think okay I need to
stop now but doing it slowly is going to
mean you're not going to go too thick
too quickly
okay so now that I'm kind of happy with
how thick the line is we're going to
start creating the wing and this is
where a lot of people struggle and this
is where it starts to get a little bit
more difficult so this is where the real
concentration comes in so what we want
to imagine is almost as if our bottom
lash line is continuing upward so we
want to kind of line our way and the
start of our wing with our bottom lash
line and I like to just continue that
direction so as you can see on this side
it's almost as if my bottom lash line is
continuing upward so it just kind of
fits my eye shape you can go for any
angle some people like to go for a
really high one some people like to go
for quite a straight one just a bit from
what kind of style of makeup you're
going for one and all I like to do is
just start on the very outer corner of
my eyes and literally where my outer
corner stops so like I said we're just
going to follow that crease and just
start to pull it up
like I said how far you want to pull up
is completely up to you and don't worry
too much because we can fix how kind of
straight it's after out with a bit of
concealer so don't worry too much about
it and then once I'm at this point what
I will do is look forward and this
really helps because as you can see we
have our crease here a lot of the time
people will look down do it look up and
then a lot of the liner ends up getting
hidden in the crease so looking straight
just prevents you from you know being
tricked into thinking that your crease
is a lot less deep-set than what it is
so for me I just like to look straight
and then what I like to do is just
connect from here to the end of our wing
so I just almost like to pull it across
so from this point which is almost like
the outer third of my eye and I'm just
going to pull it to the outer corner of
the wing
and then I'm just filling in
okay so I've realized I've gone too
thick on this side so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take my concealer and
it's good this has happened because this
is very common to do stuff like this but
to go too thick I'm going to show you
guys how to fix it so I'm just going to
take a bit of concealer and I'm just
going to literally drag upwards
okay so I'm just going to kind of fill
in this part here and looking straight
again I just want to make sure this is a
really nice fluid line as you can see at
the moment it kind of Jags downwards I
want to make sure that this connects to
that really fluidly so I'm just gonna
okay guys as you can see I have the rest
of my makeup on I hope you guys found
this video helpful to create that
perfect eyeliner look you need to
practice and at the end of the day it's
just makeup makeup wipes off you know
you can just keep practicing I literally
do a wing and take it off do a wing and
