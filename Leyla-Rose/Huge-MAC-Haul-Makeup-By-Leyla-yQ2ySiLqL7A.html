channel today I'm going to be showing
you a Mac cool that I did recently and I
decided to do a different type of video
just to show you guys the products more
up close and it'll be a lot quicker as
well so the first product that I bought
was three of the Mac face and body
foundations and these retail for 28
pounds and this is one of my favorite
foundations and it kits staple and it
decided to buy these in just a couple of
colors I bought them in c4 c5 and n1 and
I've already got quite a few colors
already so I just wanted to grab a
couple more just to add to my care and I
also used c4 and sometimes c5 on myself
the next product is the max master
foundation and this is in number four
this is for myself because I was using
number five but that is way too dark for
me now that I'm in the winter so number
four will be a better match for me
and also I bought oil control ocean and
the moisture infusion serum and these
are my favorites for prepping my face
before makeup and the oil control ocean
is 2450 and this is one of my favorite
products to control the oils from coming
out of your skin and because my skin is
quite oily it really helps to hydrate
but to prevent the oil
and also my moisture infusion serum I
applied twice a day and absolutely love
it it really really hydrates the skin
into the lower layers of the skin and
it's just absolutely amazing and that
one is twenty four fifty as well
I also bought my Mac lashes and I bought
it in four different styles and these
retail for ten fifty each and I excited
to get the it number 33 and these are
really really natural I absolutely love
these these are good for people that
just want a really natural leg and then
I bought number thirty Six's which by by
quite often and
send it to the ends but quite wispy I
also bought the path number threes and
the threes are just enormous spikey
volumous style of lash and I absolutely
love these for a more dramatic lip and
then I also bought the 48 and these it
has to be really nice wispy style of
lash
I also decided to buy some mineral
concealers for my cat this is really
good for a drier skin instead of a oily
skin and to be honest I love using these
anyway even though I do have an oily
skin but it just works really well on
dry skin and as you can see it kind of
has a lip gloss applicator and it's just
perfect for the winter cause it's so
hydrating and these are 17 pounds and I
just absolutely love these
I also decided to get some pigments and
glitter so I got a pigment in melon and
this goes for 1750 and melon is just the
most gorgeous gold color so I decided to
buy one of those and I also bought got
the reflex glass art in gold and these
are absolutely amazing it's basically a
clear glitter and it has a reflect of a
color so this is the reflex gold and
then that will support a reflex red as
well you can't really see the difference
in the packaging but when it's on the I
or wherever you're going to put it you
can really see it
I also got some eyebrow pencils the eye
references I got our fling lingering
spiked head start and I got two of each
of these because I love using these for
my cat I feel like these are an absolute
staple in a freelance makeup kit because
you can just create so many different
brow stylist with these they also wanted
to get the mineralize skinfinish in at
gold plaza and this is one of my
favorite types of highlighter because
it's just so gold and I love using this
as a bronzer / blusher because I am a
little bit lighter but if you are on the
deeper skin side this is amazing for a
high under I also got two different
types of lipliner I got the cream stick
liner and a normal lip pencil and the
normal lip pencil that I got was in the
color vino and be nervous - the
beautiful wine color so I got that
because absolutely love the wine colors
for this time of year and then I also
got the cream state definer in creepers
bias and this is just a gorgeous lip
liner for any nude lipstick and I just
absolutely love retractable with my
and I also got to way too many lipsticks
these are the normal line lipsticks and
then I also got one mineralized lipstick
as well and these might just love matte
lipsticks so I did go a little bit okay
but absolutely love them so the
mineralized lipstick that I got was pure
pout that I absolutely love this color
and as you can see is just a really
gorgeous nude and it has a slight pink
undertone but it's just really really
natural and it's a very hydrating
formula and then I also got Shia girl
which is a cream Sheen formula and this
is just a really gorgeous peach color I
also got freckle tone which is a luster
formula and this is a nude peach as well
then I got fresh brew which is a cool
toned nude and I absolutely love this
and this is also a love star formula and
then I got honey love which you guys
know I love and this is just a to
repurchase because you guys know I love
it and this is just a cool toned matte
nude and then I got modesty which is a
pink brown cream machine color and it's
just absolutely gorgeous I love this
color
then I also got brave which is a satin
lipstick and it's a pink nude color
which has got a strong undertone of pink
then I also got to chatterbox which is a
really pretty baby pink and it's a
amplified texture so it's morally
creamier texture then I got Vegas vault
which is also an amplified texture and
it is a almost pastel orange color and
it's just absolutely gorgeous for the
summer time so I'm just so excited by
that and then I also got Lady danger
which is a very vibrant orange red and
this is a matte texture
I also got Devo which is a matte finish
and this is so popular and I haven't got
it yet so I really wanted to buy one and
then it also got dark side which is an
amplified texture and these are all
really similar colors but I just really
like

very dark red as well and that's a satin
