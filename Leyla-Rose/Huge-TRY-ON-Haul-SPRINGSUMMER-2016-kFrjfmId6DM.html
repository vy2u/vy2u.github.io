wanted to film me try on haul for so
long because I have just been buying
some clothes that I really want to show
you guys bear in mind this is a spring
/summer haul I know we're getting closer
to summer but in the UK the way that I
just still isn't that great so it still
feels like spring sometimes feels like
winter that's what's great about London
so I don't have a bunch of really
summery clothes unfortunately and I'm
planning on going away so when I buy all
my clothes to go away out the country I
will do another try on haul so
definitely like this video if you want
me to do that but the majority of the
clothes that I have are from misguided
and misguided is one of my favourite
shops to shop at just because I feel
like all of the clothes they have a
really trendy the first thing in my
little misguided pile that's sticking
out to me is this cap this has a faux
leather cap and of course I can't do a
Tryon because of my little fun but I
really wanted one of these I just feel
like when you're having a bad hair day
this is just necessary so definitely
wanted to get this because I think it's
really nice for summer and spring and
yeah like I said I think it just edges
up any kind of blur next on the pile is
this long-sleeved jumper now like I was
saying I know for some of you you're
going to be like a jumper in the spring
and summer
what but in this country you can go out
wearing this and you know without a
jacket or anything like that and yeah
this will kind of do you sometimes you
might even need a jacket which is not
the greatest thing ever I wish I didn't
need a jacket but that's London for you
I just felt like I really wanted a nice
crop jumper in this color which I don't
already have I have black ones and gray
ones but I don't have anything in this
shade so when I saw it I just knew I had
to get it it has kind of a ripped bottom
so it looks just like a clean cut and I
really like that and like I said the
color is to die for
I just feel like it's really nice for
the spring and summer the next thing I
have to show you isn't really something
I would typically buy just because I am
NOT one to wear super super revealing
clothes but this is to wear underneath
like a bomber just if you want to show a
little bit of skin because a little bit
of skin is okay in my opinion I wanna
wear these kind of clothes I've always
chicken out because I'm just one of
those people that'll put it on no to be
like no but I decided to buy this
because I really want to start wearing
stuff like this especially in the Sun
so this is a pink nude bralette and
again this is from misguided I
absolutely love this because I just feel
like it would be really nice under a
really nice oversized bomber I like the
color of it as well I just think it's
really nice and feminine I really like
the cut of it when I did the trial I was
wearing a bra by the way just just
letting you know you're not meant to
wear a bra with this but I don't even
know what I would wear with this I don't
even I don't even know I probably have
to get one of those sticky pearls to be
honest I also picked up two logo tees as
well this is like a cropped t-shirt and
I absolutely love this one because I
just feel like it applies to my life has
this little detail on the left side that
says California is always a great idea
which is California is my favorite place
in the whole world so I definitely knew
I had to buy this it has a black detail
around the neck and more so around the
arms like I said it's cropped as well
which i think is really nice for the
summer
and I just think this is a really nice
basic to wear on an everyday basis first
of all another crop tesha which is
exactly the same color with the same
black detailing around the neck and the
arms but this time it says phoenix and
it also says 1978 feel the good vibe I
just really liked it I like the water go
just thought it was really summery and I
really liked it so I decided to pick
this up as well and I just I just love
these kind of t-shirts I picked up two
jackets also the first one is this denim
jacket but it's in a camo style
I am absolutely obsessed with camo at
the moment I bought quite a few camo
pieces in this haul and I am just
obsessed with it I just think it's so on
trend right now and yeah I love camo so
this is kind of like a cropped denim
jacket it's not long or anything it kind
of comes above the waist and also the
arms the arms on actually cropped I like
to roll them up so yeah but I really
like this I just feel like it's nice for
the summer if you just want to bring
something along in the evening or of
course it's one of the most perfect
pieces to style so I love this and like
I said I'm obsessed with camo so I knew
I had to pick this up and then I also
picked up an oversized bomber also have
worn this quite a few times since I
bought it so that's why it doesn't even
look new anymore I've got this in the
size 6
and it's still quite big on me but I did
wanted to be slightly oversized I didn't
want it to be massive because I'm quite
small anyway I mean I'm not short but I
have quite a small frame so I didn't
want it to like swallow me whole so I
got this in a size 6 because I just
thought it would work a lot better on me
and I really really love this the last
thing I actually got from misguided is a
pair of shoes and I have been seeing
these shoes around everywhere and to be
honest when I first saw them I wasn't
crazy over them but now that I have them
I feel like I need them in every single
color
these are creepers and these are in the
most perfect color ever this is a
pinkish nude color and it also has that
kind of beige base and I love these
because it's a little platform it gives
you a little bit of heights the color is
what I am obsessed with I just think
this is so perfect for the spring and
summer I just absolutely love this color
and yeah I'm obsessed with these while
we are talking about online shopping I
thought I would tell you guys a few bits
I bought from pretty little thing and
this is the first piece I wanted to show
you again with the camera this is
something I would not usually buy
because I tend to stick with darker
colors this is kind of a lightweight
bomber it has that kind of bomber style
it's just very light weight and I
actually really like this when I got it
I was like am I really gonna wear this
just because I don't usually tend to go
for these kind of colors like the pinks
and that kind of stuff I'm trying to
branch out or wear more colors also
picked up this jacket that I'm wearing
right now this is kind of a camo style
again like I said I've been going way
too much camo
don't judge me it's cool it's this very
very light weight bomb it almost feels
thin it's thinner than a hoody it's just
very very thin it feels almost like a
cardigan print is just very different it
looks camo look from far away but when
you look up close it has these tiny
little stripes and I just think it adds
a little bit of something different to
the traditional camo it's quite dark and
it has black detailing all around the
edges which means I love it and again
I've been wearing this non-stop it's
just a go-to I think when it's just a
little bit cold and you're wearing all
black this is just amazing so I've been
obsessed with this as well also from
pretty little thing I got two pairs of
shoes
the first one is another pair of
creepers this time it's in this nude
style this is more of a beige nude
whereas the other pair of shoes I got
from misguided or a little bit more of
that pink nude I have been looking for
this color everywhere and I just feel
like they're always sold out because
they're so popular so when I saw this
one pretty little thing in my size I was
like need to get that I am such a
trainer junkie so when I saw these I was
just like I don't have any new trainers
I definitely need these so I'm obsessed
with these and come on they're stunning
don't you think next I have an actual
pair of heels you guys what it's not
really a heel it's more of a wedge I'm
not the Timmers typical girly girly girl
where I see heels and I'm like oh I need
those like it's very it's very rare I do
that more so over trainers and stuff
like that is anyone else like that I
feel like I failed to be a girl
sometimes cuz I just love training
physically they have really long laces
that you tie up the leg and I just think
that's so feminine I really like the
wedge is well I think it's gonna be
really nice for the summertime
okay so now I have the last of my online
shopping the last online shop that I
shopped at was a sauce and a sauce I
think is one of my favorite places to
shop at ASOS and misguided everything to
me I just feel like that always the
places that I go to when I want to buy
something so I decided to pick up a pair
of hot pants denim shorts because I do
have some but I don't have any in the
darkest I love denim they're all light
so I decided to pick these up I really
like the button detailing they're kind
of high-waisted so you can bring them up
above your hips which I really like
because I think that's really
figure-hugging and it really makes your
figure look nice super ripped and it
looks really damaged and I actually
really really like that I did buy a
black pair of shorts as well from ASOS
but I had to return them because they
didn't fit Phyllis actually don't own a
black pair of denim shorts so I'm still
on a hunt for them so comment down below
and let me know where I should shop for
denim shorts also picked up a pack of
two body suits from ASOS this is like a
basic ASOS package like they do packs of
- I don't even know like how to explain
that but they are kind of a v-neck and
they really hug the body it comes in a
white and a black I'm wearing the black
one no and is
really nice it really hugs the body I
just feel like it fits beautifully and I
really like the way that this fits only
a thumbs up for me and I like that it
came in a pack of two because I feel
like black on white I just must haves
those so cool one other boy su and I
love this one love this one I didn't
expect to love it so much this is a logo
bodysuit and it says NYC and then it has
it says something out else underneath it
like Manhattan Bronx Brooklyn and
somewhere else
Harlem that's it but they're like
abbreviated I don't know I just thought
it was really cool have a halter neck so
you can tie it at the back like you
would a bikini and again it's the
bodysuit so it comes underneath where
your underwear is so that way when you
are wearing a pair of jeans it just hugs
your body and I just love this I think
this is gonna be so perfect for the
summer
I'll see from ASOS I picked up two pairs
of key sunglasses oh my goodness I have
been eyeing up key Australia sunglasses
for the longest time I'm not entirely
sure the name of this but I will show
you the style and write the name just on
the screen here because I totally
forgotten the style of this one but can
we just I love these I don't usually
tend to go for these aviator style
glasses but when I saw these in the blue
I was like I need them so I decided to
pick up a pair of those and then this
style I have been searching for
everywhere so the moment that I saw that
it came in stock on ASOS I was like I'm
getting it these are the key Australia
Bar None I think that's how you
pronounce them Bar noon or Bar None star
sunglasses oh my god I've literally
never seen anything more perfect in my
life these are my ideal style of
sunglasses
Love Wins sunglasses have that straight
edge and this 100% has that they are
very large very square and this is just
perfect perfect to hide behind and I
love that they're just all black I am
obsessed like I feel like I just want to
live in these can I just do the rest of
the whole wearing these sunglasses yeah
I can't do that so I only have a few
bits left of pieces that I bought on the
high street so I took a trip into River
Island and the first thing that I saw
when I walked into River Island was
you see me being in my element I was
like one thing I actually don't have
that camo is a normal t-shirt and I
think that's kind of something everyone
needs especially if you love camo you
don't love camo then obviously you don't
need one because I love camera I felt
like it was necessary this is just a
normal t-shirt it's quite a oversized
style t-shirt this is in the size eight
and it does it doesn't really help your
body or anything like that but the
reason why I really wanted this is
because I love pulling together the
front of my t-shirt and tiny and a knot
I just think it looks so cool so I love
doing that and this is the kind of
teacher I think would be ideal for they
also sort some camo joggers and I was
like am I really gonna take my obsession
to this level where I wear on the bottom
half of my body and I was like uh-huh
yep I am so this was mainly to wear for
like just running errands or just things
that I know I needed to do and I wanted
to look stylish whilst doing it this is
just kind of like a casual outfit I feel
like you could really start this up also
and then I saw these sunglasses in river
island and I just thought I don't have
any styles that are like this that are
more on the brown side so I thought why
not these are I love these I just think
these are so gorgeous they make me feel
like I'm cool I love the coloring of it
it's that brown tortoiseshell style is
that what it's called I think that's
what it's called and then the lenses are
brown also I just love these I just feel
like sunglasses can just play up any
look so from River Island I picked up
these sandals and when I saw these I was
like I think I need to pick these up
because they were in a khaki color I
have quite a few kaki clothing now I
thought it would be nice to buy a car
key pair of sandals these are just
really nice simple sandals but they are
in a really nice color so I decided to
pick these up I popped in to H&amp;amp;M and I
saw these and I was like this is the
most perfect thing for summer ever this
is from H&amp;amp;M coachella collections
basically a knitted top it's quite
see-through so you wouldn't need to wear
something underneath this I just wore
one of those little bandeau things you
can wear a butt
I don't know it's totally up to you you
do you you wear what you feel
comfortable with but for me I just saw
this and I was like oh my goodness I
need this I just think this is sort of a
perfect I also picked this up in black
as well so the exact same thing but in
black guys that at the end of this Tryon
hole I really hope you guys enjoyed it I
definitely want to do more clothing
styles of videos in the future because I
really want to show my style more on
here I'm going to do a spring /summer
lookbook very soon so comment down below
and let me know if you want me to do a
casual one or a going out partying I do
more outfits and out that is so yeah
