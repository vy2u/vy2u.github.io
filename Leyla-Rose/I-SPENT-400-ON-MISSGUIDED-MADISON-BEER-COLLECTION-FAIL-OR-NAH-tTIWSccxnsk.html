my channel so today I have a massive
misguided haul but I've done it in a
different format today than my usual
hauls just because I wanted to change
things up a little bit and I basically
spent 400 pounds on misguided mainly on
the new medicine beer misguided
collection and I tell you guys if it's a
hit or a miss the bits I like the bits I
don't like you guys basically get to see
me try everything on for the first time
so I'm super excited and I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you do
like it then please give it a big thumbs
up subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already
without further rambling let's get on
into this video yes good this is the
first I guess full outfit that I'm
trying dirty of these clothes are from
the Madison beer collection from
misguided and I'm not gonna lie to you
guys this is actually way nicer than
what I thought I prefer wearing
high-waisted trousers or just anything
but when I pulled them up to be
high-waisted there's a lot of like extra
like you know and there's just like a
gathering in this area it actually quite
a nice thick material or not thin
whatsoever it's quite stretchy and it's
almost fleece lined the color of the
drawstrings are actually like almost a
raspberry red so like a pinkish red and
I really really like that and of course
like this as a set I think that these
trousers paired with something else
would be amazing as well I'm actually
really impressed with the material of
this what do you guys think it also
comes in white so let me go change into
the white one so we can see the
difference okay so fail on my part she
picked up the black in a size six
actually picked off no white in an
eighth but I honestly can't believe how
big these are like you guys you could
fit like basically another version of me
in here I like it in white but it does
look kind of almost like like it reminds
me of gold thing you know people wear
golf outfits it kind of reminds me of
that even if they were wearing the right
size but I think you guys should
definitely size down because I'm usually
an 8 in jeans or anything I'm usually an
8 these are an a I accidentally got a
size up from I don't know which one I
actually made an accident with but six
definitely fit me better so I don't know
maybe size down because I think you have
to okay so this is the next item
we're trying and it's basically this
bandeau dress still in the medicine beer
collection it's got that pinstripe which
seems to be a massive theme I first saw
it on the model I was a bit confused
because I was like it looks really bad
he so I got this in a 6 and a 6 fits me
pretty well although I do feel like kind
of hard to move because it's that kind
of material that just doesn't bother
doing any squats in this that you can't
explain this material but it really does
remind me of kind of how blazes are made
like that same kind of material it's
very sophisticated and I really like the
style but I don't know if it's me
honestly I'm gonna try it of course in
the white as well and see how that looks
I was in a size 6 because it looked so
loose on the model and it's fit me well
even though usually I do get an 8 so
yeah struggling to breathe a little bit
though but I do think an 8 would have
been too baggy for sure the same dress
in Y and I do really like the style of
this but it's definitely not for me it
just looks really almost fancy looking
like and I don't like that it is a body
con and you just can't move what is this
you were going for something that you
wanted it to look sophisticated but kind
of stylish at the same time so this is
definitely going more up my street I
definitely prefer this kind of clothing
and I tend to wear this kind of clothing
way more the first item is this t-shirt
and it was quite basic but I believe it
was like 15 pounds or something which is
really expensive for just a plain white
t-shirt obviously it is within the
medicine bit range so of course it's
gonna be a little bit more expensive but
I actually just feel like you can get
the same kind of effect with the normal
basic t-shirt personally it's actually
let me show you it's actually cut
differently into a point which makes it
easier to tie up into a knot and as you
guys know if you watch my hauls I'm
notorious for turning every single
teacher that I ever buy into a knot so I
don't really find it an issue doing it
with other tops as long as it's big
enough if it's too tight then you might
struggle why am i struggling with this
it's actually a really nice fit but I
don't feel like it's worth the money if
it was cheaper than for sure I think 10
pounds of the most would have been
definitely definitely better and of
course we have these bottoms as while
these attract suit bottoms I like the
style of them but I just don't like the
fit I absolutely love
guided but whenever I try out their
bottoms for some reason I just never
find something that fits my shape well
and I don't know if anyone else feels
that way it might just be my specific
body type but I just feel I can get lost
in them a little bit like this is an
eight and I just feel like it's like way
bigger almost don't mind my socks but I
like the style of that I really like the
red detail all these kind of colors are
very up my street but I'm just I'm so
disappointed I really thought I was
gonna like these but I honestly think
it's just because sometimes just
anything I bite on the bottom off of my
body from misguided it's just never
worked out for me
it's very rare I find things where the
fit is just like a perfect so um all
right what do you guys think do you like
them next I have this skirt and I
honestly love this I think this would
look so nice with some knee-high socks
and yeah I really like this like
schoolgirl vibe I think it's really nice
I just kept this white t-shirt on I'm
not I don't think that's how I'd style
that I think I'd like to start this with
black and then black knee high socks but
it does look really nice with white as
well I love this chain on the side and I
just think it's really nice the skirt
it's quite short so I definitely feel
they need to like wear something
underneath it just in case I do think
it's really cute I love this kind of
like plaid print so yeah I decided to
pick you up in this color and I actually
really liked it you guys know that I
love red so yeah I actually really like
this and for me I don't wear skirts very
often so this is definitely a change for
me either next we have this really noisy
set I think that's a set comes as a set
but this is obviously intended to be
worn together and that's this jogger oh
I'd call this sound label okay so
apparently this is a shell suit I would
probably wear it a little bit more like
draped on the shoulders like this
I'm loving the top but again the bottoms
just are not doing anything for me I
don't know what it is they just look
really like I don't know I think I'm
just not a fan of it I guess it depends
on what you're looking for but this is
really thin so I think it's just quite
breathable if you wanted something like
that for summer I want to see thought I
was gonna love so many more items in
this but I feel like for some reason
it's just a little bit
miss for some reason I really like this
top though definitely keeping this I
mean this is so sick I love the colors
it's white black with this detail of
yellow and the bombs are really cool as
well again if they just fit but I think
it's just me and misguided bottoms just
don't get along I don't know why just
I'm just not a fan like they get really
really thick towards the bottom and it
just looks a bit does that make sense
okay so next up we have this jumper
dress and I am obsessed with this this
is as she pleases on each arm which is
kind of like Medicine Bears tagline I
believe it's the name of her tour as
well but I just really really love this
honestly
the details of this a really retro
feeling I love the color scheme again
the white the black with the pop of
yellow is amazing notice you can see
myself wearing this for sure and you
guys know I'm not a big fan of dresses
but I definitely feel like it's just I
think this is perfect for spring it like
keeps you warm but it also you know you
can like turn your legs I don't know
it's not quite there with it being
summer yet you can stop to wear dresses
but you still want to keep kind of warm
this is ideal for that and I don't know
I just really like I think it's really
cool and I just really really like the
vibe of this I honestly think it's nice
that they as she pleases is just on arm
and it's not all the way across because
I do have something else that says as
she pleases right at the front so if
everything kind of just said it right
there it would be a little bit like hard
to pick if you're not like an absolute
massive Madison beer fan where you would
you wouldn't personally buy how much
it's nice that they did some that's a
little bit more subtle so you could
still kind of buy it if you want a
massive fan if that makes sense but
loving this this is actually a really
really nice hoodie it's a lot more like
obvious obviously with her tagline
with the name of her tour and everything
so it's a little bit more obvious so if
you guys don't mind that then this is a
really nice stop hoodie I love wearing
hoodies like this it's cropped wearing
it with like high-waisted jeans like
what I'm wearing now I think it's
actually really nice again the print is
amazing and I love the color scheme as
well it's just really cool this is the
last item and this is actually from the
misguided and ombre collection that came
out and I'm obsessed with this this is
actually the last piece and it's the
only piece that wasn't from the Madison
beer collection but I just threw this in
this is I'm in love would have preferred
this probably in a medium just so it was
a little bit oversized just because I
like these kind of jackets oversized but
I do have so many like this oversized I
guess I'll just keep it because it's
like a little bit small like it's nice
to have something actually that isn't as
oversized but how stunning is this
honestly I love it
