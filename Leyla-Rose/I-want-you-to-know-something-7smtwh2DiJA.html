just want first of all so yes this is
very different where I'm setting my
camera that I'm using everything is very
different I just wanted this to feel
very comfortable as comfortable as I
could possibly make this because this is
going to be a very different type of
video for me and to be honest with you
I'm very scared to make it but I just
feel like it's necessary I really want
to let you guys in on something that has
been pressing on my heart lately and
also to let you in a little bit on the
kind of person I am and some of the
things that I have been through and the
reason I'm making this is because I feel
like I have 100% shot you guys out of me
as a person and I am so unhappy with
what I've done I was saying to myself
that I was going to show more of my
personality as my my channel grew bigger
and I just never did I just feel like I
really put a wedge in between me and my
subscribers so I'm creating this in
hopes that we could kind of break that
barrier so that you guys know more about
me and the things I'm going to talk to
you about a very personal so I'm hoping
that it will kind of really truly show
how just that I really want to show you
guys truly Who I am and I don't really
want to hide behind makeup anymore
that is definitely something I do quite
a bit I hide behind the makeup tutorials
I do makeup tutorials because they feel
safe and then I kind of avoid doing any
personal types of videos because I'm
afraid of letting you guys in because I
am insecure that is basically what this
video is kind of about also to the point
where I'm going to tell you guys a
little bit of what I've been through up
to this point to kind of explain why I'm
this way one of the other main reasons I
really want to make this is to try and
help somebody that is also going this
way because the way that I'm dealing
with it might inspire someone to also do
with it in the same way or just to help
them have a little bit more strength
just to know that they're not alone
and yes I just wanted to talk about this
because it's been on my heart for so
long lately and I just decided to just
go ahead and do it and I just think it's
time so yes I'm going to jump straight
into it just by introducing myself so my
name is Layla if you didn't already know
my name is Layla I am twice
two years old and I am from London I've
lived in London my whole life I was born
here and yes that is me growing up I
didn't have the worst childhood but I
didn't have the easiest time either um
in a nutshell it was just quite
challenging and I just feel like I
didn't have the most stable childhood
and it definitely has affected me I
don't feel like I'm really going to go
into real depths of what happened to me
because I don't want to create this
video in the hopes to get any pity or
anything like that because remember the
past is the past things aren't like this
anymore so there's no real need of
bringing it up unless it's going to help
someone so if you guys want me to talk
about it on it later date because you
might be going through something similar
or something like that then maybe I can
go into more detail but for today I
don't think it's necessary because like
I said I don't want this to be just a
gigantic like attention-seeking video
where I want like attention from you
guys that is not why I want whatsoever I
just want to let you guys in a little
bit more so you can truly know me on a
more personal level I didn't have a lot
so I didn't have a lot of money I didn't
have luxuries at all I lived in tiny
little box room with just a bed new
cupboards I didn't have a dressing table
to learn how to do makeup on and it was
a really cold house didn't have hot
water no heating it was really hot and
the reasons as to why things were like
that like I said I prefer not to talk
about it
at this precise time because like I said
I don't feel like that's what this video
is about but in a nutshell you guys can
tell that it things weren't easy for me
mum was honestly one of the main reasons
I'm here today like she is honestly she
gave me everything she did have so it
was just the greatest thing she could
ever do for me she truly truly gave
everything she could out the little that
she made always made sure I had food on
the table and she made sure that I never
truly suffered and what more could you
ask for things might not have been nice
but she made sure that things were a
heck of a lot better I will never ever
forget the things that she's done for me
and she truly gave me a chance had a
very unstable household it was very
emotionally unstable things were very
hard so at the age of 8 years old I
suffered with extreme anxiety I had
phobias it was extreme and at the age of
8 you haven't even hit double digits yet
I think that's so sad I still have it
100% I definitely feel like I've got a
lot better but I play life like I'm
really confident when really I am truly
a hundred percent not a hundred percent
not anyone that meets me thinks I'm
really confident because that is my way
of dealing with instead of like calling
up into a corner I deal with it by being
a little bit more flamboyant and kind of
like bubbly that's the way that I deal
with it that's why I'm so talkative
because I try and hide behind talking if
that makes sense
that point onwards the anxiety kind of
followed me I was bullied at school for
being so quiet and kind of being so in
my own little box I didn't socialize a
lot I didn't go on any school trips
whatsoever I was way too afraid to go
anywhere without my mum I was attached
to her couldn't leave the house it was
an absolute nightmare a lot of ways I've
got so much better with my anxiety I
know more so how to control that if so
much more that I can rely on now so I
feel a lot more safe in my anxiety I
have a faith in God so that personally
makes almost everything go away as far
as anxiety goes Oh as school went on I
just feel like a complex started to get
created in my life and I just felt like
the more and more I got older the more
insecure I would get is the whole reason
I'm coming on here today that's the kind
of baseline of why I'm here just in so
many videos where I've just felt so bad
about myself
and lately I have been just under so
much pressure I feel that I was on the
waiting list to get lip injections and I
was so close to doing it so close and
then I just kind of had a bit of a
revelation and I just stopped and I
thought and I just thought to myself is
this going to fix what is actually wrong
is this actually
going to fix it the way that I kind of
thought of it was if you broke a window
and that window was cracked you know it
was smashed putting a pretty little cart
and over it isn't going to fix the
broken window it's going to make it look
a lot visually better and yes it will
look more appealing and no one will
truly know that you know there's a
broken window underneath it but deep
down the underlying problem is still
there in the way that I saw it was going
game with injections was the same kind
of thing for me in my personal
preference I would have gone and done it
and then I would have felt maybe
temporarily better for a little bit but
then all the other flaws on my face
would have got me down anyway yes maybe
I would have felt a little bit better
and from the outside I would look a
little bit better but deep down the
underlying problem and that real issue
with insecurity would have still been
there in no way shape or form and my
bashing surgery or injections or any
cosmetic procedure what you want to do
then by all means I do not judge you at
all
but for me I just kind of thought about
it and I just thought is this truly
going to fix the underlying problem my
insecurity is still going to be there
once I get the lip fillers I am going to
find something else I'm not happy with
because when I look in the mirror
there's about a hundred floors I can
point out I am so tired of feeling just
inadequate and I just think sometimes
who makes these rules who makes the
rules of what's pretty or beautiful what
makes that and it just sucks because I
felt like this for so long and just
don't think it's bad that so many women
and girls young girls feel like they
have to go and change themselves to feel
like they fit in and to feel like each
feature has to be perfect
it's just such a such
a trap reason why I've decided to talk
about this was to make a promise to you
that I am NOT going to change I'm not
going to change I know that I have a
little bit of a voice and I do not want
anyone to ever look up to me and to
think you know she talks so much about
what's on the inside and how much the
you know inner beauty actually matters
and and then she is going and changing
her outer appearance like it's so
important like it's worth spending
thousands of pounds on I just feel like
it's very hard to preach both of those
things I feel like your actions show a
lot you can say a million times that
inner beauty is truly what matters but
at the end of the day makeup wipes off
Botox will fade lips Elizabeth the
crease wrinkles will always come back
spots are going to appear pause our
bodies are continuously aging and that's
just something that we have to
understand our bodies are never going to
be perfect there is no one on this
planet that is perfect and this strive
for perfection is truly what is ruining
so many souls and we don't deserve that
personally I want to fix what's inside
first the end of my life I'm not gonna
grasp a mirror to my face and make to
check and see if my makeup looks okay or
to see if my lips look plump or my nose
looks more I'm not gonna care who is
going to care about that at the end of
your life you're going to think about
the kind of person you are how good you
were are the people how many people you
inspired you know how much you enjoyed
every moment I don't want to spend every
moment of my life insecure anymore I
hate having to scroll through just
anywhere I just feel like it's
everywhere on TV on Instagram on YouTube
on Twitter on Facebook on Pinterest it's
everywhere caring for our appearance is
nice but my whole channel basically
revolves around beauty fashion you know
all of that kind of stuff that's always
going to be a massive passion of mine
but it can't be everything
I can't rely on the way that I look
because I'm neglecting what's inside I
can't put so much pressure to be a
certain way because I was created to be
the person that I am and this is just
who I am and I have to accept that you
can always better yourself and you can
always improve but truly I just feel
like the standards that society have set
for us is unachievable absolutely
unachievable because even if you did
everything if you fixed every single
flaw on your face and your body still we
would find something to complain about
because we crave perfection but
perfection is not achievable it is not
attainable you have goodness and
Happiness radiating through you then you
will be the most beautiful person in the
world and that is what I want to achieve
feel like I truly want to start growing
now and I don't want to delete videos
where I feel like I don't look good I
just want to show you guys everything I
just want you guys to know that my life
is probably the most real life on
YouTube honestly I've been through a lot
and I'm still really hard from a lot of
it and I just feel like it might be nice
to share that because life is not
perfect
I want to just be proof that you can
overcome it and I know that this I'm
going to overcome too but I decided that
I wanted to overcome this one with you
guys because I think we should support
each other because this problem I see
everywhere my friend Michelle I'll link
her video down below cuz she did a video
about it too she spoke about it I just
feel like this bothers so many people I
have just I just don't I just don't want
to do with this that is what basic I
don't know why I'm laughing I don't
believe any of us need to change
anything on the outside like I said
everything is fading away our bodies are
going to age that's something we have to
accept yes it's nice to do makeup and to
feel good about ourselves and to do our
hair and to get our nails done and you
know whatever get a new hair color yes I
understand that but I just feel like
going and changing everything isn't
going to fix the underlying problem and
if you are an extremely insecure person
and you criticize yourself daily we need
to change that I really didn't think
that this would be going up on my main
channel to be honest but I'm really glad
that I done it I'm glad I didn't cry too
much because I was crying all morning
this morning I was talking to Josh on
the phone and I was like what do i do do
I talk about it so I know and I've just
decided to just do it
it's gonna go up hopefully and I'm gonna
just get through this hope this let you
in a little bit and I hope that we can
take this journey together I feel like I
don't want to hold back anymore from
vlogging I feel like maybe I can start
talking about more personal things on
there basically I don't want to hold
back anymore I don't want to pretend my
life is perfect basically I'm not gonna
deal with this anymore
I am going to overcome it from the
inside out and I pray that you guys do
that with me like I said not bashing
anything whatsoever the choices you make
in life are completely your choice and I
do not judge you whatsoever but I just
wanted to tell you guys that there is
another way it's it feels like it's the
road less traveled by
nowadays but I am going to travel down
that road instead I am going to be
exactly me and I'm just going to mend
that insecurity that's inside of me I
have dealt with this for too long and so
have you I don't want to live like this
anymore and I don't think you guys
should either so let's try to mend
what's broken on the inside let's speak
positivity and goodness into our lives
every single day let's speak positivity
and goodness onto others let us find
good things to do and just to find
goodness in every single situation and I
have hope that things will get better
for all of us
but I'm just saying fixing things from
the outside doesn't necessarily mean
it's gonna fix truly what's broken
before I go I just wanted to also say to
you please subscribe to my vlog Channel
because I feel like you guys will
definitely get to know me a lot more
through daily life I am gonna be putting
more personal videos on my main channel
as well now because I'm just not gonna
let anything stand in my way I feel
really confident now that I've got this
out in the open and I just really hope
that you guys will kind of join me along
on this journey I can't wait to share
like fitness stuff on my second channel
and just daily life and I can do other
stuff on my main channel I just feel
like I want everything to mold into one
and this channel will always be based
around beauty and fashion and stuff like
that but you know I can't wait to see
where everything takes me and I pray
that you guys will follow along with me
I love you guys so much thank you for
watching um I love you guys I'll see you
