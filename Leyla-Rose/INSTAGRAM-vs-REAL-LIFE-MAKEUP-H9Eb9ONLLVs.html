so today's video is an Instagram versus
real life video so basically I'm going
to be comparing a real life makeup to
Instagram makeup and I'm going to be
showing you the process how it differs
and I'm just going to be chatting you
through basically how I'd complete each
one this video was inspired by promised
fans so thank you so much for the video
idea I couldn't wait to try it I really
hope you guys like this video but don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already smash the thumbs up
button if you want to see more videos
like this and follow all of my social
media so let's get into this video and
see the difference between Instagram and
real life so it's time to get started
I'm going to be using the left side of
my face for my Instagram side and then
the right side for my real life side so
I'm going to be doing first of all all
over is just moisturizing and priming my
skin which obviously I would do whether
I'm creating a makeup for Instagram or
if I'm doing that for everyday and
likewise with color correcting my
redness I did the same thing whether I'm
using it on Instagram or just on an
everyday basis and also because I want
my under eyes to look nice and flawless
for pictures I'm going to be taking some
color corrector and applying under my
eyes to reduce any darkness on my
foundations I'm taking the ex1 invisi
wear for my everyday foundation and then
the Born This Way Foundation to use for
my Instagram side and first of all just
doing my real life side and just buffing
in this foundation using a buffing brush
I like to do this on an everyday basis
because I just feel like this creates a
really nice smooth coverage I don't need
to apply extra layers of this one layer
is fine it looks really nice and glowy
but it covers everything I need to and
then of course for the left side I'm
taking the Born This Way Foundation just
dotting a generous amount all over my
skin and blending in with a Beauty
Blender because this gives a really nice
flawless airbrushed finish and to be
honest I'm gonna usually apply one layer
of this because I don't feel like I need
any extra
for the right side and taking the
Maybelline fit me concealer because it's
really nice and lightweight it gives
enough coverage and it brightens just
enough for an everyday basis and I also
apply that around my mouth and of course
concealer is a must for Instagram to
look nice and sculpted so I'm taking the
Born This Way concealer from Too Faced
and applying a light shade on my under
eyes my forehead and also on my chin and
this will act as our highlight as we are
going to be contouring also so I'm cream
contouring with a dark concealer as well
as I am going to be powder contouring
because of course contour is important
for Instagram to blend in my concealer
on my right side I'm going to be taking
the same brush that I used to blend in
my foundation I really like to do this
especially for everyday because I just
feel like not only is it easy and quick
but it ends up looking really seamless
and natural because it ends up blending
just so well with the foundation shade
so I just do that and make sure that it
looks nice and seamless and likewise for
the left side I'm going to be taking my
Beauty Blender and just blending
together the concealer and also the
contour color just to make it look again
nice and seamless although you do want
to make sure that you're not moving
around the color too much so the contour
color stays where it is and also the
highlight color stays exactly what you
need it also to set together the real
life concealer I'm taking the kick-ass
powder from soap &amp;amp; Glory and just using
this on a small brush and just dusting
it very gently on all the areas where we
applied that concealer this will just of
course set it into place but it won't
look too heavy but for the Instagram
side I'm going to be taking the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder and
I'm going to be baking baking looks a
lot more intense it definitely looks a
lot more flawless but it is a lot
heavier so I definitely like to do this
when I'm creating a really full-on
makeup look that I'm going to be taking
pictures of so I'm just putting it again
all the areas where we applied that
concealer and also underneath my
cheekbones as well to sculpt that area
and I just left it for a little while
and then dusted it off with that same
brush and just making sure that all of
the excess powder is brushed away
normally on an everyday basis I don't
really tend to contour because it takes
a lot of time and also I just really
like the way that our bronze look looks
as well so I'm just taking some bronzer
and applying it onto my cheekbones my
forehead and then on the Instagram side
I'm going to be full-on contouring by
mixing these two shades together from
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
applying it on the same areas but this
time using a lot more of a precise brush
and really pushing it into that
cheekbone to really give me well
cheekbones and I'm also taking this
yellow highlight shade and applying it
to my under eyes to Father brighten it
which looks amazing in pictures I'm
going to be using much more of a subtle
glow on my real life side and taking the
Too Faced candlelight glow powder this
is just really nice and subtle and it
makes me look like I'm glowing without
looking too intense but for Instagram
highlight doesn't really show up well in
pictures so I'm going to be wetting my
brush and applying some highlight on my
cheekbones this is the Anastasi of
Beverly Hills so Hollywood and really
applying it intensely because the more
intense the better in pictures what I
like to do with my brows every day is
take an eyebrow gel and apply it into my
brows beforehand to keep them in place
and instead of using a pencil I like to
use a powder and just run it through my
brows because I just find that this
looks a lot more natural I'll follow my
natural brow shape I won't really go too
intense with the color so I'll really
make it look nice and structured but I
don't want it to look too dark or
intense and of course for Instagram I
mean brows are extremely important so
getting them perfect it's definitely
important in pictures I find brows are
one of my favorite features so I really
like to emphasize them when I'm going
out or of course they're taking pictures
as well so what I would like to do is
fill them in a little bit more intense
and structured and also for the color to
be quite dark and then what I also like
to do is go underneath with some
concealer and go through it with brow
gel to really make sure that it stays in
place for my eye shadow I'm taking the
two phase chocolate bar palette and I'm
going to be taking this really natural
brown shade and I'm going to be applying
this into my crease on my everyday side
and just taking a lot of eyeshadow
usually sometimes I won't even apply
eyeshadow but just a little bit of
eyeshadow in the crease really lifts the
eyes and then I'll also
take maybe a matte color just like this
one something very natural and apply it
onto the lid just because I feel like
this adds a little bit of lightness it
adds some structure to the eye without
looking too over-the-top and then of
course on the Instagram side there are
so many different ways you could do your
eyes when it comes to Instagram today
I'm just keeping it neutral because it's
my favorite thing to do I'm just taking
some warm brown again a lot of a darker
shade and just applying it on the outer
corner and something that I personally
feel like is definitely a trend on
Instagram is to have really extended
eyes to really look cat-like and of
course there are so many different ways
of doing your eye shadow but something
that's definitely an Instagram trend is
really extending everything towards the
tail of your eyebrow and personally
that's one of my favorite trends really
like the way that it looks I'm also just
applying a little bit of a shimmery
color on my lid because this just adds a
little bit of emphasis onto that lid and
what is the most important part eyeliner
eyeliner is a must for me I mean not all
the time but the majority of the time I
think a liner will just fix absolutely
everything so I'm just applying some
winged liner onto my eyes and I'm using
the NYX matte liner to create this
I think lashes compliment eyeliner so
perfectly so I'm applying some false
lashes onto my eyes these are the ones
from satify and I'm just making sure
they're adhered properly and applying
some mascara to my natural lashes to
make them blend in and then for my real
life side I'm just applying a lonely few
coats of mascara genuinely in real life
this is what I tend to do this is just
honestly I don't tend to wear eyeliner
on everyday basis anymore I just like 12
Escarra
and then pretty much what I like to do
is apply some black liner to compliment
the liner on the top lash line and then
I also apply some mascara to the bottom
lashes and that's pretty much the eyes
complete and finally for the lips on my
real side I like to apply a lip liner
that close to my lip tone I like to over
line that's just something I like to do
but on the Instagram side I will also
over line but use a color that's quite a
bit darker than the lip color I'm
actually applying in pictures this
really does make your lips look a lot
fuller and in general anyway but in
pictures it looks amazing so that's
personally what I like to do even though
I over line on an everyday basis anyway
and the actual lip color I'm using for
an everyday where is the next soft matte
lip cream in London just because it
looks really really nice it doesn't look
too over-the-top and for my Instagram
side I'm taking Veronica from uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills this to me it
looks really good
I really like the way this looks and I
think it's that just perfect Instagram
pink nude you know I mean so guys as you
can see this little experiment is
complete here is the real-life side and
here is the Instagram side let me know
which side you guys personally prefer
like I said in the beginning of this
video I like both of them for different
times I like to look more Instagram when
I go out when I'm you know to take lots
of pictures but the real life side is
realistically the kind of look that I
wear most often because it's practical
it enhances my natural beauty I love
both of them I don't like anyone more
than the other I think it's really cool
to play around with makeup don't forget
to smash that thumbs up button if you
