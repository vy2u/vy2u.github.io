today I'm gonna be showing you this icy
silver winter makeup look I am so
excited about this slope because it
honestly just reminds me of like an ice
queen I absolutely love it and it's very
different to any look I've done before
so I hope you guys like it if you do
want to see how I achieve this look then
just keep on watching
and just levitate so as always I'm gonna
be priming my eyes just because we are
going to be applying a lot of eyeshadow
today so I just used my soft ochre Paint
Pot for that next taking my BH Cosmetics
party girl palette and taking this matte
soft brown shade and applying it into
our crease we are gonna use this as our
first transition color I wanted to use a
brown just because I do feel like it
helps everything else to blend out into
our skin turned a little bit better so
I'm just blending this with a fluffy
blending brush before we apply any of
the cooler colors then taking this matte
gray shade I'm gonna be taking this with
another blending brush into the crease
as well I'm just applying a little bit
of this to prepare for the darkest shade
we're gonna be using and then finally
taking this color right here this is
kind of like a sparkly black like blue
sparkles in it but I just decided to pop
this into the crease this didn't blend
out too well so don't use too much of it
I felt like I applied too much and then
it was hard to blend out so I just
applied a little bit more and just made
sure to blend it out as smoothly as I
could so I definitely recommend applying
this as gradually as you can and
building up this black in the outer
corner to really give my eye some
definition on the outer part of my eye
and as always just switching between
brushes to make sure it just looks super
blended and it just looks really
seamless with the other colors then I
just took a makeup wipe and just clean
the sides of my eyes to give me a really
nice straight edge and this just makes
everything look a lot cleaner
and then mixing together these two
silver shades one is like a gray silver
and then one is like a white silver and
mixing them both together to create my
lid color and I'm just applying it onto
my lid and almost creating a cut crease
effect on the top lid as you can see on
my other eye that's already done it's
more of a circular shape and this isn't
usually the kind of look I tend to go
for but I really wanted to create a
really different look I'm going slightly
above my crease and just applying it on
my lid next I'm gonna be applying some
liner onto my lid and taking a pen liner
and drawing on a thin wing onto my eye
I'm not going for anything too crazy
just a wing that is quite straight
nothing that flicks upwards too much
and then to make our lid nice and
sparkly I'm taking this next white
glitter liner and applying it all on top
of the eyeshadow we applied and then I'm
gonna be taking this shop violet Voss
loose glitter in the color Wendy I'm
just applying this with my finger and
just patting it on top of that liner
whilst it's still wet and that way it
adheres really nicely and then finally
I'm applying some lashes these are the
house of lashes iconic and I'm just
applying that with some House of lashes
glue and then to make the lashes blend
in a little bit better I'm just gonna be
applying some mascara
next I'm just gonna be applying some
primer this is the makeup forever step
one it's smoothing primer and then I'm
gonna be applying a my ex one and
visitation this is my favorite
foundation honestly whenever I use it I
just realized how amazing actually looks
it smooths out my skin amazingly and it
just makes my skin look so flawless or I
absolutely love this and I'm applying
this with a sigma f84 brush
you
next I want to be applying some
concealer to brighten up my under eyes
this is the Maybelline age rewind
concealer I'm applying a quite a lot of
this underneath my eyes to really
brighten up this area and I'm also gonna
be applying it onto my forehead the
bridge of my nose and my chin to also
bring these areas forward and to
highlight them I'm then gonna be
blending that in with my Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge this will just
make everything look nice and smooth and
I like to blend it in my concealer with
this because I do feel like it picks up
any of the excess and just prevents it
from looking cakey
I'm just taking my finger and getting
into all the little areas that are
harder to reach to set my face I'm gonna
be using the prize the prize I'm using
the so burglary instant retouch powder
on a Sigma f-35 brush this is my dynamic
duo they work so amazing together and
I'm just setting all the areas I applied
the concealer I'm gonna do my eyebrows
off camera because you guys have seen me
do them before I will link the tutorial
of where I show you how I do them down
below to bronze my skin I am taking the
hoola bronzer by benefit and just
applying it on the outer perimeter of my
face I'm just applying it underneath my
cheekbones on the sides of my forehead
and just on the outer perimeter of my
face basically to just warm up the skin
because we've gone for a really cool eye
I wanted to go for quite a warm skin so
I'm also gonna be applying some blush as
well the cabana boy blush from the balm
and this would just giving me a pop of
pink on the cheeks and I don't usually
go for blush but I felt it looked really
nice with this eye look and then we're
also applying a Becca opal highlights
out onto my cheekbones this is just
gonna give me a subtle glow and I also
applied that onto the tip of my nose
finish off the eyes I'm gonna be
applying the NYX jumbo pencil in milk to
my waterline and then I am also going to
be taking some of that dog eyes shadow
we applied into the crease on to our
bottom lash line
supplying some mascara into my bottom
lashes and then we're gonna be going for
a nice thick line of graphic liner on
the bottom lashes I'm not really sure
why I decided to go for this I just felt
like I really wanted this look took
different to any look I've done before I
felt like this is really 60s inspired
and it just gives a really nice touch to
it and it goes really well with these
colors so I'm just drawing a line with
liquid liner onto the bottom lash line
just underneath my lash line and then
I'm going to be doing a little bit of a
graphic in a corner flick and it's gonna
droop down a little bit it's totally
optional we don't have to do that if you
don't want to and because the eyes are
so intense I decided to go for a nice
neutral nude lip I decided to use this
Kiko matte lipstick and I am gonna be
applying a little bit of Mac strip-down
lip liner just around it just so that my
lips don't disappear into the rest of my
face but I did want to go for something
super neutral so that all the attention
can be on the eyes
so guys that is the end of this makeup
tutorial I hope you enjoyed something
super different from me I really wanted
