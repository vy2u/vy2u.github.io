channel so today I'm going to be doing
my July favorites I'm gonna be so
typical they say but I always do this
I'm like this is gonna sound so typical
but I genuinely cannot believe that we
have come to the end of July I just
turned 21 and I feel like I'm getting so
old I already feel like time is passing
by so quickly because I could look back
on videos I did last year around my
birthday and I'm just kind of like what
so much has changed and I've grown up so
much and so much happened in July so I
had a really great month I'm really
excited to show you guys some things
I've been loving I haven't done a
favorites video in quite a while quite a
long while actually I think it was March
was the last one I done I don't really
have a massive haul of stuff to show you
it's more of the things that I am using
I'm obsessed with first thing I have to
talk about is an app and that app is
called depop if you don't already know
what that is then it's basically an app
where you can buy and sell anything you
like pretty much there's a lot of makeup
to buy and sell on there there's a lot
of fashion stuff and I have decided to
set up my own depop shop and I'm going
to be at the moment selling beauty
products I am really gonna put up some
fashion bits as well by the way all the
makeup products that I am gonna be
selling are packaged and never used of
course I'm not gonna be selling new
stuff on that I thought I would show you
guys some of the things I am selling on
depop because I just thought it'd be
really cool to show you where all of the
money that I make from selling my items
on d-bob are gonna go to a charity I
haven't quite decided which charity I
have a few charity that have of mine so
I haven't picked it yet but what I
eventually have picked this when the
video goes up I'll leave it down below
I'll leave a link down below in the
description box where you can download
depop it's free off the App Store and
also I will leave like my name down
below it's makeup by later so it'll be
really easy to find me but I'm so
excited because I feel like it'll be
really cool for you guys to take a peek
into the things that I'm selling okay so
these first two items I'm so excited to
be selling because I love both of these
they're just doubles and I was just have
them in my drawer for ages and I was
like what do I do with them so I sort of
absolutely perfect to sell these on D
pop and the money go to charity these
are the two two-faced bronzes that both
bronzes but they're different the first
one is the two-faced milk chocolate
Soleil which is a matte bronzer and then
the other one is the sweethearts bronzer
which is basically more about the
luminous baked bronzer and I already own
them of course I'm not gonna open these
because these are of course seals this
is a really nice natural color for me I
use this more in everyday basis just
because of course like I have tan skins
but yeah I love this then this is a
sweetheart bronze which is basically
more like a luminous one I'll do like
two swatches side-by-side on both my
fingers one is a little bit darker and
then the other one is mark paid LeBrons
r I'm also gonna be selling one of my
favorite L'Oreal products ever is the
L'Oreal glam bronze cushion de soleil
now you guys know already how much I
love this but there's a funny story
actually bought one originally when I
saw it and I hadn't heard anything and I
was like oh my gosh I need this so I
purchased it then I got someone from PR
and I was like perfect now I have two
and then I accidentally took one home
when I was shooting with icon and then I
had three and I was like no this is just
this is just too much he so basically my
battery just ran out so I had to wait
quite a while for it to charge so if the
line and stuff has changed that is why I
just wanted to show you guys quickly my
one this is mine totally
that one is sealed it's basically this
bronzer it's like a wet liquidy kind of
formula and I love it but they're gonna
be standing on my tea pop this little
blush from next well it's not really
little but it's um it's a blush this is
my one again this is a double that I
already have blush isn't something I
tend to go for buy do already earn this
one now if you are a blush lover I think
you'll really like this this is one of
that ombre blushes and this is in the
shade codebreaker and yeah I mean I'm
not really a massive block person myself
but that was basically no need to keep
this one because I already have 150
people be able to find two of the NYX
vivid brights liquid eyeliners again
I've already owned these are really
inexpensive anyway so yes
can we get this perfectly good price on
my deep olive oil just gonna swatch this
eyeliner because they are so bright that
is the orange one I don't know if you
can see that today the glue a raspberry
shade and these dry matte as well which
I really really like so yeah these are
so up there there will be an uptick a
subversion lash primer I'm so excited
for this one I'm gonna be selling at the
Mac Studio Fix face and body in the
color c5 Peto this one and have to take
out the box because I don't have one of
these to show you I have this in a dark
shade but I don't have it in this light
shade this is the derocker's metics brow
bar to go sit in the shade blonde to
brunette and of course I have dark hair
so there's no need for me to keep this
and the last thing that's gonna be up
there is this Mac brow pencil in the
color stud I used to use these all the
time but I have now found my Anastacio
brow products that I literally don't use
anything else pretty much so excited to
be selling some stuff and epub it's
about time I have a bit of a declutter
because I really want to do my room tour
and makeup collection soon and I have a
bunch of makeup that I don't use so I
really did think it was time to
declutter I'm gonna jump into the rest
of my favorites for now but if you do
want to keep updated in what I will be
selling on my depop then don't forget to
follow me on social media before I get
into makeup I might as well start with a
fragrance and this is new for me and
I've already gone through so much of it
already like I'm not one to really go
through things really quickly because I
like to switch things up but I've been
wearing this non-stop this is the
Victoria's Secret fragrance mist in the
I was about to say in the shade
that's how obsessed I am with makeups in
the scent aqua kissed and I love this oh
I don't even know how to describe this
it just smells so fresh and summery it
does it does smell kind of aquatic I
don't know why maybe it's the color
that's making me think of that but it
just kind of smells really fresh and it
really does have that holiday smell to
it obsessed with this been using it so
much and I feel like I need to spray
again because the skincare favorite for
this month is the body shop oils of the
life this is the intensely revitalizing
face oil now I don't know if you can see
this but I have not gone through that
much of it don't worry I'm not using a
ton of oil on my face I do use it quite
sparingly
I don't like cover myself in oil as much
as I wish I could I didn't actually use
all of this half of it spill on the
floor all over the carpet in my room and
I was like what am I done what I done
actually cleaned okay thank goodness but
I was like oil in my carpet one at least
my carpet is moisturize that's the main
thing it's probably one of the most
moisturizing oils I've ever tried that
doesn't clog my skin I have had such a
problem with clog skin for all of my
life and I definitely feel like
gradually it's improving and I feel like
a facial oil has really changed that and
I love this I use this not every single
night though just because my skin does
tend to get quite oily I'd say I use
this about four times a week in the
evening just to add that little bit
extra hydration to my skin I don't think
ever for the time of being on my channel
I've ever mentioned a sample well I'm
gonna do that for the first time today
this is the Chanel CC cream in the
complete correction SPF 50 this is in
the shade 30 beige and best CC cream or
BB cream I've ever tried in my entire
life without a doubt about it now it's
very natural such good coverage it
doesn't feel heavy surprisingly but it
covers a lot for me and it definitely
has to be set because my skin it does
tend to get oily in this region so I
have to set it but apart from that
absolutely obsessed with this 100% I'm
going to be buying the full version this
is the Dulux sample so to be fair I've
been using this a lot and I think I'm
coming to the end of it primer I've been
loving is the Make Up For Ever step one
base nourishing primer now this looks
disgusting because it's all matte white
and you know that packaging just gets
horrible and it's white so it's just it
it needs a good
who needs a good white but the primate
is amazing I'm not even sure what's in
this that makes it so nourishing but it
really is definitely one of my favorite
moisturizing primers hey another sample
to mention this isn't quite a sample
again it's like a Dulux sample I don't
think this is the full size maybe it is
but this is the benefit
Ready Set growl clear brow gel now if
you've been watching my channel for
within the last year you would know that
the UH Nastasia clear brow gel has been
all I've spoken about it's all I use on
my brows as a clear brow gel I've
literally I haven't even bought another
one because I was kind of like why
there's no point anastacio is all I need
and then I got this and I was like it's
really not gonna be that great I have
not been able to put this down it is
incredible the specific thing that I
love about it is the brush the brush is
it almost reminds me of like a mascara
wand
it's plastic whereas the Anastasio one
is that kind of fiber brushes this comes
through your eyebrows so beautifully
plus the formula is extremely strong so
if you have stubborn eyebrows I have
stubborn eyebrows like mine just love to
comb my hair is naturally curly
somewhere I read like the Carl as well
this just keeps them in place and I I'm
scared to say it I think I'm I haven't
found a new favorite you know if you
don't like when your brows go haul up
then you won't like this but if you are
one of those people that like your brows
to be stuck in place you John any hairs
moving out of place and this is for you
I love this and I would highly recommend
it
they're whole new brow range is really
nice this is incredible I just bought
this I was like I don't think I'm gonna
like it as much as I thought because i
swatched generals I bet like I'm not
really sure I feel about it but when
it's on I'm not really wearing it today
it just reminds me of that really
natural healthy glow usually love a
really bright intense highlight so I
didn't think I'd like this that much but
when this one is on the skin it almost
melts into the skin usually a highlight
will just kind of sit there whereas as
you can see what
I'm turning to the side it just looks
like a natural jus not to mention this
because this it has just been my
absolute go to this whole month actually
maybe it's been my go-to since I've had
out I really think I've put it down but
this month bit lava get this is the Kat
Von D shade and light palette you've
heard me speak about this a thousand
times still going strong I use this
every single day and it's not I'm not
really you know I really dig into
products that much so I don't hit pan
very often but I can't see myself
picking pan very soon on the banana
shade I'm obsessed with these honestly
like this is the most perfect contour
and highlight palette I own just the
powders just go on so smooth and I find
it so hard to find a powder that looks
nice and smooth underneath my eyes
because I'm prone to them tiny little
lines everywhere it's just snoc you but
I am so prone to them these do not do
that to me and I love that
and then lastly my last favorite is the
lip liner I'm wearing right now this is
little stripped down look a little he's
getting literally I think this is my
first matte lip liner where I've got
this small so that speaks a lot when I
use lip liners I don't like shop in them
all the time I try and get the most out
of them just because I don't know the
more you shop in it but less it's gonna
last but the fact that mine is this
short kind of says a lot about how much
I love this it's by far my favorite Mac
lip liner out there so you guys that is
the end of my favorites video I really
hope you enjoyed if you did then don't
