Channel today I'm going to be doing with
you guys my July favorites July is
probably the best month of the year so
I'm pretty sad that July is over I had
my birthday in july i had mine and my
boyfriend's five-year anniversary
together and it's also my boyfriend's
birthday as well so we just have loads
of fun in july and july is just always
our best month i also accumulated lots
of july favorites I didn't do it June
favorites or a may favorites and may
have done my favorites I can't remember
all i know is i have lots of different
favorites this month so considering
there's lots of new products I've tried
I wanted to talk to you guys about them
and you may have seen because I done a
haul for my birthday so it would be good
to do age of my favorites just so i can
give you guys a little update of what I
feel with the new products I've been
using and yeah I've just been loving
lots of new stuff and I can't wait to
tell you guys a little bit about them I
do have quite a few products totally
first few products I want to talk to you
guys about our body care and skin care
products I have been loving these
products the first one that I wanted to
talk to you guys is about this soap &amp;amp;
Glory sugar crush fresh of my meat body
wash and this is an amazing body wash I
don't usually talk to you guys about
body care and like my favorite body care
products but this has to be probably one
of my favorite body washes I've ever
tried just because the smell is
incredible this is one of those products
where the smell honestly lost on you and
you just keep smelling it and smelling
it and smelling it all throughout the
day and I really really love that the
center of this is lime so it's very
zesty and I just feel like it doesn't
dry out my skin for something with quite
a strong scent I just love it I love the
way that it smells it honestly does
smell like a really nice sugary lime
just imagine a line covered in sugar
that is what you will smell like it's
amazing for the summer I also love that
it's in such a big butt all its 500
milliliters it's got a little pump
applicator so it's really good for when
you're in the shower it's really easy to
use and I've just been loving it and the
packaging is always amazing
in soap &amp;amp; Glory products so I absolutely
love this so for these skin I have spoke
about this before I think in a hall but
I've never actually spoken to you guys
about why I love it so much and this is
the boa for your paws charcoal pore
minimizer as you guys can see I have
been using this a lot I do need to
repurchase a another one this is an
exfoliate and i like to use twice a week
sometimes three times a week depending
on how clogged my skin feels these are
behind my skin clearing up I think this
is one of the main reasons as well as
coconut oil I'm going to be doing a
skincare routine very soon my skin has
just been breaking out a little bit I'm
just trying to get to the bottom of it
and just figure out why it's happening
it could be stress related it could just
be what's going on around me a lot of
makeup because I've just been doing lots
of tutorials I've had lots of days where
I'm going out without recording as well
just lots of things my boyfriend's
birthday my birthday loads of different
things of just us coming album me
applying lots of makeup I feel like I
really need to get something to unclog
all of that I am completely prone to
block pause I get blocked pores pretty
much all over my face I'm not gonna lie
I get it in my forehead my nose my
cheeks and also my chin it's basically
just this whole center area I just get
lots of blocked pores and this really
unclogs them I honestly like it it
doesn't minimize the size of my pores
because to be honest I don't know any
products that can actually change your
skin's natural structure if you're not I
mean it's amazing it cleaning it as soon
as I use this my skin just feels like a
different face like my skin just feels
completely smooth as an amazing clean
smell and this is completely inexpensive
and i would highly recommend giving this
a try speaking about skin my skin has
also been very dry recently my skin is
just had some sort of reaction don't
know what's happened all i know is that
my skin kind of hasn't been feeling like
itself and in this time I've kind of
felt dry and that my skin feels tight
and when I apply makeup on it just
doesn't look right I'm sure we all have
them sort of periods in our life where
we feel like makeup just doesn't sit on
our skin properly I have been saved by
mac fix+ this has been in my life for
years now but recently has just been my
go-to this just completely refreshes
your face if your skin looks like it's
really dry
int powdering and the makeup just isn't
sitting right just spray a bunch of this
on your face and allow the makeup to
absorb it and your skin will just look
absolutely gorgeous it will completely
absorb and your skin will just look
amazing and this doesn't keep your
makeup in place it's not a setting spray
it just fixes your makeup and makeup
tool that I've been using the I am in
love with this month you guys wanna sing
this in my birthday haul if you watch
that video but it is the beauty of the
lender I have been using this Lots
off-camera and I've used it a few times
on camera I think I used it today and I
am really really liking this I've got to
be honest though I don't really see much
of a difference between this and the
Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge which you guys know that I used
completely before I use this this is the
first time of it for only Beauty Blender
so it was kind of my first time trying
it but obviously say if you are on a
budget and you don't want to be spending
17 18 pounds for however much this is in
your country where you live I'd honestly
say that the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge definitely go for it
if you don't want to splurge out on this
just because I feel that mine lasted a
really long time if you take care of it
you can make anything last I feel like
it's very similar this is just a lot
more bouncy whereas the other one is a
lot softer so yeah I just I have been
loving this a lot I really like the
shape the shape I think wins it for me
because I just feel like it's a lot
easier to use but as far as how it
blends out my foundation I haven't
really noticed much of a difference in
the sense that it doesn't look any more
flawless with this than it does with
double techniques I'm not sure if I have
spoken about this product yet but you
have definitely seen used in if you
watch my tutorials this is the make up
for ever step won't smoothing face let
me just say if you suffer with paws
uneven skin texture if you feel like
your skin never looks smooth underneath
makeup this is the primer for you this
is great for oily skin a combination
skin I am in love with this primer it is
amazing it's definitely one of my
favorite primers for the center of my
skin sometimes i'm using two because i
have combination skin i like to have a
hydrating private too but this is
honestly one of the best primaries i've
ever owned it's definitely pricey
because it is makeup forever but it's
amazing and it's definitely worth it
next I wanted to talk to you guys about
one more
tool it is a new brush from Real
Techniques if you guys have been
watching my channel for a while you know
that Real Techniques brushes are
everything to me they are definitely one
of the best quality brushes out there
and especially for the price what more
could you want the brush that I am
talking about is this one right here
it's a new one called be sculpting brush
I believe it's recommended for
contouring and I actually already bought
this not too long ago a couple of days
ago and I have been using it to
constantly since i bought it and i just
know i am not going to take my hands off
this brush so i like to use this for is
to apply my highlights are used it to
apply at my highlight today and it just
packs on highlight beautifully just as
it would pack on something like contour
it's specifically shaped for contour I
believe and I could imagine it really
working with that too you could use
cream contour for this powder contour
powder highlight powder anything you can
even blend in your foundation with this
the Real Techniques brushes are so
versatile because they are made with
synthetic hairs and when their synthetic
it just means you can use any form of
product on them and it will just blend
in beautifully so this is great Pat's on
my highlight it just looks amazing and
it really gives me that poor just glow I
am loving this and I'm honestly going to
be using this so much in the future in
the same shopping trip there's another
thing that I bought that i was instantly
in love with the Rimmel kate nude
lipstick they have a new nude collection
line I have a whole bunch of different
nude lipsticks and I picked out one this
one is number 42 and this is personally
my kind of nude it's a new really peachy
undertone and it's nice because it's
really nice and wearable the formula is
beautiful and although i bought this a
few days ago you don't really need a lot
of time to know you're going to love
lipstick right this is definitely a
favor i know i haven't used it loads but
ever since I've got it I haven't been
able to take off of been wearing it
constantly the last couple of days since
i bought it and i'm just in love with
them okay so i have lots of products to
show you for brows i have recently got
lots of new brown products and i'm so
happy because i wasn't really happy with
the products i was using and there are
three products that i just cannot stay
away from so i have two pencils one from
the drugstore and one high-end the
drugstore pencil that I love is the brow
archery pencil from
soap &amp;amp; Glory it's exactly like the
Anastasia brow Wiz which is the my other
favorite because I just got this as a
birthday present it's exactly the same
it has these spoolie on the other end
just like the Anastasia one and it also
has the pencil on the other end and I
just think that's amazing anastasiya one
has more of a waxy fuel or as this one
has a harder feel so I like this one for
mobbin everyday because it kind of looks
a little bit softer and more natural or
as the waxy one kind of applies more
product so I like this one I'm wearing a
full of face of makeup although I still
to use the brouwers more this is great
because I like having a drugstore
alternative that I know I can just go
and pick up and it won't be really
expensive and it's just going to be
really nice to recommend to you guys too
I believe they have only two shades of
this brow archery pencil then also as I
just mentioned like I said any brouwers
is definitely another favor for me this
is by far my favorite brow pencil I've
ever had it's an amazing formula it's
really creamy and waxy and it makes all
your brows canned of form really well
together it's hard to explain but it
kind of just makes your eyebrows look
like they are for a lot like they have
more hair and that's really hard to have
with a pencil without making the to
you crayon like I'm so in love with this
so that's definitely been a huge
favorite for this month or two and again
from Anastasia Beverly Hills I have been
loving the anastasiya clear brow gel I
would think I'm ever going to find
something that will top this it's just
amazing i love the way that it dries
automatically when you fill your browse
through with this it just makes them
look fuller just makes your browser more
texturized that's when they start to
look a lot thicker and it honestly holds
your brows in that place all day also
have a lip liner that I have been using
constantly is the Kiko automatic
precision lip liner in at number 501
it's like a peachy nude but it's just
perfect and I've been using it all over
the lips and that's just that color just
there and it just gives me a really nice
matte effect and because it's an
automatic one and it just looks like
that liquid lipstick feel that Superman
is going to stay there amazing lip color
and I just love that she will show you
as well I think it's just the most
perfect color and I've just absolutely
been
this and I love the fact that it's not
expensive also so you guys would have
definitely seen this if you've watched
my last few videos this is the Laura
Geller gilded honey baked gelato
illuminator oh my god i am in love with
it it's the highlighter that i am
wearing today it's just this on its own
applied with the Real Techniques brush
it just gives me the most gorgeous
highlight this is the kind of highlight
I like a gold highlight with a sheen
nothing too glittery within it that
makes me look like unnaturally
highlighted I like my highlight to kind
of have more of a sheen than glitter
just because it makes you look like
you're kind of glowing instead of just
looking like you've put glitter on your
face palette I have been reaching for a
ton is the makeup geek vegas flight
spyler i've used this in a few tutorials
but I've also taken this around with me
quite a lot it's just the best palate to
have with you are used specifically the
three shades at the bottom the top three
are a little bit too colorful for me
when I'm just doing like an everyday
kind of thing but the bottom three are
amazing specifically Mirage and desert
sands desert sands is literally like
uninterruptedly shadow from mac which
you guys know I love I've been using
that my channel pretty much since I
started it and also viraj it's also a
color that makeup geek doesn't sell
alone also it's like a cream shadow that
has a really slight sheen to it any time
I've needed to get ready outside of my
house this is just the palette I always
take with me because it's just got the
best range of colors for a neutral other
like me I let's apply that on the lid or
a gold on the lid Plus that in the
crease and then that any corpse or power
be too dark and everything up it's just
amazing and then you also have the pop
of cranberry there if you wanted to use
that color also I've been loving this
palette and have been reaching for it
hola another pilot I've been reaching
for which you guys would have seen in my
birthday haul as well is the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette I have been loving
this this is the apparent I have on my
eyes today this is just amazing for
someone that loves in neutral shades
like I do plus loves pop of color which
I do as well used it to do this look
today and there will be a tutorial on
this book coming very soon and I use
this palette and I just love the
packaging good look quick chocolate and
then that last but not least I had to
talk to you guys about one more
anastasia beverly hill
product this is the contour kit in light
to medium powder contour kit and I
specifically like two of the shades I
likely banana shade here and fawn which
is just its greatest shade there these
are my favorite I absolutely love these
two shades i use the banana shake juice
or highlight under my eyes and all the
areas i put my concealer on and then i
like to use this in the right in the
hollow of my cheek to give us that
really nice a shadowed contour effect i
really like it because it's very soft it
doesn't look too great it still has a
bit of warmth to it and I've just been
loving it but the whole kit as its own
is really nice i like how compact it is
i have been loving this contour kit and
i'm probably going to be using it to pay
you a lot and then one non makeup
