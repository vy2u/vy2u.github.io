today I'm going to be showing you this
Katy Perry inspired makeup look that she
wore at the Superbowl game it was
absolutely stunning and I just had to
recreate it and also it's so perfect
look for Valentine's Day so my first
steps are going to be doing my skin I
used my strobe cream by Mac onto my skin
first and then I'm going to be applying
my L'Oreal True Match all over my skin I
want to achieve a really full coverage
so I'm just gonna build this up with a
morphe flat foundation brush and I'm
just gonna very gradually build up a
full coverage
so once I've applied my first layer I'm
just gonna start patting on a little bit
more thin layers work a lot better than
thicker layers so I just work in very
thin layers very gradually patting on
more product next I'm going to be
priming my eyes with soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac
so once our eyes are prepped I'm going
to be taking this very light shimmery
color from the Vice to palette by urban
decay and I'm just going to be passing
that all over the lid the eyeshadow that
Katie was wearing was really really
simple it just looked really natural and
all the emphasis was on the eyeliner so
I'm just gonna be applying that all over
the lid and then I'm also going to be
applying it onto the inner corner of my
eye as well next I'm going to be taking
this matte Brown from the same vice -
palette and I'm going to be taking a
blending brush and applying that into my
crease and this is just going to give us
the appearance of a slightly deeper
crease just making sure that I'm going
to blend that very well and that's the
only eye shadows that we're going to be
applying for this look
next I'm going to apply my liquid
eyeliner Katie had a really natural wing
but what I wanted to do was do a wing
that suited my eye shape a little better
I feel like when I do an eye look it
needs to have a little bit of a thicker
eyeliner so mine's a little bit thicker
than Katie's but because our eye shapes
are very different so feel free to do
whatever eyeliner style that you like
and the whole trick of this look is this
next step so basically what I'm doing is
taking a gold liquid glitter liner and
I'm going to draw a line literally just
on top of the liquid liner that we've
just applied and this is what creates
the amazing effect that Katie's makeup
happen it looked so amazing and it just
looked so effective it didn't need a lot
of work at all and it just looked really
stunning but also effortless at the same
time so just build up that glitter and
just carrying on building it up until it
has a really thick consistency then I'm
going to be applying my lashes as normal
I'm using some lashes that I customized
myself I will have all the details in
the description box as usual and I'm
just using my tweezers to get that as
close to the lash line as possible
next I'm going to be filling in my
eyebrows a little bit thicker than I
usually do just because Katie's eyebrows
are really gorgeous and full so I wanted
to kind of replicate them as best as
possible so I'm using my spiked eyebrow
pencil by Mac and just very gradually
filling in the hairs
and then when it gets to my arch I'm
just going to draw a little bit higher
than my natural arch because my arch
isn't as high as I'd like it to be and
then as it gets to the inner corner and
just want to brush all the hairs through
so it has a really natural fade then I'm
just going to be brushing through my
eyebrows with a brow mascara and then
I'm also going to be highlighting under
my brow but they can see that as usual
next I'm going to be highlighting under
my eyes I'm using the NYX HD concealer
and then I'm also using my light boost
on the higher points of my skin and just
blending that all together where they
rounded morphe brush
I'm just blending that in as much as I
can so it has a really seamless finish
next I'm going to be bronzing my skin
and Kate you just have a really natural
soft bronze he didn't look like she was
wearing any blusher but she was wearing
a highlighter so I'm just going to be
applying some bronzer and also my
highlighter onto my skin this is Becca
opal highlight and it is so gorgeous and
I'm just applying that to the very high
point of my cheekbone and this just
gives us a really pretty glow and next
I'm going to be filling in my lips with
cherry lip pencil by Mac and this is a
really pretty color
Katie's look was so classic it was
almost like a modern take on the classic
pin-up look so this is just a really
simple Marilyn red and then I'm going
for my fire-engine lipstick by Gerard
cosmetics this is the most stunning read
ever
it suits absolutely every skin tone and
it just looks absolutely incredible so
definitely check my description box for
a coupon code to get a discount off this
and to finish off the eye look I'm just
going to be applying some of the color
that we applied in our crease on to our
bottom lash line and this is just gonna
define the lash line and also make it
look more balanced from the top because
there's a lot on the top lash line you
just want to make it look a little bit
more balanced then I'm just applying
some mascara onto my lashes and then I'm
also going to be applying some onto my
bottom lashes as well
so guys that is the end of this look I
hope that you enjoyed another celebrity
inspired makeup look this look is so
simple and I thought I'd get this up so
that you guys can enjoy this for
Valentine's Day too because it's just so
perfect for that I hope you have an
amazing day guys and I will see you in
the next one
