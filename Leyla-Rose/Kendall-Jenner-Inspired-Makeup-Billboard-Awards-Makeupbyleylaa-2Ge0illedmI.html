showing you how to get this kendall
Jenner inspired makeup neck I have
started with my foundation of my
eyebrows on and I'm just going to be
putting a I base all over my lid I'm
using painterly Paint Pot by Mac I'm
just gonna be using this to make my
eyelid nice and bright then I'm gonna
take tempting by Mac and I'm going to be
packing this very very gently all over
the lid it's quite a glittery eyeshadow
so I don't want any of the glitter to
fall so I'm passing it very very gently
to make sure that all sticks on the lid
really nicely then I'm going to take
charcoal Brown by Mac and I'm going to
blend that into my crease and I'm also
going to blend it upwards as well just
using lots of windshield wiper motions
to blend that really really nicely I'm
also going to be taking a Kohl pencil
this is feline by Mac and I'm running
that all the way along my waterline and
I'm also going to be running that in
between my lashes and a little bit below
as well
next I'm just taking that brush that I
used to Pat's that color on my lid and
I'm using it to blend out that pencil
just to give it a nice smoldering effect
I'm also going to be flicking it upwards
at the outer corner of my eye just to
give my outer corner a little bit of
definition without giving too much
effect as it is quite a light smoky eye
I'm then going to be taking embark and
I'm going to be adding a little bit of
that with a angled brush onto my lash
line rather than using a eyeliner this
is just gonna give a little bit of drama
on our lash line rather than using a
liner and I'm just using a pencil brush
with a little bit more of that embark
and I'm just adding a little bit more of
that to the outer corner now just apply
your favorite mascara and the way
kendall has her eyelashes it looks like
it's natural but considering my
eyelashes are really really sure I'm
gonna be applying some really really
natural lashes by Mac so just apply your
mascara and then it's optional if you
want to apply any force lashes
next I'm going to be highlighting under
my eyes really really well as you know
the Kardashians and the Jenners have
really nice highlights and flawless
flawless lifted faces all the time so
I'm just going to be highlighting
certain parts of my face that I want to
appear more lifted so I've just done
down the bridge of my nose under my eyes
on top of my eyebrows and also on my
Cupid's bow and chin so I'm just gonna
be blending that out with a duo fiber
brush and I'm gonna make sure that I'm
blending that really really well to give
it those a seamless look next I'm going
to be contouring with a darker colored
foundation and this is optional but as
you know the Kardashians always have a
really really nice sculpted face so I
felt like this was definitely something
that was running through Kendall's like
so I'm just putting that around the
outside of my face under my cheekbones
and I'm also going to be putting it onto
my jawline as well and it's really
important to blend this really really
well so I'm gonna make sure that I blend
it very very very gently
next I'm gonna take a matte bronzer and
just apply it where I contoured just to
give it a little bit more of an effect
and that just makes it look like I have
more cheekbone I'm also gonna be
applying a blush as well to the tops of
my cheeks is quite a peachy blush
Kendal's look is very very golden so I'm
applying a golden highlight as well I'm
also going to be applying that highlight
onto the bridge of my nose as well and
also onto my Cupid's bow Kendall looks
extremely glowing so that's why I'm
gonna make sure they look nice and
radiant
next I'm going to be applying my lip
liner I am using etc by Mac this is a
pro longwear and it's quite a nice
lights nude so I'm going to apply that
all the way around my lip line and then
I'm also going to be applying a lip
stick as well I'm just putting on my
lipstick I'm using myth by Mac and I'm
going to be applying also a gloss on top
of that
so guys once your gloss is on that's
going to be the end of this look I
really hope that you've enjoyed the
celebrity inspired look oh if you do
want to see any more celebrity inspired
looks then please let me know
have a nice day guys and see you soon
