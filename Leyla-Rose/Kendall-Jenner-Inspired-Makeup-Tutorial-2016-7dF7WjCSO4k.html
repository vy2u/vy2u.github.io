today I'm gonna be showing you this
kendall Jenner inspired makeup look this
is based off the makeup look that she
wore at the Mets gala event it was so
glowy and peachy I just knew I had to
recreate it because it's so perfect for
summer so to get started I'm gonna be
spraying my face with the pixi by petra
glow mist and I love this this gives
just an instant of glow and I'm just
gonna be spraying this all over before
foundation and that way it will just
kind of shown through the foundation I'm
using is the Rimmel wake me up
Foundation and I'm just gonna be buffing
this in using my Real Techniques
sculpting brush and I really love this
foundation because it's really glowy but
it gives a really nice coverage at the
same time
for my eyes I just knew I had to use the
new two-faced sweet peach palette and
I'm first of all just gonna be taking
this color right here this is called
candied peach and I'm gonna be applying
that into my crease to really bring out
that peach eNOS in the crease I'm
applying this with a fluffy blending
brush to really make sure this color
gets nice and blended out by am applying
lots of layers of this color because it
is quite a light to veil of color this
kind of shadow isn't that pigmented so
I'm just kind of building it up so that
peach looks really nice and bright in
the crease next I'm gonna be taking the
color puree and I'm gonna be taking this
on a slightly more densely packed
blending brush and I'm just gonna be
applying that into the deeper hollow of
my crease this is just gonna build up
some depth and just make the eyes look a
little bit more Hollow which makes it
all look a little bit smoky err it's not
gonna be a super smoky look but applying
a medium tone Brown just makes it all
look nice and deep I'm also just making
sure to blend that all out with that
previous blending brush for my lid color
I'm gonna be mixing together Bellini and
the color nectar and this will just
create a really nice light rose gold
shade I didn't want it to be too rose
gold so I added a little bit of the
nectar and I'm just packing this all
over the lid and cutting this off at the
crease to kind of create a little bit of
a soft cut crease look for my liner I'm
gonna be applying a normal sized wing to
my eye
Kendal's wing or wasn't very big but
those kind of small wings don't really
suit my eye shape so for my sake I've
made it a little bit thicker but that's
just because I personally feel like it
students my eye shape a little bit
better but do whatever you feel for your
particular eyes shape you don't even
need to wing this out it's totally up to
you but I did apply a little bit more
eyeliner towards the outer corner of my
eye compared to the inner corner of my
eye for my lashes I'm taking the red
cherry wispy lashes I love these these
are so gorgeous
it didn't look like Kendall was wearing
much eyelashes maybe if they were really
natural or just mascara so I decided to
wear quite a natural pair of lashes
these are a little bit long and wispy
and that's why I decided to choose these
next I'm just gonna be highlighting my
skin using the Rimmel wake me up
concealer this is one of my favorite
radiant concealers and I just love the
way this look so I'm just applying this
in all the areas I would like to bring
forward and I'm just going to be
blending this out using the same brush I
use to blend in my foundation
Kendal's complexion always looks super
glowy and flawless at the same time now
if I had it my way I would use the most
glorious foundation and not set it to
really keep that glow but because I have
an oily skin type and just the way my
skin texture is it always looks a lot
better if I set it with a powder so I'm
taking my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder and just making sure to set this
and I'm really gonna recreate this glow
using some highlight at the end so if
you have an oily skin type and you want
to have that glow using a powder tie
line can really give you that look
without actually having to have a lot of
moisture on your skin if you are oily
like me to fill in my brows I'm gonna be
taking the anastacio pour out a finer
and this is totally new to me like this
is one of my first times using it and I
love the way it looks it looks really
natural but defined at the same times I
really like this I'm just gonna be
starting out by defining the bottom of
my brow and then I'm gonna be creating
the top of my brow I kind of don't have
an arch so I need to create one so I'm
just kind of joining in from the center
of my brow and then creating a little
bit of a higher arch when it comes to
the center next I'm just gonna be
applying some concealer to the bottom of
my brow to really carve out that shape
and to make everything look a lot more
defined and then to keep all of the
hairs in place I'm gonna be applying my
clear brow gel and this is a must if I
want my brow has to stay upwards
otherwise they'll just kind of drop down
to recreate candles glowing from within
look I'm gonna be taking this pur bronze
fusion from Make Up For Ever and just be
bronzing the outer perimeter of my face
she didn't look like she had any like
serious contour going on so I decided to
apply just a bronzer with a large powder
brush around the outer perimeter and
also on the contour areas so still
underneath the cheekbones but just on
the areas that would naturally give me a
glow for blush I'm gonna be taking the
new Too Faced peach blush and I'm just
gonna be applying this to the apples of
my cheeks I'm kind of smiling to give me
that kind of apple cheek look because I
can see where I want to apply it and I'm
just rolling this blush backwards to
kind of lift my face upwards and to give
me that serious glow I was talking about
earlier I am taking Becca champagne pop
highlight and applying it to the tops of
my cheekbones the tip of my nose and
also above my eyebrows so whenever I
tell my face to the side it just gives
me a glow from just the whole side of my
face if that makes sense
applying a highlight to all the natural
high points of the face really makes you
look like you are glowing from within
and finally for the lips I'm gonna be
going all over the lips with this Kiko
lip liner I think this is in the shade
701 if I'm remembering correctly it's a
really nice peachy brown shade small
peachy than brown but it still has that
nice undertone of brown and then I'm
gonna be going around the outer part of
my lips using stripped down the pencil
from Mac just because I always like to
go around the outer part of my lips with
the darkened lip liner to conceal my
overlining a little bit and just to make
my lips look all-around
fuller and although I love the way that
it looks with a matte finish Kendall did
look like she had a slightly glossy
finish so I'm taking the NYX butter
gloss in the shade fortune cookie and
just applying this all over to finish
off that lip so guys that is the end of
this celebrity inspired makeup look I
really hope you enjoyed I love this it's
so glowy and it's definitely something
that I would wear around the summer time
it's perfect for a nice vacation just on
the beach if you really want to be like
slay another Beach but yeah it's
gorgeous and I really hope you enjoyed
