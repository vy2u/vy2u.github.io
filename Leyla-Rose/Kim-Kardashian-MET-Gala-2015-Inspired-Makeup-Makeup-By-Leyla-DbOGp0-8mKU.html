today's makeup tutorial is inspired by
the makeup that Kim Kardashian wore at
the Met Gala event
Oh
so before we start I just wanted to let
you guys know that I have done my brows
off-camera but the link to my brow video
will be in the description box to get
started we're gonna be doing our skin
and I'm gonna be applying some primer
this is the natural radiance primer from
Mac I'm just gonna be applying this all
over my skin to prep it before
foundation any foundation that I'm gonna
be using today is the Laura Mercier silk
cream foundation I've just been loving
this foundation recently for a nice full
coverage and it just looks so creamy and
silky like the bottle says I just
absolutely love it and I'm gonna be
applying it today with my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
which I have also been loving to apply
my foundation recently it just applies
everything so smoothly so we're just
applying an even layer of that and just
bouncing this onto my skin next I'm
going to be applying another layer just
on the areas that I feel needs a little
bit more coverage I'm just gonna be
bouncing my Real Techniques sponge again
just to make sure that blends in with
the rest of the foundation
next time apply my primer I'm using the
soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac and I'm
playing it with a a zoeva rounded brush
and I'm just going to be applying this
onto the whole of my lids then I'm going
to be going in with Mac uninterrupted
eyeshadow and applying this with a big
fluffy blending brush this one is from
Sigma and then I'm going to be applying
a little bit more of that into the
deeper part of my crease the look that
kim is wearing is so simple so I'm not
going to be going too much into the eyes
because it is really really simple as
I'm just applying that Brown into the
crease and just blending it out and then
I'm going to be applying this shimmery
L'Oreal shadow all over my lid Kim's
look looked really shimmery and almost
messy in a sense it didn't look really
neat which was why I really liked about
it so you don't have to be too careful
with how this looks just apply this all
over the lid
then what are we applying this Kiko
mineral style eyeshadow and applying
this into my outer corner and this is a
shimmery Brown so I'm just gonna be
applying it to create a little bit of
definition but the fact that it's
shimmery means that it's still going to
create that gorgeous shimmering effect
that Kim's makeup heart
and I'm just gonna go back into that
blending brush and just blending that
color into my crease to make sure all
the colors are blend together then I'm
going to be applying a Kohl pencil this
one is a feline pencil from Mac and I'm
just gonna be running this all along my
top lashline and you don't have to worry
about being too neat with this because
we are going to be kind of buffing this
out a little bit so you can be as neat
or as messy as you like and I'm just
making sure to get it into my tight line
area as well then I'm going to be taking
a small precision brush from Mac and
just gonna be pushing this upwards just
to create a nice softened effect and
then I'm gonna be taking the mary lou
manizer from the balm and applying this
as our inner corner highlight and also
applying this to our brow bone and what
this is gonna do is create a really
gorgeous shimmering glowing eye that Kim
did have it was all about the highlight
and her brow bone highlight was just
glistening in the lights so you want to
make sure that you have a really
shimmery highlight then I'm gonna be
applying my mascara and some false
lashes I'm wearing false lashes that are
a little bit more dramatic than what Kim
was wearing and it's up to you I just
like to go for a little bit more of a
volumizing lash so it's completely up to
you next I'm applying some concealer to
my under eyes this is the NARS creamy
concealer in custard and then I'm taking
the Maybelline fit me concealer and just
applying it slightly underneath that to
highlights these areas also and then I'm
also gonna apply this onto the other
high points of my face
so my forehead the bridge of my nose and
also my chin
then I'm going to be using the same
sponge as I used for my foundation and
just use this to bounce this into my
skin and this will just create a really
nice seamless effect from the foundation
to the concealer
and then any areas that are harder to
reach I'm gonna be using my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush to get into the areas
that are hard to reach and then I'm just
applying some nas crystal translucent
powder as my under-eye highlight and I'm
just brushing this away with a real
techniques setting brush and then I'm
gonna be taking the bomb betty
loumanizer and be applying this onto my
cheeks to give us a little bit of a
bronze and I'm also gonna be contouring
a little bit but only using like the
tiniest a little bit because Kim
actually wasn't that contoured and she
was more kind of highlighted than having
glitter contour on her face so I'm gonna
be taking a sculpting powder from Mac
and just be applying this into the
hollows of my cheeks only as you can see
I'm just applying this into the hollow
of my cheeks and just brushing it
upwards I don't want it to be too
structured which is why I'm also using a
more warmer toned pulsing powder bother
than a cool one
then I'm gonna take a smaller brush and
start to apply that onto my nose and
it's just gonna create the appearance
very slimming notes
next I'm gonna be taking that same dark
brown shadow we applied into our outer
corner and just quite messily apply it
to our lower lash line and then I'm
gonna be applying some mascara also and
what I really love about this look is
that it's not really chiseled smoky eye
it's quite messy and shimmery and I just
really like the effect that it had
next I'm going to apply my Becca opal
highlighter and just be applying this to
the cheekbones and I'm also going to be
applying it on to the other high points
of my face
next I move upon my lip liner this is
stripped down a lip pencil from Mac and
I'm just gonna be using this to it line
my lips this is quite a nice at baiji
color so I'm just gonna be using this to
create a nice lip line Kim had a really
nice glossy lip that looked really
almost like a barely there nude so I'm
gonna be using blankety lipstick just to
create a really nice nude effect and I'm
patting it just so I don't apply too
much product
then I'm gonna be going in with a Bobby
Brown at lipgloss and this is just a
really nice reflective almost clear
gloss but it does have a little bit of
glitter in it and it just created the
most gorgeous glossy effect and it just
felt like this kind of replicated the
kind of lip gloss that Kim was wearing
really nicely
