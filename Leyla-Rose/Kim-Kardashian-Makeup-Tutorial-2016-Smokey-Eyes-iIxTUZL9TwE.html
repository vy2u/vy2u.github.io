today I'm going to be doing a Kim
Kardashian inspired makeup look this is
the makeup she wore at the Cannes Film
Festival and as soon as I saw her I just
knew I had to recreate it
and you guys really wanted to see this
as well so if you want to see how I
created this whole makeup look then just
keep on watching
so to begin I'm going to be priming my
eyes with some concealer this is the
Rimmel wake me up concealer and I'm just
applying this all over my lid and just
making sure it's thoroughly blended in
and I'm also setting that into place to
make sure it doesn't move and it doesn't
crease my first eyeshadow I'm going to
be using is makeup geek Peach Smoothie
and I'm just going to be using this -
first of all just add a little bit of
color into the crease to make sure
everything else blends really easily so
I'm just building up this color quite a
bit and I'm using quite a fluffy
blending brush to really blend this out
I really want to make sure this is nice
and distributed evenly along the crease
and then I am taking makeup geek frappe
eyeshadow and I'm gonna be taking this
into the crease as well to kind of
deepen it a little bit and also to start
adding some warmth
Kym's crease look like it was quite warm
and everything looked really nice and
matte as well I'm just hoping that in
the crease with the same brush and just
making sure to keep building up this
color and making sure it's blended at
the same time so I'm just adding it
little by little and just making sure to
blend it very thoroughly the color we're
going to be using for the lid shade is
latte from makeup geek like I said Kim's
eye look looked really nice and matte so
I wanted to Pat this all over the lid it
makes the look look very minimalistic
and I really like this because all the
attention is on the bottom lashline to
add a little bit of definition and a
little bit of smokiness to the crease
I'm taking makeup geek Coco bear and I'm
just popping that into the outer part of
my crease and I'm just creating an
almost a little bit of a V on the outer
part of the eye just to add a little bit
of length to really lift our eyes
upwards when you look at Kim's eyes if
it truly looks like they are cat's eyes
so I really wanted to replicate that and
add a little bit of definition onto that
outer part to really change the shape of
my eyes to lift the eyes even more I'm
going to be wiping away the sides of my
eyeshadow to create quite an angular
line towards the tail of my eyebrow and
this is really going to turn our eyes
upwards for my skin I'm gonna be priming
with two primers I'm first of all just
taking the makeup of a step one
nourishing primer and also to smooth
some areas of my face as well I'm taking
the Too Faced primed and poreless primer
and just to smooth everything over and I
really want to cover up this redness
because I
have quite a bit of acne scarring my
spots have definitely cleared up but I
have a lot of redness on my skin I'm
taking this green tone concealer from
soap &amp;amp; Glory I accidentally put it as a
little lightning bolt on my head by
accident and I was like oh my gosh I'm
Harry Potter literally I'm Harry Potter
the green tone is really going to help
to cancel out that redness and that way
the redness won't show through my
foundation and concealer for my
foundation I'm going to be taking the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation this
is definitely one of my favorite
foundations when I first tried it I
actually didn't like it but now that
I've got to use it a lot more I'm in
love with it I'm just putting this out
with a Beauty Blender and just applying
this all over the skin for a nice
flawless coverage because Kim's face is
always full list for my concealer I'm
taking the amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer and just first of all applying
that on my under eyes and then I'm gonna
be taking another two concealers because
Kim's under eyes always look so bright
so I really wanted to replicate that I'm
just first of all taking the wake me up
concealer from Rimmel again the same one
I used to prime my eyes and just
applying it onto the under eye area and
then I'm going to be taking a light
boost from a Mac this is like a
highlighting concealer and I'm just
applying this onto all the areas I would
like to highlight and bring forward so
primarily on my under eyes but then I'm
going to be applying on my forehead and
also my chin as well and I'm just
blending it out with my Beauty Blender
to make sure it looks nice and flawless
next I'm just going to be baking my
undereyes using the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and this is
really gonna help to brighten this area
and to really make sure it doesn't
crease so I'm first of all just applying
the powder on and just allowing it to
sit and I'm using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder for the rest of
my skin because I don't want to bake the
whole of my face just my under eyes so I
applied that on the other areas of my
face and then also while my under eyes
are baking I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows but I will leave a tutorial
down below on where you can see that so
now that my eyebrows are done I can dust
away that powder that was used to bake
my under eyes and I'm just making sure
to just away very thoroughly now I'm
going to carry on doing my eyes and this
bit is definitely important I'm applying
a Kohl pencil onto my bottom lashline
and also my top lashline
I hate showing this in videos because I
just think it looks horrible and then
I'm also taking that Kohl pencil and
applying it to my bottom lashline and we
are going to be smudging this out so
much that it doesn't feel right when I
was doing this I was like this just
feels too much it doesn't feel normal
I'm taking makeup geek corrupt eyeshadow
and we are going to start smudging this
I'm just going to be extending this and
kind of creating a bottom wing almost
just following the kind of shape that we
created with the eyeshadow and again I'm
just smudging this outwards kind of
going in the direction of the tail of my
eyebrow to really lift the eyes upwards
and as you can see I'm just continuously
smudging it we really don't want to see
any harsh lines whatsoever and then I
just took a little bit of that Kohl
pencil and applied it on the top lash
line also and just made sure to smudge
that so again there are no harsh lines
next I'm just gonna be applying a light
pair of lashes because Kim didn't look
like she was wearing much at all
probably just mascara but her lashes are
quite long so I took the red cherry demi
whispies and just applied them with some
mascara and I did coat them quite a bit
with mascara usually I don't put a lot
of mascara on too full slashings but
this time I did and I did apply quite a
bit and I also want to make sure that
I'm coating this a lot on the top and
also coating it a lot on the bottom as
well because it did look like Kim had a
lot of mascara going on especially on
the bottom
so now that my eyes are done I'm going
to be taking the Kat Von D shade and
light palette and I'm going to be
contouring using this bronzer shade I
wanted to go for quite a warm contour
today and I just decided to apply this
into the contours of my cheeks down the
sides of my forehead and also onto my
jaw line as well just to really give
myself a bronzy but sculpted face and
for my highlight I am taking the
Anastacio glow kit and these two shades
are so gorgeous I just mix them both
together and it just creates a really
nice gorgeous champagne glow I'm also
just baking underneath my contour using
the same Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and this just creates a
lot of brightness underneath the contour
it really makes everything pop a lot
more and it really structures your
cheekbones and of course we know that
Kim is one of the Queen's of contouring
and I definitely feel like her makeup
artists always do this on her really
cleans up the contour and yeah it just
makes such a difference next I'm going
to be contouring my nose and I do have a
tutorial on how to do that so I will
leave the link just here and finally my
my clothes have changed I wanted it to
be more Kim like and I just decided to
apply a lip liner all over the lips this
is the NYX retractable lip liner in the
shade natural and this is a really nice
natural shade it's exactly what it says
and then I'm going around the outer
edges with stone by Mac this is one of
my favorite lip colors to use on the
outer edges just to really make my lips
look a lot fuller and then on the actual
lips I'm taking a liquid lipstick today
it didn't really look like Kim was
wearing a super matte lip I decided I
really wanted to go for something like
that and is the LA splash liquid
lipstick this is in the shade innocent
vixen and it's literally one of the most
perfect nude shades ever and I love it
and I'm just applying that all over the
lip and then finally of course I need to
dust away that baking underneath my
contour so I'm just dusting that away
and making sure it says dusted as
possible and yeah that completes today's
look I really hope you enjoyed this Kim
Kardashian inspired a makeup look I am
obsessed with this look and I'm so happy
