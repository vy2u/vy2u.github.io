you this Kim Kardashian wedding inspired
makeup this is quite a simple look
that's very easy to accomplish and to be
honest it's quite a lot of fun to do
because it's a little bit different to
anything I do everything I do is usually
dramatic so the first step is going to
be applying my Paint Pot in laying low
all over the lid this is just gonna make
our eyeshadow stick and it's also gonna
make it up here a lot brighter as well
and today I'm going to be using the
Naked palette and I'm using virgin from
The Naked palette I'm just applying this
one over with a Tom Ford shader brush
and this is quite a pigmented shadow so
it does look quite bright and that's the
kind of look that I wanted to go for
although the picture of Kim is in black
and white you can tell that her lid is
quite bright so I'm putting a little bit
of vanilla pickle Mumbai Mac on top of
that and I'm applying that into the
inner corner as well next I'm taking
buck from The Naked palette and I'm
gonna be taking that with a Tom Ford
crease brush and I'm gonna be applying
that into my crease this is the only
color that I'm actually going to be
using in the crease because it doesn't
look quite defined in Kim's picture she
just looks like she's got the most
natural shadow possible which I probably
think two shadows minimum and her liner
and lashes again are quite natural so
everything tends to look quite simple
really
so I'm just making sure that's really
really nice and blended with that same
brush blending it quite softly but
making sure that it's blended all around
the eye and I'm just taking one more
brush just to blend that color out a
little bit further keep blending
next I'm gonna be taking that dark black
color from the same palette and I'm
gonna be applying that with a small
zoeva brush under my lash line it
doesn't look like Kim is wearing any
liner on the bottom it just looks quite
soft which is why I'm using a black
shadow instead then I'm just taking a
liquid liner and gonna be rimming that
on the top of my lash line and I am
going to just flick it out the tiniest
little bit it's not gonna be winged out
a lot to be honest it's just gonna be
like a tiny little flick as you can see
I'm just thinking in that a little bit
to be fair non winged liner on me
doesn't really suit me but this is
obviously how they look did lurk and I'm
just applying some skin toned and liner
to the inside of my eye to burn in it
then I'm just applying my favorite
mascara onto my lashes but as you know
guys I can't go without full slashes
usually because my lashes don't really
do much for me and it's up to you if you
wanted to apply some false lashes I'm
gonna be applying a really really
natural pear just applying that on the
bottom lashes as well for some reason my
bottom lashes are really long but my top
on it's really annoying so I'm applying
some number Seven's from Mac these are
so natural because they almost dolly
like they are quite separated so they
just sit in between my natural lashes
and then I'm just gonna curl them so
they stick between stick to my natural
lashes and they also go upwards next I'm
just gonna be filling out my eyebrows
with my whitening lightening brow bar to
go in the darkest shade I absolutely
have been loving this for my eyebrows it
just looks so natural and full without
looking too filled in so I'm just gonna
be applying that with a Mac 266 brush
this is my holy grail brush for eyebrows
and I'm just gonna be applying that to
the bottom part of my brow
and I'm also gonna extend it I do like
to extend my brow
as you can see I just go and slow little
strokes I don't tend to like fill it in
quite harshly so you can just see I go a
little backward motions as if I'm
drawing my little hairs that way it
looks a little bit more natural rather
than it looking too filmed in once my
brows are done I'm gonna be doing some
heavy juicy highlighting with my age
rewind concealer in light with a real
techniques brush I'm just going to be
blending that highlight in to the rest
of my foundation for a nice seamless
look and I am blending this really
really well because I don't want it to
look obvious that I have any
highlighting or whatever all that kind
of stuff because I know Kim's
highlighting and contouring is usually
really obvious but in this particular
picture I honestly looked at it and I
couldn't see much but contouring or
anything so I want it to be quite soft
hence why I'm going to be doing powder
contouring and not cream so there looks
a little bit more soft
I'm obviously applying my EOS lip-balm
because I know Kim loves that so I
thought I just pop that in for this look
as well I'm gonna be applying my CC
color correction powder by Mac in the
yellow I love applying this all over it
just makes it look so nice and smooth
and it sets it beautifully while still
allowing your natural glow to you come
through then I'm gonna be taking a Real
Techniques contour brush and I'm taking
hoola and I'm just going to lightly
contour under my cheekbones and around
the outer circumference of my face when
I'm done with that I am also going to be
taking a Bahama Mama by the balm I love
saying that and I'm gonna be applying
that into the deeper hollows of my
cheeks just to give that a little bit
more of an effect
so I'm just applying that into the
deeper hollows of my cheeks I'm not
taking much of this because it is quite
a dark matte bronzer so once I am done
with that I'm going to take my mary-lou
manizer by the balm and applying this
all over my cheekbones with a big fluffy
brush and this looks really scary at
first but the more you start to blend it
in the more and normal it starts to look
it is like seriously guys this highlight
area is no joke it comes out so
pigmented so you really need to work
that into the skin a little bit to make
sure that it looks a little bit more
natural just taking off that lip balm
that I apply just to exfoliate the lips
a little bit and I'm going to start with
my lip liner which is a dark brown lip
liner by Mac and the reason why I chose
a dark brown rather than a normal mid
Brown is because I want to make my lips
look a little bit fuller than what they
actually do and going with a darker lip
liner can often make the outsides of the
lips look further in and then I want to
make my the inside of my lips look fab
out basically it's like contouring for
your lips a little bit but it's gonna
look quite natural once I blend it all
together so I'm just gonna be drawing
slightly outside my lip line it's it's
so slightly you can see guys it's not
like a huge amount but the tiny little
bit that I go above really makes it
different obviously my lips aren't as
voluptuous as Kim's unfortunately
I'm using quite a light hand as well and
that's just to make sure that the color
doesn't come out too dark then I'm
taking one of my favorite Tom Ford
lipsticks I'm a bit song for crazy
recently but this is a really nice
creamy texture which is why I chose this
lipstick I I know it's quite difference
between the lighter color and the darker
color but I am going to blend that
together with my finger which is gonna
make it look a little bit more ombre
then to finish off I'm going to be
applying my NYX butter gloss and I
believe this is creme brulee the most
popular and I'm gonna be applying that
all over the lips to get that nice
buttery look that Kim has in her picture
once you are finished that guys your
look is complete thank you so much for
watching guys I hope that you enjoyed
the finished leg and I will see you
again in one of my next videos take care
