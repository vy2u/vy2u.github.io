today's makeup tutorial is inspired by
Kylie Jenner's makeup she recently
posted a picture of this beautiful
makeup I just knew I had to recreate
so we're gonna get started with this
skin today and to prime my skin I'm
gonna be using the Make Up For Ever step
1 smoothing primer and I'm just gonna be
using my fingers to blend this into my
face I mainly like to apply it into the
center of my face because that's where
the majority of my problematic areas are
and this just smooths everything for our
foundation and the foundation I'm gonna
be using today is the Studio Fix fluid
foundation the Carla I use is in NC 40
and I'm just gonna be applying this all
over my skin and blending it in with my
Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge this is a really nice foundation
it's very flawless and it does give off
a really nice matte finish and because
Kylie's makeup usually has a matte
finish i wanted to replicate that and
this foundation i think is just perfect
to replicate Kylie's skin
for my eyes I'm gonna be prepping them
using my soft ochre Paint Pot as always
I always like to use this just to cancel
out all the colors of our natural lid
and also to make the eye shadows appear
a lot brighter the eyeshadow palette I'm
going to be using today is the Vegas
lights palette from a makeup geek and
the first color I'm going to be using is
desert sands and this is basically like
a yellow tone warm brown it's absolutely
gorgeous it reminds me a lot of
uninterrupted eyeshadow from Mac and the
whole palette in general is just
absolutely stunning so this is actually
the only eye palette I'm going to be
using today and it's just absolutely
beautiful and I'm just making sure to
apply this color into my crease and
blend it very well so just make sure
that it looks as blended as possible
they are very pigmented so be careful
not to apply too much of it I'm also
gonna be taking this color just here
which is a very dark brown food butter
Bing and I'm basically gonna be applying
this into my outer V and I'm almost
applying it in a V that's shining
upwards to give us that really nice
turned upwards shape and I'm making sure
to blend this color very very well also
next I'm going to be taking this L'Oreal
eyeshadow when I looked at the picture I
thought of this eyeshadow straight away
because the look of the eyeshadow just
reminded me of the formula of this
eyeshadow it kind of had glitter running
through it and the color was very
similar also so I think this eyes shadow
is very similar to what Kylie's makeup
artist must have used so I applied that
all over my lid and now I've taken the
Mirage from that same Vegas lights
palette and I'm going to be applying
this onto our inner corner just to open
up our eyes a little bit I'm also going
to be applying a wing of eyeliner a very
very small flick at the end of our I
just to lift our eyes upwards because
Kylie has these really beautiful almond
eyes eyes are such a beautiful shape I
really wanted to try and give the
impression that my eyes turned upwards a
little bit more so the eyeliner will
just kind of pull our eyes upwards a
little bit
I'm then gonna be applying some mascara
and my false lashes the false lashes i'm
using i customized myself i do have a
video on how i customized my lashes so i
will pop that in the description box and
i will also put all the details of the
lashes that are used in there as well
for my concealer i'm using my NARS
radiant creamy concealer in custard
right underneath my eyes and then i'm
gonna be taking a Maybelline fit me
concealer and be applying it on the rest
of my face I'm using it underneath my
eyes just underneath where we placed the
NARS concealer I've done the bridge of
my nose on my forehead and on my chin
I'm also going to be blending that in
with the same sponge we use to apply our
foundation
I'm also using my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush to get into all the areas that my
sponge couldn't reach and also with that
same sponge I'm gonna be baking my under
eyes using the Mac CC powder in neutral
eyes and I'm just gonna be using it to
bake my under eye I'm gonna leave it
there to set just so that it can give us
that really nice bright effect and
whatever's left over on the sponge I use
to set the rest of my face and I'm also
gonna be brushing that away with my Real
Techniques setting brush and also you
want to make sure that there are no
powder particles sitting on your face
so I'm gonna be taking a big powder
brush and just making sure that all the
particles are brushed away then to
finish off the eyes I'm gonna be
applying a black kohl pencil into my
waterline and Kylie actually didn't have
much on the bottom lashline she only had
a little bit of eye shadow but no
mascara so we're going to be doing
exactly the same as she done so I'm just
applying that black eyeliner into the
waterline and also on the inner corner
of our eye I'm bronzing my face but not
too much because I didn't want to give
across too much of a bronzed face I mean
I do want to look like I have color but
Kylie never really has much going on
with her bronzer I mean it is bronze but
not too much so I just wanted to kind of
keep it you know bronzed but not too
bronzed I used a little bit of that
bronzer on a smaller brush to get into
the very hollow parts of our cheeks I'm
gonna be taking some more of that desert
sands color and be applying it onto our
bottom lashline and not applying mascara
because Kylie did not have any mascara
on her bottom lashline I'm also gonna be
highlighting the tops of my cheeks with
my Becca opal highlighter this just
gives us that gorgeous glow and just
makes us look completely flawless and
sunkissed which is my favorite wave work
to be honest only we could look like
that all the time for the lips this is
the star of the show in my opinion her
lips were like this really gorgeous gray
pink color so what I did was line my
lips with Mac's tone lip liner I'm over
lining my lips a little bit this gives
my lips that fuller appearance it's not
your cup of tea you definitely don't
have to over line your lips
I'm gonna be using underground lipstick
from Gerard cosmetics and I'm gonna be
mixing that with Rodeo Drive lipstick
just to give it that little hint of that
dusky pink color and because these
lipsticks aren't completely matte I went
over with a translucent loose powder to
make the color look completely matte she
must have been wearing a liquid lipstick
or something like that so to make any
lipstick look like a liquid lipstick you
can apply some translucent loose powder
and it just gives about super matte
finish and then I felt that my lips kind
of lost definition after applying that
powder to my lips so then I applied some
more lip liner onto the outer corners of
my lips so guys that is the finished
look I am absolutely in love with this
makeup look I think it is so gorgeous
and I know I recently done a Kylie
Jenner inspired makeup look not too long
ago but her makeup is just always on
point I felt like I needed to recreate
this one I hope that you guys enjoyed if
