today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this kylie jenner inspired a
makeup look
she will this look to the golden glow
boards and I just absolutely love it so
if you guys do want to see how I
achieved it and just keep on watching
so I'm gonna start off by priming my
eyes using some concealer this is the
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm
just applying it all over my eyes and
blending it in with a brush just so that
it's evenly blended and it can act as a
base for the eye shadow we're gonna be
using the eye shadow palette I'm using
today is the morphe 35o palette and I'm
gonna be taking this warm beige shade
first of all and we're gonna be taking
this on a blending brush and applying
this as our first transition shade not
only is this nice and light and will
help all the colors we're gonna be
applying after this blend evenly but
it's nice and warm I definitely notice
that Kylie's look did have a nice amount
of warmth and bronze enos in it next I'm
going to be taking this warm brown
yellow toned shade from the palette and
we're going to be applying this deeper
within the crease to start building up
more of that warmth in the crease and
also to start building that definition
and almost a little hint of smokiness in
the crease Kylie's local really wasn't
that dark but we do want to apply a
little bit of a dark brown to really
give it that nice amount of smokiness so
I'm applying this with a slightly more
pointed brush to really focus this color
on the crease area and I definitely did
notice that this color did come quite
high above the crease so I do want to
start bringing a little bit higher than
we usually would above the crease area
I do also want to be applying this into
the outer V area as well to prepare it
for the dark brown we're gonna be
applying next taking this dark brown
shade from that same palette I'm gonna
be applying this on the outer V and we
want to start booting up that smokiness
like I said this is the darkest color
we're gonna be applying it's a really
soft dark brown it's nothing too harsh
or too black in a sense it doesn't look
like a black Brown so this just makes it
look like a really soft and effortless
smokey eye and you do want to again take
it up quite high above the crease but
you make sure to blend the edges as much
as you can again go back into this color
as many times as you need to to make
sure that that color is nice and opaque
in the crease I'm gonna be wiping away
these sides of my eye because I did
notice that kylie's I was nice and
straight and then I'm gonna be taking
this a bronzy shade from the palette and
applying it onto the center of my lid
and then I am taking another gold shade
and applying it more onto the inner
corner of my lid this just gives it a
little bit more brightness towards the
inner corner and I could definitely see
that Kylie's lid was quite shimmery
next I'm gonna be taking some natural
false lashes just because I do feel like
Kylie was either wearing just mascara or
really really natural false lashes so I
did want to kind of recreate that look
but I don't have really long lashes to
begin with so I'm taking these lashes
from a makeup addiction I'm just
applying them to my top lash line and
also applying some mascara to make them
blend in a little bit better to my
natural lashes next I'm just gonna be
priming my skin using my Too Faced
hangover primer and I'm just applying
this all over my skin just to give my
skin a nice amount of hydration before
foundation and the foundation I'm taking
is the ex1 invisi wear and I'm just
blending that in with this morphe kabuki
brush and I really like this kabuki
brush it's from their new elite
collection I'll have the numbers listed
down below as always but it's just a
really nice brush blended everything in
flawlessly I'm also just gonna be
highlighting all the areas I would like
to bring forward and also conceal so I'm
just highlighting under my eyes onto my
forehead and also onto my chin and I'm
just gonna be blending in at those
concealer areas using this littles away
about kabuki brush
I'm now just sitting my face using my
soap and glory instant retouch of powder
and I'm just using this new brush I am
obsessed with it's one of the more feet
elite collection brushes as well and it
just set my face so beautifully I will
list again the numbers of all the
brushes and products down below as
always but this brush in particular is
just my new obsession
I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows
off-camera but I will link my tutorial
down below next I'm just gonna be taking
this brown eyeliner and applying it to
my waterline and also applying it onto
the bottom lashline I'm just gonna be
smudging this out and diffusing it with
some of the eyeshadow we used on the
outer V of our eye we want this to look
nice and smoky but we don't it to look
overly harsh so using this brown
eyeshadow we'll just diffuse it so there
looks nice and blended on the bottom
lashline
I'm gonna be bronzing my skin now using
this shade from the shade and light
palette from Kat Von D when it came to
Kylie's skin it looked really nice and
glowy but it didn't look contoured or
overly sculpted so I'm just applying
this bronzer with a big Brush in the
areas where we would usually contour
this will just lightly sculpt the face
while still giving us that really nice
glow that just surrounds the perimeter
of the skin and now I'm just using this
bronze highlight from Bobbi Brown and
just applying it onto the tops of my
cheekbone to finish off and give us that
gorgeous glow to finish off the look I'm
just gonna be applying some
stripped-down lip liner from Mac this is
just a nice neutral Brown and I'm just
applying it all along my lip line to
give us that nice amount of fullness and
to really define our shape of our lips
next I'm just gonna be applying this lip
lacquer from Rimmel just to give it that
really nice creamy nude lip I'm just
gonna be blending the end with my finger
and because it was a little bit too
light I just went on top of it with
these stripped down at lip pencil and
just ran it all over the lips to give it
a nice Brown time
