channel so today I have another make up
mistakes to avoid and today we're going
to be focusing on liquid lipstick now
liquid lipsticks are so popular and they
can be a little bit hard to work with
video is just a few little tips and
tricks to maybe help some issues that
you've been dealing with I'm not saying
that there's any right or wrong way to
do this and say anything bad about the
way anyone does liquid lipstick or any
style of doing your lips I love to over
line my lips so I'm not judging anyone
on the way they do it I'm just giving
you guys some helpful tips if you would
like to know them so so without further
ado we're going to get into this video
on how to avoid liquid mistakes mistakes
okay so the first mistake I definitely
recommend you guys avoiding is applying
that couldn't lipstick straight to dry
lips now this can definitely happen to
me around the winter time and this is it
absolutely no lip balm know that
exfoliation and to be honest with you it
just doesn't feel right and a lot of the
time it looks dry and can get dry
throughout the day very very quickly why
I recommend you doing is taking some lip
scrub this one is from lush it smells
and tastes amazing
Organic so you can actually eat it I try
not to though because it's kind of got
like dead skin on it and stuff I just
rub this on my lips and it just takes
all the dead skin off and then I take
some lip balm this one is just like a
really moisturizing one I apply onto my
lips and then I just blot off the excess
something else I would recommend you
guys doing as far as prepping goes is to
apply some foundation to your lips
before hand makes the liquid lipstick
appear much more true to color because
you have a nice equal base along with
your skin tone rather than it being like
your pink lips showing through
underneath the liquid lipstick so
something else I definitely recommend
you guys to avoid is applying your lip
liner after you've applied your liquid
lipstick now when it comes to normal
lipstick this is a really a rule I don't
feel like this applies to actual normal
lipstick but the liquid lipstick it is
very very very hard to do and this is
exactly why once you apply liquid
lipstick and it is semi or fully dry lip
liner just does not blend into it
because it's almost turns into a solid
on your lip it just can't blend and even
though I'm using a really dark pink lip
liner it just won't blend so now I'm
doing it the opposite way around and
applying the lip liner first and you
guys
I see such a difference so when I apply
the lip liner first it means I can go
around the outside of my lips I'm over
lining my lips a little bit because I
personally like to do that and I also go
around the outer corners as well so the
liquid lipstick have something to blend
into this definitely applies especially
if you're applying a light to lipstick
and blending it into a darker one this
is what I do almost every single day so
it's definitely something I've won once
you actually apply on the quit lipstick
it's very very easy to blend into the
lip liner and I like to use my finger
just to Pat it into a lip liner and that
will you just get a really nice subtle
blend and you have applied two different
colors but we blend in really seamlessly
and I think this applies also to lip
liners that are a very similar color to
the lipstick just because I feel like
they don't transfer really well on top
of a liquid lipstick okay so another
mistake I would recommend you guys
avoiding is applying too much liquid
lipstick all at once now liquid lipstick
is one of them things where if you apply
too much of suck with a lot and then if
it drives too quickly then you cannot
end up with a stick kind of lumpy mess
on your lips and it's not comfortable
and it just feels a bit gross honestly
you just want that clear lipstick to
feel comfortable you can totally use
this to however you want it to look like
but when it comes to actually applying
your liquid lipstick I would definitely
recommend doing it in thin layers that
way you have a nice opaque color without
it feeling really uncomfortable and you
can stop the moment you know that you
have enough liquid lipstick on your lip
okay so the next tip for this is to
avoid that horrible line you get on the
inside of your lip when you apply like
too much liquid lipstick there or just
any like liquid lipstick I find you get
it with a lot of nude like lipsticks
which I really like to wear and have
finally found a cure to this it's
amazing so what you want to do is make
sure again that you're not applying too
much of it and you don't apply the
liquid lipstick too close on that area
too thickly you kind of just want to Pat
it onto the inside of the lip so that
the area closest to the inside of your
mouth isn't covered with too much
product and then when you actually have
that dry you want to go on the inside of
your lip with a little bit of a more
moisturizing lips
of the same color and this doesn't have
to be something that is like a really
shiny lipstick I use the NYX soft matte
lip cream in a similar shade and just
apply it onto the inside of my lips I
find that really drying that good
lipsticks leave that inside mark way
more and the more moisturizing one's
done so if you guys have been suffering
with this try out that tip is if it
really really does help
now with normal lipsticks to avoid
things getting on our teeth we tend to
use the finger method where you kind of
put your fingers in your mouth and pull
them out to avoid it getting on your
teeth so instead of getting liquid
lipstick all over your teeth and getting
a ring because you use your fingers I
would recommend you cooling this face
now I know it looks pretty silly but
doing this actually makes your liquid
lipsticks dry onto the inside of your
lips and prevents not only the line but
also prevents because it sticks getting
onto your teeth as well you look
ridiculous
but this is an incredible tip I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
