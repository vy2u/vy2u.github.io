going to be doing a tag video for you I
think I've done one tag video before and
I want to get into the mode of doing
more tag videos and getting to interact
with you guys and being able to share
what I love with you more
rather than sort of just doing tutorials
obviously as you can tell by the title
today I'm going to be doing the lip
addict tag and there is a couple of
questions that is preset and I'm just
gonna answer them and show you a couple
of products so question number one is
what is your favorite lip balm or
treatment so I had trouble picking this
one I wanted to pick two it has to be
between the lush bubblegum lip scrub
this is like a cult favorite one loves
this this is so good for dry and cracked
lips
it's sugar and castor sugar
and organic jojoba oil so that's really
good and moisturizing for your lips so
it just removes all the dead skin and
makes it really really soft and smooth
for lip gloss or lipstick application
and the other option was I know I'm a
bit of like a bandwagon with this one
but the EOS your your EOS lip balms
these are really really nice they're not
you know fully amazing like they're not
like crazy like everyone needs one I've
got three of them I know that's a bit
you know excessive but I love the
different flavors I think this one is
passionfruit I think this is one of my
favorites and it's really moisturizing I
really do love it I think it's one of
the best lip balms to use for a primer
as well because often lip balms are very
glossy and this one seems to be one of
the most mattes so I quite like it for
applying underneath drawing lipsticks
when I'm applying either a matte
lipstick or something else that can be
fairly drying to the nips I really like
to apply something like this so those
tend to be my favorite lip balms of
treatments and yeah I use them both a
lot so I do really love them the next
question is what is your favorite eye
catching red so I'm not a huge red
wearer as you could tell I mean if I do
wear a red it's not that often the most
eye-catching red that I have ever
actually tried or worn or tried on
someone else is Mac Ruby whoa there's a
reason why this is the most
lipstick by Mac because it's so super
matte so it's very eye-catching to the
fact that it has no shine it's very flat
so when it's on the lips it just catches
so much attention and it's the purest
form of red I think I've seen so it's
when I say purest form of red I mean
it's just like an untouched red so it's
very bright and vibrant so this is Ruby
wow this is so popular obviously I work
for Mac so I see how much it sells and I
love it myself as well so I'm gonna pick
a classic Marilyn red this is the red
that I would go for number three is the
most luxury and drugstore product so my
favorite luxury products I'm like I
can't choose I'm really I'm the most
indecisive person ever so for me it was
between the wires our lipsticks or the
tomforde lipsticks I only actually have
one or two Wiseau lipsticks I have four
at the moment of the tomforde lipsticks
and I think I'm gonna go for Tom Ford
the reason being is that this just gives
a lot more color payoff rather than the
West L Rouge but up to confidence it
sticks could there a lot glossy ER and
if I go for anything usually it tends to
have more color in it rather than gloss
so I do love it and it does smell
amazing but these ones win it for me I
have four colors and I will swatch them
in this video and at the moment I have
nude vanilla vanilla suede blush nude
and Spanish pink so they're all nudes
and Pink's surprise surprise it's me so
yeah they're amazing I think they're the
best high-end they are extremely
expensive but they are really worth it
the packaging is so luxurious as you can
see they're just very heavy and very
just luxurious you can feel how
expensive they are when you're putting
it on you just feel like a boss so now
for my favorite drugstore products I do
have a little bit more than this but
these are absolutely amazing these are
the NYX butter glosses oh my gosh these
are amazing for the price that you pay
these are amazing quality they are so
buttery not sticky at all and they give
a really nice medium coverage of color
so I don't have anything brighter
vibrant again surprise surprise
but the amount of color they actually
give is so lovely and the smell is just
like
amazing absolutely amazing it smells
like vanilla frosting like it's so nice
it's absolutely amazing so these have to
be my favorite drugstore product they're
not found everywhere in the UK you can't
just go into a drugstore and just find
them this is a bit controversial because
you can't actually walk into a drugstore
and find these but they are drugstore
priced so technically yeah these are my
favorite drugstore products and if I had
to pick one there I mean there are a
couple more but these are just amazing
but I half of these are tiramisu apple
strudel peaches and cream Eclair and
meringue I do have a couple more but
again I can't really find them my vanity
is like all messed up at the moment so I
just I like can't be bothered even look
so these are the ones that I could just
pull out and their main number four is
your best MAC lipstick so if you know me
you'll know I love a nude and you also
know the honey laughs by Mac is my
favorite I mean you probably already
know if you watch my videos consistently
anyway I'm wearing it at the moment it
is just the best color for me like the
best nude and I love a map news usually
and I do love picking a Ghassan as well
but usually if I just want to work on
something it would be honey love so this
is what honey love looks like I'm down
to the brim of this like I use this
constantly as you can tell and yeah this
color is just amazing number five most
disappointing lip product so I find this
a little bit hard to actually think of
because usually everything I buy I make
do of like if I don't like something
color wise for myself I'll just throw it
in my kit and everything else like I
look into a lot before purchasing so I
like check reviews and yeah like I'll
make sure I'm gonna like it before I
actually buy it but I could I actually
found one so the one thing that I
actually I'm extremely disappointed in
is the Jordana easy liner for lips in 20
everyone raves about this and it's
American we don't I've never heard of
Jordana before watching YouTube everyone
talks about it so I was like okay
everyone like raves about it so let me
just check and let me buy it so I bought
it and compared to like the NYX
retractable lip blindness that you guys
know I use I was expecting it to be
fairly similar but when I kind of apply
the color it just it has no pigmentation
what or not enough pigmentation anyway
so but I don't know I don't know if it's
just me being like I don't know I just
don't really like it that much like it
doesn't show so much like if I'm gonna
compare it to the NYX one that I always
use like it's so much more opaque and
that's more of what I want in a lip
liner a lip liner is meant to define the
lips and I feel like if something is
sort of translucent a little bit it's
not going to define your lip so that's
the only product I could come up with
that was a little bit disappointing but
it wasn't expensive anyway it's just
something that oh boy and I don't use so
yeah it's not my disappointing I don't
like saying bad things about brands but
it's just not that great that was the
most disappointing thing I've had my dog
is making noises number six lip liner
yes or no so if you know me again yes oh
my god yes like I cannot apply lipstick
without applying a lip do I know like
right now I'm wearing a lip liner
holy crap yes I need to like I need need
to it is necessity from use acrylic
liner like my lips just fill bare
without one whatever color like even
like a nude for example I need to wear
one because it just feels like it
defines my lips so much more so that's
the reason why I would say yes I know a
lot of people like would rather not but
for me oh my gosh like I need one number
7 is favorite gloss I had a bit of
trouble picking this one because I know
you used to be a Gosper and I'm not
really now like I won't be caught in
gloss every single time but whenever I
go to pick a gloss which is going to be
nude usually I always tend to go for the
Gerard cosmetics butter cream and I
apply it and every single time I apply
it I fall in love with it all over again
it is amazing I'm sure you've heard of
them they are absolutely incredible the
brand is just so much value for money
and it's just incredibly amazingly
textured it's so hydrating
sticky and buttery and it just gives the
most amazing coverage of color for
example the other colors the brighter
ones their colors are just so vibrant so
this is just 100% my favorite it also
has a light on it so that you can see
when it works it has a mirror on the
side as well so I just it is amazing so
and last but not least something else
so I was like again struggling I was
like what haven't I not mentioned that I
love and these are from Kiko these are
the pencil lip glosses again I have
about five of these but I just can't
find them just don't ask so the colors
that I have at the moment are number 7
and number 8 they are a pencil in a
pencil form I'm trying to then black not
sharpened I'm really sorry that I get a
pencil form that is just sharpened with
a jumbo pencil sharpener and it has a
glossy texture with the pigmentation of
a lipstick now I think this is genius
it's really really good value for money
they're about three to four pounds from
Kiko and the color that comes out of it
is just like how how does this happen I
think it's one of the most perfect
things to take out with you so for
example when I'm going just on what I've
got a small clutch with me I'll probably
just take my jarred cosmetics lip gloss
and one of these just a touch-up and
that is it I feel like that's enough for
me
but yeah I just feel like these are
amazing just to top up here and there so
I thought I'd just mention those because
these are really really good value for
money and there's such a clever idea so
I really do love these as well so guys
that's the end of this tag video I hope
