i'm going to be doing a tag video for
you I think I've done one tag video
before and I want to get into the mode
of doing more tag videos and getting to
interact with you guys and being able to
share what I love with you more rather
than sort of just doing tutorials
obviously as you can tell by the title
today I'm going to be doing the lip
addict tag and there is a couple of
questions that is preset and i'm just
going to answer them and show you a
couple of products so question number
one is what is your favorite lip balm or
treatment so I had trouble picking this
one I wanted to pick two it has to be
between the lush bubble gum lip scrub
this is like a cult favorite one loves
this this is so good for dry and cracked
lips it's sugar and castor sugar and
organic jojoba oil so that's really good
and moisturizing for your lips so it
just removes all the dead skin and makes
it really really soft and smooth for lip
gloss or lipstick application and the
other option was I know I'm a bit of
like a bandwagoner with this one but the
EOS lip but your your cos lip balms
these are really really nice they're not
you know fully amazing like they're not
like crazy like everyone needs one I've
got three of them I know that's a bit
you know excessive but I love the
different flavors I think this one is
passion fruit I think this is one of my
favorites and it's really moisturizing I
really do love it I think it's one of
the best lip balms to use for a primer
as well because often lip balms are very
glossy and this one seems to be one of
the most mats so I quite like it for
applying underneath drawing lipsticks
when i'm applying either a mac lipstick
or something else that can be fairly
drying to the lips i really like to
apply something like this so those tend
to be my favorite lip balms or
treatments and yeah i use them both a
lot so I do really love them the next
question is what is your favorite eye
catching Red so i'm not a huge red where
r as you could tell i mean if i do wear
a red it's not that often the most
eye-catching read that i have ever
actually tried or worn or tried on
someone else is mac ribby whoa there's a
reason why this is the most popular
stick by Mac because it's so super matte
so it's very eye-catching to the fact
that it has no shine it's very flat so
when it's on the lips it just catches so
much attention and it's the purest form
of red i think i've seen so it's when I
say purest form of red I mean it's just
like an untouched red so it's very
bright and vibrant so this is Ruby wow
this is so popular obviously I work for
Mac so I see how much it sells and I
love it myself as well so i'm going to
pick a classic Marilyn bread this is the
red that I would go for number three is
the most luxury and drugstore product so
my favorite luxury products i'm like i
can't choose i'm really i'm the most
indecisive person ever so for me it was
between the YSL lipsticks or the tom
ford lipsticks i only actually have one
or two why so lipsticks i have four at
the moment of the tom ford lipsticks and
i think i'm going to go for tom ford the
reason being is that this just gives a
lot more color payoff rather than the
west l roseville up to comprehend sit
lipsticks because they're a lot glossy
ER and if i go for anything usually it
tends to have more color in it rather
than gloss so I do love it and it does
smell amazing but these ones win it for
me and I have four colors and I will
swatch them in this video and at the
moment I have nude vanilla vanilla suede
blush nude and Spanish pink so they're
all nudes and Pink's up surprise
surprise it's me so yeah and they're
amazing I think they're the best
high-end they are extremely expensive
but they are really worth it the
packaging is so luxurious as you can see
they're just very heavy and very
luxurious you can feel how expensive
they are when you're putting it on you
just feel like a boss so now for my
favorite drugstore products I do have a
little bit more than this but these are
absolutely amazing these are the NYX
butter glosses oh my gosh these are
amazing for the price that you pay these
are amazing quality they are so buttery
not sticky at all and they give a really
nice medium coverage of color so I don't
have anything bright vibrant again
surprise surprise but the amount of
color they actually give is so lovely
and the smell is just like
amazing like absolutely amazing ah it
smells like vanilla frosting like it's
so nice it's absolutely amazing so these
have to be my favorite drugstore product
they're not found everywhere in the UK
you can't just go into a drugstore and
just find them this is a bit
controversial because you can't actually
walk into a drug store and find these
but they are drugstore price so
technically yeah these are my favorite
drugstore products and if I had to pick
one I mean there are a couple more but
these are just amazing but I have these
are tiramisu apple strudel peaches and
cream Eclair and meringue I do have a
couple more but again I can't really
find them and my vanity is like all
messed up at the moment so I just I like
can't be bothered even look so these are
the ones that I could just pull out and
their main number four is your best mac
lipstick so if you know me you'll know I
love a nude and you also know that holy
love by Mac is my favorite I mean you
probably already know if you watch my
videos consistently anyway I'm wearing
at the moment it is just the best color
for me like the best nude and I love a
map news usually and I do love picking a
ghassan as well but usually if I just
want to back on something it would be
honey love so this is what honey laughs
looks like i'm down to the brim of this
like I use this constantly as you can
tell em and yeah this color is just
amazing number five most disappointing
lip product so I found this a little bit
hard to actually think of because
usually everything i buy i make do of
like if i don't like something color
wise for myself i'll just throw it in my
kit and everything else like I look into
a lot before purchasing so I'll like
check reviews and yeah like I'll make
sure I'm gonna like it before I actually
buy it but I could I actually found one
so the one thing that I actually I'm
extremely disappointed in is the Jordana
easy line of Phillips in Tony everyone
raves about this and it's American we
don't I've never heard of Jordana before
watching YouTube everyone talks about it
so I was like okay everyone like raves
about it so let me just check and let me
buy it so I bought it and compared to
like the Knicks
retractable lip liners that you guys
know i use i was expecting it to be
fairly similar but when I kind of apply
the color it just it has no pigmentation
what or not enough pigmentation anyway
so i don't know i don't know if it's
just me being like i don't know i just
don't really like it that much like it
doesn't show so much like if i'm going
to compare it to the knicks one that i
always use like it's so much more opaque
and that's more of what I want in a lip
liner a lip liner is meant to define the
lips and I feel like if something is
sort of translucent a little bit it's
not going to define your lip so that's
the only product I could come up with
that work there was a little bit
disappointing but it wasn't expensive
anyway it's just something that I bought
and I don't use so yeah it's not my
disappointing I don't like saying bad
things about brands but it's just not
that great that was the most
disappointing thing I've had my dog is
making noises number six lip liner yes
or no so if you know me again yes oh my
god yes like I cannot apply lipstick
without applying a lip liner like right
now I'm wearing a lip liner holy crap
yes I need to like I need need to it is
necessity for me to my lip liner like my
lips just feel bear with that one
whatever color like even like a nude for
example I need to WoW one because it
just feels like it defines my lips so
much more so that's the reason why I
would say yes and a lot of people like
would rather not but for me oh my gosh
like I need one I actually need one
number seven is favorite gloss I had a
bit of trouble picking this one because
I know you used to be a gaas person and
I'm not really now like I won't be
caught in gloss every single time but
whenever I go to pick a gloss which is
going to be nude usually I always tend
to go for the Gerard cosmetics
buttercream and I apply it and every
single time I apply it I fall in love
with it all over again it is amazing I'm
sure you've heard of them they are
absolutely incredible the brand is just
so much value for money and it's just
incredibly amazingly texture
it's so hydrating and not sticky and
battery and it just gives the most
amazing coverage of color for example
the other colors the brighter ones their
colors are just so vibrant so this is
just one hundred percent my favorite it
also has a light on it so that you can
see when it was it has a mirror on the
side as well so I just it is amazing so
last but not least something else so I
was like again struggling I was like
what I haven't I not mentioned that i
love and these are from Kiko these are
the pencil lip glosses again I have
about five of these but I just can't
find them just don't ask so the colors
that I have at the moment our number 7
and number 8 they are a pencil in a
pencil form I'm trying to like then
black not sharpened I'm really sorry
that I get a pencil form that is just
sharpened with a jumbo pencil sharpener
and it has a glossy texture with the
pigmentation of a lipstick now I think
this is genius is really a really good
value for money they're about three to
four pounds from Kiko and the color that
comes out of it is just like how how
does this happen think is one of the
most perfect things to take out with you
so for example when I'm going just on
what I've got a small clutch with me
I'll probably just take my geral
cosmetics lip gloss and one of these
just a touch up and that is it I feel
like that's enough for me and think yeah
I just feel like these are amazing just
to top up here and there so I thought I
just mentioned those because he's a
really really good value for money and
there's such a clever idea so I really
do love these as well so guys that's the
end of this tag video I hope that you
