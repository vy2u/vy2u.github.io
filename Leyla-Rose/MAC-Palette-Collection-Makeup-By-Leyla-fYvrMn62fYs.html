today I'm going to be doing with you
another collection video today I'm going
to be talking through and showing you
guys my Mac palette collection I have
three eyeshadow palettes that I've
customized and put the colors in myself
and I have to face palettes and after
seeing my full makeup collection which I
will link in the description box below
so that you guys can check out my full
makeup collection I promised you guys I
would do a couple more in depth videos
just showing you guys and explaining the
colors I picked and just showing you the
different colors and just explain them a
little bit more obviously my makeup
collection video was very long and I
didn't have time to kind of describe
each color so I want to do them in
separate videos you guys have been
requesting for a really long time i
freelance a makeup kit video I'm gonna
do that I promise so the first palette
that I have is this one you guys aren't
gonna be able to see if that well but
I'm going to show you a close-up of this
so this is my matte palette I arrange
them in order of like lightest to
darkest the first one is black type and
this is a very light matte cream it's
almost like an off-white it is very very
light and very pigmented
this one is Brule this is this slightly
deeper cream tone it has a little bit
more of a flesh tone to it whereas the
other one was more of an off-white and
but this is really nice it's like a nice
natural skin tone so it's nice to have
just what I can pull over base color the
next one in that palette is wedge and
wedge is like a cool turned brown and I
like to use this as a transition color
this is a really nice for fair skin and
you can also use wedge to contour as
well especially if you have a more fair
skin tone because it's got that cool
undertone you can use it to contour the
next one is cork which used to be one of
my all-time favorites it's a little bit
more warmer than wedge and it's a little
bit darker as well you can use this as a
transition shade or a little bit more of
a lighter crease color next is charcoal
Brown and again this is just another
matte Brown just slightly darker than
cork and it's a little bit more of a
cool tone of that quark it's like a
darker version of wedge she's got a
softer more buttery consistency but it's
really nice and I really like the way
that it feels on the next row is texture
texture is one of my favorites is a very
warm toned Brown this
actually isn't completely in math unlike
all the other colors it's got a slight
shimmer in it but it's nothing too
noticeable you can still use it as a
transition shade are you still alive but
using this as a transition shade I love
using this on wires just to create that
really nice warmth as it gets up into
the crease this is brown script and this
is a darker matte reddish-brown this is
very similar to an estate of the ability
Hills Morocco Morocco has that kind of
reddish brown burgundy kind of feel to
it and this is very similar next is
Swiss chocolate Swiss chocolate is a red
turned brown this is a lot darker than a
brown script and it is a little bit more
of that burgundy rub of that home red
although it does have a strong under
turn off warmth it doesn't look cool
like some of the other brands it's kind
of hard to explain because the next
couple of colors are very similar but
they've got a red turn but they also
look like a brown still yeah they kind
of like in the middle the next one is
Foley it looks a lot more red tone than
Swiss chocolate it's a little bit darker
but it's amazing and it looks amazing on
warm toned skin the next one is in bark
and this is a darker version of Swiss
chocolate it still has that dark reddish
tone to it but it's a lot deeper and you
can create a lot more definition next is
copper plate this is a very great term
to light brown this is really good if
you want to go for something that's a
little bit more cool tones instead of
the warm toned Browns that we had before
this is cool joy and I don't tend to go
for this color that much it is a really
really nice Brown just like a normal
brown it's not cool and it's not warm
either it just has like a really nice
medium tone but it is quite dark so it's
good to add definition to the crease
next is hand written and this is like a
slightly lighter version than embark it
has that warm turn again it's just not
as reddish as embark and I do like using
this for the crease again the roar just
math Browns that all very similarly to
burnish you can mix it between them
anyway you don't need to have them all
but this is a great color as well to add
to the crease the second last one in the
palette is mystery and mystery is the
second darkest Brown that man do it's
just a little bit cooler that way you
can use it in the eyebrows and stuff
like that
it doesn't look too warm toned or of
course you can use it in the crease if
you want even more cooler look then the
last one from that palette is brown
brown is the darkest Brown that Matt
could do at the moment and this is just
a dark cool brown that is like matte
brown matte palette done don't tend to
reach for this that much myself if I
ever just need like one thing from this
palette I might just use it but mainly
this goes into my freelance care
next I palette is the neutral shimmery
shades the majority of these are
shimmery and to be honest they all
pretty much look warm because the colors
that I tend to use most often Holborn I
don't have any greys in here I've got a
couple of cool colors in the next
palette but all these shimmery colors I
tend to go for I usually warm but he
first color is dazzle light and this is
a very light shimmery yellow toned color
and it looks just really light and
shimmery and it's very similar to nylon
but it's just a little bit lighter and I
like to use on the inner corner and brow
bone when you want to go for that a
really nice highlighted look the next
color in that palette is all that
glitters this is incredibly popular it
is like a pink toned liked gold and this
is just a really nice all over the lid
color if you want to go for something a
little bit more natural the next one is
honesty and honesty is like one of the
colors eternity go for as much this is a
icon with more texture this is but it
does have glitter within it but it gives
more like a soft wash of color rub them
and a high-impact amount of color it's
like a soft wash with a little bit of
more like a dazzling shimmer in it but
yeah it's nice but it's nothing special
I don't regret getting in but I don't
really reach for it that often either
the next color is gleam and I love this
one this is like a pink gold like it's
really hard to explain but it's like a
pink gold with like little flecks of
glitter in it I love this one this looks
good on again like all skin tones it
looks amazing
just because when you've got that nice
warm undertone you just put this on and
it just looks like a rose gold it's
gorgeous next one is mythology mythology
is one of the first ones I bought it's
like a light oranjee shimmery color but
when you put it on it doesn't look
really really orange but it does have
like a orange of the time
but this is just gorgeous because it has
a really nice sheen to it and it's just
a very very pretty pretty color next one
is para disco this is a oranjee rose
gold it has more orange in it than a
rose tone on someone with more all any
skin tone the goal just kind of shines
through it and it just looks amazing so
on someone with a slightly deeper skin
tone than me it looks gorgeous so this
is just a must have if you are a honey
tone skin the next is expensive pink
which is just the most perfect rose gold
color it's got the perfect amount of
gold in it and the perfect amount of
Rose and it just creates the most
gorgeous rose gold color and it's just
really nice and shimmery as well so this
is lovely
the next is amber lights which is again
one of the first colors that I ever got
this is a normal yellow gold color I
used this in one of my tutorials like
eight years ago because I just used to
love gold so much and I love this one
this is just it has a very strong
undertone of yellow but this is a great
quantity of skin tones as well the next
one is the only matte color in the whole
palette just because I didn't have any
space for anywhere else and it just fit
nicely and this is rule and rule is a
really nice color but I like to use for
the transition shades that just warms up
any look it obviously is an orange but
it's not very very bright where it makes
the whole thing look completely orange
it just kind of warms up any looks if
you're doing a black smokey eye and
you're just feeling like it's not
blending out sometimes I'll just pick up
some of this and I would just warm
everything up then just make everything
look so much more seamless the next one
is coppering which it's amazing for
people with blue and green eyes it just
makes it stand out so much more because
orange is the opposite color of blue it
just makes blue eyes stand out and if
you haven't tried it yet you have blue
eyes definitely try a copper like this
it is completely orange / red toned and
it's just one of the most gorgeous
comments that Maxell it's a very unique
tone that you don't find in many other
places and I love this color
I always use it whenever someone wants
to go for something a little bit more
daring the last row I have tempting and
this is one of the only cool tones that
I have in this palette just because I
don't tend to go for it that often but
this is a cool toned Brown which has a
slight undertone of green and that's I'm
weird but it almost has a olive kind of
on its own but it doesn't look Olive I
know it's hard to explain but when I'm
looking at it it looks golden brown but
cool at the same time so it kind of
looks green but this is gorgeous and
it's great if you kind of want to go for
a brown smokey eye but you don't go for
anything too warm this is lovely
next is sable and this is a shimmery
Brown that has a pink undertone this is
a little bit less kind of olivey and
more warm in the center and it's got
pink in it and it is really nice but
again I don't really like them kind of
pink tone so I don't really go for them
that often on next is twinks and twinks
is like a reddish darker brown and this
obviously is shimmery is well this is
really pretty if you want to go for that
nice warm smoky eye and you want to go
something shimmery this is gorgeous and
it just has a really pretty sheen and it
doesn't look too heavily pigmented this
one is antiqued which is one of my
favorite favorite Browns ever it's like
a really nice warmer Brown it's a lot
warmer than twinks but it just has a
really nice red undertone to it and if
you want to go for that really nice oh
my this is the color I will pour on the
lid next one is cranberry and this is
one of my favorites because it is
exactly what it says on the tin it's a
cranberry color that is warm and it just
looks amazing again on blue and green
eyes bubbles make brown eyes pop - I
love this on blue eyes again and I just
love this color this reminds me of
autumn when it starts to like the leaves
start to change this reminds me of that
so whenever it gets to fall I love using
these kind of colors so that is the end
of the shimmery eyeshadow palette and
I'm gonna move on to the next one this
is one of my favorite palettes I own
just because look at the colors so and I
just want to let you guys know that some
of these don't pop out because I had
deported them from the little singular
eyeshadows that one limited edition and
some of them are not gonna know the
names because obviously I have you
potted them and underneath the little
pan they have
in it and once I put them in they don't
want to come out so I'll let you know if
it's limited edition because obviously
you can't get them now anyway so I'll
just point to which one's a limited
edition but I'll tell you the ones that
aren't it's the first one in the palette
is this shimmery pink color and this is
called a pink Venus this is really nice
boy nice mid color if you want to go for
that kind of sweetheart kind of look
this is gorgeous it's not too pink where
people would think of crazy but it is
really pink so you've got a kind of like
that kind of stuff I personally don't
like to grow up these kind of colors but
I've just got it there just in case
anyone ever wants sir
and the next one is sushi flower this is
a little bit more pink and less glittery
so this is good for a crease color if
you kind of want to add some pink in
there or you can use it on the lid as
well it's not completely matte I think
this is a satin finish the next is
passionate this is a matte hot pink I
used to love using this in the crease
now this is very very pigmented this is
great as a crease color obviously you
can use it all over the lid you can use
it as a blush if you want to whatever
you want to do next one is a red brick
and this is an orange with a little bit
more of a reddish undertone the next one
is called orange and this one is just a
pure orange it's very bright the next
one is sketch and this is a very very
very dark purple with little specks and
glitter in it and this you can use in
the crease because the glitter doesn't
really come out this color here is not
gonna want to come out because this is
again one of the limited edition shades
you can't get this in the pan for Maggie
potted it so that I could put it in here
cuz it's just a lot easier I don't know
the name I can't remember must have been
from something limited edition and it's
not like a memorable one but yes that
would have been something that I don't
know the name of but you can't get it
now anyway so hopefully you're not too
excited about it the next one is parfait
or more which is like a cool-toned
shimmery purple and this is quite
popular as well I used to like using
this on the middle of the lid when I
used to do like that kind of purple halo
eye the next one is creme de baile it's
like a violet color that has little
specks of gold running through it next
one is tracks and again it has the gold
flecks in it and it's a little bit more
toned down than the creme de Violette so
it looks a little bit more neutral
but it still has that purple tone to it
the next one is chrome yellow and this
is just in pure yellow matte and you can
just really play around with it and use
it for different things
this one again was a limited edition one
the next one is green smoke and this is
a green smokey color which is exactly
what it says it's shimmery and it's
green but it's quite toned down so it
was good for a smokey eyes and then
again this color is not gonna want to go
out this is kind of like a forest green
and it has a light shimmer to it but
again it was a limited edition in a
little pop i depotted it popped in and
now it doesn't want to come out because
it's like glued to the bottom of it and
this is the electric eel you can get
this in any store and this is a very
bright blue which is a matte blue and I
used to love using it underneath the eye
as like a pop of blue oh this is my
rainbow palette done I'm just gonna get
into the other two palettes which are
they face palettes I will show you guys
first my contouring palette bro is
highlighting colors and the bottom where
it's contouring colors so the first
color is emphasized which is a
well-known one everyone likes to use
this it is very share and it does
reflect like slightly and it just works
if you apply too much of it obviously
it's gonna look talky but I like to use
this just on lean burn like highest
point where I wanna make it look
highlighted and it just looks absolutely
gorgeous so this is great if you want
that nice bright under eye the next one
is soft focus which is a well-known one
as well it's almost like the banana
shade from Mac that they do and I don't
tend to go with this one as much because
it doesn't kind of highlight as much as
they want to if I ever do use this I mix
it with the emphasize and a warm white
is great to counteract under-eye circles
which sometimes I do get so this is
great if you sometimes get under-eye
circles I only really tend to use this
one I bought and I did buy this palette
when I was a little bit more tan so I
haven't use this in a while this is good
when you feel like that darkness really
shows the peachy tone in that will
slightly contract with it and reflect
away so that doesn't show and then the
bottom three shades to contour sculpt
which is great when I am lighter so I am
like medium term now I when I get to my
paleis this is a great color and this is
good for anyone that is fair because it
is very
very cool and it's just gorgeous and
just look really natural and sculpt is a
very well-known love product so this is
gorgeous and then the one that I like to
use at the moment is this one here and
this one is shade stuff this is a little
bit rule on which you guys know that I
kind of prefer a warmer contour because
I cool the one just kind of scares me a
little bit because I don't want it
- I'm not true I haven't contour today
so this would be the kind of contour
that I would want to go for definitive
and definitive is great for people that
are darker or when I'm a little bit more
toned just because it creates a lot more
definition this one is a little bit
scarier I don't go for this often
because it's fix me I don't like being
too over contoured so this is a nice
color for those who are a little bit
darker that is the highlighting and
contouring palette this is one of my
favorite palettes just because
everything is in one place is just so
sleek and it's small fish so I can take
it with me as pops and this is good the
last one is completely for my freelance
care this I don't use on myself at all
these little compartments came
completely empty and I bought the
palette as you know where we do from Mac
did and put them in here so the top row
that I have on the back full coverage
foundations if you know the full
coverage foundations they come in like a
little ground case but they come in
these little compact things like the
mineralized skinfinish --is and to be
honest they take up a lot of space and
looking for these when you're looking
crocheted is just annoying it done was
bought I think four or five shades so I
bought the darker shade obviously the
light shades and a couple of middle
shades I did the lighter shade and then
I started to mix them together so that I
had six shades of my favorite colors
that I wanted so I've got all the top
shades of my favorites and foundations
and then the bottom I have the
above-ground foundation sticks now if
you know the bob brown foundation sticks
you know they come up in that kind of
twist up thing that annoys me because
they break when they melt after being
hot they just go everywhere and to be
honest I can't look underneath and just
it's just long but I love the formula so
what I've done was again just smoosh
them in took them off the stick and got
everything out and applied them into
here these are all the Bobbi Brown
Foundation stick so I know the top is
the Mac and
Brown just a really really versatile and
this has just saved my butt on so many
different levels when I obviously and it
just saves you from having to have all
of these it just saves you from having
to have all these bottles of foundations
in your kit
so this is just a lifesaver for people
who you know just don't wanna carry too
much I'm a small girl so guys that is
the end of this video I hope that you
enjoyed looking at my pallets a little
bit closer thank you so much for
