channel since today's video is gonna be
me showing you my makeup in a rush we
will have them times we oversleep we
forget how long we have to get ready and
we've got to be glam in a very very
small amount of time so this makeup
takes me such a short amount of time and
I'm going to be showing you how I
achieve it it looks put together it
looks really pretty and it looks like
you've made a lot of effort so if your
do wanna see how to achieve this and
just keep on watching okay so the first
step is gonna be priming my face I will
never ever skip this because otherwise
my foundation just doesn't go on
smoothly so I'm applying my Too Faced
hangover because it's my go-to and it
just makes my face so hydrated the
foundation I'm using is the wire cell
tissue claw and honestly it really does
depend on whatever coverage you want to
go for but usually I'd like to go for
something that is relatively glowy
because it looks really healthy it's
very easy to blend in and it's not so
time-consuming compared to more of a
matte foundation and also I like to use
a kabuki brush because I also find this
a lot quicker also when it comes to my
concealer again I'm using just a normal
concealer this is the rumor wake me up
and this is very similar to a normal
makeup look I use my Beauty Blender to
blend this in because I find it quite
quick it looks very seamless and I just
feel like it blends super super fast
very very easily
now before I blend anything in I'm going
to be taking the Chanel tan de Soleil
bronzer now this is a cream bronzer and
I definitely feel like when you use a
cream bronzer it's a lot quicker now I
do go on top of this and set this with a
actual powder bronzer because I've laid
a foundation of the cream one it blends
super quick and that way when I apply
the powder bronzer you don't have to be
as neat with it also you really don't
have to go on top of it and set it with
a powder bronzer but I just did it
because I wanted my bronzer to be more
intense I'm also going ahead and setting
the rest of my face with a large powder
brush this of course means I'm going to
get more done quicker if you guys do see
my regular videos you'd see that I kind
of set my face quite precisely but when
I'm in a rush we don't have time for
that so we've got use of larger brush
and the same thing goes for when I'm
using my bronzer I like to use a large
powder brush and just go on the areas
where we applied it that cream bronzer I
feel like it's it's a lot better because
we applied that beforehand and that way
it literally takes me no time at all
course applying highlight takes no time
at all so I'm just literally going into
my Too Faced candlelight glow and
applying that onto the tops of my
cheekbones this also makes you look a
lot more put-together and glowy so I
definitely wouldn't skip this especially
if you're in a rush now one of the
things that probably takes the longest
for me is brows and eyeshadow so what I
like to do for my brows to really cut
down on the time is go through my brows
first of all with a brow conditioner
slash brow gel so I just like to go
through this first of all and whilst
that's drying so we don't waste any time
I'm going to go and do my eyes so that
you want to be totally dry so that's why
we're going to move on to the eye shadow
now for the eye shadow I mean I don't
want to skip on this because I want you
guys to know that you can do this very
quickly also so I'm taking this color
pop eyeshadow applying it onto my lid
with my finger and just pushing it
around very very like gently you don't
have to you know go crazy with this I'm
just applying this very gently around
the eye then just smudging around the
edges so that it looks a little bit more
like seamless you don't have to look too
harsh then I'm going in with that same
bronze that I used on my face on a
blending brush and literally just
popping this into the crease that is all
we're doing for eyeshadow it looks
really seamless it looks like you've
made a lot of effort in reality we've
literally taken two minutes to do our
eyeshadows so it's pretty good for two
minutes of time
all my eyes I like to use eyelashes
because again it makes you look like
you've made a lot more effort than what
you actually have you can skip on this
if you feel really uncomfortable and
then it's going to take you a really
long time but in my case I'm so used to
it that I can apply it within one minute
so for me this makes me feel like I have
made so much more effort I'd like to
apply some mascara to my top of my
bottom and then later on I am also going
to be applying some black into my
waterline
- but you again can skip this if you
feel uncomfortable so after those few
minutes that it took to do my eyes my
eyebrows are now dry so I'm going in
with my uh Nastasia brow Wiz and I'm
literally just going through my brows
and creating tiny little brow hairs
basically I don't wanna take the time to
really really do my brows properly
because I know that this is gonna take
me a long time I'm not going to bother
with putting concealer underneath there
I'm literally just creating a little bit
more of a fluffy natural look because
this way I can make it look a little bit
more messy slightly and then I'm just
going in with the waterline like I said
with some black kohl eyeliner and
literally the eyes and the eyebrows took
me together around five or six minutes
which is insane for my lips I'm going in
with my stone lip liner now this is kind
of the same as with if you do any other
look so I have no tips you to make this
quicker if you are in a rush what I like
to do sometimes is do my lips on the
tube on the train in my cab whenever I'm
on my way to somewhere if I'm really
rushing I'll leave this because I don't
want to get it wrong so sometimes I'll
do this in the cab but it's up to you
guys you can definitely do it before you
leave as well and for my hair what I
like to do usually is just go ahead and
do a really really natural like messy
ponytail this is like oh no fail for me
your hair can be greasy your hair can be
like not brushed and it still looks
really nice and boho just pull a few
little extra strands down and that's
pretty much it so guys there's the end
of my makeup in a rush tutorial let me
know if you want to see more videos like
this because honestly I mean for the
sake of filming it took me a little bit
longer because obviously I have to do
with all the camera equipment but in
reality if I was to do this makeup look
off camera it would probably take me no
joke 15 minutes to 20 minutes for a full
glam so definitely let me know if you
want to see more videos like this I love
you all so much I can't wait to see you
all in my next video and don't forget to
subscribe bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
