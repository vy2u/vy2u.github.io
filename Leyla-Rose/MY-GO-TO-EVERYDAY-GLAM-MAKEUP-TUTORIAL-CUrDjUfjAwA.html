so today I have a makeup tutorial with
you guys on the look I'm wearing right
now it's actually might go to everyday
glam and I've been wearing this look
constantly like literally constantly
every Instagram pics are pretty much in
the last month has been of me in this
makeup technique of my skin is really
change so I really want to show you guys
what I've been doing and I love it it's
really just simple but glam at the same
time and really achievable for an
everyday if you want to look glam it's
not a natural look obviously but this is
what I've been wearing almost every day
just because I've been feeling Glenn
lately so I'm going to be trimming it
this look on camera few guys today and
I'm going to show you guys how to
achieve it if you've liked videos like
this and be sure to give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel already
during the family and also say follow me
on Instagram follow my blog channel and
my breasts let's get it okay guys so the
first thing that we're going to be doing
today is moisturizing as always and I'm
using the body shop vitamin E
moisturizer just to add a really nice
amount of hydration into my skin and
then I'm taking the Galan glow glow
starter moisturizer and this is in the
darker shade and this just gives a
really nice bronze effect underneath
your foundation and I really really have
been loving this and then of course I
like to use a porcelain primer just
because I feel like this smooths
everything out and this is just my
routine that I prime my skin with every
single day and I love it moving on to my
foundation I have been using two
combined for the last month or so and
I've just been loving this combination
and that's the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
and the Estee Lauder Double Wear the
reason why I've been using Double Wear
is because it's really been helping my
makeup to stay on in this heat it's been
pretty humid in the UK so it just helps
with that humidity and helps to keep it
on but my skin is a little bit too dry
just to use it alone and I just find the
combination of the to create something
super flawless and I've just been loving
to buff it in with any kind of dense
brush so these kind of spoon brushes I
don't know what they're called this is
from Primark I love to use these because
I just find that it blends in really
nicely the concealer that I've been
loving to use lately is the NARS creamy
concealer in the color custard this is
an oldie but goodie
and I'm just when I use this I was like
this is why I love this concealer so
much
if so full coverage and it really does
look nice and smooth but full coverage
at the same time without creasing and I
just love that so I applied it of course
under my eyes on my eyelid on my chin
and my forehead and I like to actually
blend this in with a dry sponge now I
wouldn't usually do this but one day has
been a bit lazy and I couldn't be
bothered to wet my sponge and I used it
dry with this specific combination of
sponge and concealer and I loved it the
sponge is from NYX and of course the
concealer is NARS and just the
combination of the two just blended it
so flawlessly I actually quite liked it
dry so there's a weird experimenting but
yeah I went ahead and applied my powder
as always you guys know my part never
changes the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
and I just set everything together
before I side cream contouring now I
would say out of everything cream
contouring is probably the thing that's
changed the most for me just because I
never used to do it and what I like to
do first of all is take this NYX contour
stick in the color dark and apply it of
course in the areas I want to appear
more sunken in so on the sides of my
forehead my cheekbone and also my jaw
line as well and then I go in with this
hoola cream bronzer and just kind of go
underneath there and just use that as my
cream bronzer and the combination of the
two it just blends so flawlessly
it looks so effortless and then I do
like to go on top of this with a actual
powder bronzer eventually but I just
love the effect that this gives and I've
just been loving to use creams lately I
just find it's so nice to blend out and
I just really love the effect that it
gives and I use the Real Techniques
sculpting brush to blend this in and
especially around the cheekbone area I
like to make sure I'm patting it and not
rubbing it everywhere just because if
you use too much product it can kind of
get a bit messy and it did get a little
messy today so I took a little bit of
translucent powder and just took it
underneath the contour just to clean it
up I don't usually do this but only if I
make a mess and today I kind of did
stuff so whilst that translucent powder
is coming to spacing that area so now
I'm just going to be moving on to my
eyebrows and I'm taking some of this
L'Oreal clear brow plumper and just
using it as a brow primer just because I
like to do this I like to kind of put my
brows into place before I start filling
them in
and I've gone back to the Anastasio brow
wiz I moved on to a couple of other brow
pencils and then recently I've come back
to this and I'm just like this is just
going to forever be my favorite brow
pencil ever I've been going for a little
bit more of a straighter brow shape it
kind of comes outwards a little bit more
and I like to create kind of the brow
hairs again I will leave a tutorial in
the eye just now just if you want to
watch this a little bit more in-depth
but it's a little bit straighter a
little bit more fluffy I suppose but
still defined at the same time and then
I just go through it with a little bit
I'll be ready set brow from benefit just
to keep them in place my brow hairs are
a little bit curly and unruly so this
just keeps them in place and they don't
move all day and I love it
so I dusted off that translucent powder
and now I'm moving on to bronzer and I'm
taking this new one from CRT and it's
really pretty it's gorgeous it just has
a really nice it's got a little bit of a
red undertone and it makes you look some
kiss because not that you look bad but
like the red red tone in it makes you
look really tan so I love it and then I
just took some of this rodeo banana
powder and just used it to brighten up
my under eyes a little bit more been
loving to do that with my under eyes
lately just to make them stand out even
more and then I use some highlight and
this is the Anastasio so Hollywood just
to give me a glow necessary always you
need the glows can't will have the glow
next I'm going to be contouring my nose
using the shade and light palette from
coupling D and I've decided not to keep
a lot of this in because I think I'm
going to do a dedicated tutorial on how
I contour my nose let me know if you
want to see that down below because it's
kind of a new method it is similar to my
old one but I've really perfected it so
let me know if you want to see a
tutorial so just use the shade and light
palette to contour my nose and then I
end up moving on to my eyes and I'm
using the Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics palette and I am first of all
taking this color right here and the
kind of technique that I like to go for
when I create in my eyes is just a
really subtle wing made of eyeshadow and
it just lifts the eyes without it being
one really hard to achieve it's super
quick you can do in a couple of minutes
and also it's just
softer it just like lifts the eyes
without you actually having to wear a
bold winged eyeliner
so then I take a little bit of this
slightly darker brown and just apply it
a little bit closer to the lash line to
just build up a little bit of darkness
and then after I've applied that I go in
with the darkest color that I would use
it's just this kind of partly brown
shade I mean it was a much smaller brush
and just again push it closer to the
lash line and just extend this slightly
just to enhance the shape but this is
pretty much all I do I just make sure it
looks nice and blended before I do
anything and I just love it it's just
been my go-to and it's so easy to
achieve and then I just apply some
mascara and then my lashes the lashes
I've been using and loving are the Coco
Queen B lashes they are my life I love
them like they're just they're like the
perfect lashes for my eye shape I just
every time I put them on I just feel
sassy and I just feel like I love them
and then finally to finish off I go for
a just nude lip as always I mean nude is
for me I just I like a nude lip and the
red color that I am using here is the
color pop key lip pencil I love this
color and of course I'm just like I was
aligning it to make the look fuller and
then I am applying the NYX soft matte
lip cream in London and the one thing
that God says I've been watching a
lighter nude probably because my hair is
lighter I'm just applying a little bit
of this Kat Von D everlasting that could
lipstick on top just to make it a little
bit lighter and that is the finished
look everyone I really hope you guys
