showing you how to open up your eyes and
make them appear a lot large aren't
using only drugstore or affordable
products so I tried to gather together
some products that are really really
affordable and they're not going to make
a hole in your wallet and what I'm going
to be doing is to be doing one eye so
you can see the difference between the
two at the moment as you can see my eyes
are actually quite small some people
have a lot larger eyes some people may
even have smaller eyes everyone's eyes
are different different shape different
size so this one is going to be to suit
anyone that wants to open up their eyes
so to open up my eyes I'm going to take
a couple of steps that are really really
easy to achieve so as you can see I've
got the rest of my makeup on and I do
have concealer on my lids as I usually
do but I'm just going to be putting a
base all over my lid so I'm just gonna
putting it on the lid area I'm not going
to be taking up or to the brow because
this is a colored one and it is also
shimmery so we don't want that all over
on it and this is cashmere by next and
this is a jumbo eye pencil this is a
really nice champagne gold color and I'm
just going to be applying this all over
the lid so the reason I'm going to be
applying a reflective color onto my lid
is because we want to make the lids
appear larger we want it to attract the
light so I'm just going to take that
don't have to be too neat with this
either and we're going to be applying
that all over the lid as you can see
it's a really similar color to my lid
I'm going to be applying something else
on top of there I'm just going to be
painting that in with my finger I'm just
blending it out
and I've just taken it very slightly
above my crease I haven't kept it below
my creases just ever so slightly just
above and this is gonna make our lid
space a bit a little bit larger
next I'm going to be taking this Kiko
shadow this is in number three and this
is the color sphere eyeshadow and it's
like a marbled mineral effect and it's
really nice and shimmery so you want
something that's going to be reflecting
the light and I'm going to be patting
that on top of that base that we just
applied so you can pick it any kind of
color that you want but I just wanted to
go for a fairly natural color similar to
my skin tone but I had more of a shimmer
to it so this is just a nice golden
color so already looking at the
difference it's very very slight but you
can see that this eye looks already a
little bit more lifted and that eye
looks a little bit more sore drooping
down not bright just nothing so this is
just really gonna bite in the eye next
I'm going to be taking my sleek makeup
face contour kit and this is in medium
so I'm going to be using the dark color
dark matte color as our crease color and
then I'm after going to be using the
highlight color to highlight our in a
corner so I'm gonna be taking a blending
brush and I'm gonna take that Brown and
we want this to be Matt and I think
using a contour kit is a really good
idea because we want to create a very
natural soft contour that is gonna lift
the eye and create the appearance of a
higher crease we want it to be soft
though it's not going to be a makeup
crease or anything like that it's going
to be really nice and diffused so I'm
just going to start to dust that color
above all crease
and start to blend it upwards
just applied a little bit more color and
I'm going to be dragging it slightly
outwards to bring my eyes outwards
because my eyes are quite closer
together
next we're going to take a skin toned
eye pencil this is from Rimmel and the
color is in 0:05 nude and this is the
scandaleyes waterproof kohl and I'm
going to be taking this and running it
along my waterline what this skintone
color is going to do is make the white
part of our eye appear a lot more larger
and rounder you can use a white but this
is a very very natural look I don't want
to go for anything that's going to be
very very obvious so what I am doing is
just applying a skin tone because it's
often not noticeable it just looks like
your eye is a lot brighter
whereas a white is pretty obvious so I'm
also going to take that color and I'm
going to be applying it to my inner
corner to brighten the inner corner so
I'm just going to be drawing a little
bit only in a corner and just patting it
with my finger to diffuse it and
creating a much brighter in a corner is
again going to make the eyes appear got
brighter and a lot more open next I'm
going to be taking some of that contour
color that we used in our crease and we
are going to be applying it underneath
our bottom lash line
and what that's going to do is it give
the appearance of a lower bottom lash
line so that therefore makes the eye
appear larger
so I'm just going to take an angled
brush and just slightly run it
underneath we don't want it to look like
a line we want it to look nice and
diffuse so we're just going to do it
really nice and light
and just take it a little bit inwards
like that next we are going to be taking
our mascara mascara I'm using is the
best lash extreme from Jordana this is
not available in the UK on in drugstores
it is in America but you can get it off
Amazon for about 2 pounds 50 or
something about 3 pounds and this is
like vodka delivery it's really really
cheap so that's the reason I wanted to
use this one and it is one of my
favorite drugstore slush affordable one
so I'm going to be using some of that on
my top lashes so I'm just going to be
applying a coat of that as you can see
mascara makes the eye looks so much more
open this is a no in fact that's why the
majority of people do wear mascara but
as you can see it complements the rest
of the steps that we just took and it
just makes the eye look so much more
open and then we are also going to take
that the scar on to the bottom and we
are gonna apply some very gently not too
much of it as well to the blushes
so as you can see even with one coat of
mascara this looked really really nice
and open you can stop with the look here
or you can also have by the lashes as
well I always like to apply some lashes
so I'm gonna go on and do that so the
lashes that I'm going to be using are
the red cherry for 15 lashes these are
really cheap I get mine off Andersen and
they are about two pounds fifty each so
these are really affordable and these
are a really wispy amazing
natural-looking lash so this is just
something that I really want to go for I
want to go for something more natural
rather than something that's more
dramatic so when you're applying your
false lashes especially to open up your
eyes you want to make sure that they
don't come downwards too much otherwise
they're going to drag your eyes down you
want to make sure that they fit
perfectly with your eye shape and that
way they don't open up your eyes so I'm
just going to trim them a little bit to
suit my eye shape so I'm just gonna be
sitting these above my lash line
it's what's my lashes are on I just want
to make sure that there's a little bit
more mascara on them to make them look
more natural to blend in with my natural
lashes this is up to you if you want to
use this step again because some people
don't like to put mascara on their false
lashes but I just think it looks a lot
more natural so I'm going to be just
applying it in upwards motions
and then I'm going to be applying one
more coat on my bottom just to even the
mouth
so as you can see you can see how much
more open my eyes look they look a lot
more right than a lot more open it's up
to you if you want to use two false
lashes like I said this is a more
everyday look I like to use people's
ashes for daily wear but you might not
so it's up to you if you want to stop at
the mascara but as you can see it's just
tiny little steps that you can do just
to make your eyes appear a little bit
larger obviously we can't completely
change the shape of our eyes we need to
work with what we have so guys this is
how it looks with both eyes I really
love using this look for daily use just
for one on going places anything just to
open up my eyes I've been loving this
look recently because it's just so easy
and it takes about ten minutes to do and
it's just so so simple and really
affordable so I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this and you found it
