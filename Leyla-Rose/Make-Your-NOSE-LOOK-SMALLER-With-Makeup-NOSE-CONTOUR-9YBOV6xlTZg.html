today I'm going to be showing you how to
contour your nose this is my before and
after
my personal preference on contouring my
nose is quite minimalistic I don't like
to go too crazy because personally with
my nose shape if I go too much and too
heavy-handed it looks very very obvious
contouring my nose was always something
I really struggled with because whenever
I used to turn to the side it always
looked so obvious you can see a really
harsh line as you can see here it
doesn't have that but from the front it
looks very slim at the top and was so
very upturned at the tip as well so my
nose just looks a lot more petite so if
you do want to see how to achieve a nose
contour look like this then just keep on
watching so something you always need to
remember when you are contouring your
nose is that your nose is different to
everyone else's so you need to have a
good feel of your nose and really get to
know what shape is and what you want to
do to it
so really what techniques I use will be
slightly different for whichever nose
that you have personally me I have quite
a bulbous tip of my nose so that is
generally my main concern but of course
your main concern may be something a
little bit different first step is just
making sure I have a flawless base
underneath anything we're going to be
applying that way everything would just
apply a lot smoother you do want to
apply this to bare skin or anything like
that because the products were using on
top you really want them to sort glide
on smoothly so a good base is very
important the next step is going to be
applying two lines of concealer on
either sides of my nose I'm using a
concealer that's two to three shades
lighter than my actual skin tone and
what this will do is actually create a
slimming effect and make it appear like
my bridge and also the bottom of my nose
is a lot slimmer than what it actually
is I'm taking this concealer just
underneath the eyes as well and I'm
going to be blending that in with my
sponge this will just make everything
look a lot more natural in the sense
that it looks like you have a narrow
nose but that color from either sides of
your nose is continuing onwards - your
under eyes you want to make sure you
blend this very well but you want to
make sure also that you keep those two
lines in that sort of position that
they're already in
next you just want to make sure the VAT
is all set in place and also brightened
and the contour and highlight key I'm
going to be using for this whole
tutorial is the Kat Von D shade and
light palette highly recommend this
windows contour by the way because it
applies so smoothly
so I'm just setting that concealer on
the sides of my nose and also on my
under eyes just so that it doesn't budge
and also so that it really brightens it
as well next we're going to be taking
this light contour shade from that same
palette and I'm going to start to
contour the sides of my nose so the
brush I actually like to use to contour
my nose is a little sort of angled
eyeshadow brush these usually come in
sets and I'm not kidding I always
usually throw these away but since I
started contouring my nose with these
I'm in love so always keep these just
not for eyeshadow for contouring your
nose instead so what I'm going to be
doing is just contouring the sides of my
nose but stopping midway through the
nose so I'm only going to be contouring
up to just where it starts to get
rounded so just to about there so I've
just gone taut the sides of my nose and
when it gets to that point I'm going to
be creating a little L shape
so what this is going to do is create
the appearance of a shorter nose it's
harder to explain and it's easier to
actually watch what I'm doing I hope I'm
explaining this okay but I'm just kind
of creating a little L as you can see
and then on the other side a little
backwards L and this were just really
short in the nose doing this also makes
the nose look a lot less round at the
top which really helps to make it into
look smaller as well the contour the
bottom of my nose I'm going to be taking
the same brush with the same powder and
just contouring just above the nostril
and I like to do this in two little
curves just above the nostril instead of
just drawing a straight line across I
just personally prefer this and I think
it looks more natural okay so next I'm
going to be highlighting and this step
is just as important as contouring I'm
taking a flat shader brush with some of
that yellow powder we use underneath our
eyes and I'm just going to be
highlighting the center of the nose this
will make this area appear like it's
coming out a little bit more but doing
it more narrow just right in the center
makes it look very very narrow and I'm
also just going to be taking this on the
sides of my nose to clean up the sides
of that contour now a lot of people do
this and leave it like this and this
gives a very like fake nose effect
you're going to see when I'm finished
what it looks like before I kind of
blend
out and you could totally leave it like
this if you like your nose to look
really fake and small you can totally
leave it like this
personally I prefer something a little
bit more natural so I'm gonna be
blending out with a sponge but you can
totally leave it like this or just buff
out a little bit but I like to really
buff this out because I don't it to look
really really obvious when I turn to the
side but as you can see this shape
really changes the shape of my nose so
to make it look a little bit more
natural I'm just going to be going on
top of that with my sponge and this will
just kind of push that product into the
skin and make it look like a natural
shadow highly recommend doing this and
blending it out as much as you can when
it comes to going out in daylight
especially just because it will really
really look obvious if you leave it that
way
for pictures and stuff like that why not
but when it comes to actually being out
in daylight it always looks more obvious
than what you think so this is the way
it looks again and honestly I love the
way it turned out it looks like my nose
shape still but just a little bit better
if that makes sense so yeah it just
makes my nose look a teeny bit smaller
and yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
