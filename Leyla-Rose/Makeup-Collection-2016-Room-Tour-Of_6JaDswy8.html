so today I have my makeup collection and
my room tour for you guys I am so
excited for you guys to actually see
this I want to just say before I get
into it I want to make sure that you
guys are checking below in the
description box because I'm gonna have a
lot of things linked down below so if
you're going to ask me like where things
are from make sure you check down below
first because I'm going to try and link
as much as I can so that you guys can
find what I have also if you guys aren't
interested in the actual room part then
you can skip to this time that's on the
screen right now if you guys do want to
skip right to the makeup collection then
you can find it right here and apart
from that I really hope you enjoy this
video it did take me so long to film and
edit so I really hope it came out okay
and without further ado let's get into
it
I can't
you
so this is a general overview of what
you can see when you walk into my office
the room that I have is a box room so
it's not very big so I try to utilize
the space as much as possible by
creating an l-shaped desk I'll explain
how I created it why used down below
because it is quite long to explain but
as you can see on the right side of the
room is my desk area and where I could
pull my office stuff and then in front
of you as soon as you walk in is pretty
much all of the makeup area so I'm going
to be explaining to you guys what's on
the tops of my desks and just like
everything that's around first of all
like what's on the shelves and then we
will go into what's in the drawers
afterwards so on the very left of the
desk I have some Alex 9 drawers and I
also have to Alex five drawers from Ikea
also and they are underneath my desk and
that's where I keep a lot of my makeup
and then of course above that I store a
lot of my makeup and brushes on the tops
of the tables so sitting above my Alex
nine drawers I have a Peach Smoothie
Yankee candle burning and then just
behind that I have a liquid lipstick
holder and that just holds some of my
favorite liquid lipsticks and lipglosses
and then also any candy jar I have some
of the makeup revolution blushing hearts
blushes in this little lipgloss holder
which is from a by allegory I have some
of my dose of colors liquid lipsticks
which I love and then I also have my
favorite la splash liquid lipsticks and
also the Kylie cosmetics liquid
lipsticks as well and then also on the
other side I have some of the Too Faced
melted liquefied melted lipsticks and I
just keep these legs they look really
pretty and then also behind that I have
the colour-pop ultra matte lip liquid
lipsticks and then on the left side I
have some of the Stila stay all day
liquid lipsticks and this is one of my
favorite formulas so on the right of
that sitting on my desk I have a tissue
box and also I have my phone which is
sitting in this little acrylic like
phone holder which is so good when I
want to watch videos when I'm doing my
makeup and then right next to that I
also have these little containers where
I keep my cotton pads and also where I
keep my q-tips and I love having these
like stored somewhere that way they
don't collect dust and that way they can
just keep nice and clean in there and
then to the right of that I have all of
my makeup brushes
as you can see I have a lot of makeup
brushes and they are stored in for clear
vases and then I also have them stored
in two mugs on the left in the mugs I
like to keep some of my real technique
brushes and also some of my most used
face brushes tool or purple containers
they have the brushes that don't really
tend to reach for as much and then just
underneath the purple containers I have
this little mirrored drawer set where I
keep some of my certified glitters and
also where I keep this little glass
holder next to the right of that I have
this Muji drawer which is filled with a
lot of lip products that I own and then
just above the Muji drawers I like to
store my lip pencils on the left I have
all of my nude toned lip pencils and
then on the right I have the dark ones
as you can see I have a lot of nudes
because I love to wear nude lips and
then I also have in front of that this
little lash holder where I like to keep
the lashes that I've lost the boxes too
so underneath that I have my Muji
drawers and in the very first drawer I
have some of my NYX butter glosses and
then in the second drawer I have some of
my NYX soft matte lip creams these look
really nice when they're paired together
so it's really nice to display them this
way and also this is one of my favorite
formulas to continue with the whole NYX
theme I have some of the NYX intense
bottle glosses which I don't really
reach for as much and then I also have
some of the limited edition of DK
lipsticks and also the NYX butter
lipsticks and then in the drop below
that I have my urban decay of vyse
lipsticks and these are amazing so I
like to keep these there as well so I
can reach them whenever I need them and
then in the drawer below that I have
some of my Too Faced melted matte liquid
lipsticks in the drawer below that this
is a deeper drawer I have the shade and
light palette from Kat Von D and also
all of my favorite makeup geek
eyeshadows because I am always reaching
for them and then of course in the
bottom drawer as you can see I have some
of my lip glitters these just fit really
well here and I couldn't find a space in
my actual drawers that fit as nicely as
this so I decided to put them in there
so to the exact right of the Muji
drawers I have my perfume stand which is
actually a cake stand that I stole from
my kitchen and some of my favorite
perfumes are the supreme bouquet by YSL
this is probably my number one and then
I also love the victor of bon bon bon
bon and then of course black opium which
is like one of my signature scents so
all of my perfume
just chill right next to my big vanity
mirror and then on my vanity mirror I
have to Kylie cosmetic lip boxes and a
green candle just cuz I think it looks
really cute and then I have another
candle burning
this one is a coconut milk one which I
love the scent of and then I have my a
hundred thousand subscriber plaque which
I love to display and also this canvas
that says be brave with this little
ornament that says believe you can and
you're halfway there next this is my
office area so I have my computer and
then I have a few little knickknacks
I have this little tray that says pretty
little things and then a little rose
gold elephant a little tiny candle a
coaster because I'm always drinking tea
and then on the other side of my
computer I have a vase with a little
pink flower I also have a mug with an L
on it which has a few little bits in
there like hand cream and stuff like
that and then I have a black hashtag
ornament right next to my vase and
that's pretty much the office area so up
on the wall on either side of my desk I
have some shelves so on the first shelf
on the right side I have a little
Victoria's Secret bag and then on the
Shelf below that I have this really cute
glass that stigma got me with my name on
it and then right next to it I have a
candy jar full of lush bath balm because
look how cute it looks it's totally for
display so I don't actually use those
ones and then on the bottom shelf I have
a few other little bits and gold is kind
of the theme of this show I have a clear
vase with this nice white flower sitting
in it and then I also have a box of
candles from Paris and then in front of
that I do have this little reindeer
jewelry holder which is so cute and then
it was to have this Elle mug that my mom
got me full of some two-faced lip
glosses and then on the same shelves on
the other side of the room I have a
Sephora bag a Chanel bag and also this
little card that says xoxo on it because
it reminds me of Gossip Girl and on the
shelf below that I have this little
candle that says on it you are an
inspiration I love that because it's
just so positive and then right next to
that I have this little L ornament as
well just because I like having elves
everywhere clearly and then on the shelf
below that I have this little lipstick
organizer that has some lipsticks in it
