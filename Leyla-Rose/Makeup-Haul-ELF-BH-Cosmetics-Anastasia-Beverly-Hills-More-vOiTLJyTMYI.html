channel I am so happy to be sitting in
front of a camera I haven't been well
this past week and I haven't filmed I
know I skipped an upload on Tuesday and
you guys would have seen my friday one
but this is the first one that I've
actually sat down and like spoken since
I wasn't well I get ill quite often and
I'll explain in a further video why I
get on well but it just feels really
good what I can sit in front of a camera
again and you'll probably notice I
having a little bit of a different
setting and the reason being is I'm
actually in my room still I've just
moved my camera to another part of the
room because I wanted this to have a
little more of a chilled feel to it I'm
actually gonna be not decorating my room
because it's technically wasn't
decorated that logo I'm just going to be
revamping it soon so I'm gonna basically
do some chatty videos in a different
place to where I do my makeup tutorials
i have no artificial lighting it's just
natural lighting right now I hope it's
ok let me know if you like it if you
don't like it then let me know and I'll
try and sell out something else but
today we're going to be doing a haul I
am so excited because I haven't done a
whole in what feels like forever the
last time I down a hall was my birthday
haul some of you may know some of you
may not know I'm going to LA in January
so I'm kind of saving up for the trip so
I have a nice amount of spending money
to take with me so i can buy makeup and
you know just purchase stuff while i'm
out there and also to sightsee and have
a good time while I'm out there so I
haven't really been purchasing a lot of
makeup having the job that I have means
that I get sent makeup products from all
sorts of different companies and so
blessed i am recognized by so many
amazing companies so i recently got sent
a huge care package from elf so this is
mainly going to be kind of an elf haul
butt is going to have a few other
products as well i also got said some
stuff from bhcosmetics it also purchased
a few things from colt beauty coding UK
they're one of my favorite sites they
stuck Anastasio beverly hills they sell
all sorts of different skin care stuff
so i picked up a couple of skincare
stuff and a couple of makeup products
too so this is going to be a big one I'm
not really going to be showing too much
into depth with the products because I
have a lot to show you so if you do want
to see the whole as some of the stuff
that I received and purchased recently
then just keep on watching the before I
jump into the elf of bh cosmetics i'm
going to show you guys some of the stuff
that i purchased recently
as we have probably already seen these
kind of products in makeup tutorials
already just because whenever i get a
product i do usually tend to just use
them straight away and I just can't wait
first I'm going to show you guys some
stuff I've recently purchased from colt
beauty Dakota UK they are by far one of
my favorite websites just because they
stock so many different products they
have so many different things on that I
feel are harder to get hold of in the UK
by purchase to skincare products from
their website from different brands the
first one is this pixie glow tonic from
pixie obviously it's an exfoliating
toner notice such a difference as you
can stay if you can see i have used
quite a lot of it already this is like a
cult favorite loads of people love this
at kora member how much this was but i
think it was roughly around 15 to 20
pounds i can't remember everything from
colt beauty i will link down below if
you guys watched my previous get ready
with me you would have already seen this
this is the ren clean skin care
vitamineral omega-3 opt-in skin serum
oil yes that's this one here this tiny
little bottle this was pretty expensive
i think this was 24 pounds I can't
remember again I'm awful with prices
this is basically a skin oil that you
use as a serum and serums are really
important because it goes into the lower
layers of the skin I like the fact that
it's oily because I do feel like it
really does hydrate my skin and it
absorbs into the skin really quickly
even if you do have oily skin it's not
something to worry about oh I will tell
you guys how I feel about this in the
future if it goes well yes so if I am
really liking it also I got some makeup
products from coal beauty as well I got
the anastasi of Beverly Hills so
Hollywood eliminator you guys have
obviously seen this already so far just
because I mean I've been using it
constantly I'm wearing it right now
that's giving me this glow right now I
love highlighters and so Hollywood one
it's absolutely beautiful I absolutely
love this and I do feel like this was
the best color I don't know I personally
like a gold champagne highlight if you
haven't picked one up already definitely
recommend that you purchase it because
it is a really nice highlight last thing
that i got from cart beauty is this
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer and
this is
tiny little but I was so scared when I
opened this I was like oh because it was
really expensive I want to say it was 18
pounds maybe more actually i'm not sure
but yeah i purchased this because i had
heard really good things about her and I
wanted a thick under-eye concealer
because I don't actually have one I
always use the Maybelline fit man is
great but sometimes I want that really
nice bright full coverage under eye and
I really really love this I have this in
the color fair golder so now we're gonna
get into the good stuff too excited
because bh cosmetics and elf are so
affordable i have never used bh
cosmetics or i have never used elf
either which is absolutely crazy right
like how have I never used both of those
brands and I'm so excited to be
incorporating these brands into my
tutorial okay so I'm gonna get started
off with the bhcosmetics stuff but I
thing I wanted to show you guys is this
long sexy lashes this is a lengthening
of a scar from bhcosmetics any color
noir and i will show you guys a close-up
of this mascara and now so you can just
see what it looks like it also sent me
this bh liquid eyeliner pen and this is
in the color black as well so know that
i love liquid eyeliner pen so this is a
liquid eyeliner pen it looks a lot like
a felt-tip and these are really easy to
create a nice wing shape so I'm
definitely looking forward to that and
the thing that we're most excited about
of course from vh they said meet some
pallets they sent me first of all the bh
studio pro ultimate brow palette and
this is a really good path they have a
ton of different colors in here all
sorts of different shades to suit
different hair colors and they also have
a row at the bottom which are four
shades of waxes as well definitely be
great for someone that was starting out
a kit to be a mega biased because it's
so affordable as well it's great when
you're just dying out H party girl After
Hours palette this is 32 colored eye
shadows in it and guys just look at this
how pretty this is so beautiful I'm so
excited to use this let me know if you
guys have any of these pallets and what
you'd like me to do with them because
i'm just so excited because I'm sure
lots of you have these kind of pallets
they're so affordable and they have so
many cool colors
these are nice colors especially for the
winter and fall definitely one of the
most excited about this is the
bhcosmetics galaxy chic 18 color baked
eyeshadow palette like baked eye shadows
give off such a different effect a
smooth glittery beautiful shine and I
just love the way they look so when I
saw this I was like oh my God look how
pretty I just can't their palates are
just to die for love about this as well
is that they mimic the look of Planets
which i think is so cool they have
different colors they're all kind of
swamp of different shades they have lots
of warm shades i absolutely love all
these in this corner just here just
because it just screams full and then
they also have lots of cool blues
purples and then these topes down here
as well so many different colors and
this would just be such a good palate
especially for the lid just because you
get so much shine up these colors and
let me know if you want to see a
tutorial with this one too now I'm going
to go onto the elf stuff I'm not kidding
there's so much stuff in here so I'm
going to try and make this as brief as
possible because I don't you guys to be
bored by this so the first thing that
stands out to me in this huge box on my
lap is this elf makeup remover cleansing
cloths and this is from the elf studio
line this has 20 pre-moistened cloths
inside there I love makeup wipes to
remove my eye makeup only new makeup
wipes always go so I'll let guys know if
these are any good they sent me the
ultimate kabuki brush a multi-use brush
for blending highlighting contouring and
stippling like the real deal guys this
is a huge brush honestly so soft I don't
even know what I've used this for I
believes it to bronze my neck of any
brushes like that that's so cool they
also sent me this ultimate blending
brush I'm really excited this cuz I love
kabuki brushes so supersoft we filled a
really good quality it does feel really
nice and synthetic so it won't clog up
with loads of product on it so synthetic
hairs are always a million times better
to apply liquids with a contour brush as
well I'm so excited so they sent me this
traditional style contour brush I'll be
honest I don't really like to use these
for contouring because usually they are
too stiff like the one I have from Mac
is so stiff I just feel like it makes
everything but patchy but this feels
still stiff but soft at the same time so
let you guys know how this goes whenever
I do
cream contour I'm looking for a good
brush to cream contour with because I
actually don't have a good brush that I
love I love brushes like these because I
do usually tend to use pencil on my
brows but sometimes I like to apply a
tiny little bit of brow powder on the
inner corner of my brow and I feel like
that will just kind of finish off my
brow look and then it also comes with a
spoolie on the other end and that is
just always so good to just brush
through your browser as well so I love
this and this is their eye brow duo
brush three shades of their instant lift
brow pencil I have never seen this
before so I'm really excited let me just
show you guys in the packet so it kind
of looks like a jumbo ish pencil can I
end is a spoolie quite a thick spoolie
and then the other end is a quite thick
pencil and that one that I'm using is in
the color neutral Brown this eyeliner
and eyeshadow stick so on one end it has
an eye shadow and then the other end it
has an eyeliner they send me one in
purple and plum and then the other one
is basic and brown so this is pretty
cool that is the brown eyeliner in one
and then i will show you guys the other
side oh that is nice that's like a rose
gold oh I've got to show you guys a
close-up of that well a lip definer and
shader site actually has like a little
sharp and a pencil and then on the
inside kind of like a highlighter and if
you guys can see that but it's kind of
like I think you can use it to highlight
your Cupid's bow and stuff like that but
the other side on the other hand I'm
going to use this so much I just know it
what a pretty color so sent me these two
blush palette some light and one in dark
I'm really excited about these but have
I already open them and I think they are
so cool these are also I believe from
the elf studio line so this would be
great again for someone that's building
up a camp this one is personally my
favorite I do like some of the shades
from the dark one as well so this is
what one of the palettes look like this
is in light this color here I'm just
living for I love these kind of apricot
shades and what I love about it is that
I don't if you guys can see this but
they have these little buttons at the
back so you can actually push them out
and replace them so you can buy a couple
of these and just move
bow and I think that's really good so
that's the light shape and then I'll
also show you guys the dark shade it's a
beautiful palette and this is in the
shade doc Quan Torin blush and bronzing
powder duo so two of these this is what
this one looks like it's really nice and
neutral this shade right here is kind of
like a shimmery blush and this one down
here it's kind of like a shimmery bronze
us I like this one I like the bronzer
because I just feel like it's a really
pretty matte bronzer and the blush is
beautiful as well it's quite bright but
it looks like it's going to be really
pretty so I love that bronze I think
it's a really nice neutral warm bronze
either would be great to contour with
two because it's not too warm where it
doesn't do his job as a contour powder
and then also this one here is a
beautiful blush as well so those jurors
are very pretty i also got sent to baked
blushes I'm just living for both of
these I'm so excited about one of them
you guys are going to be just as excited
as fellow highlighter lovers but yeah
really excited with both of these baked
blush is called Ichi chinky and that's
just this color right here super pretty
right it's really really nice it's a
very light mineral style baked blush and
it's just very pretty and I just feel
like it has a really nice summer element
to it so I'm not sure if it'll be great
for this time of year but I think would
be really really nice in the summer so
excited for that this is a baked blush
also but this makes my highlighter
senses tingle because it just has such a
pretty highlighter feel to it and so
this is pink tastic as well from ELF I
just if you love highlighters you just
know you're gonna love this before you
even swatch it just gonna swatch this
for you on my fingers oh my god so
pretty unfortunately three of these
bronzers came broken baked bronzers
always tend to do that loads of the ones
i have always do that as well just
because the consistency is so much finer
than other products i just feel like
it's way more likely for it to break so
it's one is called los cabos and that's
this one right here will be more topi
than the other shades so it's not very
warm and but I do really like this shade
I can imagine using this Morsy blusher
and this one is st. Lucia this one is a
little bit more but you lie to one this
is probably
a lot better on a lighter skin tone just
because only more medium to deep skin
tone this wouldn't sharp very well but
you could use this as a highlighter on a
deeper skin tone if you would like to
one this is the only one that isn't
broken so I'll show you guys this one
this one is bora bora's probably my
favorite one at chili's I'm glad this
one isn't broken because this is 1 i'm
probably going to use the most has more
of a warm tone to it I'm really a yellow
toned one but it is definitely more warm
and then last of all is Maui and this
one is kind of similar to Bora Bora but
it has more of a yellow tone I'm sad
this one broke because I do feel like I
would you use this one a lot but this
just looks like a really nice natural
yellow toned warmish bronzer lastly I
wanted to show you guys some more I
products they sent me to New cream
eyeliners one in coffee and one in black
these are basically seem like they're
just gel liners definitely excited to
use these because I'm always looking for
new gel liner they send me a bunch of
baked eye shadows which are probably my
favorite baked product I just love baked
eyeshadow two of these I should have
trios which are such cool things to have
especially if you're traveling you don't
take too much with you it's kind of cool
to have each because they do have three
colors in 11 is in smokey see and then
the other one is in peach please so
these are pretty cool i'll show you guys
a close-up of these as well but they
basically just have three different
tones within them so cool like i just
think they're so nice because especially
for someone as a beginner you know you
don't want to buy a whole palette but
you want to have three different shades
these are so cool so my favorite one is
definitely the peach one they sent me
three single baked eye shadows as well
and they are definitely my favorite the
colors are just beautiful one in the
color and chanted this just looks so
pretty it looks like just a really nice
light rose gold shade very peachy ish
very nice i'm really excited this is a
really nice color for the summer all the
fool if you really like them warm tones
on in bronze to beauty and this is a
little bit more of a dark gold it's not
quite a bronze I'd probably say it's
just a really nice dark yellow gold but
this is really pretty and very unique I
don't think I own another color like
this and lastly they also sent me one
called bunt plum which is again perfect
for this
yes i'll definitely be using this new
tutorial if you guys would like to see
it but this is exactly what it says on
the tin it's a but plum color but this
is really nice because it has a nice
Sheen to it this would look beautiful
with a glitter packed on top of it or
even on its own so exciting this just
really gets me in the mood for this time
of year definitely as the end of this
