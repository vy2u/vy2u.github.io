I have not sat down and done some sort
talking video for the longest time I
honestly it feels weird it feels weird
actually talking because I feel like I
have just been doing so many beauty
videos with a lot of voiceovers and it's
just been a long time since I've had a
chat with you guys by the way I'm
wearing a hat like I never ever wear
hats but I decided to be you know like a
cool kid and wear my hat backwards
because my hair is greasy and I couldn't
be bothered to worship lazy girl
problems I haven't been buying a lot but
makeup recently so it's kind of stuff I
already had in my collection but I've
kind of just revisited stuff I'm super
excited for April mainly because of Game
of Thrones of course you know me the
first thing I actually wanted to talk to
you guys about was something that I got
up to in the month of March I filmed
such a fun video with icon UK and
L'Oreal and you guys need to see it I
had so much fun filming and I really
wanted to share the link with you guys
if you really wanted to see it I did
share it on my Instagram but I haven't
had a chance to share on YouTube yes
I'll leave the link down below and also
a little link just here if you want to
see that video it was honestly it's so
much fun to film and yeah you guys need
to see it don't forget to subscribe to
their channel as well because they put
out some amazing content with some
amazing youtubers on there and I am so
blessed to be featured on there for one
video though I have a box full of stuff
that I was loving in the month of March
basically been using the same skincare
routine for a little while now and it's
been working really well for me but I
really wanted another moisturizer I
wouldn't this step for moisturizer for
day and for night and I just found this
one and I'm obsessed with it it kind of
feels more like a serum than a
moisturizer so sometimes actually use
this with my Liz Earle moisturizer that
I use now this is the pixie h2o skin
drink and I actually bought this off
cult Beauty I love that pick singular
tonic which is like a toner and I also
love that pixie cologne mist which is
this one so I decided to pick up English
drives and just see what it's like and I
am obsessed with this has a gel
consistency and it's called skin drink
and that is exactly what it does like my
skin just drinks this up and I love it
it's really really hydrating it feels
very cooling on the skin
like it literally feels like water so it
doesn't leave any residue on your skin
it feels like a teeny tiny bit silicone
II which makes it really nice for the
daytime but I do also use this in the
nighttime as well and I really really
like it so I've been using this a lot in
this last month and yeah I really really
like you man and then another skincare
favorite is an expensive one I couldn't
give in to the hype I really wanted to
try it but I just couldn't justify
spending so much money on a mask but I
finally gave in I've spoken about on
snapchat but this is the glam glow mask
this is the super mud clearing treatment
and I'm not kidding you guys this is
honestly like no masks I've ever used
before
I tried to find others that would mean
you liked it but honestly this is really
one-of-a-kind I haven't found anything
that's as good as this although I think
it's very overpriced very very
overpriced it's not worth 40 to 50
pounds it is really good and even though
I did pay that much I would 100% buy it
again because it's really really good
I don't always apply it all over my face
sometimes I just apply it on areas where
I need it the worst areas for me on my
forehead for the little bumps and then I
also get blemishes and also bumps on my
cheek areas as well sometimes I just put
it on the area on my nose I don't always
put it around my mouth area like the
outer part of my face it's not always
necessary so sometimes I do a full mask
sometimes I just do it a little spot
areas and I'm multi mask the next one is
actually ting fragrance and I'm obsessed
with the whole range of this not just
this spray but the supreme particular
I'm obsessed with this is the bodyshop
british rose a new toilet perfume
basically it's like a body spray and I'm
obsessed with this I want to lose people
that don't usually like floral scents I
kind of sometimes like them but not if
they're too floral scent the whole
collection and when I smell this I was
like what like it is unbelievable it
doesn't just smell like that bitter
floral scent it smells sweet and floral
which is why I really really like it if
you sometimes get turned off by floral
scents this is really sweet at the same
time and I really really like this it's
just the spray they have but they have a
whole collection I showed you some of it
on my snapchat don't forget to follow me
on snapchat by the way I'll pop up just
here all my social media is makeup
strimmer gotta follow me and it's
perfect for spring so it's perfect for
April at May if you go into a body shop
store go and smell this I promise you
you'll fall in love and I love it so I
found these sunglasses in TK Maxx and I
just fell in love with them I have been
looking for these kind of shades for
ages when I found them they were so
inexpensive by the way there by the
brand of Polaroid I saw these and I was
just like obsessed I'm obsessed this is
what they look like is probably gonna
give you guys inqalab because of the
ring line I have in front of you love
the fact that it's totally straight at
the top like I really want the Saline
glasses but I've never bought a pair of
designer glasses in my life because I
don't know I just want I can't be
trusted with Sony's I just feel like
I'll sell them what's up big here's what
I think 1499 which are so cheap and I
love the style of them they're matte
black and then the two sides are gold
can you think of anything more perfect
for me a black and gold nope love it
all set so now until you some makeup
items for the first product it's
actually something I didn't initially
like when I pull this here I used it a
couple of times you guys said you didn't
like it on me I didn't like it on me and
I really just didn't like the way it
kind of looked on me but I feel like I
wasn't using it right and that's why I
didn't like it and that's the Oh Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder I
bought this because if you watch youtube
videos you know that every single woman
and her mother rave about this this felt
like it was totally flashing back on me
on camera it just didn't look right and
I think I wasn't dusting it away enough
because now I've kind of tried it to
bake my under eyes and also other parts
of my face this powder is for all of us
and my skin is not flawless right now
and it makes my skin look pretty much as
for as they can get I don't use this on
an everyday basis I kind of only use it
when I'm going out and I really want to
bake but this is perfect I used to
really love my Mac CC loose powder in
the yellow tone I still love that but
this for me I think I like it more the
next product actually have to talk about
is a blush can't believe I'm talking
about blush because me like I barely
wear blushes like never but when I do
want to wear a blush I wanted to be
blush that I love and that doesn't make
me look like I don't know - Rosie I
don't know if that makes sense but I
don't like pink on my cheeks I've just
never been a fan of something too pink
so one of my favorite blushes of all
time is Mac horn soul and if you watched
one of my more recent videos which was
the half a face of juice and half a face
of high-end products and I basically
found dupes for them this was my dupe
for warm soul and I have been loving
this more than one soul because I think
it's more illuminating and more glowy
the warm soul is so it actually has
three stripes of colors in it this one
is kind of a peachy gold this is a
little bit more of a peachy pink and
then up here is just a plain old gold
and I love this I really really do and I
spoil the colors together the walnuts -
in wedding not long ago and this looks
so premium pictures I have to be careful
because I get a lot of spots and bumpy
areas on my cheek area where you usually
apply blush so a lot of the time I kind
of skip it because it just makes my
spots look worse it just makes them look
more apparent but this looks really
smooth on the skin and even if sometimes
if I do have bumps it doesn't make them
look too too obvious which I like did I
tell you guys the name I don't think I
told you that I'm this is the makeup
revolution of blushing hearts triple
baked blush in the shade peachy keen hot
and I can't even tell you the name I'm
so crap what's wrong with me next makeup
product I have to talk about is this
concealer from L'Oreal this is the
L'Oreal True Match the touch magic
concealer and this is in the color warm
beige and I actually don't use this to
illuminate or bright and my under eyes
at all actually use this to color
correct and this was actually a mistake
that I bought this actually bought this
to use as a normal concealer and I just
guessed the color warm beige on line and
it was way too dark for me and way too
warm should have known by the color warm
beige but you know buying online it's
kind of hard the colors never really
look like what it looks like on the skin
so I tried and it was a fail and I was
like I need to use this for something so
I tried using it and I used it as a
color corrector under my eyes and I'm
obsessed with this because it's such a
light formula I feel like it's so
natural it just feels really light on
the under eyes it just takes care of
that without it being too over-the-top
because my under-eye circles really
aren't that bad and I love it so this
has been perfect for me and
color warm beige I'm obsessed that night
for what this is just been my go-to
color corrector it was to use this
around the dark areas around my mouth as
well and it's perfect the last
complexion kind of product that I've
been loving is actually from the body
show I have been using the shade
adjusting drops constantly this last
month and these are just life saving
I've never actually tried another like
shade adjusting drops before anyway but
this is so good because it doesn't alter
the texture of the foundation if
anything it will just make it a little
bit smoother to apply but it will never
make it feel thinner or thicker it's
just it keeps the foundation feeling as
its own consistency and I love that this
is just genius honestly I don't know
what I did without this before having to
mix foundations and changing the formula
is annoying and you can really adjust it
to the exact shade you want with this it
comes in a little dropper which is so
handy because you know that one drop is
a really going to be a lot and then you
know two drops it's gonna be a little
bit more depending on how much you need
so you guys know I'm obsessed with
eyeliner and obsessed with a winged
liner and I have been loving lately is
the tart tart est clay paint liner this
is insane
I love this the formula is so creamy and
smooth it doesn't make you feel like
it's gonna be super super pigmented but
when it dries it dries to a super matte
finish it's so black and I'm obsessed
the only thing I don't like about this I
don't know if it's just full tee and
it's just the one I bought I bought this
when I was in Sephora in LA so I don't
know what happened I don't know if I got
a wrong one but there's a ton of air
bubbles in these and when I try and push
the product out every now and again the
liner will just go I'll be like the heck
just happened
honestly I totally don't mind because
the liner is that amazing I'm almost
through so I'm gonna have to be buying
another one soon I'm gonna have to buy
from Sephora online or I don't know if
there's another place that stocks this
so a pair of lashes that I have been
obsessed with lately are the Adele demi
whispies now I pulled this in a multi
pack of Amazon and I always buy my all
Adele and red cherry lashes off Amazon
because it's just so cheap honestly for
a pack of this I think it was
and I'm not like 8 pounds which is crazy
for 4 pairs of lashes and I've just been
going through these sorry bunch because
these aren't too long but they get
longer towards the outer corner it
really shapes my eyes without actually
having to do much I wore them in this
Instagram picture right here and you
guys really liked how natural my makeup
look so let me know if your way to do a
tutorial or on my go-to everyday look
using these lashes because I'm obsessed
with these then lastly I have two lip
products to mention when I think about
why I've been wearing this month I think
I've just been keeping it very simple
and the same kind of lip colors I always
wear I do have these two which I don't
think I've actually spoken about and
especially the liner more than anything
this is the Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat
reshape and resize a lip liner and this
is in the shade iconic new use a little
bit of this today underneath the gloss
but it's kind of covered up by other lip
liners and lip glosses so it's hard to
even explain what I'm wearing on my lips
I think I put like six or seven products
on why do i do that's watch this liner
for you so you can see what kind of mood
is and as you can see is kind of just I
don't know just that really nice natural
dark nude shade and I really really like
it I've been loving this and this is
really nice when it's on all over the
lips it's very creamy Charlotte Tilbury
is not cheap and I know these are the
first two products I've actually ever
tried from them but I've been obsessed
with this liner a lot and I'm actually
wearing this lipstick as well underneath
the gloss while Charlotte Tilbury
packaging is to die for this is a really
nice peachy dark nude in the shade
Hepburn honey and as you can see it's
just a little bit peachy up but yes the
kind of shade I'm using on my lips today
so the combination of those two together
kind of creates this look and then I
applied a gloss on top of it but guys I
think that's all the favorites I have
for this month I really really did want
to chat to you guys and it felt so good
actually getting to chat to you I will
try my very best to do more videos like
this in the future because I don't know
I feel like things can get very very
makeup related and I'm just doing
tutorial often tutorial tutorial
but that is sometimes what I enjoy doing
and that sometimes just goes really well
