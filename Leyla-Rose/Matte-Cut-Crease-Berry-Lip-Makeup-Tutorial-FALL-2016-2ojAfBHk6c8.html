this really intense makeup tutorial and
I'm so excited for you to see it
it's definitely stepping out of my
comfort zone I never go for stuff like
this so I really hope you enjoy it you
guys have been asking for more intense
makeup looks so I hope this delivers and
I am hoping to make more makeup
tutorials like this in the future so
don't forget to thumbs up and comment
down below if you want to see more
intense fall and autumn makeup looks
this look is a really intense cut crease
pair with this bold plump lip and I love
it and I hope you love it too if you do
want to see how I achieve this then just
keep on watching so I really have one of
my eyes partially done and I've also
done my eyebrows too and I will have an
updated tutorial very soon of that so
the first step I'm going to be doing is
just taking some of this Kiko full
coverage concealer and just applying it
all over my lids because I'm using a lot
of eyeshadow today I really want to sort
of blank out all of my eyes natural
tones so I'm just applying this all over
and just making sure to set this just
because it's quite a thick creamy
substance oh I do want to make sure that
it's really set in place and the
eyeshadow palette I'm using today is the
new decay naked ultimate basics palette
and I'm first going to be going into
this matte
pinkish shade it's kind of like a
pinkish more of shade and this is going
to be our first color we're applying
into the crease so right now you don't
have to be too careful with the shape
you just want to apply this into the
crease and make sure you're extending it
outwards towards your eyebrow and I do
want to take this up relatively high as
well because we're going to be applying
a few other shades and you want to make
sure this is almost peaking through then
the next shape of taking is this
beautiful bunt orange shade and I'm
going to be taking this with a more
precise blending brush and just applying
it into the deeper part of my crease I
do want to make sure again I'm kind of
extending it towards the tail of my
eyebrow and I do want to make sure that
I'm blending it really well with the
other color that I did apply that way it
will just blend really seamlessly next
I'm really taking this deep matte purple
and we're going to be applying this with
a more precise pencil brush and we're
going to be applying this into that
crease area and we are going to be
creating that kind of Krrish ape but
they're not you don't have to be too
neat with this all you got to do is just
kind of apply it make sure it's very
blended
we are going to be cleaning up that
really precise cut crease with some
concealer afterwards as you can see I'm
just kind of creating the rough shape
that I want to create but as far as the
lid goes that will be cleaned up with
some concealer and then finally I'm
taking this matte black shade from the
palette and I am going to be taking this
on in more precise brush and just be
creating again the deep deep Ness of my
crease as you can see on the other eye
when it gets to that very deep point of
the crease it's very dark so this is how
we kind of create that kind of shape and
of course you want to make sure that
blends in a very seamlessly with the
other shades now I'm taking some more of
that Kiko concealer and we are just
going to be creating the shape that we
desire and this is what makes it so easy
because you don't actually have to be
too precise with the actual blending or
you have to be precise with is the
concealer so this makes a cut crease
super easy just following my other eye
and I created a shape that really comes
outwards towards the tail of my brow you
do want to make sure that you are
setting it in place as well just because
I did use a concealer so you do want to
make sure it's nice and set so I'm just
taking this color from the palette and
just making sure to Pat this on top of
that that way it will look nice and
vibrant it will look a really nice
bright white and also it will look nice
and set as well and your crease
throughout the day
and then also if you do feel like you
need to intensify that black you can go
in with a little bit more of it just to
make it more smokey and then finally I'm
going for a wing of eyeliner but I'm
making sure to not join it up with the
cut crease line I really like the way
this looks and I'm kind of creating a
little bit more of a straight wing
rather than a wing that really turns up
and I'm using my NYX matte liquid liner
for this and this is one of my new
favorite eyeliners I absolutely love it
and then to finish off the top lashline
I'm taking some of these certified
Calypso lashes I love these I think I've
mentioned this like a thousand times
certify on my new favorites and I'm also
just applying a little bit of mascara to
my top lashes to make them blend in
finally moving on to the skin I'm gonna
be taking these soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of
a blot primer and I'm just going to be
blending this all over my skin this is
just gonna prep my skin really nicely
for foundation the foundation I'm using
today is the Too Faced Born This Way and
I'm just blending this in with my Beauty
Blender just want to get a nice full
coverage because I am going to be going
for just quite a just a matte look I
really want it to look nice and matte
with a highlight on the cheeks so I want
to make sure my foundation is nice and
full coverage and this is one of my
favorites for my concealer I am mixing
together my Maybelline fit me concealer
and the new shape tape concealer from
Tarte
I actually only have this in a really
really light color so I have to mix it
with something that's not as bright but
I did want to go for something quite
brightening under the eyes today just
because let's just let's just add to
that drama why don't we I'm also
blending in with my Beauty Blender and
just making sure that it looks as
natural just kidding it's not natural
just making sure that it blends in as
well as possible just because it's quite
a bright color I do really like the way
that I really bright under-eye looks
though I do feel like it's quite nice
for certain looks I think it matches
this kind of look really really nicely
just because everything is so intense
I'm setting that with my Too Faced
primed and poreless powder I was gonna
go for some baking but I decided to just
set my face normally so I took just a
normal pressed powder and just set my
entire face with it I used a small brush
for the precise areas and then a larger
brush for the larger areas and then I'm
just going to finish off the rest of my
skin before I move on so I'm gonna be
bronzing my skin with a oldie but goodie
this is the Bobbi Brown bronzer and
golden light if you're a known follower
on my tan
you would remember that I used to use
this almost every single day so it was
really nice to music and it's such a
nice color so I'm kind of flowing a lot
of that again I'm just applying it on
all the areas I would like to blonde so
that's pretty much almost everywhere I
applied on my forehead underneath my
cheekbone and then also just on like my
jawline area as well and I just love the
color like isn't it so nice and then I'm
also going to be contouring using the
Kat Von D shade and light palette which
is also an absolute favor of mine just
taking the lightest shade and just
applying it into the hollows of my
cheeks I really like that this gives
such a natural but defined contoured
look it's definitely up my street
because I don't like anything too
intense so I just applied it on those
areas and also on the sides of my
forehead as well and just making sure I
apply some blush for once oh my gosh
whoa are you kidding I very rarely apply
blush dry as you can see I'm really
trying to step outside my comfort zone
this one is from soap &amp;amp; Glory and it's
matte so I'm just applying it on the
apples of my cheeks just for a hint of
color and then to highlight just just
cuz my whole face is very very much I
just want to add a pop of Pilar on the
cheeks and I want it to be intense so I
went for Jacqueline Hills collaboration
with Becca this is champagne pop and
then moving on to my eyes I'm taking
some of the makeup geek obsidian eye
pencil and just applying it into my
waterline and also applying it onto the
bottom lashline as well to really create
some smokiness and then I'm going to be
smudging out that black and applying a
little bit of that burnt orange shade to
really create a nice transition between
smokiness and then to have that little
pop of color showing through and of
course to finish off that eye look I'm
just applying some mascara to my bottom
lashes and then finally for the lips I
decided to totally step up my combat
zone and go for something super bold
just to let you know you can totally
experiment with the lip color you could
go for something neutral you can go for
something bright like a red or you could
stick to what I've done as well what
I've done is definitely probably the
most intense option you could go for but
I really wanted to make this super
intense but just know that if you did
want to take in another direction you
could also do that so to line the lips I
took some of knight morph lip pencil
from Mac and actually fill it in I took
some of Kourt K Kylie lip kit and just
applied some of the liquid lipstick and
applied it onto my lips so guys that is
the end of this full splash autumn
makeup look I really hope you enjoyed it
I definitely want to get
all fall autumn looks out there for you
