today I'm gonna be showing you the first
video of my new series called first
impression Friday well I'll be doing a
new review first impression review or a
swatch video every week I am so excited
I've been wanting to do this for such a
long time so I hope that you guys enjoy
the first product we're going to be
reviewing is the Maybelline adream
flawless fluid touch foundation his
foundation claims to even and perfect
skin with complete and natural looking
coverage has an impeccable yet
undetectable finish and is ultra thin
with a fluid touch formula it recommends
that you shake well before application
they also recommend that you hold the
dropper vertically and allow the
foundation to drop onto the fingertips
and apply to the face as usual okay guys
so I've already prepped my skin I've
applied some serum and moisturizer that
nothing too greasy it's all very matte
feeling so it's not gonna affect the
wear of the foundation and before I
start I just want to say oh wow the
product looks amazing I have to give
points to Maybelline because they've
really done a good job at the bottle of
this it has a really beautiful
silhouette packaging it looks really
high-end it feels really well-made and
also my favorite part is the applicator
this is so unique and I feel like a lot
of drugstore foundations like this they
usually go pump I don't mind a pump but
I thought this is really good for a very
liquidy foundation because this is very
liquidy like when you shake it you can
just kind of hear it just sounds like
water color that I'm using is 21 nude
I'm usually between nude and some Vegas
depending on how tired I am but
considering and that to my face and my
chest so why the rest of my body is
fairly tired but we can boys bronze it's
not a big deal
yep I'm really excited to try this so
let's just jump straight into it so the
brush I'm gonna be using today is the
Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush the reason why
is because I didn't want to apply with a
sponge because I just thought a sponge
which kind of absorb it because it's so
watery and I wanted to use a kabuki
brush just to see how it would apply so
they recommend this to be put on your
finger before but I'm just gonna put
this straight onto my face I'm gonna
talk you through it instead of doing it
voiceover because I
you guys to see my actual first
impression of it so firstly there's a
little application thing I like a lot
it's very very handy and already I can
tell it literally feels like water I
feel like it it might even be a little
bit thinner than the consistency of my
face and body
but I am pretty excited because I am
doing just like everyday stuff today
like I'm really not doing anything to
you you know I'm going to the gym
actually but I want to see like how it
lasts obviously I don't usually wear
makeup to the gym but you know just
gonna start to buff this in and just see
how one even they are applies
as you can see I have read mrs. so I am
interested to see why that actually
covered it really well
I don't know how to explain the
consistency of this it's very weird I
think a brush is probably the best way
to go I'm really impressed with that
though because when I applied my face
and body is very shiny
it doesn't really cover much and you
kind of have to go in with a concealer
but that is that is nice
I have to admit though now that it's
applying them to the dry parts of my
skin it does look quite matte it looks
really like on camera I'm gonna bronze
because I didn't want to be too dark
I've gone on my nose and I noticed like
sometimes gets a little bit dry and it's
kind of drawing Matlock it kind of feels
like a satin power did finish it dries
very quickly okay I feel like it dried
quick as you were blending it in is this
really where it's a weird texture I've
never applied a foundation with this
kind of texture before
okay following there's nothing want to
buff it look it's already dried it looks
smooth but it's weird should we apply
some more coverage that see how it
layers so I think a good quality in a
foundation is always something that you
can build so I'm gonna build up only on
the areas where I feel like I need more
coverage because this isn't everyday
look and I'm only going out you know
quickly to you know go do a couple of
things out and then I'm just going to go
to the gym because I have to do and then
we will see how it was because I think
the gym is the ultimate test really okay
so I preferred it with the with the one
layer just because I feel like it's
enhancing my dry skin this just doesn't
feel as great as I thought it would I
don't know if that's because I have
troubled skin I don't have really smooth
skin for some reason my skin is
constantly struggling with it being
smooth and perfect but there's loads of
girls new tuber their skin is literally
flawless without them even put anything
on I am NOT one of those people but I'm
glad that you guys get to see things on
someone that doesn't have perfect skin I
don't have terrible skin but I have
imperfections in my skin so stop with
the rambling I am gonna put on the rest
of my makeup and show you and then we're
gonna come back in four hours roughly
after I have come back from doing a
couple of things I'm gonna do my makeup
quickly and I will come back okay so at
the moment is 20 past 10:00 in the
morning about at the moment I just feel
like it brought out some of my floors
instead of hiding them yes it covered up
the redness it covered up some of the
scarring although
they came through but it really brought
out the dryness in my skin and my skin
is not that dry for it to be you know
crazy okay I just hate to think what it
would be like on someone with extremely
dry skin so I will see you guys in about
four hours and then we will see if
anything has changed hopefully for the
better I hope
hey guys I'm back it's been about four
and a half hours it is now three o'clock
in the afternoon I went out I was in the
Sun I have been out and stuff and this
is how it looks
excuse my no makeup thing I've just been
getting stuff done today so I have been
pretty busy as far as the makeup goes
it's sinking into my lines I am 19 years
old I shouldn't have lines but I do
it's making me it's almost aging me I'm
I'm pretty upset with this because I
want to love it like I love the fact
that it sounds like water and it feels
really like and I love from that face
and body so you know I really wanted to
love it but after time it still looks
dry it looks pretty cakey considering I
don't know why I looks cakey and put a
lot on but it's just gathering in
certain areas of my face it's kind of
transferring a little bit and it's also
dry it's a really weird consistency
maybe it works on some people but it is
not working on me I have a bit of dry
skin on my cheek here it's completely
clinging to it
it's just faded around my nose area my
redness is coming through I don't really
have lines on my forehead that maybe one
that make expressions then I've just
sunk in basically in my opinion I feel
like it's showing more than it's
covering if I'm not particularly
enjoying this foundation but we will see
how it looks after a full eight hours
and after I have come back from the gym
so I will catch you guys again in
another four hours or so hey guys so I'm
back it is now just before 7 o'clock I
have my foundation on for about 9 hours
now in my case it just I just thought
like it didn't really agree with my skin
at first it looked really dry and then
after about 4 hours it started to kind
of separate a little bit cakey in some
areas and then off in some now that
got to this part my skin doesn't really
look oh yeah I'll be honest
considering my skin does get kind of
oily and I have gone to the gym and come
back and it's still pretty much intact
so it's a good long wearing foundation
and I am pretty pleased with the fact
that it you know has stayed on it did
smooth out all the redness but for my
particular skin type I just felt like
because my skin doesn't have that really
smooth texture it does have bumps and it
does have kind of dry bits and it does
have you know rough skin on some bits
unfortunately my skin is just not smooth
but what can you do and really say on
the bottle how matte it was I mean I
don't know if it's just my skin but it
really dried matte and it was just too
much for my skin to handle so the great
thing about this foundation is that it
feels super lightweight it's a matte
consistency it's long wearing quick
drying and it's only $8.99 and the bad
things about it it clings to dry skin
sits between fine lines has a very small
color range with only seven colors and
has light to medium coverage that isn't
really easily buildable overall I give
this foundation a 5 out of 10
just because it didn't really impress me
it was quite drying on my skin even
though my skin isn't really even that
dry I didn't like the way that it kind
of accentuated the texture of my skin
and it didn't have a smooth texture
don't forget this is just my experience
with the foundation you may have had a
much better experience if you have tried
this foundation and you have something
to say leave it down in the comments
below and it will help anyone out that's
thinking of buying this foundation I
hope this review helped you guys I hope
that I touched on as many bits
throughout the video as possible I hope

series that is going to continue every
Friday please don't forget to subscribe
I put new videos up every Tuesday Friday
and Sunday hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video if you did please leave a
like because it helps me out so much so
without any further ado I'm gonna go
take this face off because I have been
wearing it for nine hours and I just
gone to stand wearing foundation all day

just gonna go ahead and do that you guys
have an amazing day
