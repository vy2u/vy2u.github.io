today is first impression Friday where
we try a new product every Friday all we
do a review or a lip swatch or a nice
for charges it's generally a review day
I just started it last week so if you do
want to see my last first impression
Friday video then please click the link
that's just here or if you're on a
mobile device then click the link in the
description box today we are going to be
going back to another Maybelline product
because this is the product i have
really wanted to try for a while it's
not necessarily new but I just haven't
had a chance to kind of wear it so I
really wanted to try out so the product
that we are going to be reviewing today
if you can already tell by the title is
the dream pur BB 8 in 1 BB cream from
Maybelline and I've been really
interested to try this because this is
promised to be good for oily skin is two
percent salicylic acid which is meant to
be really good for people that are prone
to acne or sports I myself you know have
had that kind of problem before I'll be
honest my skin used to be very very oily
was in a patch of dry skin on my skin
but now I have a mixture of the two so I
think that makes me a good candidate to
you know show you guys how it is oily
pass in my skin and also how it is in
the dry parts I have really weird skin
so this is what Maybelline promises only
back of the bottle it says it's an 18-1
beauty balm with a two percent salicylic
acid for healthy looking skin number one
it conceals imperfections number two it
helps to protect against the appearance
of blemishes number three is oil-free
and non-greasy number four is that it
minimizes the appearance of pores number
five is that it clarifies the skins look
the b6 is that it conceals redness
number seven is that it hydrates and
smooth and also number eight is it
complements the skin tone so without any
further ado let's just jump straight
into it I personally feel I like
applying BB creams in my hands I don't
know how you guys feel about that but
I'm gonna apply this my hands by the way
the color that I'm using is the medium
shade
there was only two shades available and
I think that's pretty poor to be honest
I think that's wrong in my opinion they
really need to broaden their range but
oh yeah this only had two shades as you
can see already have my eyebrows and my
am I makeup on I'm just going to put
this straight onto my skin so already
looking at this they always tend to have
pink undertones don't they this even
looks light on me and this was the
darkest shade they had in this so oh my
god that looks so lie I don't know how
this is going to lurk okay so I'm just
kind of like patted it in every area
that I can by the way I'm looking into
the viewfinder because i have no mirror
in front of me so if you feel like I'm
like staring right at you it's because
I'm like the viewfinder is my mirror for
this so this looks really really light
and I don't know what I think of when
it's really light okay the color is
really like like it's really lightining
my skin the end of the day we want to
remember that this is a BB cream it's
not necessarily going to cover
everything so I have a big fat blemish
there so as far as the consistency goes
it feels really nice and smooth it
doesn't feel oily but it doesn't feel
dry either so I'm quite happy with that
and all the areas where I want to build
coverage I'm just going to start patting
this in because patting motions helps to
build coverage with that second little
bit of layer I actually think that looks
really nice I just wish it was a little
bit darker a little bit come to the
drier skin on my nose a little bit but
like I said my skin has been extremely
dry recently I don't know what's
happening I'm actually really happy with
that like I think it covered really
nicely for a BB cream this is the kind
of coverage I'd want to go for for a
daily use anyway it feels like it's got
a site tackiness to it which I like
which means that if you are oily you can
apply a little bit more of a powder onto
it or if you have a drier skin you can
just leave it as is and it's going to
sit really nicely as the oils come
through for other day I'm really happy
with their I like the consistency I'm
liking at the moment the only thing I'm
a bit unhappy with is that this is
actually
the darkest color as far as the
consistency goes it's sitting on my skin
really nicely I like the way that it
looks my skin still is showing through
bear in mind i suffer from like you know
quite a few blemishes so I'm used to my
skin showing through if I really care
and i really want to cover it i'll go
with a bit concealer but for a BB cream
the coverage is gorgeous it actually
built really well so i'm very impressed
with the fact that it did build up
coverage and i'm just going to cover
these little bits with a bit of
concealer because i personally don't
want them to show through today and yep
i'm really happy let's see how it wears
anyway i'm going to apply the rest of my
makeup so I'm just gonna bronze up and
i'm just going to show you how it looks
with the full face on and then we will
come back in a couple of hours and see
how it looks if you guys so this is how
it looks with a full face of makeup i
actually really really like it i think
it really looks like kind of a
foundation I've had a lightweight
foundation which I'm really happy with
I'll be honest my dry skin looks really
dry but I think that's just because of
how my skin's been lately I don't know
what's wrong with it identify a kid to
something i don't know if it's because
the weather change I don't really know
what's going on but my skin is very dry
and I'm just kind of trying to sort out
anyway so I think it looks really nice
it looks nice and smooth a little bit of
concealer on to the areas where I needed
a bit more coverage and I just felt like
that was enough I feel like if this
looks nice throughout the rest of the
day I feel like I could really stop to
love it the only thing I didn't really
like was the color but I did bronze up
and it looks okay now I'm really happy
with it I think it's going really nicely
it kind of does everything at promises
which I like so i'm going to show you
guys they close up and then i will see
you guys in about four to five hours
depending on how long i'm out i'm gonna
go out for a little bit and i will catch
you back a little bit later
ok so I'm back it's been a total of four
hours I forgot to tell you the time I
applied the makeup it was about half 11
when I first applied the BB cream but
it's been about four hours and now it is
half three honestly I am extremely
impressed with the way this is Warren
it's barely even moved off my nose I've
been out in the Sun um I really like the
way it looks I feel like it's wearing
nicely do you ever feel like when you
wear a BB cream or a foundation for a
couple of hours it starts to look better
than when you initially applied it the
way it's kind of oxidizing onto my skin
I think it just looks really natural my
natural oils are coming through in a
good way they're not looking oily or wet
it just looks nice and healthy and glowy
and that's the way I like my skin to
look so I'm extremely liking this BB
cream right now I just feel like it's
wearing really beautifully and I can
imagine wearing this as a daily thing so
I'm really liking it it's just smooth
everything and it just looks really nice
considering it's a BB cream of course I
did put the concealer on the areas that
needed I'm a little bit more coverage
but yeah considering is just a BB cream
it's just meant to help to even the skin
tone a BB cream is meant for daily wear
it's not meant to give you a full
coverage I think it's just smooth my
skin as much as I want for a daily wear
and I can see this easily becoming one
of my favorites it was very light on the
skin to the touch it feels pretty much
the same as when I first applied it
it'll be interesting to see what happens
after another four hours really happy
that I'm liking it this much because I
just feel comfortable in it I don't know
if that makes any sense but I just feel
like my face doesn't feel like I'm
wearing anything I feel like the amount
of cupboard was a nice natural amount
let's see how it looks after another
four hours of wear and we will see how
it looks so i will see you at around
seven to eight o'clock is now cool to a
and it has been a 48 hours or a little
bit more since i first applied the BB
cream then we just say i am so happy
with the way that it turned out i really
like the way that it's sitting on my
skin i like how my oils are coming
through but not too much where it looks
where my skin looks glory it looks
natural looks fresh this is what I want
in a BB
cream and I'm actually really impressed
with this I had to have people say
really good things about it so I am
really happy with it i think it just SAT
beautifully and this is what i want for
something for every day something that
lets my skin show through and if i want
to cover blemishes you can just do with
a bit of concealer is fantastic
considering i haven't touched my face
for over eight hours it's holding up
pretty nicely and also the dry areas
didn't look too dry it didn't look
powdered but it also held on the skin
nicely too so it had a really nice
balance between both of those features
that's what makes me think it would be
good for people from a dry skin all the
way on the other end to people that have
more than oily skin before the price
which i will put right here you get 30
mils of product which i think is a
really nice amount of product for a
drugstore 30 meals is pretty average
it's nothing too much but it comes in a
really nice pretty-looking bottle it
reminds me of the kind of Baby Lips
packaging so what I love about this BB
cream is that i sat on the skin really
beautifully and that it would suit a lot
of different skin types it's good for
people with an oilier skin because it
doesn't have that sticky oily
consistency but it would also be good
for being with a drier skin just because
it doesn't dry completely matte also i
love about this is that it has 2%
salicylic acid which is great for people
with acne and blemishes and stuff like
that and that just means that it's going
to combat that while it's on your face
and also my skin it does feel really
moisturized as well so it does help to
create a nice even moisturised finish at
the same time it provided a really nice
amount of coverage for BB cream
especially the fact that you can build
up the coverage as well and I don't like
about this BB cream is the fact that
they don't have a wide range of color
choice I feel like there should be more
skin tones for this BB cream so bearing
that in mind I have to give this an 8
out of 10 just because I'm extremely
happy with the formula i think the flu
winner is beautiful i think that it
glides on it's smooth and it's just a
perfect thing for everyday wear i hope
