today's making tutorial is going to be
this gold and blue metallic makeup look
before I begin I just want to let you
guys know that there is a eyebrow
tutorial down in the description box if
you guys want to know how I do my
eyebrows I also have one eye done so
let's get started on the next one I'm
applying my soft ochre Paint Pot from
Mac all over my eyelids this is such a
crucial part for me especially when
doing a look including color because it
just makes the colors appear so much
more vibrant and it just makes
everything blend a lot smoother too so
I'm just applying that all over my
eyelid and then I'm going into the Naked
1 palette and I'm taking the color naked
and just applying it into the crease as
our first transition shade this will
just make everything blend a lot easier
and it just means that the blue has
something to blend into
I'm using this on a very fluffy blending
brush just to get a really nice seamless
blend
then from that same palette I'm taking
buck which is a gorgeous color and this
is just going to go into the crease just
to deepen it a little bit and also just
to warm it up a little bit because when
we do apply that blue it is gonna be a
very cool toned blue so just to warm up
the crease a little bit I'm just
applying a little bit of this with
another blending brush then taking this
morphe palette and this shimmery blue
shade I'm gonna start to apply this into
the outer and inner corner with a pencil
brush I am gonna connect the inner
corner and the outer corner with the eye
shadow almost creating a halo effect
around the eye
then I'm taking a fluffy blending brush
and just making sure to blend that color
out as much as I possibly can you just
want to make sure to really really blend
things out and just to make sure that
the blue blends in into the brown that
we applied previously the brown is there
to kind of create a nice transition
between the brown and the blue so this
is just gonna make everything look a lot
more seamless let's just try and blend
it the best that you can
and then if you feel like you need to go
back into that brush that you use to
apply the brown and just go around the
edges of the blue just to diffuse them a
little bit more and that way it doesn't
look as chunky then I'm just gonna take
in makeup wipe and just apply this on
the outer corner of my eye just to make
it look a lot more seamless and then
with the morphe palette I'm gonna take
this darker shade of blue and I'm just
gonna apply a little bit of this into
the outer corner just to deepen it a
little bit
next taking this half-baked shade from
The Naked palette again I'm gonna apply
this as the center lid color and I want
to apply this right in the center to
give our eyes that really nice halo
effect the blue really complements the
gold it's a really nice color
combination I just think it's really
different you can use any kind of color
for this you can use a white but I do
feel like gold is really really nice
next I'm just gonna apply a very thin
line of liner to the top lash line this
would just create a little bit of
definition and it'll also allow the eyes
to have something for the lashes to sits
on because this is quite a bold look you
might want to apply just the smallest
line of liner so that then lashes just
have something to adhere to and it just
looks a little bit more natural I'm
applying my ILA
1 to 6 lashes with some tweezers and
then I'm applying some mascara to my
lashes to make sure that the lashes
blend in to the false ones next we're
gonna get started on my skin and I'm
gonna be applying my makeup forever step
1 smoothing primer all over my skin just
to smooth everything out before I apply
my foundation and for foundation today
I'm going to be taking the Laura Mercier
silk cream foundation I'm using the
color sand beige at the moment and I'm
just gonna be applying this all over and
just kind of spreading it into the skin
a little bit
I'm using a damp Beauty blender to buff
this into the skin and just bounce this
into the skin to create a nice flawless
finish
I just want to make sure it says blended
as it can possibly be it's a really nice
full coverage foundation but you need to
make sure you blend it really really
well
and then with my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush I'm just going around my eyebrows
and all the other little areas just to
make sure that I don't affect the makeup
I applied previously then I'm just gonna
apply my Maybelline fit me concealer you
guys know I absolutely love this
concealer it's such a gorgeous gorgeous
shade you want to go for something quite
brightening especially because we're
using blue eyeshadow if you don't really
highlight them under eyes and get rid of
any dark color under the eyes it can
look a little bit dark under there so I
would recommend trying to brighten your
under eyes because the blue can affect
it quite I'm just gonna be blending that
in with my Beauty Blender again
next I'm gonna be setting my under eyes
with the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder and I'm taking this on a sigma
f-35 brush this is probably one of my
favorite brushes at the moment because
it just sets your under eyes so
beautifully so I'm just taking the
tapered side and getting it as close to
the bottom lashline as possible
and I'm also using that to set my
forehead and my nose as well just to
make sure that everything is nice and
smooth over next for my eyes I'm just
gonna apply some black kohl liner to my
waterline and I'm also gonna take it
slightly underneath the lash line too
this will just kind of create a nice
smoky effect and it will kind of act as
a base to apply that blue as well so I'm
just running it across the bottom lash
line and just making sure to get in
between the little lashes as well
next we're just taking some of that blue
just to add a little bit more color to
the look this just kind of ties it
together in my opinion and just makes it
look super blue and really really
gorgeous and then to finish off the look
I'm just applying some mascara to my
bottom lash line and then I'm also gonna
highlight my inner corner as well
to highlight my inner corner I'm gonna
take a virgin from The Naked palette
also and just take a very small detail
brush and just apply this on the inner
corner and this will just kind of
brighten that area and just make the
whole look look more angelic and just
feminine I really love how this just
makes the whole look pop
next I'm gonna be bronzing my skin and
I'm taking some of the mac mineralize
skinfinish in dark and I'm just gonna
apply this to my skin with a big fluffy
powder brush I just want to have an
overall bronzed today I don't really
want to contour or anything like that
because the eyes are so much so just
want to overall give myself some color
and just go around the outer perimeter
of my face and just make me look nice
and bronzed but not too much at the same
time I'm also gonna complete applying a
little bit of blush today I'm taking the
hot mama blusher and this is a really
gorgeous pink shade with a little bit of
a peachy undertone and I'm just applying
that to my cheeks and just kind of
taking it up to my temple a little bit
just to lift my face and then I also am
highlighting all the high points of my
face with my Laura Geller gilded honey
illuminator this is my favorite
highlighter ever it just gives that
really nice luminous glow without it
looking glittery which I absolutely love
and then for the lips I'm gonna be
taking Rimmel's cappuccino lipliner this
is probably one of my favorite lip
liners and I'm gonna be loving it for
the fall and winter because it's a
really nice cool brown nude pencil and
it's just so nice and I'm just kind of
running this all along the lip line
and then for my lipstick I'm gonna be
taking honey love lipstick which you
guys know is definitely one of my old
favorites I absolutely love this and I'm
just using my finger to make sure that
it's blended very well through the lip
liner so it looks nice and seamless so
guys that is the finished look for today
