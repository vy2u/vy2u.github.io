today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this midnight blue makeup
tutorial and the first step is going to
be priming my eyelid I'm going to be
using soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac and
just using my finger to blend this in
from my brow bone all the way to my
eyelid just to make sure that our eyes
are prepped for the eyeshadow that we're
going to be applying then I'm taking my
whitening lightening brow BOTS ago and
taking the lightest shade and applying
this into my crease with a big fluffy
blending brush just to prepare our lid
for any other transition colors that
we're going to apply and this just makes
everything blend a lot easier so when
you use a very light transition shade
everything else just blends with it so
I'm just gonna make sure to blend that
very well then I'm going to be taking
the Urban Decay vice 2 palette and
applying this color called rewind and
this is a cool matte brown and I'm just
gonna be using another blending brush
and just applying this into the deeper
part of our crease and blending it
upwards and I'm going to be using lots
of vigorous side-to-side motions just to
make sure this is really well blended
and I'm just gonna go back in with that
color and just make sure that it's
fairly intense and that it looks more
opaque than the rest of the transition
color then I'm going to take the light
shimmery color on the far left and apply
this on our inner corner as our inner
corner highlights and this is just going
to make the eyes look a little bit more
bright then I'm going to be taking from
that same palette this cool blue color
and taking a flat shader brush I'm gonna
be
this onto our lid and I'm just going to
be applying this all over and then I'm
going to be blending it into the crease
just so that it blends in with the other
colors that we applied and for this I'm
using a more densely packed blending
brush and then I'm going to go back into
that other blending brush just to make
sure that it's fully blended in next I'm
going to be taking this other blue color
that's just next to it and be patting
this on top this is just gonna make it
look a little bit more shimmery and it
just makes it look a little bit more
reflective then I'm going to be taking
this off black color and just applying a
really small amount of this into our
crease and this is just gonna give us a
little bit more definition then I'm
going to be taking this glitter liner
and patting that on with my finger and
it's just gonna give it a little bit of
extra sparkle of course this is optional
then I'm gonna be taking my feline eye
pencil from Mac and applying this into
my waterline and also applying this
under my lash line in between my lashes
and it's just gonna give us a little bit
more of that smoky effect and then I'm
gonna be going on top of that with that
same blue that we applied onto our lid
and just blending that on top of the
black and this just gives it that full
on a blue look and I just absolutely
love it even though it is blue it still
looks quite wearable like even though
it's blue it doesn't look too crazy
which is great then I would be playing
my mascara I'm using the extended play
mascara from Mac and I'm just applying
this on my top lashes and my bottom
lashes also then I'm going to be taking
my false lashes and applying them onto
my top lashline
next I want to be applying my foundation
and I'm going for a much lighter
coverage than I usually go for just
because I've been loving a more lighter
juhi consistency and recently just
because my skin is kind of tired of
wearing a lot of makeup so I'm applying
my Mac face and body all over my face
and I'm blending that in with a Mac 130
brush and I'm applying only one layer of
this because I'm gonna apply some
concealer in the areas that I need it
I'm using my Maybelline fit me concealer
under my eyes and on the high points of
my face and that pretty much takes care
of it because I don't really need
anything else it usually just I need it
on my cheek area but the highlight color
kind of covers that so yeah I just love
this kind of coverage and it looks
really nice and gooey which is great and
I'm just sort of patting this into my
skin using a morphe brush and I'm just
making sure that it's well blended into
the foundation and everything blends so
well with this foundation it honestly
just looks amazing and it just looks so
natural although it still covers really
nicely as well so I've been loving this
combination recently so I'm just making
sure that everything's blended in really
well then I'm just applying a really
light dust of powder on top of it just
because I do still have an oily skin and
this just prevents it from looking too
greasy throughout the day then I'm going
to be taking that same brow bar to go
from whitening lightening and I'm just
gonna be filling in my eyebrows I'm
using the lightest shade today because I
don't want my eyebrows to be too harsh
just because the eyes are quite a harsh
color I don't want it to be too full-on
and I've been loving using a lighter
color through my brows recently just
because I'm trying to go for a more
natural brow look and yeah I've just
been loving it so I'm just going to be
highlighting under my brow with a
concealer
then I'm gonna week Bruns in my skin
with my Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden
light and I'm just gonna be applying
this onto my cheek my forehead and my
jawline and this is just gonna give me
an all-over bronzed look just because I
don't my skin to look at you washed out
so making sure that my skin looks nice
and bronzed
then I'm gonna be applying my hot mama
blusher from balm and applying this onto
my apples of my cheeks and just blending
it backwards and then I'm applying my
Bobbi Brown highlighter in beige and
this is a really pretty color it just
gives you the most gorgeous soft glow so
I'm just applying that on to the tops of
my cheekbones onto the bridge of my nose
and also my Cupid's bow and it's just
going to highlight the higher points of
my face
as well also giving myself a glide then
I'm going to be applying my lip color I
decided I wanted to go for a really
natural nude today so I'm using stripped
down
liner from Mac and this is a really nice
Brown and it's a nude brow so it's not
too dark and I'm just going along with
my natural lip liner with this and then
I'm going to be going in with Mac Yash
lipstick and again it's just a really
nice beige nude it has no pink running
through it so it's great and it's nice
for when you're using em colored
eyeshadow because it doesn't have any
pink in it and it's a clash so I just
find that this went really well so that
is the end of this look guys I hope that
you enjoyed I just wanted to bring a
little bit more color back to my channel
