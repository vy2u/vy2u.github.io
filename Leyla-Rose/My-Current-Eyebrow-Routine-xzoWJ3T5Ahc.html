how to get my eyebrows and how I do my
eyebrows obviously my eyebrows are a lot
more dramatic than some but it goes with
my hair and my skin tone so that's
mainly the reason why I wanted to show
this because I do mind differently to
others probably some way doing the
similar way but you know to maybe see
people with more my skin tone or even if
you're not my kind of skin tone go for
it and just alter it to how you want it
so I like to use gel eyeliner and an
angled brush to apply my eyebrows at the
moment I used to use a pencil I've used
powder before and this is the most not
easiest for me but I guess it kind of
suits my eyebrows the most because I
have quite not truly thick and arched
eyebrows as they are so I like to use
Bobby Brown sepia ink number two I like
long wear gel eyeliner on it looks a lot
like that and this is obviously a good
color for me because I have very dark
hair and I use the del iam tours seven
six
the brush and this is the smallest angle
brush iron so it's really good and
really precise so it makes it a lot you
know easier for me I guess so yeah let's
begin shall we
why just do is I like to take and little
bit on the brush and put it onto the
back of my hand so that you can just
warm up you can kind of see that it can
just help you to warm up a little bit
and it makes it a lot easier to apply to
my eyebrows so I have combed my eyebrows
through and I am going to come a little
bit closer for you and I'm going to fill
them in so started this obviously has
product on it starting from the bottom I
am going to draw a line from the inside
to the arch and as you can see I'm using
light stroking motions I'm going to tap
a little bit more color onto there
defining the bottom of the arch and
dragging this color down and extending
the eyebrow down so as you can see that
is the bottom and that is as much as I
would go on the bottom and I'm going to
start with the top now as well
just drawing a line from the top I don't
know if I just caught up the camera
there sorry
and from here I'm going to make my arch
look a little bit more exaggerated I
guess guess that's a good way to
describe my eyebrow
Oh so yeah but just with me light
stroking motions I really have a very
light hand and you have to have quite a
steady hand as well to do this because
once you put on the gel eyeliner
obviously it's hard to get on so yeah
very gently
drinking that
and that is the shape pretty much
cupboard just going to take more product
onto my brush and just begin to fill it
in a little bit darker and this is
obviously up to you how much you want to
fill it in if you even want to fill it
in you know it's up to you completely
that you know all these steps are
optional and you know the colors the
brush the product whatever you want to
do is completely optional it's kind of
this is just how I like to do them and
just dragging the brush very very
lightly and I'm saying I have a very
light hand I am using a very very light
hand dragging this slightly more towards
the inside it's just going to make
a more graduated effect
just perfecting these little boys and
that is one eyebrow completely complete
so as you can see the difference so yeah
I really like having my eyebrows like
this I think it suits my coloring the
students my hair it kind of just suits
me and obviously if I was wearing them
you know no eye makeup I would do a
little bit less by I'm going to be
putting eye makeup on today so that is
why I am doing it dark so this is how I
tend to do my eyebrows usually as you
can see it doesn't take me a very long
time at all and if I need to I will call
my eyebrows out as well and I would just
use any concealer I'm just using bobby
brown concealer and I'm going to just
draw a very very thin line underneath it
coming off as a highlight as well as
need it
and if you want to perfect the top of
your eyebrow as well but I don't want to
do that so I'm just going to be using
the button so yeah that is one eyebrow
complete I'm going to show you the other
eyebrow but in fast-forward
so guys this is how my eyebrows look
along with a full face of makeup as you
can see it doesn't look as dramatic
anymore before when I had no I makeup on
it obviously looked a lot more bold but
with full I make on I makeup on
eyelashes all of that obviously looks a
lot more natural and it goes with how I
look so if you were happy with this give
