channel today I'm gonna be showing you
all how I like to achieve my everyday
full makeup look
so get started I'm gonna be priming my
skin using my Mac natural radiance
primer this is just a really nice
hydrating primer and I love it for this
time of year for my skin I'm gonna be
taking these two BB creams from a
Maybelline and mixing them together
because I don't have the perfect shade
so one is extremely dark as you can see
and the other one is extremely light so
I kind of just put them both on my face
and blend them together with a brush and
I love to use it beery cream this time
of year because it's really hydrating
and it covers up everything I need to
while still feeling and looking natural
which I love I'm blending that into the
skin using my ELF ultimate blending
brush I absolutely love using this for
BB creams and natural looking
foundations because it just blends in so
perfectly and it always looks so smooth
and I just love this brush
for my concealer I'm gonna be taking the
Maybelline age rewind concealer and just
applying this onto all the areas I would
like to bring forward and also to
conceal I'm applying this underneath my
eyes onto my forehead the bridge of my
nose and also on my chin this just makes
all of these areas come forward and
highlights them whilst also concealing
them too
I would usually use a lighter concealer
if I really wanted to go for a natural
look but this is more of like an
everyday glam makeup look I'm blending
the end with the same brush I use to
apply my foundation
I also like to use my finger as well
just to get into the under eye area and
just because it does push it into the
skin really nicely to to set my face I'm
gonna be using the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder you guys know I
absolutely love this powder I need to
buy a backup because I've actually hit
pan already haven't even had it for that
long but you guys know I just absolutely
love this powder I use it on all the
areas I applied my concealer just
because although my skin is quite dry
especially this time of year it still
does get oily so I like to apply this on
all the areas where my skin it does
produce a lot more oil for my brows I'm
gonna be using my anastacio Beverly
Hills brow as you guys know I use this
every single day it's my favorite brow
product and it just gives my brows the
nicest first look without being too
unnatural so I just apply this through
the brows and just define my arch a
little bit more just because I don't
really have that much of an arch brush
it through and that's pretty much it and
then to make sure that my brows stay in
place and make sure none of my curly
brow hairs flopped down I'm using my uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills clear brow gel I
love this because it really does make
sure my brows stay in place all day and
then to finish off the brows I'm just
taking some concealer underneath my brow
and just kind of highlighting the area
and also clean up as well for my eyes
I'm gonna take desert sands eyeshadow
from makeup geek and just apply this all
over the lid and also into the crease
for an everyday look I do like to go for
something simple but I do like my eyes
to be enhanced so this color of
eyeshadow really warms everything up and
it's just such a beautiful full shade
and then taking maca from makeup geek
I'm gonna be applying this onto the lid
as well using the same brush and this
just kind of darkens everything up a
little bit and gives the eyes a little
bit more dimension you can totally skip
this if you don't like to wear too much
eyeshadow but I just like defining my
eyes and then I'm also just applying
some natural lashes just because my top
lashes are so sure I don't even bother
with them because they are honestly so
hard to work with so I'm just applying
my false lashes on and then applying
some mascara to make my natural lashes
blend in a little bit better to the
false ones and then I'm taking a little
bit of a black pencil and applying it to
my waterline again like I said I just
like to enhance my eyes as much as I
possibly can so you can totally skip
this step if you don't like to apply
black but I personally like the effect
it gives my eyes and it just really
easily makes my eyes look a lot more
defined and then I'm also just applying
some mascara to my bottom lash line too
taking a flat brush and some of that
desert sands color
I'm just running that on my bottom lash
line next who bronzed my skin I'm using
this new bronzer I absolutely love this
is from ELF in the color Fiji and I
absolutely love this color to bronze and
contour and I just absolutely love it I
apply it all over the outer perimeter of
my skin and this will just kind of give
me an overall bronzed look without being
too over-the-top and then I do take it
on a more flat contour brush and just
use it to really chisel out my cheeks
and to give my face a lot more structure
I'm also using this to contour my nose a
little bit just because it gives me a
little bit of extra shape and it's a
really nice color to contour the nose
I'm taking this blush shade from the
same bronzer and blush up palette and
just applying it to the tops of my
cheekbones just to give me a little
flush of color and then to highlight my
skin I am using my Laura Gala gilded
honey this is without a doubt my
favorite highlighter ever this is my
favorite it gives me the just the most
gorgeous glow and I love applying this
onto my cheekbones and also onto the tip
of my nose to make my nose look more
petite I also apply that on my inner
corners and also on my brow bone
and then finally for the lips it really
does depend what mood I'm in I can use
any lip color with this look but usually
tend to go for a dark nude for this time
of year so I'm taking caulk and lip
liner from Mac and just running it along
my lip line and then also filling in my
lips with this just because like I said
I do like to go for a little bit of a
darker nude usually and then taking one
of my favorite lipsticks
girag cosmetics one 995 or 1995 lipstick
and just applying this on top this just
gives it the perfect flush of pink but I
did feel like it's a little bit too dark
so I applied a tad of honey love for Mac
on top and just patting that into the
lips and as you guys know I love a matte
lip and I apply a little bit of
translucent powder on my lip just to
make sure it stays all day and also to
mattify it as well
so guys that is the end of this makeup
look I hope that you enjoyed this is
obviously not a natural everyday makeup
load it's more of a glam everyday makeup
but I personally love to wear more
makeup in the fall and it's definitely
more makeup than I would in the
summertime especially for an everyday
basis but I just love this kind of look
especially for this time of year and I
just love all the tones that run through
it and it's just my favorite so hope you
guys liked it if you did then please
