so today I'm gonna be showing you my
everyday summer makeup look this is the
look that I keep going back to every
single day when I want to go for
something slightly glamorous but
everyday looking as well so if you do
want to see how I achieve this look and
also my favorite products for the
summertime then just keep on watching so
to begin I'm going to be applying some
primer and this is the Make Up For Ever
step one nourishing a primer this has
just been my go-to just because it's so
unbelievably hydrating and it's so light
feeling and I also like to apply the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot primer
onto my skin also just because my skin
is dry but also bumpy so this will help
to deal with the bumpiness and make it
feel nice and smooth and to actually add
some coverage to my skin I'm going to be
using this Chanel CC cream and this is
actually a little sample by I'm going to
be buying the full version very soon I
just cannot pry myself away from this
it's such a nice formula as you like
you'll be able to see it just covers
everything really nicely and it also has
an SPF of 50 which is of course perfect
for the summertime and all year round as
well because you do need to be protected
from SPF not just in the summer you need
to be protected all year round and not
only that it's just really luminous and
it just looks really nice I blended that
in using this kabuki brush from morphe
and I'm just going to be applying a
little bit of foundation onto my cheeks
just because the redness likes to show
through and this is the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless which is my
favorite foundation and this just covers
up that little area instead of using a
concealer I'd rather use a foundation
because it's a lot lighter and that way
it's enough coverage for me and I can
apply concealer just under my eyes the
concealer I'm using under my eyes is the
Rimmel wake me up this is by far my
favorite concealer for everyday wear
that and the Maybelline fit me this one
more so because it really brightens up
the under eye area and it has light
reflecting particles so it just looks so
nice and bright so it's perfect for an
everyday wear I'm just blending that in
with my Beauty Blender and I'm just
making sure that it looks nice and
blended in with everything so a bronzer
I have been loving lately is the sole a
tan Deschanel I just love it so much I
just thought I'd show you a cheaper
alternative because it is pretty pricy
L'Oreal Paris cushion de Soleil bronzer
is relatively similar it's more of a
could feel but it is pretty similar if
you want that glowy bronzer look so I'm
just applying the Chanel one around the
outer perimeter of my skin I have just
been loving this so much it blends so so
perfectly and it's definitely one of my
new favorites just because I love it so
much and I'm just going to be applying
this on to all the areas where I usually
bronze and then I will be setting my
skin as well and setting the bronzer
also just because everything I've used
is cream and I do have to wear this all
day so I do want to make sure that it
stays on to set all the rest of my skin
I'm going to be using the Too Faced
primed and poreless powder I will switch
between this and my well-known favorite
that you will know that I love the soap
&amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder I switch
between the two because they both do a
very similar job at the moment I am
loving the Too Faced one but also you
guys know that I have been through so
many soap &amp;amp; Glory ones all set I'm just
setting anywhere where it tends to get
oily including my eyelids because that
also gets oily throughout the day and to
set my bronze area I'm going to be
taking the bodyshop honey bronzer this
is such a natural looking bronzer which
is why I love it for an everyday wear
I'm just applying this with a big fluffy
powder brush just because I don't want
this to be in a specific placement I
just want to look a nice and bronzed all
over the outer perimeter and just to
give myself a little bit of extra shape
I'm just going to be baking only
underneath the bronzer right where my
cheekbone stops this will just basically
give my face some shape and almost make
me look like I have cheekbones but very
subtly so I just like this to sit there
whilst I'm doing the rest of my face I'm
applying some of the Too Faced
candlelight glow highlight which is one
of my favorite highlights for an
everyday wear it's so gorgeous and
subtle and it looks like just that glow
that melts into the skin I'm applying it
on my cheekbones and also above my
eyebrows
so all the things that I like to stand
out whilst I do an everyday makeup it's
definitely my eyebrows personally I'd
like to switch between a natural looking
brow and a bald brow and usually the
bold brow wins just because my brows
definitely frame my face so I love to go
for something that's on the bolder side
my favorite brow pencil for an everyday
basis right now is the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills brow definer just because
it's a little bit more subtle rather
than the actual brow wiz and it just
covers more perimeter because the actual
nib is different and then I also like to
go through it a little bit with the dip
brow from anastacio as well I have dark
brown in both of them and I just like to
go over the outer part of my eyebrow
with this and a little bit on the
underneath pot also and to set them i
love i'm just been loving loving loving
right now the benefit ReadySet brow
clear brow gel it's so good and it
really keeps them in place and this is
just my favorite and of course to really
give it some shape I'm just going to be
taking some cream concealer and applying
it underneath the brow just to really
give it that nice amount of shape and
also to lift them as well with that
little bit of a lighter shade of
concealer now typically on an everyday
basis I would tend to just wear mascara
but I do like to wear a pair of false
lashes from time to time and this style
definitely wins all the time I always
wear these lashes these are the ardell
demi whispies these are so natural on me
and I really love when lashes get
slightly longer towards the outer corner
because I feel like this really frames
my eyes and tones them upwards and just
changes the way that everything looks so
I love to apply them instead of mascara
and had a bit of a nightmare my lip
pencil broke on me but I am just going
to be lining my lips with a little bit
of the not a little bit a lot of like
stripped down lip liner and I do like to
over line my lips just because it gives
me a little bit of a pouty a look today
I over lined a lot more than I normally
do just because I was feeling it so you
guys as the end of my everyday summer
makeup look I really hope you enjoyed
and you liked hearing about some of the
products that I just can't seem to stay
away from around this time of year and
