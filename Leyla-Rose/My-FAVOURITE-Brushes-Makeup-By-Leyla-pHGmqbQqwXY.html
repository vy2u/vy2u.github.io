today I'm going to be showing you guys
my ultimate top favorite of all time
brushes basically if you are new to my
channel then you may not have seen these
brushes before but if you've been
following me for a while then all of
these brushes will be no surprise to you
because they're all just brushes that
you've seen me use a lot I had so many
brushes that I wanted to put into this
but I literally just kept it down to my
top 20 brushes because I didn't want
this video to be mean just showing you a
hunter brushes and then you guys being
really stuck for choice so there's
roughly 10 face brushes and then roughly
10 high brushes but actually meant to be
filming a makeup tutorial today but my
light for some reason is flickering I
think the bulb is going in my ring light
so it was flickering whilst I was trying
to film my makeup so I didn't get to do
it so I thought I would do this instead
because if it does flicker hopefully it
won't be a big deal because you know
we're just trying so if it does
that is why I've already purchased a new
bulb it's on its way so it won't ruin
another video for me again so if you
guys are interested in my favorite
brushes of all time then please just
keep on watching this video so first of
all I'm gonna start off with foundation
when it comes to applying my foundation
I usually tend to use a sponge and if I
am NOT using a sponge I will very rarely
use any other brush this brush is the
Real Techniques sculpting brush I
discovered this about three months ago
and ever since I discovered this I have
not been able to put this down it did
use this brush today because I just
couldn't stop myself from using it cuz I
love it that much this brush just blends
in foundation so flawlessly I love the
shape of it I love that is densely
packed with hairs but it's really nice
and soft so it gives just a beautiful
airbrushed finish it's really easy to
build coverage with this because you can
kind of buff on your first layer and
then when you want to build coverage you
can just kind of pass on coverage on any
areas that you feel like you need extra
coverage you haven't tried this brush
already and you just haven't found a
brush you love for foundation I
definitely recommend this and also I
love using this for concealer as well
because it just blends in concealer
again it's a really good size so you can
just get into the hair up really nicely
and
just love the effect it gets speaking of
concealer if you've been watching my
channel for a while you knew this was
coming and this is the Sigma 3d HD
precision brush I love this and I just
can't seem to take my hands off this
brush it's just the perfect size it has
like a little pyramid coming up to the
top and just tapers in and that just
gives it the best shape to get into the
really precise areas I like to use this
specifically for getting into like the
inner corner you guys know I love to do
my eye makeup first I once I've done my
eye makeup and I really want to get
precisely underneath my lash line
without ruining that eye makeup this is
just so perfect it's the perfect shape
and size just to get into all those
areas and gimmick in the little corners
of the nose if you wanted to go around
the lips if you had a doc limp it's
perfect and it's just the perfect shape
and I love it if you guys do on a shop
on Sigma I will leave all the links down
to the products that I've mentioned
today and also a discount code that I
will just write just down here just so
that you guys can get 10% off for the
sake of a website I wanted to mention
one more brush for concealer and this
brush is the morphe g2 brush I love this
brush I used to love using brushes like
these to blend in my concealer and I
stopped doing it for a while because I
was using the Beauty Blender a lot and
then I went back to this and I was like
why did I stop using this this is so
amazing what I love about this is
specifically the shape and how dense it
is great for specifically blending in
the under eye concealer just because
it's the perfect domed shape it's really
stiff Sloane is like when you push it it
won't kind of flip from side to side and
I just love that it's really dense that
means that when you really want that
full coverage right under I just really
packs on a full coverage beautiful
concealed look underneath the eyes to
the perfect shape and you can just see
it just fits amazingly into that kind of
shape of the under eye and it's great
for the other parts too don't get me
wrong but specifically for the under
eyes this is amazing for setting my
powder I have had brushes in the past
and I've never really found one I really
really liked I have not used another
brush since I bought this this is the
Sigma F 25 brush this is a tapered face
bar
and I just absolutely love this I love
this to set my powder so just when I
want to set any large area just you know
around the cheek or chin this is amazing
and I love the shape the tapered shape
just means that you can really get into
a little areas it's just a really nice
shape instead of a really large brush
quite absolutely love this one and it's
definitely the only powder brush I have
that I love setting my whole face with
another brush you guys have seen a
million times is the Sigma f-35 brush
this is the taper to highlighter brush
and I absolutely love to use this to set
my under eyes nothing else does my under
eyes justice like this brush it's just
the perfect shape and it's the perfect
density where it doesn't pack on too
much powder I love it because look I
mean it's just the perfect shake you can
really get into the under eye area and
just really set that whole area and I
just love it used to use the rule
Techniques setting brush but since I
found this this is just a million times
better so I just absolutely love this
and nothing's ever gonna take its place
it's just the perfect size perfect
density and it just sets my under eyes
so beautifully and I just love it those
are all of like the complexion brushes
like powder concealer foundation all of
those types of brushes but now it's kind
of on to the cheek area my bronzer brush
that I have been using for at least a
year and nothing else is going to take
its place is either waiver 101 brush you
guys have probably seen this about a
bajillion times I use this every single
day without a fail
nothing applies my bronze are the same
like I had to use a different brush
because I didn't want to dirty this one
today because I wouldn't just show you
guys what it looks like clean because
you guys never see it clean because I
use it every day literally this is 100%
the best bronzer brush I love that it
kind of tapers inward sunk it has a
tapered point on the top but it isn't
too tapered really spreads the bronze
evenly and it runs is my face perfectly
but I like to just use it on the cheek
area on the forehead and it just applies
it and just spur
is it so evenly I have used a few
different contour brushes in the past
contour but the only brush I feel like
I've loved and I feel like I really love
the look it gives me every time I use it
is the Mac one six eight brush picks up
product beautifully but distributes it
quite evenly and softly so it doesn't
give that really strong contour it just
very lightly sort packs on the product
without it being too strong I do love
this brush too which is the Real
Techniques contour brush but I just much
more prefer this little angled shape
because I just feel like it fits into
the area so much better so I definitely
prefer the Mac 168 brush and it's
definitely a must-have I feel like
whenever I don't use this I'm just not
happy with my contour so I definitely
love this the most out of all my contour
brushes I wanted to talk about this
rounded brush and this is the 1 to 6
luxe cheek finish brush I love to use
this for highlighter and also blusher
mainly for highlighters because I just
love the kind of finish it gives me it
does pick up a lot product surprisingly
I mean I don't see a lot of people using
this kind of shape but I actually really
really like it I like applying my
highlight to the tops of my cheeks with
this just because I do feel like it
packs it on really really nice and I
like a strong highlight I haven't found
another like fan brush I love yet and so
let me know if there are any other fan
brushes or brushes for highlight that
you guys really like I just really like
this one at the moment and it's been the
one that I've loved the most out as a
whole of my collection and I just love
the effect it gives me it always gives
me a really nice strong highlight and
that's what I like and the last one for
the face brushes is actually an eye
brush this is an old school makeup
addiction brushed one makeup addiction
cosmetics first opened and I purchased
this as soon as I saw their brush sets
this is from the only brush that they
had at the time if they do sell this
brush set still I will link it down
below and if they don't I will try and
find and dupe of it for you and just
because I do when you guys to get your
hands on it if you haven't already and I
love to use this brush to contour my
nose
I have tried searching for a brush that
contours my nose perfectly for ages and
it turns out it's one of the oldest
brushes in my collection coz I must have
purchased this about four years ago
maybe three four years ago and I have
certainly loved this when I contour my
nose I
to just shade either sides of my nose
and also on the tip of my nose too but I
feel like it just applies it so softly
that it doesn't look too strong and I
just love applying my berries contour
with this and I don't think I'm gonna
find a brush a lot more than this so I
love using this to contour my nose that
is all of my face brushes and now let's
move on to the eye brushes one of the
brushes that I feel like is just a
must-have for me is the zoeva
two to eight brush this is a little
brush that I love to use for my first
transition shade so when I'm using the
lightest color that I'm gonna be using
in the crease I love to use this just to
disperse that color evenly and then
everything else will just blend sort of
flawlessly after I use this brush it
just blends everything without even
needing to try it's just so soft it's
not too dense where it makes everything
look patchy it's just nice and soft and
I just love this brush so I'd love to
use this in the crease and it just
blends everything so perfectly and
whenever I use another brush for my
transition shade it does not look the
same so this is an amazing brush I
absolutely love this so this is a zoeva
to 2 beta brush another brush I use for
blending eyeshadow there's a few
blending brushes I have to show you this
is the Sigma e35 brush absolutely love
this look at how nice it is all nice and
clean you know like you see it like this
often because I'm always using hands a
tapered blending brush it kind of tapers
outwards and it's just a really nice
brush I like using this to apply not
dark Browns into the crease but just
applying not the first transition shape
but sometimes like the second color and
just making everything blend really
flawless least this blends everything
amazingly I absolutely love this brush
it's soft but firm and it's just perfect
as well my blending brush I had to
mention this is the Mac two one seven
brush I wanted to include this because
this is definitely the best Mac brush
out there and I wanted to mention it
because I haven't used this recently but
every single time I do use this I
realize why haven't I been using it as
much as that are dupes for this brush I
never feel like it's exactly the same
Mac just saw something different with
this brush compared to other brands the
closest one I've ever tried is from
Sigma I think it's the e25 brush it is
really good as well but I just love this
one a bit better I do love
Sigma 1 to the Sigma 1 is an amazing
dupe for it but I do love the 9172 this
is an amazing brush and I just love the
way that this applies dark colors into
the crease I love to use this to kind of
blend out blacks and dark Browns when
they're right there and I'll - be it
just blends everything so perfectly my
next brush is this pencil brush from
madness b21 9 brush I absolutely love
pencil brushes especially for applying
black or dark Browns into the crease
this is just how I specifically like to
get that detail in the outer corner of
this but there are Jukes
again from sigma and from zoeva there
are dupes of this as well so yeah I just
always tend to reach for this one though
when it comes to applying color on the
lid I love these two brushes
specifically and I just can't seem to
get away from them I just love them both
so much that she wants you and the Sigma
e60 are practically the same they're
kind of like a synthetic brush that's in
like a paddle shape and it just packs on
product really easily onto the eye and I
just love both of these brushes I just
can't seem to use any other brush to
apply stuff onto my lid I love this
Sigma one a million times more like I
just love the way that it feels a lot
more but the Mac one is smaller so what
I want to be a little bit more precise I
love using the Mac one I do believe this
Sigma does a small one but I just don't
have it so I definitely need to pick up
the smaller version of the e61 brush
that I use for detail it would be this
one right here does these away but to
3:7 detail shader brush and I just
absolutely love this this is so teeny
tiny the small shader brush it's amazing
for the inner corner
I love applying my inner corner
highlight with this or my brow bone
highlight a thing and I just really
really like this and again there's no
other brush that I tend to reach for
when I want to do details for smudging
on the bottom lash lines or smoking
things out there's only ever one brush I
tend to go for and this is the zoeva 2
to 6 much a brush really nice and
synthetic so it will blend out creams or
powders it's just amazing and I always
get a really nice smoke when I use this
so I'll just use it to kind of smoke out
that bottom lash line you can use it to
smoke out eyeliner you can use it for
multiple things but this is just what I
tend to use it
and I just love to use this to smudge
things so I will always use this
whenever I want to smudge something on
the bottom lashline don't tend to use
gel eyeliners often I prefer liquid but
whenever I want to create detail with
gel or whenever I'm doing like the inner
corner flick on the inner corner of my
eye always go for this brush this is the
best eyeliner brush I've ever used this
is the 3:1 to detail liner brush from
zoeva this is so this is a tiniest brush
I think I own it's a tiny aalangal so I
love it because it's very thin you can
use it to create a really nice thin line
on the ledge ever I want to use a gel I
just feel like I conquer wrong with this
because it's so small I like to work
gradually with eyeliner so I don't go
too thick too quickly and this is just
the perfect brush for that so this is my
favorite eyeliner brush ever and then
lastly I have been using this brush oh
my god for so long cuz in Real
Techniques eyeliner brush and it's basic
this was from one of their collections
I'm not sure if they do this anymore I
hope they do they love to use this to
carve out the bottom of my brow nothing
ever does it the same like nothing it
just really gets underneath there and
just really creates a nice sharp line
underneath my brow and I love the bottom
of my brow to be sharp but not the top
so I'd only use this on the bottom but
it's just so small that you can just
really get in there and just get into
wherever you want to get to so I just
love how small this is and it's just the
perfect size to use concealer underneath
my brow so I absolutely love this but I
said at the end of this video I hope you
