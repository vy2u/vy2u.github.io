today I'm going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this makeup look that I'm
wearing right now this is my go-to
everyday winter makeup look I wear this
look all the time I've literally been
wearing it constantly for the last two
or three weeks especially since the
temperatures have started to drop in the
UK it's pretty much winter here now I'm
not gonna lie it feels pretty cold
basically going to share with you guys
how I transform my skin to make it look
a lot more flawless without having to
feel like you're wearing too much in
makeup and I do have a lot of blemishes
today and you're definitely gonna see
that so I do show you guys how I cover
those maybe too much makeup for some
people but for me this is a really nice
minimal look so if you don't like to
wear too much makeup then you can just
use a little bit less than I have but
personally this is a really nice minimal
look for me anyway I like to wear a lot
of makeup sand this is definitely
minimal in my mind so guys if you do
want to see how I achieve this everyday
makeup look that's appropriate for the
winter time or any time of year then
just keep on watching the first thing
I'm going for is the vitamin E overnight
serum in oil and I notice it's overnight
but a tiny little bit of this will not
make you any more oily for my
moisturizer I'm taking the bodyshop
vitamin E intense moisture cream it
really keeps my skin and nice and
hydrated without blocking my pores which
I love keep prepping my skin with the
prep and prime natural radiance is a
super super hydrating primer it's we're
going to be moving on to our base it
really just depends on what kind of mood
I'm in and what my skin looks like that
quite a bit of scarring on my face at
the moment and a few little breakouts
here and there so I'm gonna go for a
foundation today but if my skin was
looking better I would go for a BB cream
I'm gonna be going for the Bourjois
healthy mix foundation instead you feel
like this is a great winter foundation
because it does take care of dry skin
really well you could go for a BB cream
if you'd like this is just a really nice
light to medium coverage foundation and
just because I have breakouts at the
moment I just feel like I want to cover
them so it really does depend on what
kind of mood I'm in usually my aim is to
cover the breakouts to blend in my
foundation I am taking the elf ultimate
blending brush and I'm going to be using
this to just buff everything into the
skin but my skin is particularly bad and
I have a lot of red
this I like to kind of Pat it into my
skin instead of rubbing it because that
way I can build more coverage and that
means I won't have to add on as much
product so any areas where I feel like
I'm getting more redness just use your
brush and just Pat it on instead of
rubbing everything around because that
way you will build more coverage change
you will ultimately have to use less
foundation which is what we want for
everyday wear this is one layer of the
foundation you can see my skin is
definitely still coming through so you
can stop here if that's your desire and
if your skin obviously isn't as
problematic as mine but if you do have
more problematic skin you can build up a
little bit more of that foundation or
you can go in with a concealer dealer I
love to use for blemishes is the
collection lasting perfection concealer
buying this just onto the areas where I
have spots just because this concealer
is very thick and it gets a little bit
sticky if you apply too much of it so
I'm gonna apply something very minimal
and then I'm going to be blending it out
with that same brush and again I'm kind
of going in with the patting motions
just because it does make sure that I
don't move this product around too much
and it just means this is going to build
a coverage rather than take away
coverage
yes I'm just going to be concealing my
undereyes just to take away any dark
circles and just brighten my under-eye
area and to do that I'm taking the
Rimmel wake me up concealer I absolutely
love this concealer and if you like it
really brightens up that under-eye area
although I like how it looks I do want
it to look a little bit more matte just
because I know my skin and I know that
this would totally melt off if I didn't
set it so I'm definitely going to be
setting my skin and the powder I love to
go for to set my face on it every day
where is the Naz crystal translucent
powder I really like this for an
everyday wear because I do feel like it
gives a nice amount of radiance because
it does have little light reflecting
particles in it so it does make you look
nice and glowing still to set all of
those areas I'm going to be taking this
on the precision highlighter brush from
makeup addiction and I'm just going to
be taking a little bit on my brush and
just tapping off the excess and then
just setting it
so typically next what I would do is
bronze and highlight my skin for an
everyday wear usually I like to just
bronze a little bit just to give myself
a little bit of color all around the
face and just highlight the tops of my
cheekbones and my nose just to bring
these areas forward the dark golden
mineralized skinfinish from Mac and I
absolutely love this I'm just going to
be taking this on a big morphe g7 brush
and I'm just gonna bronze the outer
perimeter of my face I'm just starting
on the cheekbone area and just sort of
passing it on to the skin then taking up
to my temple
I just like to apply my highlight on the
tops of my cheekbones this is the gilded
honey baked gelato swallow illuminator
and this is one of my favorite
highlights in the world so I'm just
applying this on the top of my cheekbone
just to give that area a little bit of a
glow and also to bring it forward as
well take a little bit of my finger and
then just pop it on the tip of my nose
just to turn my nose upwards a little
bit I do my brows on an everyday basis
differs quite a bit to how I do them in
tutorials when I have a lot makeup on me
I don't like to use too much brow pencil
and I just like to sculpt them into the
place I like them to be and then just
fill in any sparse areas so what I use
to do that is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills clear brow gel and what I'll do is
just run it through my brows and just
put them into place and then if I see
any sparse areas any areas that don't
look right I'll just go in with the
tiniest little bit of brow pencil and
just leave them looking as natural as
possible for the hairs in the center of
my brow I like to push them upwards and
then when it comes to the rest of the
brow I kind of like to take them in the
direction that they naturally grow in
but it goes to the side and then as it
goes to the town I like to push them
downwards
once the brow Joe is dry and I feel like
my brows totally in place I like to go
in with some concealer and just
highlight underneath the brow to really
bring forward the brows without actually
having to put anything on them so once I
have a little bit concealer underneath
the brow I can really see where I need
to fill in the brow and I can definitely
see on this row just underneath my arch
it just needs filling in a little bit so
I'm just going to take some of my uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills a brow is and
they color dog Brown and I'm just going
to take this and just draw in a little
bit on the areas that look a little bit
sparse
much the last thing I like to do apart
from lips is mascara I just like to coat
my lashes with the mascara sighing at
the base and trying to get as close to
the base as possible just to give some
volume and then pushing up
we line the outside of my lips I'm
taking matte cream Oh spice lip liner
and I'm just going to be going outside
my lip line a tiny bit I'm going to be
filling in the rest of my lips using
this Kiko automatic precision lip liner
in the color 501 just add a teeny tiny
bit of pink I'm taking the Gerard
cosmetics hydramat serenity lipstick
which was the collaboration with many
MUA I'm just going to do a tiny little
bit of this just on the lip and just Pat
it in you guys so this is the finished
look hope you guys enjoyed this video
this was such a super simple makeup
tutorial and I really hope you guys
enjoy it most of you guys have been
requesting more simple looks and I hope
that this was a good one this is a look
I have been wearing so much recently so
I hope you guys enjoy wearing it too
personally I can't get rid of the
blemishes just yet
I do feel like I have figured out a nice
way to cover them without feeling too
heavy I literally don't feel like I'm
wearing anything which is an amazing
feeling
I definitely feel most like myself when
I have this kind of makeup on because
like wearing it all the time I feel like
all my features are enhanced in the most
natural way and I just love this look so
