today I'm going to be showing you might
go to collab makeup look that I am
always wearing I have been wearing this
look a lot in the last couple of weeks
especially on social media and you guys
really wanted to see how I achieved it
see if you guys do wanna see how I go
about creating this look then just keep
on watching
surprise is looming I went ahead and
applied some of my Smashbox primer water
and now I'm just concealing some of the
redness on my skin I've been suffering a
little bit for the last couple of months
with acne scarring because my skin is in
the process of clearing up my breakouts
have a mintue bab I feel like applying
concealer underneath the foundation just
helps the foundation to look a lot more
flawless on those areas and now I'm just
applying some concealer onto the under
eye area this is a little bit of a
peachy tone just to color correct and
make my darkness seem a little bit
better especially underneath the
foundation and concealer and I'm just
using my Real Techniques sponge to blend
that in and I've been doing this a lot
lately because I just feel like it makes
my face look a lot more flawless with
foundational my go-to foundation lately
has been the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation it's nice because my skin is
partially dry but it also gets oily at
the same time I personally feel that
when I prime my skin right this
foundation can be really long-lasting
but it also gives me a lot of hydration
as well which works really well for the
drier areas for my eyes I'm just going
to be priming them as always using my
Maybelline age rewind concealer just
because it's a lot softer and less harsh
than a actual eye primer it's just not
as heavy which I really like and I'm
just blending that out with my finger
the palette I'm going to be using today
is the makeup revolution salted caramel
palette now the Too Faced semi-sweet
palette is of course exactly the same
but this one is a lot cheaper and I
don't know why but I just find myself
reaching for this a lot more than the
Too Faced one using a fluffy blending
brush I'm blending that warm Brown into
the crease and making sure that it's
nice and pigmented because I really like
that warmth to show through in the
crease next taking this darker brown I'm
applying that into the deeper part of
our crease to create some definition and
a little tiny bit of smokiness I want it
to look a little bit deep and just to
give our eyes some shape and I also kind
of want to drag it out to that outer
corner and create a little bit of a V on
the outer edge to really drag our eyes
upwards when we apply our winged liner
it's really going to drag our eyes
upwards and just give us that really
nice feline eye as always I'm going back
and forth between brushes to make sure
each color is as pigmented and as
blended as necessary next taking magic
act
boiled eyeshadow from makeup geek I'm
just going to be applying that onto the
lid and this is one of my favorite eye
shadows in the entire world first
we'll just look at how pigmented that is
it kind of speaks for itself but it's
just the most perfect white gold and I
love to go for a shimmery gold on the
lid I like to apply this all over the
lid and then stop right at the crease so
it's a nice solid color all over the lid
which gives us that cop crease look next
I'm going to be applying my liner and of
course it has to be winged liner because
it wouldn't be a glam makeup look of
mine if it wasn't winged liner we all
know that the wing that I'm going for is
quite thick as normal because I like to
go for quite a thick wing on my eye
shape but the only difference to I think
what's quite different to what I usually
tend to do is it's just quite angular
and it turns upwards very sharply
towards the tail of my brow next I'm
gonna be applying my lashes and of
course I'm using my Coco Goddess lashes
these are one of my favorite pairs of
lashes ever they're like the house of
lashes iconic but just a little bit
wispier and I just absolutely love them
and then to blend in my natural lashes
with the false ones i am using the
l'oreal full / sculpt Nascar which is
one of my favorite mascaras it's just
the perfect shape and then i just run
through that with a spoolie to make the
lashes look nice and wispy again for my
concealer I am using the Maybelline fit
me concealer and I'm gonna be applying
it onto all the areas I would like to
highlight so under my eyes my forehead
my chin and I'm also just gonna be
applying that underneath my cheek bone
to make my cheekbones down out a little
bit more without actually having to
contour too much because I'm sometimes
not really a fan of going for too much
contour because I feel like it's just
too much on my face he's going to be
blending that in using the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
which is the same sponge I use to blend
in the rest of my complexion products
and I'm just bouncing this on the skin
to make sure that it just blends into
the rest of my foundation
once that's all blended in I'm gonna be
baking and I like to use my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder for
this and I'm just applying that on all
the areas I would like to bake so I just
apply the powder on and just leave it to
sit for a little while and once that's
sitting and baking I'm just gonna be
filling in my eyebrows I'm using the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills brow ways which
you guys know is my favorite brow pencil
ever just defining my brows and creating
a nice angular shape because I wanted to
go for a little bit more every shaped
brow today I'm always switching up my
brows but this is probably one of my
favorite ways to do my brows I tend to
keep the majority of the product on the
outer part of my brow and leave the
inner part fairly free so it looks a
nice and faded inwards and nice and
natural and then I just like to apply
some clear brow gel to make all of the
brows stay in place and that way all of
the brow hairs can sit where I want them
to and then finally to finish off the
brow I like to go right underneath it
with a little bit of concealer this will
just highlight and also just clean up
any mistakes that we made
so now that powder has been sitting on
our skin for a little while I like to
dust this away using a powder brush I
like this pointed one because it adds a
little bit more precision and it just
makes sure that you can dust off
everything you do want to make sure that
you get all the powder so it doesn't
leave that powdery residue now I'm just
going to be applying some coal pencil
into the waterline and I don't like to
apply much on to the bottom lashline
because it really gives that lifted
effect so I only apply a little bit of
brown eyeshadow on the bottom lash line
and no mascara I feel like this really
transforms my eyes and makes them look
like that almond eye shape next for
contour I'm going to be taking the shade
and light palette I'm actually not going
to be really contouring I'm just going
to be bronzing and kind of contouring at
the same time using this one warm shade
from the palette because we applied that
concealer just underneath the contour
earlier on it really makes things easier
and it kind of just means I bronze and
my shape just kind of looks
automatically contoured so I really like
doing this and then I also like to apply
one of my favorite highlights this is
the so Hollywood illuminator from uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills this gives me a
really gorgeous glow and really makes my
cheekbones stand out and I also like to
apply this onto the tip of my nose as
well the lips I'm just going to be
applying this Urban Decay lipliner from
the urban decay gwen stefani collection
this is in ex-girlfriend I believe I
like to apply this all over this do my
go-to liner recently and then I also go
around the outer edges using stone a lip
liner from a Mac and this just helps me
to achieve that fuller lip and helps me
to over line and make it look a little
bit less obvious I know you guys
sometimes don't agree with me I really
like over lining my lips and I feel like
that darker color around the edge just
makes it a little less noticeable and
then I like to go on top of that with
the abu-dhabi soft matte lip cream from
NYX so guys that is the end of this
makeup look I really hope you guys
