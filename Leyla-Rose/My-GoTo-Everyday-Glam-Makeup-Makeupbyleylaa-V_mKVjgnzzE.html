showing you how to achieve my go-to
everyday glam lick so the first step is
going to be applying our eyeshadow base
I'm just applying that all over the lid
and blending that in really well to give
us a nice bare canvas to work on
then I'm going to take this beautiful
shimmery gold Kiko shadow and I'm going
to apply that all over the lid with a
flat brush and I'm going to Pat it on
quite well so we can pack on a nice
amount of color
next I'm going to take charcoal Brown by
Mac on a blending brush and I'm going to
blend that into my crease and I'm also
going to blend that upwards and I'm
going to blend it outwards as well to
extend the shape of my eye I'm just
using lots of windshield wiper motions
going back and forth to fully blend that
color upwards
next I'm going to take Foley by Mac and
I'm just gonna warm up this loop this is
a really nice red Brown so it's going to
warm up the look nicely and it's also
going to define my crease a little bit
more I'm using a slightly smaller brush
to achieve this then I'm going to take
Swiss chocolate which is a slightly
lighter red Brown and I'm just blending
the upwards with the same blending brush
next i'm going to take vanilla pigment
and I'm going to apply that onto my brow
bone and I'm also going to apply that
one to my inner tear duct and that's
just going to give my eye a little pop
of color and to brighten it a little bit
and I'm just going to make sure that
it's really well blended I've been
loving applying vanilla to my brow bone
it really lifts up the eye nicely
next I'm just doing a nice wing liner
I've been loving in nice big wing
recently so obviously this is my go-to
look so it's completely up to you how
big you want your eyeliner to be or if
you give them one to bring at all so
it's completely your choice
once I've fully lined the lid I'm also
going to start extending that as well so
I'm going to be extending it it's fairly
far and I'm also going to thicken it as
well
as you can see guys I'm in need of some
false lashes so I've gone ahead and
applied some falsies you can see how I
apply my false lashes in the description
box below I've linked my eyelash
tutorial there so that's how you can see
how I apply my eyelashes for now I'm
just applying some mascara to the bottom
lashes and as you can see things don't
always go too well and I have a complete
fail not good guys so guys I'm gonna be
applying some light boost to my under
eyes this is by Mac I love this for a
nice bright under eye I'm just gonna
make sure that I blend this really
really well so I'm using lots of patting
motions and I'm also going to be
blending it inside with motions as well
next I'm going to be applying my
chocolate bronzer by Bourjois and I'm
just applying that all around the
cheekbones and the forehead and the
jawline this is a really soft bronzer so
this is just gonna give me a nice
shading or bronze then I'm going to go
in with a little bit of a darker bronzer
and I'm going to be contouring with that
so I'm just gonna apply that to my
cheekbones and I'm just going to blend
it quite vigorously to make sure that's
nice and natural and I'm applying this
beautiful NARS blush with the same brush
it's quite a natural colorss and that's
why I'm applying it with the same brush
then I'm going to take this beautiful
highlight by Bobbi Brown and I'm just
going to apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones to give me a nice natural
glow
I always forgot guys I want to apply a
nude eyeliner to the inside of my eye
just to open them a little bit and to
make them look more bright just applying
my lip liner and I am also going to
apply my favorite matte lipstick at the
moment which is honey love this is
definitely my everyday lipstick
absolutely love applying honey love
lipstick
so guys once you finished applying your
lipstick your look is complete I really
hope that you enjoyed watching guys
