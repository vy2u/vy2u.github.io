today if you haven't already told from
looking at my face it is going to be a
very natural makeup tutorial I wanted to
do a extremely natural tutorial I wanted
to do this for a while now and now that
it's kind of hit summer this kind of
look is very appropriate for them summer
days when you don't to wear too much
makeup makeup look is just enhancing
what you actually have already so it's
not adding anything additional you're
literally just smoothing things over
just enhancing things little bits here
and there this is perfect for worth
going to the shops if you need to walk
the dog just if you want to leave the
house with some makeup on it doesn't
take a long time it's very simple
minimal and you just look like yourself
still and it's a no makeup makeup look
because you know someone would look at
you and not really think you know she
was wearing a ton of makeup it's natural
and it's made to look natural so I can't
wait for you guys to see this so if you
guys do you wanna know how I achieve
this makeup look that I am wearing then
please just keep on watching thank you
guys so I have started off with nothing
on my face I literally just cleansed my
skin although I am using a BB cream
instead of a foundation I still feel
like I need to hydrate and prep my skin
as normal because my skin it tends to
get oily and dry so I'm gonna put my
skin as I usually do and I'm gonna be
taking the vitamin E intense and
moisture cream to get started just apply
this all over and then I'm just gonna
apply some eye cream this is the vitamin
E eye cream from the body shop also and
I'm just going to again apply a really
small amount of this and just apply this
under my eyes and also on my lips
and yes I do have to go for a primer
even though I'm using a BB cream just
because I feel like it just smooths on a
lot easier so I'm going to be using the
Mac prep and prime natural radiance and
I'm just gonna be applying two pumps of
this and just applying this all over I
have actually been really liking this
primer just for everyday use just to
make my skin feel a lot more hydrated
I'm in love with there okay so to get
that kind of flawless but make it skin
look I'm gonna be mixing together two BB
creams the main BB cream that I like is
the dream of pure BB cream eight in one
BB cream 2% salicylic acid for oily skin
I love this but the color that I got is
way too light for me so I like to do is
mix in the dream bronze BB SPF 25 medium
to deep boom from Maybelline they're
both from Maybelline and these are just
amazing this and this are basically the
same this one is just more bronze and
this one I just feel covers a lot better
so basically I mix these two together to
get my perfect shade and just to bronze
up a little bit which makes it perfect
summer then I just like to apply with my
finger onto my skin
so to blend all of that in our Gritty
wind to blend that all in I'm going to
be using my morphe g2 brush and I'm just
gonna be patting this into the skin
but I just like to make sure this is
really evenly blended in so I'm just
taking that brush and just patting this
into the skin because I don't want it to
be sticky when my face looks this bronze
even though it does match my neck and my
body I do like to have a contrast
between light and dark so I'm gonna go
over with some of the mac mineralize
concealer in NC 25 this is a very light
feeling to the CLS so it's very thin
it's made from minerals so it is very
light it's quite radiant at the same
time so it's not too heavy this is
definitely one of the lightest two
concealers I own in texture not whitest
in color so I'm just gonna be using this
to highlight under my eyes so I just
kind of still highlight in that kind of
upwards motion but not as much as we
would do if we were going for a
glamorous look and I'm also gonna apply
some one to my forehead down the bridge
of my nose as always just to gain a
little bit of structure into our nose
and a little bit on the chin and my
Cupid's bow I'm also just gonna apply
whatever is left on the brush onto my
eyelids so this is what we're working
with at the moment I'm just gonna take
that same morphe brush and just use this
to bounce this into my skin and as you
can see it just gives off the most
natural concealed look it's very natural
and it blends very easily I'd highly
recommend this concealer for people that
want to go for something very natural
I'm just going to use my fingers to make
sure this is all really well blended in
at the moment my skin looks really nice
and flawless without having to put too
much product on it which means it's
going to feel really light I don't feel
like I'm wearing lots of makeup but I do
need to set it because these products
are all quite glowy products that aren't
really gonna set in to the skin so I do
need to set them with a powder
especially because I do get quite oily
throughout the day powder that I
particularly like to use is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder and this is
a really nice translucent powder with a
slight yellow undertone so I'm just
gonna take some of this on a real
techniques setting brush and I'm just
gonna set my under eyes first because
these are always the first areas to
crease also going to set my forehead
just to take away that shine that I
always tend to have on my forehead and
then without adding any extra product
I'm just gonna take a powder brush and
then just put that onto my face just to
make sure that all the powder is blended
and there are no additional powder
particles just sitting on my skin let's
to give us a little bit more color and
just to look more healthy I'm just gonna
be bronzing it teeny tiny bit nothing
too much because this is a no makeup
makeup look for anza I like to use when
I like to go on the more natural side is
the revolution vivid baked bronzer and
this is just the most natural bronzer
know just apply a really small amount of
that under my cheekbone and on the sides
of my forehead and then just kind of
join it up in a/c and this just kind of
gives us a really nice natural sunkissed
look blend that all in I'm just gonna go
in with that clean powder brush again
I'm just gonna go for a really natural
highlight so just because I don't agree
for anything too crazy considering we're
not wearing much on the rest of our face
I'm gonna be taking the Kiko color
sphere eyeshadow in number three and
this is just a really pretty gold
highlight and I'm just gonna
some of this onto this fan brush from
Mac and then just apply a little bit of
this on to my cheekbones I'm gonna apply
some on the tip of my nose just to turn
my nose upwards a little bit so once
you're happy with your complexion we can
get started on the other features there
for a really natural look what I like to
do is apply a tinted brow mascara this
is the prolong wear waterproof brow set
from Mac in the color quiets brunette it
ends my eyebrows at the same time of
grooming them so what I like to do is
just flick my brows upwards and then as
it gets to the arch I like to kind of
flick them downwards so at this point
they're kind of tinted and they have a
little bit of shape to them so just put
them in the place that you want them to
go it with be clean spoolie just gonna
take a little bit can see that when my
angled brow brush and just apply this
directly underneath the brow just to
clean up and this will just give it a
little bit of shape so you can totally
leave it here and not apply anything
else but I do like to apply a little bit
of brow pencil just on my arch area
because unfortunately my brows don't
like to grow at all in the arch area so
just to lift my brows a little bit I'm
just gonna literally apply the tiniest
bit of brow pencil in that area and I'm
just literally flicking it because I
don't like to apply too much
and then again I'm just going to brush
through the brows just to finish them
off and just to make sure everything
looks nice and natural and you can
totally go for some eye makeup if you
want to I'm just gonna apply the tiniest
little bit of mascara because I don't
like to go too crazy on my eye mascara
that I'm gonna be using is the what's
your type black mascara from the bombs
gonna apply a really small amount of
this onto my top lash line
and I just like to completely leave the
bottom lashline because my top lashes
are a lot shorter than my bottom lashes
so this just kind of gives me a more
open eyed effect that I've like the
bottom lashes so that's just kind of
enough for me I don't like to go too
crazy and sometimes I don't even apply
mascara because to be honest I don't
feel like it really makes that that much
of a difference so sometimes I'll just
leave it just to brighten up my eyes a
little bit I'm gonna take a nude pencil
and just run it on my waterline and this
just kind of effortlessly opens up your
arms so to finish off this look of
course is the lips
everything is so natural so I personally
usually like to go for a nude lip either
a peach nude or a pink nude today I'm
feeling nice and golden so I want to go
for more of a peach but go for whatever
you feel suits your skin we taking the
Kiko lip pencil in seven hundred this is
their smart lip pencil and I'm just
gonna be lining my lips
the lipstick I'm going to be taking my
trusty draw cosmetics nude lipstick and
totally go for a gloss as well if that's
the kind of look you actually go for for
a daily wear but for me I feel more
comfortable in a matte so guys as the
end of this look I hope that you enjoyed
this makeup tutorial of course this is
one of the most natural makeup looks
I've ever done on my channel I hope that
you enjoyed it I know it is something a
little bit different to anything I
usually do considering the rest of my
looks are usually on the more colorful
dramatic side the majority of the time
if you guys saw me outside of youtube
this is what I would look like because
this is just the look that I love to go
for the most and this is where I feel
most like myself I feel like I'm wearing
makeup it's nice it's glowy I feel
healthy and it's just you know yourself
but a more confident better version of
yourself so I hope that you enjoyed this
