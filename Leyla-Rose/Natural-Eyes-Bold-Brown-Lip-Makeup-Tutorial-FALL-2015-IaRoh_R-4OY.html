channel today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to achieve this really soft
natural eye look with this bold brown
chocolate lip
to get started today I'm gonna be
priming my skin with my Mac natural
radiance primer I absolutely love this
primer it gives off such a smooth finish
and really hydrates any dry areas so I
love this for the autumn and winter then
I'm taking the L'Oreal infallible 24
hour foundation I absolutely love this
foundation I'm just applying it all over
the skin I really wanted a nice fullest
coverage today and this definitely does
do that I did want to apply it with a
sponge though just because I feel that
when I apply it with a brush it does
give off quite a cakey finish so this
just really helps to blend it in really
seamlessly so I definitely say if you
are gonna be wearing this foundation it
works really well with a sponge
next I'm just gonna be priming my eyes
with some concealer this is the
Maybelline age rewind concealer I've
been loving to use this as an eye primer
recently just because I feel like it's a
lot lighter on my eyes my eyes can
sometimes tend to get a little bit dry
and I just feel like this can be a lot
less harsh on my eyes rather than the
Paint Pot sometimes and I'm also just
making sure to set it so that it doesn't
move for my eyes today I'm gonna be
taking the Urban Decay Naked 1 palette
and taking the color naked I'm gonna be
taking this on a big fluffy blending
brush and just taking this into the
crease and making sure to blend this
really well I wanted to create a really
natural soft eye today just because the
lip is so bold you can totally go for a
darker eye if you want to but I did want
to keep it as simple as possible so I'm
just going for two Mac colors in the
crease and one shimmery color on the lid
and that's it and next I'm gonna be
taking me color buck and I'm gonna apply
that more towards the outer be area just
to add a little bit of definition to the
eyes and also just to lift them a little
bit without adding too much darkness
like it's not too dark it's still looks
really soft and is appropriate for
daytime and I am also going back into
that previous brush just to make sure
that color is really nice and well
blended
next I'm taking the color virgin and I'm
gonna apply this all over the lid I'm
using my finger just because I do feel
like this does spread out the product
evenly without it being too harsh
I just wanted to swipe this color on
really softly
next I'm gonna apply some false lashes
this is totally optional you can go for
some natural false lashes or even your
own lashes I just really wanted to apply
some because we are going for such a
bold lip and I do feel like it kind of
balances out things really well and I
just love these lashes these are the ILA
1 to 6 lashes I've been using these
constantly I just feel like it's the
perfect amount of volume and length and
I just love the way this enhances my
eyes so I'm just applying them with some
glue and tweezers
I did feel like it needed a little bit
of liner so I'm taking my soap and glory
super cat liner and I'm just drawing a
line on the top of the lash band I'm not
gonna be winging out the line or
anything I'm just gonna be applying a
line of eyeliner and that's it this is
just gonna enhance my eyes a little bit
more and just give it a little bit more
depth
next I'm just gonna apply some mascara
to my top lashes just to make them blend
into the false ones a little bit better
next I'm just gonna be applying some
concealer this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer you guys know I love this
concealer by now it's definitely my
favorite I'm just applying it under the
eyes on my forehead the bridge of my
nose and also on my chin this is not
only going to conceal but it's also
going to highlight as well so it's just
going to give us a really nice
highlighted face and really bring those
areas forward
to blend that in I'm gonna be using the
Beauty Blender again just to make sure
that it blends really seamlessly into
the rest of my complexion we don't see
any harsh lines and the beauty blender
does that absolutely flawlessly I
absolutely love the finish that a beauty
blender gives I don't use a sponge all
the time but when I do I just always
love the way that my foundation comes
out
and also just to blend out these smaller
areas I'm gonna be using my finger just
to help me out a little bit and also
just to get into all those little areas
that the sponge can't reach next I'm
gonna be setting all the areas I applied
the concealer I'm gonna be using my soap
&amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
I know surprise surprise it's definitely
my favorite powder so I'm sorry I'm
using the same powder all the time but I
just absolutely love this one and if you
can get your hands on it I definitely
recommend that everyone buys this
because you will not regret it it's an
amazing powder
and then taking a larger brush I'm just
gonna go on the rest of the face as well
just so that my bronzer and everything
will gone really seamlessly and
everywhere is zapped next I'm just gonna
do my eyebrows off camera just because
you guys have seen me do it a million
times but I will put my eyebrow tutorial
down in the description box for you next
I'm just gonna take a little bit of that
buck color from that palette and just
apply it onto the bottom lash line
taking some more of that virgin shade
that we applied on the lead and just
take a small brush and apply it on the
inner corner to open up our eyes and
then I'm just taking a nude pencil and
just applying it to our waterline this
will just make our eyes appear a lot
brighter and also open them up as well
and then to finish off the eye look I'm
just gonna be taking some mascara just
to it really balance the top and the
bottom lashes
next I'm gonna start bronzing my skin I
am using the Bobbi Brown bronzer in
golden light it's been a while since
this bronzer has made an appearance but
I definitely love this bronzer I stopped
using it because I was running out and I
didn't want to finish it so I blew it
out again because I love using this kind
of color for the winter time it's not
totally yellow toned it does have a
little bit more of that bez tone so it
is nice up for the winter so I just
prefer using this kind of color in the
winter so just applied that all over the
outer perimeter of my face and then
taking hoola bronzer by benefit I'm just
contouring the cheekbones just to give
my face a little bit more definition I'm
also using that same hoola
to contour my nose a little bit as well
for my blush today I'm gonna be taking
Mac warm so and just applying a tiny
little bit on my cheekbones just to give
myself a little bit of color
and then to highlight I'm gonna be using
the laura geller gilded honey
highlighter I absolutely love this and
I'm just applying a fairly small amount
nothing too much on the cheekbones and
also on the tip of my nose
and for the lips today for the star of
the show this is definitely the main
attraction of this look I'm gonna be
using Matt chestnut pencil all over the
lips now I wasn't sure what kind of
brown I wanted to go if for this look
but I definitely knew I wanted to go for
a brown just because I have seen so many
brown shades recently and I personally
have never done this on my channel
before and I've actually don't think
I've ever worn this kind of color before
so I just knew I had to do it at least
once and I actually really loved it I
think I'll be doing this color a lot
more I just lined all of my lips with it
and then also filled in although I did
make sure to moisturize my lips before
hands just because this can be very
drying
so guys that is the end of this makeup
tutorial I hope that you enjoyed
although it is something a little bit
more simple it's definitely something I
love you guys were requesting a more
simple eyelet with a bold lip you can
totally substitute the brown for any lip
color you want I just really wanted to
do something a little bit different I
didn't want to do something typical like
the dark purple I do sometimes and also
red I wanted to change up a little bit
and if you haven't tried brown I
definitely recommend it because although
I'm not a bold lip person I am loving
this if you did enjoy this video then

does help me out a ton and subscribe to
