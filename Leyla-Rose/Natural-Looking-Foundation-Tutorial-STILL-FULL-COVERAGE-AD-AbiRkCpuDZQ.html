today I have a glowy natural foundation
tutorial that still gives you coverage
it's perfect for me right now because
I'm still suffering with acne and I'm
gonna be using one of my favorite
foundations today and that is the ex1
invisi wear foundation you guys know how
obsessed I am about it and it's actually
available now in selected boot stores
which I am so excited about because I
just love that foundation so much
it's available in 184 stores now so if
you guys do want to see how to achieve
this look then just keep on watching so
as you can see I'm starting off with
nothing on my skin and I am first of all
just going over my skin with an
exfoliating pad I sometimes like to do
this before I do my makeup because I
just find that the acids that within and
exciting that just helps to kind of like
clear away anything after I've cleanse
my skin and I do really like to prep my
skin well whenever I'm doing my
foundation even if my skin isn't at its
best
especially if my skin isn't at its best
I really like to make sure that I
moisturize well and also prime well as
well so I went in first of all with a
moisturizer and now I'm going in with a
moisturizing primer and it's funny I
really like to use two primers just
because I find that this really helps to
prep my skin well so the foundation just
goes on so smoothly especially if I have
acne going on just because I feel like
it helps to deal with every skin issue
so now I'm just applying a smoothing
primer and this just helps to fill in
all the pores and then we can go in with
some color correction and you guys have
seen me do this quite a few times before
but I just like to go on top of my acne
scars with some green concealer just cuz
I find that this really helps to cut
down on that redness so now it's time to
go in with foundation and I'm so excited
because I'm gonna be using the ex1
foundation and as you guys know this is
my favorite foundation ever I'm finding
my perfect shade and the way that I like
to do this is apply a little bit on at
the bottom of my chin to see if it
matches with my neck and that is how I
find my perfect shade I'm just applying
this with a flat top brush and this is
my favorite way to apply this side
the reason why I am so obsessed with the
ex1 foundation especially now is because
it's available in 13 shades it used to
be available in only five but now
they've extended their range and it's
also available in boots and this
foundation is so special to me because
it really matches my skin well and I
find it so hard to find a foundation
that matches so perfectly but this one
does and I'm obsessed with that so I
just love the way that this foundation
looks it looks so natural and effortless
on my skin it kind of just looks like
I'm not wearing much but it still covers
everything I need to which is amazing
and what I also love is that there is a
perfect shade for me now before I used
to have to mix two colors to get my
perfect shade but now I am the shade 11
and I'm so happy that it matches me so
well I honestly love how well this
foundation matches me I find that a lot
of foundation brands or makeup brands
they use a lot of pink tones or yellow
tones too much and I find that it just
looks unnatural on the skin but this
just looks so golden and natural and
that's because of the pigments that ex1
actually uses they use specific golden
pigments to make it look more natural
and more like skin the best part about
this foundation is that it's only 12
pounds 50 and it's available now
nationwide across the UK and Ireland in
184 boots stores which is so amazing so
now you can go and test it for yourself
and you see how many shades there are to
actually try it I also just applied some
concealer under my eyes now and that's
just too bright in the under eye area I
didn't want to apply too much just
because yeah I wanted it to look natural
so I used a fairly natural-looking
concealer that's kind of similar to my
skin tone just a little bit brightening
but nothing too crazy and then I just
blended that in with my fingers and a
brush and I set it with translucent
powder now this foundation honestly
looks amazing on its own but because I
have oily skin I find that when I set
the x-1 foundation it just allows my
oils to come through naturally through
the day so if you have oily skin maybe
set it in the t-zone area if you have
dry skin you'll be good to just apply
this straight onto your skin and it
would just look so natural and glowy and
I'm just obsessed with that so just
because I've got acne right now I'm just
going to be going over with a pressed
powder on the areas where I have acne
just because they are so dark I didn't
want to apply too much foundation
and then I'm taking a powdered
foundation in a lighter color and using
it under the eyes to really brighten
that under-eye area and I really love to
do this especially what I want to go for
something a little bit more full
coverage but it actually looks
surprisingly natural and then another
thing that I love to do is use a darker
shade of a pressed powder and use that
as a bronzer so I'm just using that
around the outer perimeter of my face
and this is one of my favorite things to
do especially if you have acne on your
skin because it's weird it's almost like
it gives you coverage at the same time
as bronzing your skin because obviously
it has pigment within the pressed powder
it's kind of bronzing my skin but it's
giving me that like coverage at the same
time and then I'm also just applying a
highlight on to the top portion of my
cheekbone above my eyebrow and then also
below my eyebrow as well just to have
that really nice glow as I turn to the
side and I'm just using your brush to
just press everything into the skin to
make it look natural and just setting it
with a spray and that's pretty much the
end of this skin look guys I love this I
do this kind of look all the time it's
honestly my go-to when I want to look
natural and glowy and this is how it
looks with a full face of makeup I love
it it's still full coverage but it has
that real nice skin like glow to it I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
