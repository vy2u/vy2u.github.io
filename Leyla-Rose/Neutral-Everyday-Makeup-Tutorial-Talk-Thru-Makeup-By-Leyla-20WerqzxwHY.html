today's makeup tutorial is going to be
the look that I'm wearing right now I
decided to do a talk through for this
one it's not really a talked through
because it is honestly so simple but
instead of doing a voiceover I just
really wanted to kind of just talk to
you guys a little bit cuz I missed you I
haven't actually recorded in about a
week I mean I obviously still have been
uploading but a lot of them were kind of
pre-recorded so I have really missed
sitting down and working so I just
wanted to talk you guys through it but I
really wanted to show you guys a nice
everyday look this is obviously an
everyday look that you can wear for
stuff like shopping work school still
kind of feel like yourself which is nice
and I wear this book so much so I really
wanted to share this with you guys and I
want to do a little bit more of a talk
with you rather than do a voiceover but
just because I missed talking to you
guys and you do want to know how to
achieve this really easy neutral
everyday like then please just keep on
watching if you guys don't start it off
with a no makeup at all and I'm just
gonna get straight into it by the way in
my hair don't even don't even say
anything my hair is everywhere I've
already moisturized my skin so the first
thing I'm gonna be doing is using my Mac
prep and prime natural radiance and I'm
just gonna be applying this all over
I've actually really been liking this
primer recently because it's really
hydrating and it kind of smoothes the
skin at the same time and it has a
really cooling effect so it kind of
makes the skin feel a little bit cool
before you pick up anything on I don't
know whether it's necessary but it just
makes the skin feel really nice so I'm
just applying this all over my skin and
my skin just kind of feels really plump
after using this and when I used to work
for Mac I was never really that fond of
this primer but now my skin has changed
actually really did I guess hey so next
I'm gonna be applying my foundation
because this isn't everyday look you can
of course go for a BB cream or something
like that I just decided I wanted to go
for a foundation just because this look
isn't going to be like a no makeup
makeup look it's still gonna be like
something you can wear for everyday but
it still involves you actually putting
on a decent amount of makeup so I'm
using my Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation and I'm just gonna start to
do it all over my skin
and with this foundation because it's
quite thick I kind of just like to rub
it a little bit as well just so that
it's ready for when I apply my sponge on
top of it and the color that I'm using
is cashew base just because I haven't
tanned so this is kind of like my light
shade when I'm light up then I'm gonna
go in with my sponge and I'm just gonna
be bouncing this onto my skin just to
make sure everything is nice and blended
and this just gives you the most
flawless finish in the whole world so
I'm just gonna be bouncing this onto my
skin and I've just been loving this
foundation the past two months or so
it's just the perfect coverage for me it
gives you a really really gorgeous
coverage but it kind of gives you a
little bit of like luminosity at the
same time so I really like it okay so
once that it's all blended in an idiot's
type on my eyes I'm gonna be using my
state of it straight primer from benefit
it has been a while since I've used this
I've been using the soft ochre Paint Pot
for a while now I'm using this just
because this is a little bit lighter
than the soft ochre Paint Pot that's
quite thick and because we're going for
something really simple on the eyes I
just want to do something really really
you know white so if I go for soft ochre
it just might be a bit too much so I'm
just using this all over my lid I'm just
gonna blend this out with finger so
because my eye primer is it'll be sticky
I'm gonna be using the soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch pressed powder just on a
sigma sigma e30 brush I think it's
rubbed off because I've had this brush
up in the treaty so long but I'm just
gonna be applying this all over my lid
just to very lightly set everything I
don't apply too much of this powder just
a little bit next I'm gonna be taking
these away over 2 to 8 brush and I'm
gonna be taking my bronzer this is the
mac mineralize skinfinish and dog golden
and I'm just gonna start to apply this
in my crease and this is one of my
favourite bronzers at the moment because
it's just got a really nice neutral tone
to it it's warm but it's not too orange
at the same time I'm really liking
especially for this summer and I'm just
gonna reapply this into my crease cuz
it's actually a really nice transition
shade so I'm just blending this in and
just basically using it to define our
crease a little bit so I'm gonna be
taking the tiniest little bit of Mac's
did I shadow and just apply a really
small amount with this into my deeper
part of my crease just because I want to
give it a tiny little bit of definition
but not too much and I'm just applying
this into the crease and just blending
it back and forth and just making sure
that blends into the previous shade next
on my lid I'm gonna be using the Kiko a
color sphere eyeshadow in number three
and this just is a really pretty
shimmery gold color we're just gonna
take a really small brush to apply this
all over my lid just basically all I'm
gonna do for the eye shadow just because
I want it to be really natural because
I'm just gonna apply some mascara and
then we're gonna apply our force lashes
guys don't wanna apply false eyelashes
it's completely optional
I just don't mind wearing eyelashes for
everyday wear but it's completely up to
you I just just give me a little bit
more of extra definition and I'm gonna
be using a fairly natural pair but is is
of course up to you and for my lashes
these are the 102 Demi of a random brand
I'm not sure what brand this is these
are literally exactly the same as Max
Evans and yeah I can't tell you about
the name but I know that they are called
102 Demi
I'm not sure and I'm gonna apply these
lashes onto my lash line I can never
talk when I do this
so these lashes are literally one of my
favorites just because they look like
when you apply a lot of mascara and they
kind of go spiky kind of reminds me of
that so I'm completely fine with wearing
lashes especially when they're not true
like these or another one of my
favorites are the demi whispies from
ardell they're amazing as well so he
said while the lashes are kind of drying
I'm just gonna do my eyebrows
so next I'm gonna get started on my
concealer so I'm gonna be using you can
see that it's a couple of shades lighter
than my skin just so that I can kind of
highlight these areas as well and I'm
just gonna be using the Maybelline fit
me concealer I'm just applying this
under my eyes and I'm gonna kind of be
putting it in an upside down triangle
shape and I'm just gonna be blending
that in the same sponge I used to apply
my foundation and I'm just gonna be
balancing this into a mask yeah
so once I've kind of blended all the
areas that are kind of blendable with
this sponge I like to go in with a
smaller brush and the brush I'm going to
be using is the Sigma 3d HD procedure
because it's just so easy to blend in in
lower areas that you can't reach so I'm
just gonna be using this to blend in in
the little corners of my eye and just on
the bridge of my nose and that way we
can kind of get a nice sharp line here
and what the old days just kind of lift
the face as well it's I'm gonna be
sitting my under eyes with the soap and
glory powder again this is the instant
retouch pressed powder and I'm just
gonna be using a real techniques setting
brush and just making sure there's no
creases so looking up it's just gonna
make sure that it prevents any creasing
I'm going to be taking another Zoe over
to 3:7 brush and I'm just gonna be using
that to apply the uninterrupted
eyeshadow onto my bottom lash line
next we're gonna apply some mascara to
our bottom the lash line and then to
finish up I'm gonna take a skin tone
pencil and apply that to my waterline
just to finish up the either to make it
look nice and bright so I'm gonna start
to bronze my skin and just so I can give
it a really nice pretty cool eye and you
guys don't have to bronze as much as me
I like to be bronzed but it's completely
up to you a lot of you guys say to me
that my bronze is too much but I'll
that'd be a bronze to me and I'm gonna
carry all the world I just love that
kind of bronzed effect and because I
have quite tan skin it kind of my face
always ends up being lighter than the
rest of my body somehow so bronzing on
my face may look a lot on camera but in
real life it really does help and it
kind of just evens everything out so
yeah so I'm just gonna be applying this
onto my cheeks and I've got to apply it
onto my forehead and then I kind of just
go up in AC shape and just kind of runs
everywhere and just make me look like
I've been in the Sun a sick thing okay
this is an everyday look I don't want it
to be too crazy on the contour so I'm
just gonna use a really small amount of
the Bahama Mama bronzer from the balm
and just that should he use it to very
slightly chisel the cheeks and then to
finish off the skin I'm gonna be taking
the Becca opal highlighter and I'm just
gonna be applying this onto the tops of
my cheekbones just to give us that glow
visits an everyday look I really like to
look like I'm glowing because even
though I've used kind of like a matte
finish of a foundation this will just
kind of make you look really nice and
healthy so where I like to put it is on
the top of my cheekbone and just above
my eyebrow I'm also gonna pop it on the
edge of my nose just to turn my nose up
with a little bit and then I'm also
gonna apply it my Cupid's bow so for me
a nude
just has to be done but of course you
can pick any lip color any lip color is
actually gonna go with this you could
pick a bright lip a dark lip as I've
kind of got this golden face going on I
really just want to go for a really nice
peachy nude so I'm gonna be using two
lip liners and a lipstick today so I'm
gonna get started off with the aroma
addiction
lipliner and I'm just gonna be using
this almost all over my lips so I'm just
gonna be lining my lips and then kind of
filling them in as well
someone we taking one of my favorite
lipsticks and this is the Gerard
cosmetics nude lipstick I'm just gonna
be applying this all over my lips and
then to kind of cool this down a little
bit I'm gonna be taking the cappuccino
the planner from Rimmel and then I'm
just gonna be kind of lining the outside
of my lips with this so guys that is the
end of this look I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I really wanted to do
something a little bit more on the
natural side really wanted to do a look
that you guys could wear everyday and
this is obviously a look that is not a
no makeup makeup look you guys want to
see my version of a no makeup makeup
look and if you guys don't know what
that is that's basically like making it
look like you're not wearing anything

something that you can wear when you're
