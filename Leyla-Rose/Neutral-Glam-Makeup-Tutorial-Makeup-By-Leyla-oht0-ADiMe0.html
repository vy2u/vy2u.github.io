you're pulsing through me
the blood is rushing
see No
come save me
my
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
today's makeup load is on this neutral
glam makeup
to get started we're gonna start by
applying our soft ochre Paint Pot to our
eyes as our primer and what this is
gonna do is it's gonna lighten our
eyelid just to make sure that the colors
appear more vibrant and it's also gonna
make all the eye shadows stick and blend
easier next we're gonna take
uninterrupted eyeshadow from Mac and
we're gonna apply this into our crease
as our transition shade this is gonna
create a really nice warm effect in our
crease and it's just a really pretty
color to give us nice amount of warmth
and also definition as well so I'm using
a large crease brush and just going back
and forth and pulling this in to the
very inner part of our crease then I'm
gonna take a clean blending brush and
this is from Sigma and I'm just gonna
use it to buff this color upwards with
no product on it then I will go back
into that large crease brush again with
the uninterrupted shade and just go back
in to create more definition and to make
sure that color is nice and vibrant
then I'm gonna be taking this chocolate
shade from the Smashbox full exposure
palette and just be applying this to our
outer V to create a really nice soft
amount of definition and I'm using a
small crease brush for this just to
create a nice amount of definition then
I'm gonna be taking one of the L'Oreal
single eye shadows and I'm gonna be
applying this on my lid with a short
shader brush and this one is from Sigma
and I'm just gonna be applying it onto
my lid and just patting it on top just
to make sure that it looks nice and
smooth all over our lid and it's just
gonna create a really nice open eyed
effect then I'm going to be using a
smaller brush to apply some light
pigment on to the inner corner of our
eye and it just makes the eyes look nice
and open then I'm gonna start doing my
winged liner I'm gonna be doing it a
little bit different today because I'm
almost gonna be creating a half winged
I'm gonna start by doing the wing on the
outer corner of my eye
and I want the line to be thicker
towards the outside of my eye and then
quite thin on the lid of my eye as you
can see I made the wing first and then I
joined up the lines to the lid and as it
gets to the lid I want to make sure that
the lines are quite thin next I'll apply
some mascara and then apply our force
lashes this is of course optional but I
just fooled that lashes give us that
little bit of extra drama and I love me
some drama thanks I'm gonna get started
with the skin and I'm gonna be applying
the serum from the body shop this is the
vitamin E 1 just to give me a nice
amount of hydration then I'm gonna be
taking the natural radiance primer from
Mac and just be applying this all over
my skin to give myself some hydration
and also so that our foundation can go
on smoothly
next I'm going to be applying my
foundation and just dotting it all over
my skin the foundation that I'm using is
the Laura Mercier silk cream foundation
and I'm going to be bouncing this into
my skin using a real techniques miracle
complexion sponge and this just creates
the most flawless skin and I really
wanted my skin to be really flawless
because the eyes and the lips are quite
simple you kind of want to make sure
that your skin looks as flawless as
possible because otherwise it will kind
of draw on your imperfections
considering there's nothing bold about
your makeup look so I'm just going to
use the sponge to bounce this into my
skin and just ensure that I have a nice
even layer next I'm gonna be applying my
NARS radiant creamy concealer under my
eyes and then I'm also gonna be going
into my Maybelline fit me concealer and
just be applying that slightly
underneath just because this is a little
bit thinner and it's also more yellow
tone to the more pink undertone goes
right under my eyes to cancel out the
darkness and then the yellow tone just
underneath it to brighten and highlight
their areas and then I'm also applying
it onto my forehead my Cupid's bow my
nose and my chin and I'm just gonna be
using the same sponge to apply this into
the skin
and as you can see I'm just taking that
sponge and just buffing it onto my skin
and this just makes the coverage just go
really smoothly as you can see it's just
applying it so smoothly onto my skin and
when it comes to these smaller areas
that I want to reach I'm gonna go in
with a brush just because it helps you
get into them tiny little precise areas
and the brush that I'm using is the
Sigma 3 DHT precision brush this has
been one of my favorite brushes this
month I've just been so in love with it
just because it literally gets into any
area that you need to and it's great for
someone like me because I need to be
precise so I'm gonna be using my finger
to blend in the concealer on my nose and
then I'm gonna be baking my under eyes
using the Mac CC neutralized powder and
I'm just applying this under my eyes and
I'm just gonna allow it to sit for about
two to three minutes and this just
creates a really nice bright under-eye
effect and it also makes sure that it
sets really well and then whatever's
leftover on the powder I'm just pressing
the sponge into my skin just to create a
really nice flawless effect and to
mattify them areas also then I'm just
taking the Real Techniques setting brush
and just buffing away all of that powder
that's left over
you
then I'm just gonna be using a clean
powder brush just to make sure that's
all taken off my skin and then I'm going
to be going into my eyebrows you guys
have seen me do my eyebrows and many
times before if you do want to see my
full eyebrow tutorial then please click
the link in the description box
next I'm gonna be bronzing my skin with
the Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light
I have almost finished this and my heart
is broken I am looking for a really good
bronzer to definitely let me know your
favorite bronzers guys because I need a
new one and I'm so in love with this one
so I don't know how am I just have to
repurchase it I'm just applying this all
over my cheek area on my forehead and
just making sure to make my skin look
nice and bronzed on the outer perimeter
of my face I'm also gonna be doing a
little bit of contouring today so I'm
taking these sleek contour kit and
medium and the Real Techniques contour
brush and just apply it to the hollows
of my cheeks and then just buffing that
out with the bronzer brush and then I'm
also gonna be taking the makeup
addiction the blender brush I'm just
applying this on either side of my nose
to create a little bit of a nose contour
and then I'm taking the NARS blush in
lustre and just applying this onto my
cheeks and rolling it backwards next I'm
gonna be applying my highlighter the
highlighter I'm applying is the Becca
cosmetics highlight in opal and this is
the pressed version this just gives me
the highlight that I need in life it's
just so gorgeous and gold and it's
amazing for the kind of olivey skin
tones or deeper skin tones as well but
it's great for someone that has that
kind of olive undertone cuz it just
brings them undertones out then I'm
gonna taking my favorite lip liner which
is primo spice lip liner from Mac and
then one of my favorite nude lipsticks
which is the Gerard cosmetics nude
lipstick it's one of my favorites guys
it's amazing and I'm just applying this
all over my lips and then just using my
finger to blend that in to the lip liner
also I'm gonna be going into my
waterline with a cream pencil and this
is gonna open up our eyes and make our
eyes look a lot larger than they
actually are then I'm just gonna apply a
little bit of that dark brown eyeshadow
that we applied into the crease I'm just
gonna apply that onto the bottom lash
line and then we're gonna go into some
mascara to finish off the look
so guys that is the end of this tutorial
