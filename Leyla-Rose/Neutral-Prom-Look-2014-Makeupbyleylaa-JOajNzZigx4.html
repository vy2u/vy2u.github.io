you how to achieve this beautiful
neutral prom look and it is a beautiful
look that can be used with any lip color
so I'm going to show you just how to do
so so the first step in achieving this
look is going to be applying our
foundation the foundation that I'm using
is Laura Mercier silk cream foundation
in kashew beige and I'm using a sigma
angled kabuki brush to apply that all
the names and numbers of brushes will be
in the description below guys and make
sure to check that hour as well so just
making sure that's fully buffed in with
that same brush just working that in I
am also going to be defining and
thickening my brows with Mac spiked
eyebrow pencil absolutely love this
pencil it is so good for defining I
think it gives so much more definition
opposed to a pencil that you shop there
so I'm just thickening and defining my
arch a little bit more
and I'm also going to brush that through
as well with a another eyebrow pencil
but just to soften the inner part of my
eyebrow I'm also going to carve the
eyebrow out a little bit as well just to
thin them out a little bit and to make
them look more defined
I am applying my Paint Pot in laying low
by Mac just to give us a nice bare
canvas for us to work on I'm also going
to be using the Smashbox full exposure
palette and I'm using this champagne
shimmery color from the top row this is
such a beautiful palette it has all the
shimmers that you need and it also has
loads of matte colors so I'm gonna be
using that for the whole tutorial I also
applied some fixed glass to my brush
before hand to make the color stand out
a little bit I'm using this soft brown
color for the crease and I'm going to
just use a blending brush to blend that
into the crease and also upwards and
outwards as well to extend it
I'm going to be using this expresso
color from the palette as well just to
darken the crease a little bit more and
again using quite vigorous and
windshield wiper motions in the outer
corner as well just creating a tiny
little B at the outer edge
next I'm going to be applying some
liquid liner I'm just doing quite a
standard that could liner to be honest
with a wing at the end the only thing
that is a little bit different about
this wing is I'm going to be thickening
it more towards the outside than it is
on the lid so you'll see in a sec how I
thickened the wing but I don't think in
it closer to the inside of the lid
I'm going to be taking that matte black
from the palette as well and I am going
to be applying that with a Smashbox
blending brush and I'm just going to be
applying that in windshield wiper
motions and concentrating that in the V
then I'm taking that small blending
brush from before and just going to be
blending that black out a little bit
more to make you look more diffused
I'm also going to be applying some
glitter liner to the lid on top of that
champagne color this is from collection
mm and it is so beautiful I think it
catches the eye a lot better and it just
makes it look really nice and pretty and
bright so I'm just going to be applying
that all over the lid I'm also going to
be applying a brown pencil liner to the
inside of the eye and taking that
underneath the lid as well with an
angled brush I'm just using Brown
because I think it's a little bit more
and natural rather than going for black
because sometimes black can be a little
bit harsh just applying vanilla pigment
to the brow bone and the inner corner
just to highlight a little bit I think
this is really nice to brighten up the
eye and I'm also going to be applying
mascara to the top and the bottom of the
lashes I've also gone ahead and applied
some false lashes not too on camera
because I've already done a full /em
tutorial so that's going to be up soon
and I'm just gonna be applying my
concealer which is also my highlight
which is the age rewind concealer in
light really we love this concealer and
I'm just applying it everywhere that I
want to highlight I'm going to be
buffing that in with the same brush that
I used for my foundation just in
circular and side with motions just to
get that fully buffed in
so next I'm going to be bronzing just
around the face with a nice big fluffy
brush I am using dark mineralized
skinfinish from Mac just to give me a
little bit more color and I'm just gonna
be applying that on my cheeks and around
the forehead and chin area
I'm also gonna concentrate that a little
bit more on the cheeks with a smaller
brush and then I'm also going to go into
hoola by benefit and I'm going to be
using a smaller contouring brush just to
give my cheeks a little bit more shape
I'm also going to apply this really
really beautiful pink blush by Mac which
has a really nice gold reflex to it and
I'm going to apply that to the apples of
my cheeks and I'm going to be blending
it out with a big dura fiber brush to
make it look nice and diffused and
natural next I'm going to be applying
some of my highlight I'm using soft and
gentle by Mac this is just a nice soft
highlight for the tops of the cheekbones
rather than using something too harsh
because I think it looks a lot nicer in
photos when it looks nice in that true
just applied a little bit of that onto
my Cupid's bow under my chin and for my
lips I am using Coquette by Lancome yet
by Lancome and I'm using a sand beige
lip liner by NYX
so as I said in the beginning of this
tutorial you can use this look with any
type of lip color just wanted to show
you how it looks with a nice nude if you
want it to be natural a nice girly look
it looks beautiful with a pink glamorous
with a nice fuchsia as well also looks
gorgeous with a classic red bit
dangerous with a dark burgundy and a
little bit different with a nice bright
purple but as for me guys you know I
love a nude so I'm gonna stick with the
nude today thank you so much for
watching guys have a lovely prom and I
will see you in my next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
