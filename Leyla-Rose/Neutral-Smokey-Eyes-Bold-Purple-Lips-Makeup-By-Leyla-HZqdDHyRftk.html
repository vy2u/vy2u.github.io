tutorial is going to be this neutral
smokey eye paired with this bold purple
lip
hold me close till I get up thumb is
belly outside
I don't want always with left stones
which is leading us love is all wheel
ever trust ya know I don't always with
left
to get started for the eyes I'm going to
be applying my soft ochre Paint Pot from
Mac just to prime my eyes and to make
sure that all the eye shadows appear a
lot more vibrantly and I'm going to be
applying this all over the lid with my
zoeva 142 a rounded brush this primer is
just going to smooth out my eye and just
create a really nice smooth canvas to
work on next I'm going to be taking
these zoeva smokey eyes palette and
taking this soft brown color first this
color is completely matte and I'm going
to be applying this into the crease with
a blending brush this is going to be our
first transition shade so you want to
make sure to blend this as well as you
can and what I really like about this
palette is that the colors are very
neutral they're not very very warm and
they're also not very very cool either
they're kind of in the middle which is
really nice and I'm also going to be
taking this dog Brown and this has a
slight reddish tint to it but it doesn't
look really warm at the same time like I
said it's kind of neutral it's in
between a warm and cool then we apply
this with a more petite crease brush and
just be applying this into the very
hollow part of my crease so just go
right into where its deepest and really
emphasize that deepness of your crease
I'm also going to be applying this onto
the outer V as well just to drag our
eyes upwards and outwards and to make
our eyes look a lot more opportune
I'm also going to go back into my first
blending brush to make sure that it is
thoroughly blended out you want to make
sure that all the colors blend into one
another perfectly then I'm just taking a
q-tip with a bit of makeup remover on it
and just going to be kind of cleaning up
the edge to kind of give us that really
nice lifted effect to the corner of our
eye so I'm going to be taking this
shimmery color also from the palette and
this looks silver but it's actually not
it looks like a Silver Gold it's so hard
to explain but in one light it kind of
looks silver and then in the other light
it looks gold it's really nice in
neutral so I've just applied that all
over the lid and now I'm taking a Kohl
pencil for a mag and just be applying
this onto the outer corner of our eye
and kind of creating almost a half
winged I'm gonna be taking a smudger
brush and just smudging out that color
and just creating a really nice soft
effect you want this look to look really
nice and soft we don't any harsh lines
so I'm just making sure to blend that as
well as I can
except maybe taking leave matte-black
from that palette and be applying it on
to the inner corner of my eye almost to
connect the line from the outer corner
to the inner corner and an eyeshadow is
just a lot more of a softer way to apply
this this is just going to create a
softer effect rather than going for an
eyeliner and then I'm just going to kind
of clean up the edge again just to make
it look nice and sharp next I'm going to
apply my mascara as always and then I'm
going to be applying some false lashes
the false lashes I'm using are the red
cherry 47 lashes
I'm also going to be creating a little
free line in a corner flick to make our
eyes look nice and feline like next I'm
going to be priming my skin with the
makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer and just apply
this all around into my problematic
areas and then I'm taking the Laura
Mercier silk cream foundation in kashew
beige I'm just going to be applying this
all over my skin and blending it in with
a damp really cool complexion sponge
from Real Techniques I always like to
use my sponge damp a lot of you guys ask
me if I use it dry or damp and I just
find that it's dry it doesn't really
give me the effect that I like but when
it's wet I feel like it kind of shares
out the foundation and it looks a lot
smoother so I much prefer using my
sponges damp instead of dry
so once I have a nice even layer of
foundation I'm going to be applying some
concealer this is the Maybelline age
rewind concealer and I'm just going to
be applying this under my eyes onto my
forehead the bridge of my nose and also
a little bit onto my chin this is going
to bring these areas forward and really
highlight them and I'm going to make
sure to blend this really well into the
rest of my complexion using that same
sponge we used for our foundation
you
you
and as you guys know you know I love to
use my Sigma through the HD precision
brush to get into all the areas where my
sponge cannot reach I love this brush
it's so handy and also going to be
setting my under eyes with my soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder and I'm
going to be using my sponge to kind of
bounce that on top of the concealer and
this will just kind of set everything in
place and just make it look super smooth
and flawless
next I'm just going to be filling in my
eyebrows and just applying some
concealer underneath my brows and then
applying a little bit of a brow pencil
through the brow to make them look more
defined I like to go for a very natural
brow so I like to make sure that I brush
through them very thoroughly to make
sure that none of the product is like
sitting in my brows so I like to go as
slowly as I can and apply as little
product as possible next I'm going to be
applying some of that black eyeshadow
from the palette to my bottom lash line
with that same smudger brush I also
applied some Kohl pencil into my
waterline but it seems that my camera
cut it out so I'm just going to be
applying some of the eyeshadow to my
bottom lash line and just making sure
that it looks nice and smoky and then
I'm also going to be applying some
mascara to my bottom lash line also
to give my skin some color I'm going to
be using the Mac mineralize skinfinish
in dark golden and just be applying this
all over the outer perimeter of my face
I'm also contouring with a little bit of
the Bahama Mama bronzer from the balm
and just be applying that to the areas
that I want to appear more sunken in
next I'm going to be taking the hot mama
blusher from the balm also and be
applying this onto my cheekbones just
because I want to again give a little
bit of a flush of color to prevent
myself from looking washed out by the
purple lips
I also contour my nose a little bit with
the Bahama Mama bronzer also the next
I'm highlighting the tops of my
cheekbones with my Becca opal
highlighter this is by far my favorite
highlighter it just makes me feel like a
bronze goddess so I just absolutely love
to apply this and it's just the perfect
tone for Olive skin so it's just really
great to give us that really nice glow
from within I'm also applying some of
that onto my nose onto my chin and also
above my eyebrows to give us that super
glowy look
and then finally for the star of the
show
for the lips I decided to pick a darker
lip liner then the lipstick decided to
go for Mac current pencil and I'm just
applying that all along my lip line and
I'm also going to be applying this on to
the outer corners of my lips also and
kind of just feathering it in
you
and then for the lipstick I'm going from
Mac heroine lipstick this is just again
like I said the star of the show
there aren't many colors on the market
that are like this and it's definitely
an amazing unique color and I just feel
like it really makes the look look good
nice and edgy and because it wasn't a
completely matte lipstick it says it's a
matte lipstick but I had a bit of shine
I decided to Pat on a little bit of
translucent powder to completely mattify
the lip so that is the end of this look
