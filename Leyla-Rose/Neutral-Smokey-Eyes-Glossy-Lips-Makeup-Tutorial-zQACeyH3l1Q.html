Channel today I'm going to be showing
you how to achieve this neutral smokey
eye and I decided to pair it with this
nude glossy lip if you do want to see
how I achieve this makeup look then just
keep on watching
to get started I'm going to be priming
my eyes with Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and I'm just going to be applying this
all over the lid with my finger I'm just
applying it just to give a little bit of
a base and also to cancel out any of the
eyes natural discoloration and I'm also
going to be taking visa way of a smoky
palette first of all taking this soft
brown I'm just going to be blending this
into the crease I really want to apply
this quite a lot on to the crease I want
this color to really show and I really
want it to pop through all the other
dark colors we're going to be applying
so I'm just blending this first of all
and then keep packing on that color so
that it's nice and pigmented next I'm
going to be taking this dark warm brown
shade and I'm gonna be applying this
into the deeper part of my crease I want
to achieve a smokey effect but I want to
gradually build up that color until we
apply the black that way everything will
just blend in really easily and that
will just prevent everything from
looking too chunky instead of going in
straight with the black
I'm just applying this into the crease
and then you can go back and forth into
your previous brushes if you need to to
make sure you get that really nice
airbrushed effect next I want to be
taking this matte black from the palette
and I'm going to be applying this into
the outer V area this is really going to
lift the eyes and it's really going to
give a smoky effect on the outer corner
I am sort of swiping it onto the inner
part of my eye as well just to give a
little bit of depth into the crease by a
mainly keeping it on the outer corner to
really turn our eyes upwards
again go back and forth into your
previous brushes to make sure that it
looks super blended we don't need to
look chunky and we just don't want to
see any seams between the colors we want
them all to be blended into one next I'm
just going to take some makeup remover
on a pad and I'm just going to be wiping
the sides of my eyes just to clean it up
a little bit
next I'm going to be taking this neutral
shade is a shimmery shade from the same
palette it's sort of a green gold and
brown all in one it's almost like a
duochrome color is a really nice color
and I think it's quite unique as well
just paying this on the lid with a
shader brush just to create a little pop
of something shimmery with a smaller
brush and taking that same matte black
and I'm almost going to create a liner
on the top lashline didn't want to go
for something as harsh as an eyeliner so
I took some black eyeshadow and just ran
it along that area just to give a little
bit of extra definition and then taking
some gel liner I'm going to be applying
it to my waterline and also on to my
tight line area I really don't want to
see any skin tone on any area of my eye
so this is just going to make sure that
everything looks black and that way the
eyes look super smoky and sultry
next I'm going to be applying some false
lashes this is optional but i definitely
recommend it if you want to go for some
extra you know if you know over it it's
really nice because it does definitely
transform the look
next I'm going to be applying my
foundation that this is the Bourjois
healthy mix and I'm just mixing together
two shades to create my perfect custom
shade I'm applying this all over my face
and then I'm going to be blending it in
with the elf ultimate blending brush
this is a beautiful brush and I love
this foundation as well because it's
really nice and juhi it's not too heavy
on the skin and it does look really nice
because it is a medium coverage so you
can still see one natural skin coming
through as well I just want to blend it
in to get a nice even coverage and then
I'm going to be applying some concealer
as well
you
well my concealer I'm taking the Rimmel
wake me up concealer I really love this
concealer because it's just such a nice
consistency and I love how light it is
because it really highlights the areas i
want to bring forward so just went ahead
and applied it on all the areas that i
wanted to bring forwards on my forehead
under my eyes the bridge of my nose and
also on my chin as always all the usual
areas
again I'm just taking that previous
brush we use to apply our foundation and
just blending that in I love to use
brushes I used for my foundation to
blend in my concealer because I just
feel like it really gives a flawless
finish
I also use my finger to blend in my
under-eye concealer as well next to set
my skin here is no surprise i'm using
these soap and glory instant free touch
powder as always you guys never
absolutely love this powder i'm using
this on a sigma f 35 brush and I'm just
using this powder only on the areas
where I use the concealer because I'm
gonna be going in with another powder to
set the rest of the face so just
applying this on the areas where we
applied that concealer and then to set
the rest of my face I am taking this mac
mineralized skin finish powder and I'm
just taking it on all the areas where we
didn't apply that powder previously
today I decided to skip any eyeshadow on
the bottom lash line you can totally go
for a super smoky bottom lash line but I
just decided to skip it because I wanted
to create a really lifted effect on my
eyes to really draw attention to the top
lash line but it's totally up to you you
can add I should or if you want to but I
just decided to go for a really thick
coat of mascara on to my bottom lash
line instead
two bronze I'm taking the mineralized
skinfinish from Mac in dark and just
applying it onto the outer part of my
face and just giving myself a little bit
of a glow this is a nice jewelry found a
shin so I feel like a nice bronze hago
is really nice with this and then to
contour I am taking the bomb Bahama Mama
powder and just taking it on to all the
areas i want to appear more sunken in so
just underneath my cheekbones and also
i'm applying this on either sides of my
nose just to narrow it down a little bit
as well
to highlight I'm taking the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills highlighter and so
Hollywood and I don't want this to be
everywhere today so I'm just applying it
on the very highest portion of my
cheekbone just to really bring this area
forward without being too shimmery and
then I'm gonna be taking this on the tip
of my nose also just to bring this area
forward to and then finally for the lips
I actually decided to go for a glossy
lip like I never do that I never ever go
for a glossy lip anymore anyone that
knows me knows that matte lip is
definitely always been my favorite
option for a lip I haven't done a gloss
in ages so I decided I wanted to pay a
smoky eye with a classic nude gloss lip
today I'm first of all taking this
Rimmel lip liner and lining my lips with
it and then I also went ahead and filled
it in as well this acts as a nice base
for the gloss and it does just give the
lip a little bit of color too and then
for the gloss I decided to go for a
thick coat of the butter gloss from next
I can't remember the color but it's a
really nice nudey pink shade with a
little bit of a move undertone because
that is the end of this video I hope
that you enjoyed if you did then please
like this video because it helps me out
a ton I actually really really like this
look I think it's really classic you can
use this look for whatever occasion I
think its really nice just for a night
out you just want to feel a little bit
more glam I think it's perfect thank you
