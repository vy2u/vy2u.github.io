today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to achieve this New Year's Eve party
makeup look is this really bold glittery
black smokey eye if you guys would like
to see how I achieve this look then just
keep on watching
so to get started I'm gonna be priming
my eyes using some concealer just to
make the eyeshadow stick and a pair more
vibrant then taking the new zoeva
nude spectrum palette I'm gonna be
taking this beige brown shade and I'm
gonna be applying this with a duo fiber
blending brush into the crease and
because we're gonna be using lots of
really dark colors today we really want
to make sure that it has something
really good to blend into so I'm gonna
be building this color up to really
create a nice crease color so that all
the other colors just blend really
effortlessly into this one then taking
this dark up warm brown I'm gonna be
applying this into the crease to start
to build up some of that depth and I'm
just taking this on a separate blending
brush and building up that color and
don't forget you can go back into your
previous brushes to help the blending
process so I'm just taking the other
brush before and just kind of blending
out the edges so there looks a lot more
seamless the ones the edges of that
color are nice and softened you can go
back into that color again and just
filled up that color so it looks nice
and pigmented in the crease next taking
a gel liner I'm just gonna be taking
this on my finger and applying it all
over the lid just because we are
applying a matte black this will just
make everything look a lot smoother we
are applying a glitter on top of it so
you don't have to do this but it just
makes the black appear a lot more
pigmented and a lot smoother then taking
this matte black from that same palette
I'm just gonna be taking this and
applying it with a flat shader brush and
just patting it on top of that gel liner
we previously applied I'm applying it
all over my lid and taking it right up
to the crease we don't really want to
take it any further because we do want
some space to blend this upwards
so stop where your crease naturally
curves and then you can soften out the
edges of that black using that previous
brush we use to apply the brown then
taking a liquid liner I'm going to start
to do a nice winged liner you can
totally skip this if you don't want to
go for a feline effect on the eye but I
really wanted to really give us them cat
eyes so I decided to go for some winged
liner but it's totally optional you can
just style this out as much as you want
and then I am taking some glitter this
is a glitter liner from Nick
and I'm just applying it over all of my
led apart from the actual liner and I'm
just softening the edges of that glitter
using some more of that black eyeshadow
and then I'm just cleaning up the sides
of my eyes to make everything look nice
and sharp you have made any mistakes
this will really help with that and
because I wanted to jazz up the glitter
a little bit more I decided to go for a
color glitter that matched my top so you
can totally play with the color as much
as you need to if you're wearing
powerful green blue apply that color
glitter on top of the black and it just
plays things up it makes everything look
really pretty this one is kind of like a
multicolored one from Kiko then I am
taking some House of lashes new are very
lashes and just applying them to my lash
line and then applying some mascara to
make them blend in a little bit better
and then I'm just gonna be tight lining
my upper waterline and also my bottom as
well
we're gonna be moving on to this skin
now so I'm just priming my skin with my
Mac natural radiance primer and just
applying this all over my skin and then
for my foundation I'm gonna be taking
the NARS sheer glow foundation and I
haven't used this in forever buy
absolutely love this foundation it's a
really nice medium to full coverage
foundation that really feels nice and
moisturizing so it's good for the winter
time and I'm just gonna be applying this
with my Real Techniques sculpting brush
and just applying one even layer all
over the skin because we are gonna be
doing a lot of contouring and
highlighting do feel like one layer
foundation is just more than enough to
highlight and conceal I'm gonna be using
the Maybelline fit me concealer and I am
also gonna be taking a little bit of the
not really a little bit I'm taking a
decent amount of the Rimmel wake me up
concealer because this is a really nice
highlighting concealer both of these
concealers are quite light in
consistency so they don't feel too heavy
on the skin but they really light in
those areas and bring them forward and
I'm just blending that end with a zueva
arounded concealer brush to set and bake
my face I am taking the Mac CC powder
and just baking all the areas I want to
just bake for a little bit and then I'm
taking some brow pencil and just filling
in my brows very quickly so once I
filled in my brows I'm just gonna be
dusting away that excess powder from our
baking session and then I'm gonna finish
off the eyes I'm just taking some more
of that Kohl pencil and just running it
on the lower lash line and then I'm just
gonna be smudging out doesn't need to be
too neat because you doing it to look
quite smoky so I'm just gonna be
smudging that lower lash line
did decide afterwards to apply some
glitter so I definitely say apply or
mascara right at the end I wasn't really
sure I was doing at this point and then
I'm just applying a little bit more
eyeliner on the inner corner to give us
that nice feline flick again this is
totally optional and then I went in with
that green gold glitter and I just
applied it on the bottom lashline to
give it an extra hint of sparkle next
I'm gonna be contouring because it's New
Year's Eve when is there any more excuse
to contour your face so I'm just gonna
be contouring with the NYX contour stick
and I'm just doing it around the outside
of my face and also my nose too and I'm
just blending that in and just making
sure that everything looks as seamless
as possible and I do like to leave my
contour quite dark because I do like to
kind of use it as my bronzer as well I
do go in with a bronzer but not too much
with me just taking this bronzer by the
body shop and just setting that contour
and also just applying a little bit
extra color too and then as always I
like to kind of bake underneath my
contour just because it cleans
everything up and makes it look a lot
more sharp I did highlight my cheekbones
but the footage got cut out so then I
also highlighted the tip of my nose and
then to fill in my lips I am going to be
applying it some stripped down and lip
line up from Mac and then I am going to
be taking Gerard cosmetics nude lipstick
just because I feel like a nude really
fixed I feel like for this eye look a
nude is really nice so guys the end of
