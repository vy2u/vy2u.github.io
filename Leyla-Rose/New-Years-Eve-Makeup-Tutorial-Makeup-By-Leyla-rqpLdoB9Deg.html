today I'm going to be showing you this
really cool New Year's Eve lurk which is
super glam and really dark on the eyes
with a nude lip and as you can see my
first step is priming my eyes as usual I
used soft ochre by Mac and I'm going to
be using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
palette this is the amur easy one and
mmerazzi one and I'm going to be taking
the light caramel color from that
palette and applying it into my crease
with a blending brush and I'm going to
be blending this up quite far and this
just gives us a really nice blown outlet
and because the colors that I'm using in
my crease are so warm it just gives the
most gorgeous bronze delay so it looks
amazing with the dark colors that we're
gonna apply so as you can see I'm just
blending it further up towards my brow
bone then I'm going to be taking Morocco
which is this really nice Reddy Brown
and like I said before this is really
gonna warm things up in the crease so
I'm just gonna be applying that with a
2-1 7 brush and just slowly blend that
into the first transition color that we
applied then I'm going to be taking
black track by Mac and this is a fluid
line gel liner and I'm going to be
applying this with a smudger brush all
over my lid and you want to work quickly
if you're using a gel because it does
dry so if you are a little bit on the
slower side I recommend a pencil instead
so I'm just spreading that all over my
eye then I'm gonna be taking LBD from
that palette and patting it on top and
this is going to set the gel eyeliner in
place and then I'm also going to be
going around the edges of the black and
applying more of that black eyeshadow to
give the black a more diffused look and
it just helps to blend it in with the
rest of the colors as well so I'm just
packing that on very slowly and I'm sort
of just extending it outwards as well
and especially when you're using dark
colors you want to make sure that you're
blending everything are in between each
step so as you can see I just apply a
little bit more of that crease color
that we applied before and I'm just
using it to blend the black upwards and
that way we get a really nice transition
look
next I'm just going to be wiping away
the edges that just gives it a really
clean look and it also lifts your eyes
upwards as well and then I'm going to be
going over that with the first
transition color to give it a nice even
blend next I'm going to be applying my
mascara as usual as we're going to be
applying some force lashes and I'm just
doubled up some false lashes and applied
them onto my eyes and I just wanted to
have a really nice full look so I'm
blending them in with my normal lashes
by applying mascara to the false ones
next I'm going to be doing my face and I
am prepping my skin with a serum fast
this is the moisture infusion that serum
and then I'm applying a primer this is
the CCD or one and don't get it
everywhere look I did I'm just going to
be applying that all over my skin just
to prep it then I'm going to be taking
my Giorgio Armani luminous silk which I
absolutely love and I'm applying that
all over with a matte 130 brush and just
stippling it into my skin and as you can
see yes I know it is a little bit warmer
than my skin but it blends in with the
rest of my body so that's why I've
chosen that color and I'm going to be
applying a brow gel into my brows before
I fill them in and this just gives the
brows a really natural look on the inner
corner of the brow and I've been loving
the fluffy looking brow recently so even
though we are going to be using a brow
gel which is a Mac one it's the fluid
line or to proof brow gel and it just
gives a really nice fluffy look even
though it's a little bit more defined so
this is my kind of new go to routine and
I'm just filling that in with a Mac who
6:3 brush I think and I'm just running
that through very carefully making sure
not to fill it in too thick
then I'm going to applying that silvery
light color the lightest color in the
palette and applying it to my brow bone
and my inner corner and this is just
going to highlight them areas and just
make everything stand out really nicely
next I'm going to be highlighting under
my eyes with the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm just highlighting in
the areas that I want to bring forward
so I'm going to be doing it onto the
bridge of my nose and also my Cupid's
bow and then my chin as well so I'm just
buffing that in with the same brush that
I used to buff in my foundation and I'm
just going to be kind of patting it and
also going in side to side motions as
well I sometimes don't like to do side
to side motions but I feel like this
brush really helps to blend everything
out really nicely so you can see that it
at the end it ends up looking really
smooth
and as we are going for a more dramatic
look I'm going to be highlighting and
contouring with some powders and I'm
using emphasized powder by Mac and this
is a really light and reflective powder
that you can apply to highlight the
areas that you want to bring forward and
I'm just applying this onto my under
eyes and I'm also going to be applying
it onto the other areas that we
highlighted then I'm going to be taking
this other contouring color which I'm
going to apply into the hollows of my
cheeks and this is gonna give the
appearance of a larger cheekbone and a
more sunken look skinnier face basically
and I'm just very gradually building up
that color rather than applying too much
at once then I'm going to be taking this
sainte-marie blusher bronzer and it's a
really reflective one so I wanted to
apply it as my blush are and I'm going
to be taking becca cosmetics opal
highlighter and applying it with a fan
brush onto my cheekbones next I'm going
to be filling in my lips I don't know
why I'd on top of this in a really word
order because I haven't finished my eyes
yet but i'm applying chestnut lip pencil
by Mac and then I'm going to be taking a
Maybelline lipstick which I've
absolutely been loving recently and it's
so affordable which is amazing and it's
just a really nice cool nude which is
nice for this time of year rather than a
warm one so I'm just applying that and
then I'm going to blend that into the
lip liner and it's just such a creamy
consistency it's gorgeous next I'm going
to be taking this NYX glitter liner it's
a black glitter liner and I'm going to
be applying it all over my lid and I
figured as it's New Year's Eve when else
can we apply a black glitter on to our
eyes and this is just a really easy way
of applying glitter making it look
really effective so I'm just going to be
applying that all over the lid area
and then I'm going to be filling in my
waterline and also underneath my lash
line with a black gel liner and then I'm
just going to be applying some of that
glitter liner onto the bottom as well
and here I'm just creating a more feline
Chi in the inner corner and then I'm
just yeah applying the glitter on the
bottom as well so guys that is the end
of this look I hope that you enjoyed
something that's really nice and
wearable for the new year's time I hope
you have an amazing New Year's and your
Christmas was incredible thank you so
much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
