channel so today I have a no makeup
makeup look for you using all drugstore
products and this video is actually in
collaboration with Maybelline I
absolutely love all their products and
they're one of my favorite brands ever
to work with so I really hope you
enjoyed this video and I hope you guys
like the finished look and I will see
you guys in a second with no makeup on
okay so to get this makeup look started
I'm going to be priming my skin I have
just previously moisturized and I am
going on top of that with the baby skin
primer
from Maybelline I love this because it
really smooths my skin and my skin has
been a tad bumpy lately so this is
really going to help to smooth down that
texture so I'm just pushing it onto the
skin and now I want to correct these
spots using the master Cameron palette
from Maybelline also I'm taking this
mint green shade and I'm popping it on
top of all of my redness to correct that
color and to really make sure that that
redness disappears this really helps
when applying foundation it just means
you get to apply a little bit less which
is really great for a no makeup makeup
look now for foundation this amazing
package that Maybelline 70 shows that
all of the dreamtone and liquid and the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundations are extending their shade
ranges which I'm so excited about I'm
just testing out my shades to figure out
which one I prefer I'm in between 220
and 250 but right now I'm going to go
with the 250 because it matches my neck
and staff way way better so I'm just
popping that on the back of my hand and
then applying it onto my face and we're
just going to be blending this in you
guys know the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless is one of my favorite
foundations of all time so I am so
excited that they have extended that
shade range in this I personally
preferred this for my skin type because
I have slightly oily skin I do like the
dream satin liquid foundation also if
you have dry skin that is a better one
to go for although I do feel like you'll
still love this foundation as well for
my concealer I'm taking my Maybelline
fit me which is no surprise I use this
almost every single day definitely my
favorite concealer of all time I love it
I'm applying this in the shade 20
underneath my under eyes just to give a
really nice brightness I like to go
quite bright under the eyes just because
I feel like it makes me look more awake
and I just personally prefer
blending in with my sponge also under my
eyes and also on to my eyelids a
decimation of increases I'm just
applying some loose translucent powder
and just testing those areas where we
applied that concealer next I'm just
going to be bronzing the outer perimeter
of my skin just to add a little bit of
color to my face and then I'm going to
be moving on to my eyebrows and for my
eyebrows I'm taking this pencil from
Maybelline and just creating a really
natural looking brow I don't want to go
for anything too heavy as you guys know
I like to go over quite a bold brow
usually what I like to do is always
create tiny little strands to replicate
hair strands and this just looks more
natural and I love this on a known
makeups makeup day so I'm just drawing
through the strands and just emphasizing
my arch and once I'm done with that I
just go through with a little bit of
clip rel
just to add a little bit of texture and
to keep them in place I'm also keeping
the eyes super simple and I'm taking one
of the Maybelline Color tattoos in this
really natural matte pink shade I'm just
applying this with a brush onto my lid
just to create a little bit of an opaque
looking at color sometimes I like to do
this with a brown shade and sometimes I
like to do it with something a little
bit brighter and this is kind of
brightens up my eyes which I really
really like next for one of my favorite
parts of any tutorial is applying
highlight to the tops of my cheekbones
and also to the other high points of my
skin I'm using the master strobing
liquid from Maybelline also and I'm
applying this onto the tops of my
cheekbones and I'm going to be blending
this out with a sponge I personally feel
I can make everything look really subtle
and glowy I like to go for quite a
highlighted look because it makes you
look really healthy and I just really
really like that if everything is all
totally matte I feel like it can look a
little bit flat and not like skin but
when you kind of apply highlight on to a
different higher point of your face I
feel like it looks really realistic and
healthy and even though we have a lot of
makeup form as to the dimension of
really healthy looking skin so I really
like doing this and it's a really good
tip especially if you feel like your
face looks a little bit flat which mine
sometimes does as well
I also applied on to my inner corner and
I'm just finishing off my eyes with some
scar
and I love this mascara probably my
favorite one from Maybelline this is the
lash sensational but in the waterproof
kind and I usually use the non
waterproof but this one is really good
as well my lashes are super super short
so I don't really like to apply too much
mascara because otherwise they look like
tiny little little clumps and it doesn't
really do much for me so one coat is
usually just enough for my lashes of
course you can apply as much of this as
you like and for my lips I am taking
this dark pink lip liner and rubbing it
around the outer part of my lips and for
my lipstick I am taking this lipstick in
peach buff from the color sensational
range for Maybelline and I'm just
putting this on the center of my lips
and rubbing it to the lip liner to make
it blend easily and that is the finished
look like I said earlier on in this
video I am so excited that Maybelline
have extended their shade ranges I have
now found my perfect shade which is 250
it's golden and just so perfect for my
skin tone so now you guys can find your
perfect shade don't forget to comment
