today I'm going to be showing you how to
achieve this really easy to achieve
glamorous lip using nude colors in
different parts of the face so my first
step is going to apply my face primer
I'm using my Maybelline Baby skin primer
and just using my hands to blend that
into my bare skin then I'm going to take
my liquid foundation I'm using the
Armani luminous silk liquid and I'm just
going to be applying that in all areas
of the face and then I'm going to be
taking my Real Techniques sponge and
just bouncing that onto my skin to
create a nice even layer of color I've
been absolutely loving this method for
applying my foundation recently it just
builds a really even layer and it just
looks a really flawless so it's a really
good way of applying it next I'm going
to be applying my base for my eyeshadow
I'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac
and I'm going to be applying that with
my fingers and just creating a nice even
layer of that to prep our eyes before
the eyeshadows that we're going to apply
next I'm going to take the nude 2
palette by the balm and taking this very
light reflective color and applying it
onto my inner corner and this is just
going to emphasize our inner corner and
make it look nice and glowy and bright
next I'm going to take this matte brown
color from the same palette and use a
blending brush to apply that into my
crease and what I want to do is just
work it as much as possible because this
is the only crease color we're going to
be applying and we're just gonna work
that color into the crease and just use
lots of back and forth motions and
little circular motions just to make
sure that colors is blended as possible
and you can see that I just go crazy in
the crease and just make sure that it's
nice and blended
and as well as blending upwards I'm also
blending outwards slightly because we're
going to be doing a winged liner and
that would just go really nicely with
the whole extended look next I'm gonna
take this berry and pikmin this is like
a loose glitter pigment and this would
work really well wet so I would
recommend wetting it I didn't wet it I
regretted it after I'd done it because
it is quite loose so I'm just patting
that on with the same brush and yeah I'm
just going in side to side motions but I
would recommend wetting it because I
think it would have a lot less fallout
if you did wet it next I'm going to be
applying my the balm Schwing eyeliner
and this has been my absolute favorite
eyeliner recently because it's so black
and it dries to a really gorgeous matte
finish no matter what I show do you have
one underneath it so I'm just going to
be doing a normal line on my lid and
then I'm going to be opening that out to
a nice wing and I'm gonna do like a
medium thickness of a wing you can go as
thick or as thin as you like I'm just
gonna take that same wing that I would
usually do from the same place which is
just where my bottom lash line is and
just extend it upwards and then I'm
going to connect them to lines and then
gradually make it thicker
next I moons be taking a nude coal
pencil and applying that into my
waterline to create a nice open
bright-eyed look then I'm going to apply
my mascara on my top and my bottom
lashes and then I'm going to apply my
false lashes these are the red cherry 47
lashes and they're just a really nice
spiky full volume of slash next I'm
going to apply my concealer and I'm
going to be applying it in an upward
motion that way it will give me a more
lifted cheekbone look and then I'm going
to be applying it onto my other high
points such as my forehead nose Cupid's
bow and chin
to blend in that concealer I'm using the
same sponge I use to apply my foundation
and I really like using this method
because it just creates a really
seamless look you can't see whether
concealer starts or finishes and it just
looks really natural but really to find
at the same time and plus it's really
easy as well you don't need to be too
neat with it then I just like to take my
finger and just use it to get into the
more detailed areas like on the inner
corners underneath the place that we put
our makeup and it just it's just easy I
like using my fingers for the areas I
need it next I moons take the
mineralized skinfinish in light of my
under-eye area and just use a really
small amount of it to set the areas that
I want to set such as the areas that I
get oily on my cheeks my nose and my
forehead next I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows using my spiked eyebrow pencil
I'm just going to create more of an arch
than I actually have because I don't
have much of an arch
and then I'm just gonna gradually fill
it in just using lots of stroking
motions you don't want to use coloring
motions because that creates something
that's really unnatural you just want to
stroke through it almost as if you're
creating little hairs and then taking a
little spoolie brush you just want to
brush through the inner corner of the
brow to create a nice faded effect and
then what I like to do is take a light
up brow mascara and just apply it onto
my hairs to create a more lighter brow
feck and it just makes my brows look a
lot less harsh as well next I'm going to
be taking my concealer this is my book
Brown can see like in beige and I'm just
going to be using an angled brush to
correct under my eyebrow and also to
lift it as well it just creates a really
natural brow highlight then I'm going to
be applying my bronzer this is my Bobbi
Brown bronzer in golden light and I just
absolutely love this I'm going to be
applying on my cheekbone and forehead
area and just create a really nice
sunkissed look then I'm going to be
taking my the balm Bahama Mama to
contour just slightly underneath my
cheekbone then I'm taking the balm hot
mama which is a really pretty Orange II
peach blusher with like a gold undertone
and it just looks really nice and
sunkissed again and then I'm going to be
taking my mary-lou manizer by the balm
and just using that as my highlight and
it's really really really dramatic to be
honest so you just want to be as natural
as you can as you can see it does come
out quite pigmented but I just like to
blend that in with my finger after just
to make it look a little bit more soft
and finally I'm going to be doing the
lips this is my favorite lip combo ever
this is the cream o spice lip liner by
Mac and then I'm going to be filling in
my lips with Mac honey love lipstick and
this has just been my absolute favorite
nude combo it just complements my skin
tone really really well and it's just
the perfect nude for me and it's just a
really nice beige nude but it actually
has a little bit of a pink undertone as
well so I just absolutely love it and
then what I like to do is just go around
that color again with a bit of the lip
liner just to define it a little bit
more then lastly I'm just going to be
doing some finishing touches like just
creating a little bit more of an inner
corner highlight and also doing some
SCARA
on my false lashes as well just to
create some extra dimension on my lashes
