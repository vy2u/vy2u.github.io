so today I have my very first one grand
makeup tutorial for you guys and I'm
wanting to do these for ages I just I'm
so indecisive I just couldn't decide on
which brand to start off with so today
I'm starting off with NYX Cosmetics all
of their products are all generally
really inexpensive you can find them in
Boots in the UK and I believe in
drugstores in the US and worldwide so
it's quite a easily accessible brand for
a lot of people around the world so I
wanted to start with this one so I just
love their stuff and they're really
inexpensive so that's why I start off
with this one but if you have any
suggestions on what you want me to do
for my next one then let me know down in
the comments this is a look that idea to
create with all of my NYX makeup so I
learned something really summery it's
quite neutral everywhere apart from this
pop of color on the bottom lashline and
that's using some of them new products
that they've just brought out you guys
do enjoy this video then please make
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already because I'd love to have you
here and without any further ado don't
there's anything else I want to say
let's get on into it is and make a
tutorial on let's go okay guys the first
thing I'm going to be doing is
moisturizing my skin as I always do just
because I always like my skin to be as
moisturized as possible even though I am
to be applying to primers so just making
sure to do that first of all and then
I'm going to be going in with two
primers from of course next as
everything is in this tutorial so the
first primer is going to be this green
tinted one just to cut down on any
redness my skin has been pretty good
lately so I don't feel like I need some
hardcore color correcting but just a
little bit of the green tint really does
help and then I'm just applying some of
the NYX angel veil just on the center
part of my face to help smooth it down
and then I'm taking the new NYX
foundation I think it's called the total
coverage foundation and I'm dropping
this onto my skin and honestly that with
this foundation you do not need a lot of
it it was actually my first time trying
it throughout this tutorial and I loved
it so I just used a mixed Beauty Blender
to actually blend this in so it's one of
their own sort of sponges I just blended
that in to the rest of my skin and
honestly one layer of this was enough it
looks so flawless and I just love the
way that it turned out
by the way sorry that this footage is
blurry I don't know where that happened
so next I'm actually going to be moving
on to my eyes and I'm priming my eyes
using the NYX HD eye primer now this
isn't usually the kind of eye primer I'd
like to go for but it's the only one I
actually had from NYX and honestly I
feel like I'd prefer using a concealer
because the coverage just wasn't enough
for me it was a little bit more of that
kind of moisturizing eye primer rather
than a full coverage one and it did give
a little bit of a tint but it wasn't
enough personally for me and I noticed
that made a difference with my eye
shadow the actual eye shadow palette
that I'm going to be using is the next
ultimate warm palette I love this
palette so so so much so I'm just first
starting off with this color and I'm
going to be blending that into the
crease of my first transition shade I'm
going to be keeping the eyelids quite
neutral because I'm going for a pop of
color on the bottom lash line
so the brushes I'm actually using as
well are all next which is pretty cool
because I've been very authentically
mixed so far so once I've blended the N
in the crease I'm going to be taking
this color and just using it on the
outer corner to add a little bit of
depth and darkness and personally I
really really like the effect that this
gives because it just makes it look a
little bit more tanned upwards and once
you build it up it really does look
super super gorgeous and then I like to
take a little bit of a slightly darker
color and use this in that outer corner
area just to give it that slight hint of
smokiness and I really like the effect
that this gives as well so like I said
nothing too crazy going for something
neutral and smoky because the attention
is going to be on that pop of color on
the bottom lashline I'm just applying
some concealer now this is the NYX HD
concealer and just using that same NYX
Beauty Blender sponge and just using it
to clean off the shape on the side of my
eye that way it can really be turned
upwards and get that really pretty sharp
edge which is what I was definitely
looking for now to actually set this
into place I'm going to be using the NYX
HD powder now the thing about HD powders
is that they do reflect in flash and
because I'm using a ring light I thought
I had buffed it all the way when it
turns out on camera it does not look
like it was buffed away I did go in
further and buff it away a little bit
later as I finished off of my makeup but
it's so annoying and this is why I don't
really use HD powders anyway moving on
I'm going to be using this little Paint
Pot
also from next of course and I'm just
going to be using this on the top of my
eyelid now it was very coppery and I did
eventually go on top of this with a
another eyeshadow from the palette but
for now I'm just using it to create a
really nice shimmery base on my lid and
I did go in with some eyeliner because I
thought this is the color that I was
going to go for because I went for some
aqua sort of like an aqua green on the
bottom lash line I decided to cool it
down a little bit after I had done my
eyeliner so I used the next ultimate ink
liner to create my wing which is
actually one of my favorite pen liners I
actually own it so black and it's really
easy to use so I just created my normal
wing that I would normally do okay so
like I said I did go in with this
shimmery shade from the next ultimate
palette and I just pop this on the inner
corner and I felt like this really cool
it down a little bit I wanted to keep it
warm but I didn't want it to look copper
if that makes sense so once I was done
with that I went and applied a aqua
Paint Pot on the bottom lashline and
this was a really nice base for the
colors I was going to be applying to
really make them stand out to go on top
of this I used another enix ultimate
palette it's with the bright one that
they do and I mixed together these two
colors and pop that on the bottom lash
line on top of it and then took a little
bit of this lime-green and use the other
very bottom to blend this out and to
really make it look more green rather
than blue and then it just took some
more of that shimmery color and popped
it onto the inner corner and I did do my
lashes and mascara off camera because
they want from neck so I thought I'd
just skip that and I did go in with this
NYX contour kit just took some of the
highlight shades and just pop that onto
my under eyes to make them look a little
bit brighter and then I took some of the
contour colors I was just mixing them
all together to be fair I wasn't using
just one specific color and just using
that to create a slightly more bronzed
halo effect around the outer perimeter
of my face so I'm just going on the
sides of my forehead first of all with
this brush which is also from next I
think all the brushes I used in this
video were all from necks which is
pretty impressive and then I just use
that all around the cheekbone area and
just did a general contour look but then
I did go in with a more precise brush
and use that on the rule hollows of my
to really make it look like a shadow
really like the way that this looked and
I'm glad I went for something a little
more contoured than I usually go for
because it just went with the whole look
really nicely for my highlight I am
taking this cream highlight of course
for mix as well I've been really into
cream highlights lately and I use this
for the first time in this video and I
loved it I've blended in the first layer
with the sponge and then I just went on
top of it and it just creates such a
gorgeous glow and I'm just doing some
finishing touches now like applying some
glitter just on the top of that inner
corner area just to add a little bit of
sparkle and then I'm going to be doing
my eyebrows off-camera as I always do
but I'll leave the link just going to
watch it and then finally for the lips I
am taking this suede lip pencil from NYX
as well and that is in the shade London
and then I did take the soft matte lip
cream in the shade London as well and
it's definitely my favorite color of the
soft matte lip creams and it just went
really well with this whole look so
really loved the way this turned out and
pretty much one size on that is the end
of this look guys I really hope you
enjoyed this full face of mix tutorial
