Channel today I'm going to be showing
with you my October beauty favorites and
a couple of random favorites as well so
you can get to know a little bit inside
later life so I'm just going to jump
straight into it because I have quite a
few products to show and talk to you
about the first one is to do with
Halloween and a little bit to do with
being a makeup artist too I've been
using this throughout october for my
halloween makeup and also just to aid in
my kit and just to act as amazing color
basis and everything as well i
recommended this to so many of my makeup
artist friends and they've been like
what the hell have I been doing I
haven't had this it's amazing if you're
a make up lies and you want to fill up
gaps in your kit if this things that you
don't have this is an amazing amazing
tool to have it's because it has so many
different colors within it that you can
mix together their cream so you can
basically create anything with it and I
just love this you can create a shadow
basis blushes lipsticks foundation
colors anything it's absolutely amazing
if you know your color theory is an
artist this is like a kid in a candy
store kind of thing it's amazing so this
was amazing in October and I've really
used it a lot and I've been absolutely
loving this so I can't wait to see what
else I can do with this so hey next I
want to talk to you a little bit about
my contour and highlighting care but I
bought from Mac as well in my previous
hall so I bought this last month and I
have been absolutely loving these two
particular colors for myself so this was
originally meant for my care but I
basically stolen this and this is mine
now oh I haven't even used this on
customers because I don't like to share
my makeup with and customers and my
clients but oh my god this is amazing
sorry there's like fingerprints
everywhere these are really hard to put
out so I can't tell you all the colors
because I've actually forgotten but I've
been loving this one which is called
emphasize this one's very popular this
one which I can't remember the color of
and also that one I will write the
colors in the description box below
these two are highlighting colors and
also that one is a contouring color this
one is perfect for my skin tone so
absolutely love that color I really want
to know the name con remember the name
it's really hard to pop out so i will
write down in the description box for
you the colors of these neck
something that I've been absolutely
loving this month are the red cherry
lashes I did a huge order on amazon i
bought loads of different styles 43's
are one of my personal favorites these
are just really really wispy ones I'm
wearing one of the pairs now and the
name is 415 these are amazing as well
and then I also bought some dramatic
ones as well like the number 30s and a
couple of different ones here's another
style and you have just bought loads of
different ones and I've been absolutely
loving them they are super super
affordable and they just look absolutely
amazing on the I amazing if you are a
makeup artist and you don't wanna be
spending loads of money on lashes I just
like to box them up and use them in my
kit those are amazing and they're
actually one of my favorite for quality
they compared with Mac to be honest so I
really really love them next is
something that everybody has been loving
this month and that is sort lip liner
it's a really nice dark pink and I will
show you that there and the reason why
everybody has been going crazy for saw
lip liner this is by Mac by the way is
because Kylie Jenner wore it I know
you're all tired of hearing that girl's
name but it's an amazing color I didn't
get it because of her I did have it
before but I've been loving wearing that
recently and just to let you know in Mac
stores it's literally gone out of stock
globally because everybody has been
going crazy over it including wall as
well which she does use to so this is
just a really nice color to act as a
really nice dark pink it's lovely for
the autumn time and I love it just
complements and olive skin tone
amazingly my next favorite is something
that i bought not too long ago but i've
been loving and wearing every single day
since and this is a cult favorite i had
to join the bandwagon and get you Becca
opal highlight and this is the powder
version this is absolutely amazing um I
don't know if this is going to come out
on my hand I don't know if this is going
to show very well but this is amazing
it's the most reflective thing ever I'm
wearing it now again I don't if it's
coming out because my lighting is a
little bit yeah but it is absolutely an
amazing car lights a really nice
champagne tone it's got gold tones and
in
little bit of a pink tone as well which
makes it just the most amazing high like
for a olive skin tone this is obviously
going to be a little bit too dark for
someone that's a little bit fairer but
they do have other color choices that
you can use if you're a little bit
fairer and also if you're a little bit
darker but this has obviously been a
favorite for a really long time and I
needed to get this and I've just
absolutely been loving it it's so soft
and creamy and it doesn't look all bitty
and look next I wanted to show you an
interrupted eyeshadow you guys have seen
me use this quite a lot and it's a
favorite all around the world people
love this color I love these sort of
burnt tones it's like a really nice bun
yellow color and it's amazing also what
I've been loving this month are the EOS
lip balms this one is I've been a loving
applying this in the evening before I go
to bed and also in the morning before I
put on my makeup this is a really nice
way to just condition the lips I have
been through so many lip balms in the
past and nothing really works for me
whereas these help to keep my lips nice
and supple without drying out my lips
and as we are approaching winter time
this is definitely going to be my baby
and I'm going to keep it with me all
this home because especially in London
the when the winter gets really really
bitter and very very cold so I'm going
to be needing this to make sure that my
lips don't look chapped next are going
to be some skincare favorites so I've
been loving the oil control ocean
recently by Mac I have extremely oily
skin and I've been suffering with some
bad skin recently for a while by done if
you've noticed but my skin has started
to clear up I hope you guys have noticed
I had a lot of congestion in my forehead
area a lot of blackheads around my nose
and I did tend to get a lot of spots on
my cheek area they are still there I do
get a lot of sort of congestion still
but it's not as bad as it was before and
it's slowly starting to clear up I've
absolutely been loving this to control
the oil it helps to disperse the oil
evenly around the face while still
hydrating my skin and not making it and
dry out from the makeup so I have been
loving this and this has been a up
salute go to for me especially in the
wintertime because I don't want my skin
to get dry the absolute most amazing
thing recently for my skin has been the
seaweed facial range and I have been
absolutely loving this
is seaweed range is for combination to
oily skin and it's got that oil
balancing properties to it which I need
one hundred percent and this has been
the main reason that my skin has cleared
up I've been really on point with my
skincare recently making sure that i
cleanse twice a day exfoliator twice a
week using masks once a week I've been
trying my best to keep my skin nice and
clean and getting everything out my skin
and these are really deep deep cleansing
and they have been absolutely amazing
I've got the whole range but these have
been my particular favorite so I'm just
going to talk through these individually
so the first one is the seaweed deep
cleansing facial wash and what it says
on the bottle is that it is a refreshing
gel removes impurities makeup and excess
oil and that is exactly what it does so
I use this twice a day I use this in the
morning before I put on my makeup and
also afterwards to take off my makeup my
face makeup and also to cleanse my skin
as well this leaves your skin feeling
cool and refreshed and you literally
feel like your skin has a breeze hing
against it because you feel like your
pores are open and they've got
everything out this is amazing I know
and people it's a controversial thing
with body shop skin care but i
absolutely love their didn't kill anyone
says it's amazing so this has been
absolutely amazing and this has been the
main reason why my skin has got to clear
up and i did have quite bad skin before
if you refer to some of my old videos
the next thing is the seaweed pore
cleansing facial exfoliator also by the
body shop and it says that it has an oil
balancing polish too deep cleanse pause
and reveal smooth skin and again that's
exactly what it does I use this twice a
week and I use it in the evenings rather
than the daytime because I don't like to
exfoliate my skin before I put my makeup
on it I like to leave my skin to sit so
that it doesn't get all open and the
pores on to open to apply makeup on top
of it so I've been applying this twice a
week it's quite chunky it's not the
softest exfoliator so it's not exactly
suitable for sensitive skin but my skin
is very oily and it needs a lot of
cleansing so I you know I've been fine
with this again it leaves your skin
feeling so clean your pores literally
feel like they're so refreshed
the more you use it the more you see the
difference and i love how affordable
these products are they're really not
expensive I'm getting really scared with
a with buying expensive skincare because
i feel like if it if it doesn't work
it's such a waste of money whereas
makeup you can make it work the last
payment for this month is from that same
range as well is the seaweed clarifying
night treatment and it says on the
bottle balances excess oil as it
moisturizes so because I use the oil
control ocean by Mac on my skin as the
daytime this is my nighttime moisturizer
this is a really nice light gel
consistency it just calls the skin
really refreshing and it definitely
definitely balances the oil because when
I wake up in the morning instead of
feeling all climbing my skin feels nice
and smooth and then when I cleanse my
skin and take this off oh my gosh it is
absolutely amazing it's technically a
moisturizer but you can feel a slight
residue in the morning so I do like to
make sure that I wash my skin and
cleanse it off before I start doing my
makeup and yeah it's absolutely amazing
and I've barely used any of it and i've
had it for so long so I've absolutely oh
I love this one as well so guys that is
the end of my favorites for this month I
can't think of any random favourites
apart from pretty little liars oh my
gosh I literally watched three seasons
in two weeks I need help I literally
need help there's 25 episodes in each
season that's seven to five episodes
that's like 75 hours of my life in two
weeks that I have been watching free
little eyes is absolutely amazing I am
currently on season four I haven't
watched any for a little while because
I'm trying to wean myself off it I just
love it that much so that's basically
what I've been up to in October just
watching pretty little liars constantly

favorite for this month randomly so guys
