today I'm going to be doing with you
guys my October favorites I know lots of
people say stuff like this but how crazy
is it that we are going into November it
just seems like yesterday we were
starting off this year and I just feel
like christmas and new year is just
creeping around the corner and it's just
scary scary how fast this year is going
so October was an eventful month I did
lots of Halloween tutorials I feel like
I didn't do lots of beauty looks so I
don't know I thought I'd have got a lot
of products I've been using that
everyday use I think the last favors I
dog was in August favorites I don't
think I damn a sep tember one so I'm
really excited to be doing a favorites
video again because I love talking to
you guys about products that I really
love and by the way i know i might not
be addressing the fact that i have a new
background and this is probably the
first time that you guys are seeing this
i hope you guys like this kind of
background i'm hoping to have another
area of my room that's gonna be four
favorites videos and talking videos as
well so this is mainly going to be for
makeup tutorials but let me know down in
the comments what you think of this
background i'm personally in love with
it because gold is like my favorite
color but without any further ado I'm
just gonna jump straight in to my
favorites I have a couple of skincare
bits that i wanted to mention because i
had a major break out in the last couple
of weeks as due to stress because i have
been doing my room up at the moment I've
just been changing a lot of round if you
don't follow me on snapchat it totally
should it's makeup by layla as well as
all my other social media so you should
definitely follow me yeah I've been
basically dealing with breakouts not to
mention I have been putting on lots and
lots of halloween makeup and just a
bunch of different stuff on my face I
wouldn't usually put on and so I have
just been needing to get everything off
my face and to clean it properly and to
do that i have been loving the body shop
chamomile sumptuous cleansing butter i
absolutely love this this is a really
nice cleansing butter it smells
beautiful it's a really nice soft clean
smell really nice it's nothing to
fragranced it's really nice you guys
know I love body shop skin care products
so
with the halloween makeup because it
really got everything off and I just
feel like it really helps to melt away
makeup and any other dot that's lying on
or under your skin so I really love this
and this has definitely been a savior
this month because this really helped me
to clear out my skin because it was a
really bad very sensitive it hot to
touch and so this really helped to just
get everything off gently without it you
know reacting to my skin then another
skincare product from the body shop as
well of course this thing vitamin E
overnight serum in oil and I absolutely
love this this is a really nice serum
oil so i use this before i apply my
moisturizer and I just absolutely love
it I feel like it's been dealing with my
dry skin so well this year usually
around this time of the year I would
have a lot of dry skin and it would be
visible for makeup but I feel like with
this the cold really is a getting to my
skin I've been using this every night
and I definitely noticed such a
difference this doesn't make my skin any
oily ah it absorbs a really nicely into
the skin to like it's made my skin feels
so smooth and my skin texture has never
felt this smooth in my opinion is really
helping to keep my dry skin under
control and I just love this so happy
fragrance to share with you that i have
been loving this month as well I had a
little step like you know the little
sets of body lotion body spray and I
think body wash I was searching high and
low to find a full version of the body
spray because I just fell in love her
there and I finally found it in Boots 47
pounds I did not expect this to be seven
pounds because it's a really good size
and it's honestly like the nicest sent
ever I went through that small bubble so
fast faster than i have ever gone
through a body spray before so I knew I
had to purchase a larger one this is the
ted baker london body spray in the mint
color it doesn't smell like mint i will
read what it says on the back because by
an awful at describing sense its
fragrance body spray blends fruity top
notes with violence whilst the base
combines a sweet yet soft vanilla
patchouli and
Amber's though you guys know I love
sweet sense it doesn't matter what time
of the year is I just absolutely love to
smell sweet like to smell fruity and
sweet like that's just my kind of sense
so have a small one of this to keep it
my bag as well so I just love this for
everyday wear and every single time I
spray this I just fall in love with it
so girly so fruity and it just smells
like you know when you just walk past
someone and they just smell really nice
it just reminds me of that like this is
just that nice person set and I just
absolutely love this so if you haven't
tried this and you like sweet smells I
would really recommend this and it's so
affordable I really thought it was going
to be expensive I don't know why I'm
just in love with it so I've been using
this a lot this month I've just cracked
it open this bottle because I just
recently finished the other one and then
next we're moving on to makeup favorites
I have been trying lots of new base
products this month lots of new
concealers and also foundations as well
and the one foundation that I think has
to be my favorite for this month is the
Loreal infallible 24-hour stay fresh
foundation of this in the color to 60
Golden Sun this is probably the closest
joop to Studio Fix fluid from Mac that I
own it has such a similar formula so
many things about this foundation
reminds me of the studio fix I really
really love the fact this is a very
yellow toned color on like a liquid and
then it dries to mean that finiti of
coverage but I would say that you can
build it up to a full coverage too and I
just love the finish this gift this is a
really nice evening foundation because
it is quite heavy for me for day to day
is extremely long lasting I mean I
wouldn't say 24 hours because I never
keep my foundation on for anything close
to 24 hours 12 hours maximum but I did
wear this for a really long day last
week must have been about 12 hours or
more and I did not need to touch up all
day definitely gonna be wearing this a
lot more because I love the color as
well and next I have 2 concealers to
talk to you about one of them will be no
surprise because it has made multiple
appearances in my last couple of videos
this is the Rimmel wake me up concealer
and this is in the color classic beige I
love the color of this it's such a
brightening
radiant concealer like I just absolutely
love the effect it gives it's definitely
a wake me up can see like he'll like it
really does give a really nice
brightened effect under the eyes and I
just I just love that I really love the
effect that it gives and I've just
fallen in love with this concealer I
wouldn't say it's come close to the
maybelline fit me but i like them both
for different reasons and I just
personally love concealers from the
drugstore I always feel like my
favorites always from there don't find
many high-end concealers I love more
than drugstore ones so this is another
drug store than I absolutely love and I
personally prefer this mostly for under
the eyes and I think this is great for
everyday wear it's really Gary just a
bright in that area and to make you feel
more awake so I just absolutely love
this and I've been using it a ton in my
past videos so i can see what i wanted
to mention is not one i have purchased
recently actually purchased this a while
ago to the collection lasting perfection
ultimate wear concealer and the color i
have is a warm a medium 3 and this is
what it looks like this is extremely
inexpensive i think this must have been
about three or four pounds i can't
remember but it was really inexpensive
and I didn't like it for underneath my
eyes because I thought it would increase
because it's long wearing but it totally
creased on me more than a lot of
concealers usually do so I just kind of
stopped using and not too long ago when
I broke out really bad like i was saying
i needed a concealer to quickly cover up
some blemishes without putting anything
else on my face and i applied this and I
was like but a coverage on this is
beautiful didn't need to apply a lot of
this at all and it just covered it so
beautifully so I feel like this is a
great spot concealer I'm talking about
when you have a really bad spots and
it's on top of it just really covered
them up and I was really happy with it
so this is a great spot concealer and I
just really really like this and I'm
definitely going to use this again if
again breakout thankfully at the moment
there's not much breakouts going on in
my skin actually can't believe I'm about
to mention this because I have never
mentioned a mascara on my channel before
this is the bhcosmetics ilanic sexy
lashes and lengthening mascara okay so
me with mascara I don't usually like the
scars from my top lashes is usually
mascara i love for my bottom lashes and
this
is absolutely incredible on the bottom
lashes I never thought I would find
something I loved as much as the
extended play mascara from Mac but this
has just outdone it for me this makes my
lashes look so long on the bottom lashes
this is great when I'm wearing false
lashes because it just makes them look
absolutely amazing it really lends dins
but it does add a little bit of volume
as well so it doesn't make the book so
spiky that it looks weird and I just
really really like this I also love that
it doesn't transfer onto can see light
so hard to find a mascara that doesn't
do that and this is amazing not to
mention that it's really affordable as
well so I've just been loving this this
man definitely going to be repurchasing
this as soon as I run out because it's
an amazing amazing mascara okay another
thing that I'm going to mention one pump
is a surprise either because I think
I've mentioned this about a bajillion
times but Jillian this is the elf
bronzer blush duo in the color EG you
guys know that i have just been using
this like absolute anything this one the
bronzer in particular is one of the
nicest bronzer shades i have tried from
an affordable brand ever i love the
packaging i love everything about it it
just really screams high end in my
opinion it doesn't feel as cheap as what
I actually is is only 450 I believe and
I mentioned this in previous videos
about how much I actually love it and I
just I love it I'm gonna talk too much
by could you guys are probably sick of
seeing this if I absolutely love this so
this is the elf bronze blush duo in Fiji
and then one of the product I wanted to
mention just had to be done this is the
anastacio Beverly Hills highlighter in
so Hollywood I had to mention this
because I have been reaching for this
for months ever since i purchased it and
it has just been such a beautiful
illuminator i feel like i've used it so
much and i've barely touched the surface
or it's a really great long-lasting
product that will go a long way you
really don't need a lot of this which I
love and this looks absolutely
incredible when you wet your brush as
well with a little bit of fixed glass of
water it just goes on like the most
beautiful shine ever and I know that
these are limited edition but if they
ever do come up with illuminators again
which I surely will try and pick them up
if
you can you love that golden highlight
the highlights that I tend to wear a lot
i definitely recommend this in the color
so Hollywood because it's just a
beautiful champagne gold it's not too
yellow where it looks really gold on the
cheek it looks nice and highlighted and
it just makes you feel like you're
glowing goddess okay guys i'm going to
show you guys a song i've been loving
this month i want to try and do this
mobile cuz i see loads of other people
showing songs that they love at the
moment so i'm going to show you guys a
song that i have been listening to so
much i just isn't the whole song and
just basically Sun it the whole time
though I am quite open when it comes to
music like I don't have a specific type
I like I think my main type of music
that I love is just meaningful music
usually and just nice sounding music
like if I like the sound of a song I'll
just like it I could like a rock song I
could like a slow song I could like a
classical song it really just does
depend on whether I like it or not and
for some reason this song i have just
been loving Josh loves it as well as
been listening to it so much recently
it's been on the radio a las we've been
listening to a lot in the car and yeah I
just need to show you guys that song
because i have been loving it this month
and i think you guys might like it too i
think that british and write their name
just here because i actually don't know
how to say it weston and the song is
called into toba has definitely been the
best month of my career so far it has
just had so many beautiful moments in it

final favorite for this month and this
is just a highlight of my career so far
this is a mite silver play button from
YouTube I received this in the post

yourself hard enough and if you have
enough faith you can get yourself to
anywhere there's also Sigma's October
