gonna be showing you this olive and
cocky makeup look I am obsessed with
olive right now so I just really wanted
to incorporate this into an eye look so
this is what I came up with and I really
hope you guys like it I also show you
guys in this video a little bit of acne
coverage because my skin has been an
absolute pain lately so if you guys
would like to see how I cover my skin
when it's really bad and really bumpy
then just keep watching because I kind
of just give you guys a few little tips
and stuff home basically what I do and
yeah if you want to see this full makeup
look then just keep on watching
certificate I'm gonna be spraying some
of these Smashbox primer water onto my
skin and then I'm just gonna be using
some concealer on my spots because for
some reason I don't know why I have just
come up with just a really bad break out
all over my face just the last couple of
days so I needed to cover the head so it
wasn't just color correcting my under
eyes a little bit using a peach toned
concealer and I feel like just doing
this underneath the foundation just
makes my foundation look as flawless as
possible because my skin is quite bumpy
right now it's gonna be kind of hard to
create that nice flawless finish so I
decided to go for the Make Up For Ever
HD or Ultra HD foundation just because
it gives me a really nice full coverage
look and I felt like because my skin is
really bad today I felt like I really
needed it and I also mixed in a little
bit of the bodyshop lightining drops
because this foundation is quite dark
for me so I'm just applying that onto my
scan with my Real Techniques sponge and
just blending it all over and moving on
to the eyes just applied a loop of
concealer onto the whole lid just to
prime it a little bit and then I am also
taking my jumbo pencil in milk from NYX
and just applying onto my lid just to
make sure that the colours we apply on
our lid come out more true to the actual
color it looks like in the pan and I'm
just blending this out a little bit
using a brush and for my transition
shade I'm gonna be using the NYX bronzer
and I'm not gonna lie I had a little bit
of trouble with this it just wasn't
blending for some reason it's not really
a very blendable formula so use a eye
shadow or a bronzer that you know blends
really well because I heard a little bit
of trouble with this one and so I'm just
making sure to blend that as flawlessly
as I can and then I'm gonna go ahead and
just apply a little bit more of that
jumbo pencil just because I did take
away a little
of that white on the lid and then I am
taking this incredible eyeshadow from
makeup geek this is the color dirty
martini and if you love cocky and olive
you need this eyeshadow I'm just
applying it all over the lid using a
flat brush and I love that it's totally
matte so yeah if you're obsessed with
cocky like I am you will absolutely love
this eyeshadow I'm just flipping the
brush over and just turning that in the
crease to kind of use the flat brush to
blend that into the crease area I'm just
relaxing my crease and just letting the
brush sit right in there and that will
just kind of smudge that color outwards
and then I am taking a clean blending
brush and just making sure to go over
that area where the green and the brown
meet and just making sure to smudge that
so it looks like the two colors join
together and it just transitions well
next I'm going to be taking the makeup
geek eyeshadow in the color enchanted
forest and we're gonna be using that in
the outer corner to really give it that
smokiness now you can just leave it with
the original color we placed all over
the lid if you don't it to be too dark
but this just really gives it some
smokiness and really transformed it into
a really nice sexy smoky eye so I'm just
taking that color in the crease and just
making sure to really blend that color
into the rest of it because we want it
to transition and we almost want it to
look like it joins into one and then I'm
going back into that first brush and
just applying a little bit more of that
brown color to make sure it blends in
really seamlessly to the rest of the eye
next I'm gonna be taking the makeup geek
eyeshadow in the color karma and I'm
just gonna be applying this on the inner
corner of my eye I love this eyeshadow
because in some lights it looks gold and
in some lights it looks olive so right
now it's really picking up on them
beautiful olive shade so I'm just
applying that on the inner corner of my
eye or concealer I am just taking some
of the NYX HD concealer and applying it
under my eyes and then I'm gonna be
taking the Rimmel wake me up concealer
and just applying that on to all the
other areas I would like to bring
forward and highlight I'm also just
applying a tiny bit of that underneath
the eyes as well and blending the in
would be sponge I used to blend in my
foundation and then I am just baking
using some of the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and just
applying that on all the areas I would
like to set and bake and I'm just gonna
leave that powder to sit on there for a
couple of minutes and I
gonna do my eyebrows off-camera whilst
that is baking I do have an eyebrow
tutorial down below so I will link that
there so that you guys know how I do my
eyebrows so now that my eyebrows are
done I'm just gonna be dusting away that
powder to reveal as much of a flawless
finish as my skin can be whilst it is as
bumpy as it is I'm just gonna be
finishing off the eyes for now and I'm
just gonna be applying a winged liner
but I'm not gonna be applying any liner
on the inner part of my eye it's almost
gonna be like a half winged so it starts
in the center of my eye and then I
create a nice flick just to kind of
extend my eyes outwards and to really
turn them upwards and I'm creating quite
a thick wing but I like I said I don't
want it to be any eyeliner on the inner
part of my eye I also just went ahead
and applied some black kohl pencil to my
waterline and then I'm gonna be applying
some false lashes the lashes I'm
applying all the dose of colors
showstopper lashes and these are perfect
I don't usually wear lashes like this
but I feel like it went so nicely with
this makeup look and it really kind of
came out woods towards the outer corner
and just really went with the whole
aligner style and then I'm just applying
some mascara to my natural lashes to
make them blend in and to just tie the
whole look together
for the inner corner I'm just applying a
little bit more of that karma shade and
applying it just on the inner corner and
the inner third at the bottom lashline
and with a pencil brush I am taking more
of that dirty martini that we applied on
the lid and just blending that on the
bottom lashline to balance everything
out and then of course just applying
some mascara on the bottom lashline for
my skin I decided to keep it very very
simple I'm just applying some bronzer
around the outer perimeter of my face
because I don't want to apply too much
on them areas where there's lots of
bumps I just feel like it will draw a
lot more attention to that area so I
want to keep it as free of anything as
possible and I'm just applying some
highlight on to the tops of my
cheekbones again trying to avoid any
spotty areas and then for my lips I
wanted to keep it nice and nude just
because I wanted all the focus to be on
the eyes I'm just applying some crown
lip pencil this is in a really pretty
nude shade and then I also went ahead
and applied and naturally transformed
lipstick from Mac and then went across
the outer edges using stone because it
just makes my lips look a little bit
fuller and it also cools it down a
little bit to make it look nice and
neutral so guys that is the end of this
makeup tutorial I really hope you
enjoyed I am so happy I got to do my
spin on a Oliver makeup look because I
am just obsessed with this color right
now I think everybody is it's such a
popular color and I just feel like why
not wear it on your eyes alright it
definitely does suck that my skin has
been so bad lately and you know it was
going so well and then suddenly it's
just gone downhill but the reason why I
wanted to continue to film this video is
because I really hope that someone out
there can be inspired by me just showing
my insecurities to the wall because that
is the only way I guess that I can deal
with them is to help inspire other
people with my own insecurities so I
really hope this helps someone that's
maybe going through a tough time with
their skin and they want to know how to
cover it even if it's just to see
someone else dealing with their
insecurities to help you deal with your
own I really hope it helps you and I
hope you enjoyed so please share this
with your friends like and subscribe and
I will see you all next time
I love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
