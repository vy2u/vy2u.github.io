Ungh
yes
breaking free from whisk informally a
chick force hey guys and welcome back to
my channel today's makeup tutorial is
going to be this Olive Sparkle bagel
tutorial
the first step is going to be applying
our primer all over our lid I'm just
using soft ochre Paint Pot which is from
a Mac and I'm just going to be applying
this all over my lid to make sure we
cancel out all the colors and just make
sure it's all one even color and this is
just going to make sure everything stays
on and appears a lot more vibrant next
I'm going to be taking my bronzer and
use this as our first transition shade
I'm just taking a big fluffy brush and
just applying this into the crease and
just going in side to side motions to
create a really nice even blend and this
will help all the colors we're going to
apply later on blend out perfectly
the next I'm going to be going in with
uninterrupted eyeshadow from Mac and
just taking a blending brush and
applying this into the deeper part of
our crease we want to try and apply as
much color as we can just so that this
color looks really nice and pigmented in
the crease so I'm just going back and
forth between brushes and just making
sure it's really nice and blended out
along with it being blended you want to
make sure that it's really nice and
pigmented also
next I'm gonna be taking this chocolate
shade from the Smashbox full exposure
palette and applying this into our
crease this is going to be the darkest
crease color we're gonna be applying
because I didn't really want to go for a
really smoky look so I'm just applying
this into my outer V and just going back
and forth and just kind of blending it
into the crease and taking the brush we
use beforehand and just blend it out we
want to make sure that this color blends
into the other colors that we apply
beforehand then I'm just taking that
first brush we applied to make sure that
everything is blended out go back as
much as you need to to make sure that
dark brown is as pigmented as possible
next I'm going to be taking this
sugarpill pigment and my mac fix+
and I'm gonna be wetting my brush before
applying the pigment I'm just gonna be
applying the pigment all over my lid
just to make sure this color appears
nice and vibrant and I'm just applying
this all over the lid and just leaving a
very tiny little bit on the outer corner
just so it blends into that Brown then
I'm going to be taking this gold and
applying it straight on top this will
just create a more olivey effect because
this pigment that I had wasn't really an
olive color it was more of a green I'm
just applying this on top to ensure that
it looks more olive than green then I'm
taking the matte reflex glitter in gold
and just applying this on top to give it
a really gorgeous sparkly effect and
just patting it on as much as I need to
next I'm gonna be applying my false
lashes just to give us some extra drama
I wanted to skip the liner today just
because a lot of you guys were
requesting some looks that didn't use
eyeliner so I just apply my lashes
straight on next we only I started with
the skin and I'm applying the natural
radiance primer for Mac and just
applying this all over my skin to ensure
that my skin is nice and hydrated and my
foundation stays on and then I'm gonna
be mixing my mac matchmaster and my
dream satin liquid from Maybelline and
just mixing them together because they
weren't the right colors and also their
different textures so it just kind of
creates a matte but glowy texture at the
same time so I really like mixing
foundations at the moment because you
can come up with some really nice
company
I'm just applying that with my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge and
just bouncing this into my skin as you
can see I've done my eyebrows and the
tutorial will be in the description box
if you guys want to know how I achieve
my eyebrows next I'm going to be
applying some concealer under my eyes
and just creating a triangle effect to
highlight my cheekbones and then I'm
also going to be applying this on to my
forehead and the bridge of my nose I
went ahead and finished off that
triangle shape with a lighter concealer
just to really highlight them areas
then I'm going to be blending that out
with my Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge again just to make
sure that everything is really well
blended and there are no harsh lines I'm
just using lots of bouncing motions to
make sure that blends in really evenly
but I also keep the coverage and
bouncing is really good for keeping that
amount of coverage next I'm gonna be
taking my Sigma 3d HD precision brush
and just getting into the areas that are
really hard to reach and this will just
make it a lot easier to get right up to
the line of my eye and right up to my
eyebrow without affecting at the makeup
I applied on before
next I'm going to be setting my under
eyes with my Mac CC correct powder in
neutral eyes and just applying this
under my eyes and I'm going to leave it
there for a brief amount of time just so
that it kind of bakes on my under eyes
for a little bit and I'm just applying
this in a triangular shape to brighten
and highlight my under eyes then I'm
just going to take the excess on that
sponge and just bounce it onto my
forehead because that area does get
quite oily and then I'm going to be
dusting that powder away with my Real
Techniques setting brush next I'm going
to be taking that pigment that we
applied onto our lid and start to apply
that on the bottom lash line I'm going
to be doing that the same with the
glitter and just applying that on top of
it to create a really gorgeous sparkly
effect then I'm going to be taking some
nude eyeliner and applying that into my
waterline next I'm going to be going
into some Escarra to balance the top and
the bottom lashes and just to make the
lashes look nice and long and voluminous
then I'm going to be taking a light
pigment and just applying this onto my
inner corner just to create a really
nice bright eyed effect you can skip
this step but this just really helps to
open up your eyes I'm also applying some
of that onto my brow bone next I'm going
to be bronzing my skin just to give us a
light amount of color and just to shape
our face a little bit as well then I am
going to be taking the hot mama blusher
from the balm and just applying that to
the apples of my cheeks and rolling it
backwards
then I am taking the Becca opal
highlights ha and just applying that to
my cheek bone next I'm gonna be lining
my lips with the Rimmel cappuccino lip
liner my camera cut it out so I just
lined my lips with that and then I am
taking a soft matte lip cream and just
applying that all over my lips
