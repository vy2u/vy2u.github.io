spontaneous this was totally not planned
it that should be really crazy how this
will happened so basically I was meant
to upload as you're watching this or
when this was meant to upload I was
meant to put up my room tour and make a
collection of the room that I match up
again right now and yes if that was
meant to go up I did all the filming it
took me all day and I literally just
went to edit it like an hour ago and all
of the footage was really like fuzzy and
that has never happened to me before
and I was really upset I called Josh and
I was just like why is this happening
I'm just shocked that and yeah kind of
like let it get the best of me for a
minute and then saying Leyla kind of
kicked in and I kind of just thought for
a minute that listen I'm a firm believer
that everything happens for a reason and
I just I'm one of those people that will
put something off especially if it's
important like I didn't to do that I'm
definitely a procrastinator it's not
good but when it came to this video I've
wanted to actually just sit down and
chat to you guys again for a while and
I've just never let it happen because I
just put important things off and it's
not good at all so once all of the video
kerfuffle that basically happened I just
got a really strong urge to film this
video then you're watching right now and
yeah that's basically it and I kind of
spoke to you guys on snapchat I was
basically just saying that this video
that I was gonna upload the makeup
collection was kind of gonna be me
getting back into things because I've
just not been myself for a really long
time I'm not sure if you can picked
anything up I'm not sure if you've
noticed anything but in my day to day
life all of my family and friends that
are close to me can tell that I haven't
been right for the past month or so I
don't even know how what it's been to be
honest if you did watch my previous hot
top video you have seen that I told you
guys that I have in the past offered
with anxiety and stuff like that and I'm
one of those people again that don't
like to
speak things into existence so I don't
tend to talk about it much I've really
pushed myself to a point where I feel
like I have got so much but that's why
it was like I said this morning I was
really motivated and I was like gonna
get back into things I'm kind of gonna
try and feel like myself again I'm gonna
do this and life kind of came back and
knocked me over again the reason why
I've decided to make this video now and
I feel like it's a really fitting time
is I wanted to just touch you guys
basically about how I've let life knock
me down and I've kind of stayed down for
a little bit and I just feel like this
can apply to a lot of people and
whatever situation you're in because I
just feel like whether you have anxiety
or you don't there's gonna be a time in
your life where you feel like you've
been knocked down for some people
happens more so than others some people
don't feel like this all the time some
people feel like this almost every day
all of us are different but my main aim
of this is to try and just share my
experience and just have a
heart-to-heart with you guys because I
just feel like I have this platform for
a reason and I feel like yeah I feel
like I've been blessed with a platform
to speak about issues like this I'm not
gonna dawn on what's wrong for too long
because I want obviously overcome it I
have let my anxiety get the best of me
and that is where I have been for the
past however long that maybe you've
noticed I haven't been myself for
however long it's been I've kind of
allowed myself to get to this place I
feel like I have the authority over
myself
and I have kind of just like allowed
myself to fall into this one there is
something I can do to stop it because
I've overcome it before and yeah I just
feel like I know what to do but it's a
very easy thing to fall into if you've
never suffered with anxiety before that
I feel like it can be often a really
hard thing to understand for me I just
don't feel motivated to do anything a
lot of the time I kind of just like
don't for managed to get out of bed and
I kind of just feel that
I am my own worst enemy and I kind of
prevent myself from doing what I know
I'm meant to be doing or doing something
that I know is gonna make me happier or
I'm doing something that I know is good
for me me being my own worst enemy will
kind of do anything that I can to
prevent myself from doing this and I
wake up in the morning and I'll just
have a massive lack of motivation to do
anything and that's how I think that's
what's really been affecting me the most
lately and I hate feeling like that
because anyone that really knows me
knows how much of like a hard worker I
am and when I feel like this it's just
so totally far from Who I am like my
character as a person is a hard-working
motivated person so when they're kind of
comes back again I kind of just feel so
far for myself and yeah it's obviously
very disheartening and it's a horrible
feeling to feel like you'll kind of gain
on Ben you're just like this is just so
hard to move on from this I have a
immense belief and faith in God so when
these things happen even when they're
bad for me I still think God for the
things that aren't going right because I
just don't know what he is redirecting
away from me I don't know what he's
pushing away from me that isn't meant to
happen even things that happened that
I'm not particularly happy with I still
know that I can trust God and I know
that something better is gonna come into
place and I feel like that is the most
massive way that I have been able to
overcome this whilst I've been through
this kind of anxiety of feeling just the
pressure of life it's just such an
unexplainable thing as ayah is almost
the fear of nothing it's like the fear
of what could be what would have been
it's like it's crazy something that's
gonna happen if something is meant to
happen I just know he's in control and
I'm just letting go of it and for me
that's a massive weight off my shoulder
because that is one of the main key
points of anxiety is
putting all the pressure on yourself and
trying to figure out in your brain like
what am I gonna do if this happens what
do I do if this doesn't go to plan what
is it's just the consistent continuous
overthinking I definitely believe that
the words that you speak over your life
are extremely important I believe that
once you speak something you kind of
speak into existence and I think just
was they're extremely powerful when you
say really really negative things and
you're extremely negative all the time I
believe that negative things are gonna
happen around you because of how
powerful our words are you should speak
negativity I thought you could only
notice the negativity around you and not
only that I feel like kind of you drew
all the negativity to you but if you
speak positively and you'll kind of see
things for a more shiny sunshiny
perspective and you're just positive
about it then you know that you are
going to attract some of that and I feel
like that's a really important way to be
so I don't really like to just say yeah
I have anxiety and this is it and this
is Who I am
I'm an anxious person I cannot like
saying that I don't like saying this is
me I'm an anxious but I have anxiety and
this is me I like to kind of just say
I'm suffering just with a little bit of
anxiety right now to play it down
because I don't want anything to think
that it's one I don't want the anxiety
to think that it's beating me because it
hasn't and if you are suffering with
anxiety stop speaking over your life
because you will notice so much of a
difference start speaking over your life
that tomorrow is going to be better
not even tomorrow today is gonna be
better like I'm gonna overcome this this
is this is nothing this is nothing it's
all in my mind
it's nothing I can overcome this I feel
like the more that we speak that over
our lives we can do anything I feel like
I have a responsibility to talk about
this it's because I feel a lot of people
kind of look up to the people on YouTube
nowadays or any social media platform
and the way that a lot of us tend to
portray it is that life is perfect you
kind of just betray things as look at
this perfect meal I'm eating and look at
the pie
Vick event I'm going to with my perfect
boyfriend with our perfect list and
perfect that and I just feel that I
would never ever want any single person
that watches me to ever think that I am
less of a human than they are we are all
equal you guys may not know how to deal
with it you feel like you're the only
person in the whole world dealing with
this right now and that you're crazy and
that everyone around you is not going to
understand you and yeah I feel like I've
thought that many times I'm crazy I'm
literally like no one's gonna understand
me they just I don't know like no one
gets it basically I just wanted to be
here to basically say I get it I
understand even if I find keeps me said
even if you don't have anxiety and it's
something else if it's another trial in
your life it's if it's another storm
just know that just because people in
social media betray their lives as
perfect to the whole other like 90
percent of their life that you don't see
so don't feel like you're the only
person going through this just because
of the people that you watch on social
media you might think well so-and-so
their life is perfect they log every day
and their life just looks perfect so
even though people show so much of their
lives they're only showing what they
want you to see I've tried living like
that and I've tried kind of like posting
the beautiful bright lovely Instagram
pictures of pretending that's what my
life is like but it's not and I'm pretty
sure a lot of other people that do
social media can vouch for what I'm
saying and they can still say that
there's still hundreds of other problems
that they have that they have to deal
with on a daily basis I've just decided
that I want to try my best to help
others with the things that I go through
because I feel like God's given me this
platform for a reason both teach people
to do makeup for one which is what
things got started on and to have fun to
put a smile on people's faces but also
as well to be a platform of light I just
want people to
feel like this channel is somewhere that
they can turn to when they feel like
I've been feeling this last month like I
said I've just been so pratfall and so
involved with my relationship with God
and I feel like that's just the most key
thing for me anyways it's been
everything and then further on from that
I've learned myself into something I
really enjoy and that's ah and I feel
like again like that's a gift that God's
given me too it's like my serenity I
love it I just do it I could do it for
hours everything gets blocked out when I
do it it's like nothing else in the
world kind of matters I just kind of
focus on that and I just thought like
connect it to Who I am when I do it and
it's an amazing feeling and I just like
recently rediscovered it and yes that's
been another thing that's made me feel
so good and I just feel that there are
so many distractions in this wall and
there's so many things that people want
to try and make you feel are important
such as our image the way we look the
you know the person that we're meant to
portray like women to almost be a public
figure I'm like nah this is we are equal
at the end of the day no one is more
than anyone else we are all the same and
we are all equal of worth and I just
feel like this video is important
because I don't want you guys to feel
like anything anxiety any trial or storm
within your life anything can stop you
from being who you were created to be if
you feel like you just want to vent to
someone full of my social media that's
the best way to do it because I will try
my very best to respond on that it's a
lot easier than obviously here if that's
public as well obviously if I've ever
spoken to you about an issue you know
who you are of course and I pray I was
able to just try to see things in a more
positive light I am determined to
overcome anything that is thrown my way
anything and I hope you guys just feel
motivated to do the same like we can do
this we are gonna overcome we're gonna
push through
and I just feel that there's just so
much in store for you and I just feel
like you don't know unless you push
through like when things feel the most
intense and the hardest and when you
feel like literally nothing can get
better I feel that that is when you're
about to break through and that is when
you are going to find so much joy and
yeah I just I'm just like really really
trying to push on and I'm so happy I got
the chance to kind of just but I know
like literally like what even is this
video about like it is a bit of a ramble
really but I just want you to know that
your anxiety is not you that is not who
you are you are not an anxious person
you were just dealing with something and
you can overcome this but something I've
wanted to share for a while and I'm so
glad that it happened now I just feel
like what's timing is so perfect because
like I said if I had shared this when I
initially was going to and I was gonna
do a haul - ha I was in a very different
place then and now I'm at so much more
of a stronger place but these videos are
always really weird for me to film
because it's so different to walk I
guess my channel started out to be and I
hope I can do these kind of videos more
often just as a update just to chat you
guys and just to just to remind you this
is kind of just like a reminder to let
you know that you are not the only
person that feels like wife is knocking
you down life knocks everyone down but
it's all about how you handle it are you
gonna get back up or are you gonna stay
on the floor for me for this past month
kind of stayed on the floor for a little
while and sometimes you need that time I
thought sometimes you you need to
realize your strength and you build up
and then you're able to stand back up
again the plan for my life and the more
I kind of stopped worrying about it just
know that it's under control the easier
is to let go because just knowing that I
can't control everything I can't be in
control and is something I guess I had
to learn the hard way but it just takes
faith faith is so easy yet so hard at
the same
I feel like faith is kind of letting go
and just knowing that you'll be cool
sometimes the thing that's trying to
break you is actually helping you to
turn into the person that you were meant
to be and that's why for now I just feel
like I'm in God's creative process and
he's just transforming me and yeah
sometimes turning into the person that
you're meant to be can be painful I hope
that this video was encouraging for you
guys I don't didn't really know where
this was going and wasn't planned it was
so spontaneous it was so different so I
thought I was going to be doing today oh
I was gonna be doing a makeup collection
and I guess for a minute I kind of like
cried and like I didn't care I like
almost cried and I was like why why is
this happening now sometimes we just
can't see what is going on we can't see
the bird's eye view of things and just
see what's going on right in front of us
and really what I believe is that God
was orchestrating something bigger and I
feel like it was kind of a moment to
have a heart-to-heart with you guys
because this wouldn't have happened if
my other video didn't fail so if
something in your life isn't going to
plan something bigger is is gonna happen
something better we are able to just
show love in the comments just be loving
to one another no matter where we're
from no matter who we are it doesn't
matter we are all equal we are one
anothers brothers and sisters if we
thought if everyone thought of each
other as if we were family
imagine how much bad this world would be
honestly so you're all brothers and
sisters down in the comments be nice to
each other give each other compliments
show love I'm gonna be down there as
well and I'm so happy I got to do this
you don't even understand how much of a
better mood this has put me in I hope
you guys like these kind of videos
they're a little bit Rohrer and the
walrus outward rora with a little bit
more raw than the types of videos
I obviously tend to do and of course
like I love my makeup tutorials and I
love fashion and I love hauls and that
will never stop but it's gonna be kind
of my new goal to do these kind of
videos
turn and just show my journey I'm
thinking of doing a draw my life even if
I get to touch one person and are able
to just encourage them then that was
probably a lot more useful than a makeup
collection video even though I still
really want to do that it's so so so
happy that you happen to stumble upon
this video and if there is any other
topic or anything else you'd like me to
talk about please let me know also try
and encourage me down in the comments to
try and kickstart my blog channel again
cuz I need a bit of them I need a bit of
a boot I think probably guys so much I
call me to see you guys in my next video
and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
