so today I have a tutorial I'm really
excited you to see it's on this all map
cut crease it's peach and the whole
makeup look is glowy and peachy and
glossy and I just I love everything
about this I love the combination of the
colors and I really hope you guys enjoy
it as well I think this is so perfect
for this time of year and it just makes
me want to become a peach so if you guys
enjoyed this video be sure to give this
video a big thumbs up subscribe if you
haven't already and let's get on into
the tutorial okay guys the first thing
that I'm going to be doing is taking
some really really light concealer and
using this as my base because we're
going to be doing a lot of blending and
stuff today I really want to make it was
nice and bright so all the colors will
blend nice and easily so I'm just
blending that in and setting that to
make sure that it doesn't move before
today's look I'm going to be using the
Too Faced sweet peach palette because
it's the perfect palette for a matte
peach look and the first color I'm
taking is this one right here I actually
mixed in a little bit of the light pink
shade as well just to make it slightly
lighter but I'm just going straight in
with this color and using it to create a
really nice deep crease color now it's
not super dark but I'm making the
appearance to look like it's deep so I'm
concentrating a lot of this color on me
very deepest part of my crease and then
we are going to be faking a cut crease
of course but as you can see I do a lot
of blending and building up this color
and just going back and forth between
brushes and just making sure there's a
really nice even blend because it really
pays off once you do create the cut
crease so that's what I'm doing right
now I'm just making sure that it's
evenly blended and I do like to kind of
bring it in to the inner part of my eye
as well slightly because I really like
the looks at the skin also I'm going to
be taking this color right here it's
slightly darker than the last one and a
little bit more ready so what this will
do is just add a little bit more warmth
into the crease but obviously is all
deepen it slightly more so again I want
to make sure that I'm keeping this
primarily to the very bottom of my
crease and then make sure it's nice and
blended now I'm going in with this Mac
concealer palette and I'm going to be
using this to sculpt out my cut crease
now this is something that I like to do
gradually I've sped it up a little bit
because as you can see I do kind of
my time with it so I have doubled the
speed because this is probably the most
intricate bit out of the whole look but
I really like to gradually make the cut
crease bigger until I'm happy with it
I don't like to just suddenly create a
cut crease and then I'm unhappy with how
large it is so I just gradually get
bigger and bigger and then once I'm kind
of happy with the shape I just go over
and refine it and make sure the edge is
super super sharp and then once that's
on my lid and it's all blended in I'm
taking it this color right here to go on
top of my cut crease and I love this
color it's a matte peach shade and I
just think it really finishes off this
book and it just I don't know why but it
just reminds me of sweets so I'm just
patting that all over the lid and I want
to create a really nice opaque color
with this so I'm really pushing it into
the concealer that I did apply and I'm
making sure to get it all over even
around the edges where we created the
cut crease and then what I do want to do
as well is just go over the outer corner
of that cut crease with a little bit of
brown and just blend this out very very
carefully I don't want the outer corner
to be too dark I'm just adding a little
bit and it creates a little bit of
dimension next I'm just going to be
taking some of this color right here and
I'm just going to be using this cool
toned color to add a little bit of
deepness to that crease just a little
bit more and I'm using a small angled
brush just to add that right into the
crease and then I'm blending that out to
make it look nice and smooth finally I'm
going for a wing of black eyeliner and
you can totally have a thick wing a thin
wing whatever suits you as a float your
boat I'm going for a rather thick one
because I find that this matches my eye
shape the best I'm using been mix ethnic
ink liner and I love this eyeliner just
because it's so matt and black but it
depends well I'm also applying some
lashes and these ones are the Rodeo
Drive lashes from backstage - better
backstage lashes contour today as always
I'm just using some glue to apply that
and just apply some mascara to make sure
that my lashes look nice and black and
also to allow them to blend into the
false ones I like doing it in this order
especially when I've just finished off
an eye look I'm moving on to the skin
now and I'm taking the glam glow glow
stop why is everything a tongue-twister
today glam glow
glow starter moisturizer and the Sisk is
such a gorgeous glow I love this and I'm
making sure to apply this all over my
skin just so that my face has been all
over glow but if my eyes are so mat I
did want to go for quite glowy skin so I
also went in with the aqua glow primer
which is so hydrating and then I am
taking this L'Oreal pro glow foundation
everything had the word glow in the name
of the product so that means I'm all
about that glow life and I definitely am
today I'm blending this out with a
Primark
I don't even know what to call these
brushes I guess they're kind of spoon
brushes with spoon brushes and I am just
blending it everywhere all over my neck
for my concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me because I love it it's
glowy but it has a really nice medium
coverage and I'm just using my Beauty
Blender to blend that into the rest of
my skin and I just love how glowy my
skin looks and I wish I could keep it
this way without saying it but
unfortunately my skin is so oily that I
really have to well my skin isn't so
oily but it does get pretty oily and I
couldn't get away with not setting it I
set my face using the soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a broad powder which is a change
for me because you guys know I always
use the other powder from soap &amp;amp; Glory
and I've always been bronzing my skin
using this bronzers from Too Faced and I
used something matte because I find that
it bronzes but it contours at the same
time so I'm just using that in all the
contours of my face this is their milk
chocolate one and I just find that when
I build this up it just looks really
healthy and natural for my skin tone so
I definitely love this one and for the
glow I am taking this anastacio so
Hollywood illuminator I haven't used
this in ages and when I did I just
realized how much I absolutely missed
this highlight and then to finish off
the eyes I didn't really do much I just
took some of that saw the mixture of the
Browns and just applied it on the bottom
of my eyes and then I also went ahead
and applied some of this shimmer shade
which is a really nice I don't know it
does have a bit of a peach undertone a
little bit golden on the inner corner of
my eye just to add a tiny bit of sparkle
to this all match my look I love it I
went ahead under my eyebrows off-camera
you guys know I don't really do much to
my brows I do have a natural brow
routine on the eye right there if you
click it if you want to watch it finally
for the lips I was actually going to go
for something matte
to the eyes but because I was wearing a
plumping gloss throughout this tutorial
I really liked the shade of it so I
actually ended up using it on top of the
lip color that I used and I was
surprised actually because I don't
usually wear gloss but I feel like the
gloss is really nice for summer
especially when it's peachy so I took
this Too Faced plumping lip gloss and
that is the end of this tutorial I
really hope you enjoyed it if you did
