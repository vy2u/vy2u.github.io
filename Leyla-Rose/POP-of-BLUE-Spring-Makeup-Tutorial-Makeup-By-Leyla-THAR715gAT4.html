today I'm going to be showing you how to
achieve this pop of blue eyes for spring
this is just such a simple tutorial
that's really easy to achieve and
obviously you can switch up the color
with any other color that you'd like and
it's just the most gorgeous look so the
first step is going to be priming our
eyes as usual I'm using soft ochre Paint
Pot from Mac and I'm just going to be
spreading this all over with my finger
and just applying it from my brow bone
all the way to my eyelid just to make
sure eyes are prepped and ready for
eyeshadow today I'm going to be taking
the Smashbox full exposure palette and
I'm taking this soft brown color on a
blending brush and I'm just applying it
into my crease we don't want to go too
crazy with the eyeshadow today we just
want something that's going to very
lightly accentuate our crease and just
make it look a little bit more shaped so
I'm just applying this soft brown color
just to very lightly contour the eye and
I'm just going in side to side and round
motions just to blend this color into my
crease and also blending it upwards and
outwards
next I'm going to be taking this dog
Brown expresso color on a smaller brush
and just apply this into the deeper
hollow of my crease it's just going to
create a deeper looking crease the cup
next we're going to be applying this
l'oreal infallible eyeshadow and this is
just one of my favorite eyeshadow x'
ever it's quite creamy textured so you
want to apply it with a synthetic brush
and as you can see it just gives you a
really gorgeous wash of color with
little bits of glitter in it and as I am
pulling it over the eye and also
creating a very soft cut crease effect
just to make it look a little bit more
structured then I'm taking this Urban
Decay eyeshadow which is also quite
glittery and just patting it on top and
this just gives us a really nice soft
wash of color next I'm going to be
applying a pigment onto my inner corner
just to create a nice bright in a corner
as we're applying a color under our lash
line we want to make sure that our eyes
look nice and open then I'm going to
start to apply my eyeliner today I'm
going to be doing a nice big flick so
it's completely optional to how big you
want this flick to be depending on the
shape of your eye you want to go with
whatever is best for your eye shape so
for me I can go with a bigger wing and I
just prefer a bigger thicker wing so I'm
just going to create a nice thick wing
next I'm going to be applying some
mascara to my top lashes and then I'm
going to be applying my false lashes as
well this is just going to create a
little bit of extra drama and it just
looks nice and full then I'm going to
apply my strobe cream from Mac all over
my skin just to moisturize and act as a
base before we apply our foundation and
then I'm going to be using my L'Oreal
true match foundation and be doing this
all over my skin and then we're going to
be blending that in with a sponge
you
and once I have a nice even coverage I
like to go over the areas that I need a
little bit more coverage and just put on
a little bit more coverage then I'm
using my concealer and just applying it
under my eyes and on the high points of
my face and it's just going to highlight
these areas and make them look brighter
and I'm using a rounded zoeva brush for
this this is one of my favorite brushes
to blend in concealer and it's just such
a perfect shape then I'm going to be
taking a morphe brush with my bare
minerals well rested powder and just use
this to brighten up my under eye area as
we are going to be using quite a dark
color under the lash line we want to
make sure that our under eyes are nice
and bright next I'm going to be applying
undercurrent pencil from Mac this is a
purl glide pencil and I'm applying this
onto my waterline and under my lash line
then I'm using a mixture of these two
eyeshadows from a morphe palette I'm
just going to start to buff that color
under my lash line with a pencil brush
and this pencil brush is from Sigma and
I'm just going to be going in side to
side motion very gradually blending out
that eyeliner that we just applied
you want to make sure the color is quite
opaque so just build it up as much as
you need to then I'm going to be
applying some mascara onto my bottom
lash line just to create a more dramatic
look and also just to balance the top
lashes
with the bottom lashes then I'm going to
be bronzing up my skin with my Holy
Grail bronzer this is Bobby Brown and
bronzer in golden lights and I'm just
going to be applying this with a big
fluffy brush and just applying it to the
perimeter of my face then I'm going to
be applying onto my cheekbones Becca
opal highlight which I've been loving
recently and just using a fan brush to
apply this then I'm going to be lining
my lips with a nice peachy beige lip
pencil I'm using stripped down from Mac
and then I'm also going to be applying a
peachy Brown lipstick and a lip gloss as
well of course you can pick a majority
of different colors for this but I just
wanted to go with something very neutral
and very Brown toned
then I'm going to be taking draw
cosmetics and nude lip gloss and just be
applying this onto my lips to create a
little bit of extra shine and plug thank
