today I'm going to be showing you this
peach cut crease makeup look
so to get started I'm gonna be priming
my eyelid as always I'm using my soft
ochre Paint Pot from Mac this is just
gonna make the eyeshadow a pick a lot
brighter in color and it's gonna make
everything blend a lot easier as well
then I'm gonna be taking the morphe
Jaclyn hill favorites palette and taking
this coral color and I'm also going to
be mixing it with this orange e brown
shade and I'm gonna be applying this
into our crease with a big fluffy
blending brush and what I want to
achieve is a really nice cut crease and
to start off we're just gonna be
applying this into the crease as normal
and just blending it from side to side
and also upwards we also want to make
sure that this color appears very
pigmented so keep layering it as much as
you need to
then to deepen the color I'm going to be
taking this brown shade from that same
palette I'm going to be applying in this
same area but just a little bit further
down just to add a little bit more depth
to the look and I'm just gonna be
applying this in side-to-side motion
then I will be going back into that same
brush to blend everything out next I'm
going to be taking the NYX eyeshadow
base and this is in the white shade and
I'm just gonna be using a very small
brush to apply the cut crease to our lid
so the shape that we want to go in is
just following the natural shape of our
eye and just almost bringing it upwards
slightly and I'm just gonna be applying
this gradually you want to make sure
you're creating this line as gradually
as you can and just following the
natural shape of your crease so where
your I basically creases this the best
way to explain it and then I'm gonna be
dragging it outwards and we're almost
creating a little flick then I'm gonna
be taking this blush from Mac this is
called peaches I'm gonna be applying
this with a very small detailing brush
and just be applying it all over the lid
just so I can get up right to where that
white stops and just make sure that we
cover all the white and I'm just going
to be packing this on so it's nice and
pigmented
and then just to brighten it a little
bit I'm gonna be going into my Smashbox
full exposure palette and just taking
this matte white shade and just going on
top of it just to make it look a little
bit brighter and I want to make sure
that our lid looks nice and light and it
doesn't blend in to the color in our
crease too much then I'm gonna apply
some mascara and my false lashes today I
wanted to skip the eyeliner but of
course is optional you can apply a nice
wing of eyeliner I think it would look
absolutely gorgeous with this look but I
just decided to go without next I have
just primed my skin with my natural
radiance primer from Mac and then I am
taking my Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation and applying it onto my skin
with a sigma 3d HD kabuki brush and just
buffing this into my skin
next I'm going to be applying some
concealer onto the high points of my
face and also under my eyes and I'm just
gonna be applying this quite a lot
because I really want to brighten these
areas and then I'm also going to be
bronzing my skin so we can regain some
color back into my skin and I'm gonna be
blending that in with a zoeva
rounded brush and just making sure that
everything is nice and buffed out and
there are no harsh lines and then I'm
going in with my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush which you guys have seen me use in
basically every single makeup tutorial
in the past month just because I have
purely been in love with this brush this
brush really helps me to get into the
areas that I can't reach with a normal
brush so I'm just using that brush to
get into that it's areas I'm just
setting every area of my face that I use
the concealer on it with the kickass
soap &amp;amp; Glory powder I hate saying that
name it's so weird
I have done my eyebrows off-camera but
you can check the brow video in the
description box next I'm going to be
applying a white Kohl pencil into my
waterline just to brighten up our eyes
and then I am going to be taking this
NYX copper pencil and applying it under
my lash line just to create a little bit
more of a different shade of orange on
the bottom lash line and I'm just going
to make sure that it's all connected to
the outer corner of my eye then I am
taking that peaches blush again and just
using that to blend out the liner just
so that it all looks really nice and
diffused
I'm just applying some mascara to my
bottom lash line and the eye look is
complete
next I'm gonna be taking some bronzer
and bronzing up my skin just because I
want to make sure that there's a lot of
color rushing through my skin especially
because we are going with quite a nice
peachy look you want to make sure that
our skin it looks a nice and peachy also
then I'm just going to be contouring my
nose a little bit with the Bahama Mama
bronzer and then highlighting my skin
with opal highlighter from a Becca then
for the lips I decided to go for a
peachy lips you match the lid color and
I'm using boldly back lip liner from Mac
just to line the lips and make them look
nice and peachy and then for my actual
lip color I decided to go for the morphe
palette this is the morphe lip palette
and I'm using this really gorgeous
peachy nude shade just in the center of
the palette and I'm just applying that
all over my lips with a sigma I brush
actually it's not a lip brush just a
really good shape for a lip brush I'm
just applying that all over my lips and
then I'm coating that with a little bit
of the NYX butter gloss
so guys as the end of this makeup look I

a little bit different but I really do
