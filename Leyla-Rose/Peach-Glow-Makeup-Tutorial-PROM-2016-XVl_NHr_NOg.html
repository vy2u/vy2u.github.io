going to be this gorgeous peach glow
makeup look if you do want to see how I
achieved it then just keep on watching
so I'm just tying off by priming my skin
using my Smashbox a primer water and
then I'm going straight in with my
Giorgio Armani luminous silk this has
been my favorite foundation lately
because it's just such a glowy just
beautiful coverage foundation so I'm
just applying that with my Beauty
Blender and I'm just bouncing that all
over my skin and just spreading that
evenly I really like how this makes my
skin look really nice and luminous but
it also still does give me a really nice
amount of coverage at the same time
moving straight onto the eyes I'm gonna
be taking my Kiko full coverage
concealer and using that to prime my
eyes I'm just applying that all over my
lids using my Sigma 3d HD precision
kabuki brush and I'm just using that to
create a nice even base and then I'm
taking Peach Smoothie makeup geek
eyeshadow and of course I have to use
this because it's peach and I'm using
this as my first transition shade and
just making sure to really blend this
into that crease make sure this color is
blended seamlessly so that all the other
colors blend perfectly next taking
makeup geeks chickadee eyeshadow this is
quite a weird muted yellow color I'm
just gonna be applying this into the
crease and I'm just gonna make sure to
blend this super well and this is gonna
give us that really nice yellowy
peachy tone in that crease and then just
to add a little bit of depth I'm gonna
be taking makeup geeks Coco bear
eyeshadow and I'm just gonna be applying
this into that outer corner just to give
it some depth and dimension and make it
look a teeny-weeny bit smoky next for
the lid I'm gonna be applying makeup
Peaks
I'm speechless I shadow how cute is that
name that's adorable it's one of the duo
chrome eyeshadows so in some lights it
looks pink and then in some lights it
looks peach on camera I was coming up
kind of YC pink but in life it was
really really peachy so just apply this
all over the inner third of the eye kind
of go over to the half as well and just
make it blend into the rest of the
colors we applied and this just gives a
really nice pop of brightness on that
lid I really wanted this eye look to be
nice and light by also wanted it to look
structured at the same time I'm just
taking some of this makeup geek brown
eye pencil by the way I really like
their new pencils they blend beautifully
I'm just applying a lope on the outer
corner and just
merging it with just a clean brush just
to make sure that it looks nice and
smudged and it just lifts the eye a
little bit so just applying that
eyeliner on the outer corner is going to
really lift the eye and smudging it it's
gonna make it look a lot more natural
just like a natural shadow all lashes I
decided to apply these eyelet lashes
that get longer towards the outer
corners I love this because this really
made my eyes turn upwards and it just
looks so pretty and girly and I just
really like this these aren't the lashes
I usually tend to go for and then I just
applied a little bit of this mascara
from L'Oreal just to get in there and
kind of cut my natural lashes in with
the false ones moving back to the skin
I'm applying some concealer under my
eyes this is the Rimmel wake me up
concealer and I love this concealer
because it's nice and light but it's
also radiant so it's gonna go with that
nice glowy complexion we're going for
and I'm just applying that on all the
areas I would like to highlight and also
conceal as well so I'm just applying it
on my forehead my under eyes and also
onto my chin and I just want to make
sure to blend that really well with my
Beauty Blender to make sure it blends in
really nicely to our foundation as well
you don't see any harsh lines now I'm
gonna be faking my under eyes and also a
lot of other parts of my face because I
really wanted it to look nice and bright
and baked on camera but if you wanted to
stick to a really nice glowy complexion
you could skip this part and just set
all the areas you need to I know that
for my complexion I really need to set
my foundation really well so I decided
to bake today but this is obviously
totally Knox naught and it's totally up
to your preference but I really wanted
to make sure I set my foundation super
well so I left that powder to just sit
on my skin and now I'm just moving on to
my brows and I'm taking some of my uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills brow powder and
this is in the color brunette I believe
or dark brown one of the two I'm just
gonna be applying that through my brows
I really want to kind of create some
shape through my brows but I wanted it
to be a little bit softer than brow
pencil and then I also just went through
with a little bit of her clear brow gel
as well
just to put all the hairs into place
so I didn't want to let that powder sit
for too long so I'm just gonna be
dusting away all of our excess powder
make sure it's all dusted away and what
I really like about this is because I
use a luminous foundation my skin
doesn't look totally flat especially
when I starts up like bronzer and stuff
it still looks luminous especially it
once the S sat on my skin for a little
while I'm taking another makeup geek
pencil and applying that through my
waterline it's a beautiful cream shade
and this is just gonna open up our eyes
and then for the bottom lash line I'm
just taking a little bit of that
chickadee eyeshadow and just applying
that with a flat brush to the bottom and
just really taking it quite low and then
I'm gonna be taking a little bit of that
cocoa bear and just running it right up
to the bottom lashline and I really like
the way this create a little bit of a
halo look around the eyes and it really
pulled my eyes outwards and then
finishing off the look as always with
some mascara just to finish everything
off and to balance the top and bottom
lashes next I'm gonna give you myself a
nice veil of bronze because I don't know
I am at my lightest right now and also
the lighting was super bright in my room
there was nothing I could do about it
I couldn't just like close my cut and so
it was super bright so I was making me
look even paler I was just applying it
in all the areas kind of like the Sun
would naturally hit so the sides of the
forehead just under my cheekbones to
give me a little bit of structure at the
same time and also on my chin and the
bottom of my nose and just kind of all
the areas where the Sun would hit it and
this will just give a really pretty
sunkissed
look next I want my glow to be extreme
because this is a glow looks I'm just
taking a cream highlight and applying it
onto my cheekbones first of all to
really intensify the powder highlight
when we put it on top and to really give
it that glow I'm gonna be taking my uh
Nastasia glow care and taking those
three shades and mixing them all
together and just applying them onto the
tops of my cheekbones just to give us
that glow and make it intense and then
to finish off I want to go for a nice
glossy peach lip and I'm just gonna be
applying a boldly bare lip pencil from
Mac and just running that all along the
outer part of my lip over lining my lips
a little bit as always to give myself a
little bit of a fuller look and then i'm
taking this nyx butter lipstick and then
going on top with a butter gloss just to
really give us that peachy glowy lip i
think a gloss really goes with this look
