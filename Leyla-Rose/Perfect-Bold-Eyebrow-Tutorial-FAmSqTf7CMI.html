today I'm going to be showing you this a
perfect bold brow tutorial now I'm going
to be showing you basically they're kind
of brow I like to go for when I want
something a little bit more dramatic I
do sometimes like to take my brows
shaped but more natural but this is a
little bit bolder and darker so if you
do want to see how I achieve these brows
then just keep on watching so the first
thing I like to do is brush out my brows
with a spoolie I kind of like to brush
all my hair upwards just start defining
the brow and I like to use my Anastacio
Beverly Hills brow is to start to build
up some color and make our brows look
naturally fuller so I draw a line just
underneath the brow and like to brush
that through so you can't see any harsh
lines and gradually start to fill in all
of the gaps so it looks a nice and full
and I do like to start to define my
shape as well so I go to the top and I
like to define my arch and make my brow
look like it's a lot more arch than what
it actually is because my brow has don't
really grow at the top I'm just making
sure that when I'm applying brow pencil
through each time I apply it I also go
through with the spoolie and brush it
out to make sure it looks nice and
natural and I do want to make sure as
well that I'm not applying too much of
that eyebrow pencil on the inner third
of my brow the majority of the product
is in the outer part of my brow next I'm
just taking some eyebrow gel on an
angled brush this one is from NYX but
you can use any brow pomade or gel or
whatever type of liquid product you'd
like to use for the brows and I like to
use this small angled brush to gradually
build up some darkness and some
definition on the outer part of my brow
I'm using lots of small stroking motions
to make sure I'm not applying too much
of that gel too quickly I just like to
apply it mainly on the outer half of my
brow and leave the inner half free and
just where we applied that pencil and
that way it looks like a nice transition
and it looks like it's nice and smooth
from light to dark next I'm just going
to be applying some a clear brow gel and
I like to make sure that the inner part
of my brow the hairs I am flicking
upwards and then the rest of the hairs I
kind of brush towards the natural
direction that they grow in and I'm also
just taking some cream concealer and
applying that just underneath the brow
to really give it some definition and to
really make it look nice and structured
which we really want for this type of
brow and I want to make sure that I'm
blending that really nicely and also
just using
whatever is left on the brush you can
also go to the top of the brow and clean
up and define anything else you need but
I wouldn't recommend applying too much
concealer to this so guys that is the
end of this brow video I really wanted
to show you a before and after between
my two brows and I love this brow style
I'm always doing it when I'm applying a
full face of makeup and when I want to
go for something a little bit bolder
this is just my go-to this is what it
looks like when both the brows are done
and I just know you guys would love this
type of brow because whenever I wear
these you guys just like brows I'm
obsessed so I thought I'd show you guys
how I done it I really hope you guys
enjoyed if you did then don't forget to

will see you all next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
