today I'm gonna be doing with you guys
my favorite lip combinations for this
time of year mainly focusing these lip
combos for winter but I think fuller
winter kind of wrote one on one I kind
of include like one festive one and now
like a really nice red that looks quite
glossy I also include a couple of nudes
of low nude and then some deeper lip
tones as well I just wanted to show you
guys some of the combinations that
personally I like to go for in this time
of year or just some of the combinations
that I think you guys might like on it -
first of all apologize for the lighting
at the beginning of the video the
lighting is probably different to how it
is at the end of the video because it
has gone from white to dark in the UK
literally within the space of 20 minutes
it goes from light to dark and that's
basically what happened today I'm sorry
I apologize sometimes it does wash out
the colors so I hope that everything
came out okay I've basically turned on
every single light in this room to
prevent myself from looking washed out
from this large ring light that's in
front of me so I hope that looks ok so
if you guys would like to see some
perfect full and winter lip combinations
then just keep on watching
so guys that is the end of this video I
hope you liked my traces of lip
combinations I picked out I really
really liked all of them and I honestly
would wear each and every single one of
them the only one I probably wouldn't
wear is the glossy red just because I
personally prefer matte Reds but that's
why I gave you guys the options between
the matte red and the glossy red as well
either way both of them are perfect for
Christmas time so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did them
please I like it for me
comment down below some of your lip
combinations that you like to wear for
this time of year as you guys know I'm
the lip addict so I would love to hear
for you guys love to wear on the lips in
the fall of winter so yeah definitely

haven't already I do pop up three new
videos a week so definitely subscribe so
