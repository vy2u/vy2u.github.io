channel today I'm going to be doing a
video all about wind eyeliner I have
done a video about winged eyeliner in
the past and it's something that I feel
like has been requested a lot lately I
done a how to be a pro at winged liner
quite a while back I think it's about
over a year ago now was a real in-depth
lesson I think that was like a half an
hour video this is of course not like
that it's a little bit more straight to
the point so if you guys do want to know
how I create my winged liner and the
method that I would recommend to anybody
that wants to create it too and just
keep on watching so to begin with I'm
starting off with my favorite eyeliner
this is the L'Oreal super liner slim and
I'm taking this because is one of my
favorites it's very easy the first tip I
have for you is to lean on your cheek
especially with your pinky finger this
just gives you a lot more balance and
will prevent a lot of mistakes so this
is definitely something you should get
in the habit of doing because you just
have a lot more stabilization this way I
personally like starting off the liner
on my eyelid because this is just what I
find easier I actually do the wing first
on my other eye to show you guys the
difference but to be honest is just
whatever you feel most comfortable with
I like to start off as thin as possible
and then gradually make it thicker
because I just feel that we always end
up making mistakes somehow and making it
thicker is always a possibility and the
shape I like to create is just following
the natural curve of my eye next we're
going to be creating the wing and I'm
going to show you guys a little tip I
mean I'm sure you've seen this all over
YouTube but you can use tape to create
the wing because I definitely feel like
this simplifies everything a lot
I think the wing is personally the
hardest part of creating the whole of
the lioness if you could just use this
to create the wing and then you can do
the rest without it I personally feel
like this is really good if you're just
getting started out but if you do want
to do it freehand I will of course be
showing you what I like to do so where I
like to actually start the wing is where
the upper lash line and the bottom lash
line meet so basically your outer tear
duct that's where I like to start the
wing and then once I've drawn the wing I
like to join up the end of the wing to
the middle of my pupil so from those two
lure points I'm going to draw a line
just joining them both together I like
to try and do this in the most fluid
motion as possible and
then once it's kind of created to a
point at the tip I will of course go
ahead and fill it in now once I've kind
of joined those two tips up this is when
you do a lot of the perfecting so what I
like to do is just go ahead and add on
more thickness
I feel like gradually it's always the
best because I just feel like if you do
too thick too quickly it's really hard
to take away but if you do feel like you
do make mistakes concealer can hide
almost anything a really nice full
coverage cream concealer I'm using one
from Kiko and just a small tiny brush
will change your life so I'll just kind
of go ahead and just fix up any of the
edges and this will really just help you
if you go too much too quickly so
usually I'd show you all how to do just
one eye in itself by I'm going to be
showing you guys the other eye and I'm
going to be kind of changing it about
I'm gonna be starting off with the wing
this time just to show you that you can
do it this way as well
this is actually my uncomfortable I like
you know how we all have an eye we're
not really too comfortable with so I
definitely feel like this I always gets
way more mistakes than the other one and
the concealer definitely comes in handy
for this eye so I definitely like to
change up the angle but the same kind of
ratio applies I like to connect the tip
all the way into the center of my pupil
and I feel like that is the good ratio
that works really well for me so now
that I've shown you all how to do it I'm
now going to be telling you guys a few
more tips and tricks and also some of my
favorite eyeliners as well so I just
wanted to come on here and tell you guys
a few things I thought really helped
beginners number one is just the most
obvious and I don't want and dawn on it
for too long because it's pretty obvious
but it's extremely important and it's
just to practice and figure out what
suits your eye shape they shape the most
I am probably experimented the most in
all of makeup with eyeliner I think
eyeliner is one of my favorite things to
do because I feel like it just really
enhances the eyes and the face so I love
to do a winged eyeliner for a lot of
people a winged eyeliner may not be the
actual best course of action it can be
done but it may not enhance your eyes
exactly how you want it to so maybe I
shadow might be a little bit better
maybe doing a winged liner with
eyeshadow or doing it with a pencil and
smudging it that might enhance your
a lot more so it's something that you do
really need to play about with you need
to look at how much space you have you
need to know how much you kind of want
to pull it out words you need to know
how much your eyes up ton it's something
that it's hard for me to kind of just
explain for every single eye shape
because I mean think about how many
shapes that really are closer wide so
there's so many different combinations
if you guys would like me to do a really
in-depth video about my line in two
different shapes then I can definitely
do something like that but it is very
hard to explain because it's something
that is very personal so it's a lot
better off you guys just kind of
experimenting and just trying out and
seeing what works on your eye shape you
kind of just need to think to yourself
like what do I want to do to my eyes so
when I look at my eyes I was actually
more slightly closer set so what that
means is that they're actually closer to
my nose than they are to my temple see
the more extend eyeliner the more is
going to make my eyes look like they're
dragging outwards and that's going to
solve that particular problem so if you
look at your eyes for example when you
feel like my eyes droop downwards too
much then you can kind of think okay
well the eyeliner style I'm going to
pick is going to be the opposite of that
and I'm going to do in my liner shape
there comes upwards more to really
counteract with a downturn a shape so
that's kind of what we're going for
it's a lot of practice but there are
certain methods you can do that really
makes life a lot easier the tape method
is 100% one of the best things to get
started on I started on that with
eyeshadow but personally now I find it
actually harder to do tape than freehand
because I find it hard to get the angle
I just posted like when I do it with my
hand I find it a lot easier so using
tape in the area that you want to create
that eyeliner it's actually the wing I
personally find it's the hardest part
once you've got the line in the place
that you need it to and you've got the
length or you want the rest of it is
really easy in my opinion that's the
hardest part for winged eyeliner so if
you're finding it harder to create that
little line use a piece of tape and if
you really want to try freehand just
really practice and really find what
really works for you so typically to
create a winged liner you would want to
have some sort of the
or gel liner you can use a pencil but it
does make life a little bit harder to
create that super intense line or if you
wanted to go for a smudged winged liner
that is going to be your better course
of action I'm that or a gel but I
probably see a pencil because a gel can
be a little bit harder to smudge out
really what you want if you want to
create a winged eyeliner like myself or
even if it's just a normal line without
actually winging it out but you want it
to be quite intense and very structured
and not smudgy you want to go for a
liquid or a gel so there are lots of
different types that you could go for
but my personal favorite and I think
this is why I've mentioned in my last
video as well so it's actually been a
favor of mic review a long time it's a
pen and this is one of my favorite pen
liners this is the L'Oreal Paris super
liner perfect slim and this is probably
one of the easiest liners to use because
it's so tiny like gaining a really tiny
point is just going to make life a lot
easier in my opinion there are pens a
lot like this this is the elf intense
ink liner this is also a pen I can open
it it's a lot thicker it does come to a
point still which is really good and you
are creating eyeliner you really want to
have total control over the eyeliner so
you really want to be using the eyeliner
you feel most comfortable with some
people actually don't get along with pen
doesn't ly find that these are all
eyeliners this one's from next where it
has a little brush on the end I
personally find these harder to create a
shape I love these for like intensifying
my liner making everything look darker
but I don't like them for actually
creating the wing because I personally
feel like the brush is too flimsy and
it's a lot easier to mess up you
actually want to go for a liquid I
personally like it when they have a
little nip I don't know what to actually
call this it's almost like a little
pointed sponge almost but it's stiff and
that's what makes life a lot easier this
is very similar to the pen so it's kind
of on the same kind of lines I
definitely recommend these over a gel
I'm using a brush or having an actual
eyeliner that has a brush in it just
because I personally find that if the
brush is too flimsy it's a lot easier to
make those
mistakes kind of explained this in the
tutorial as well that you do want to be
as gradual as possible even if you're
going to go for a little bit of a
thicker eyeliner like me you want to
start off as thin as possible and
gradually build it because it's likely
that you're going to make some sort of
mistake everybody makes mistakes when
they do in Thailand and no one could
create it perfectly I make mistakes all
the time people basically tell me that
my eyeliner is like passage is not and
you do not know the struggle it took to
get that the struggle was definitely
real and there are definitely moments
where I'm like okay all right I'm done
with life I just I just want to like
remove it all and start again I really
