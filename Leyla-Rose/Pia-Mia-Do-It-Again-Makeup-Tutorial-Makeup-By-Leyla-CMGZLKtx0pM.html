today's makeup tutorial is going to be
inspired by p.m. vs new music video do
it again
so today I'm going to get started off
with my face and I'm priming my face
with my natural radiance primer from mac
and I'm just applying this all over with
my hands to hydrate my face and I'm also
going to be going in with the deerskin
air flash primer and this is just going
to correct the color because I've got a
little bit of redness going on and it's
also just going to make my foundation
gone a lot smoothly so I'm also blending
that in with my hands then while that's
sort of soaking into my skin I'm going
to be going in with Max soft ochre Paint
Pot and just blending that in all over
my lid from my lid to my brow bone with
my finger then I'm going to be taking my
l'oreal true match foundation and i'm
mixing together two shades to match the
rest of my body it comes across as very
dark when you first see it but it does
much my body I promise because my body
is tanned at the moment and I'm just
going to be blending that in with my
miracle complexion sponge by Real
Techniques I just want to make sure that
my skin is looking nice and flawless
just because p.m. ears skin is
absolutely a beautiful
next I'm going to be taking a creme
brulee eyeshadow from makeup geek and
just be applying this into our crease as
our first transition shade this is just
a really nice warm brown color and it's
just going to warm up the crease and
prepare the eyes for the rest of the
colors we're going to apply
then I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
cocoa bear I shadow and just be applying
this into the deeper part of my crease
I'm using this on laser waiver 228 brush
and this is quite a pointed tapered
blending brush I'm just going to be
applying this into the deepest part of
my crease and this will just give us
that really nice deep set looking crease
and it's going to smoke everything out a
little bit more as well and also making
sure to blend that really well too then
I'm taking a bleached blonde eyeshadow
or so by makeup geek and just be
applying this all over my lid because
this wasn't as sparkly as the eyeshadow
she was wearing I wanted to go on top of
that with magic act also by makeup geek
this is one of their fold eyeshadows and
I just wanted to apply a little bit of
this just to add a little bit more
sparkle to the look and then to darken
the crease a little bit I'm going to be
applying maka I shadow also by makeup
geek as you can tell i'm in love with
makeup geek eyeshadows at the moment and
just going to be applying this on the
very outer corner of my eye and this was
just kind of darken everything and I'm
just going to make sure to blend that
really well as well I'm just going to be
applying some liner to my lid it's not
going to win out too much it's always
going to be like a tiny little wing but
it's just going to kind of lift my eyes
up boys I've just done a medium
thickness of a line on my lid and I've
just kind of flicked out the tiniest
little bit as you can see it's not a
winged liner but it is lifting my eyes
up a little bit
then I'm going to go in with some
mascara and then I'm going to apply some
false lashes this is just gonna finish
off the I look it just makes it look so
pretty and P art was wearing eyelashes
so I wanted to kind of mimic the lashes
she was wearing as much as possible
next I'm going to be applying some
concealer under my eyes and I'm using my
Holy Grail concealer this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer this is just
the most trustworthy conceal I've ever
used it just always looks absolutely
flawless and I just love the way this
looks on my skin so i'm just applying
this under my eyes and onto all the high
points of my face and I'm going to be
blending that in with the same sponge we
use to blend in our foundation and as
you can see it just all ends up lending
out so flawlessly and to get into all
the little cracks and crevices that I
can't get into with my sponge I'm going
to be using my Sigma through the HD
precision brush you guys know that this
is my absolute favorite concealer brush
I've ever used it's just the best shape
and it honestly work so I'm just using
that to get into all the little areas
that are hard to reach and then to set
that i'm using the soap and glory
instant retouch powder and just going to
be applying that with the sponge that i
use to apply my foundation and my
concealer then i'm just going to be
taking some of that cocoa bear eyeshadow
on that 228 blending brush and just be
applying that quite messily under my
lash line just because it's not very
neat I didn't want it to be me I wanted
it just look really nice and sort of
blended outwards and then i'm applying
some mascara to my bottom lash line and
then i'm going to be applying some nude
eyeliner just to open up our eyes a
little bit
and then as for the rest of the face her
face was just glowing like an angel so I
wanted to make sure that I bronzed my
skin but not too much I wanted there to
be a contrast between the dark and the
light so I'm going to contour a very
very small amount just with my normal
bahama mama bronzer by the bomb and I'm
just using April technique contour brush
just to contour the hollows of my cheeks
a little bit and I am gonna go to town
with the highlighter so I'm starting off
with Becca opal highlighted just to give
us first that really nice champagne gold
and I applying it on to my cheekbones on
top of my brows and also on to the tip
of my nose just so that all of the high
points of your face of glowing and then
I also went on top of that by the bombs
mary-lou manizer this is a very intense
highlighter going on top of that with
this color literally makes you stand out
from a mile away but applying on to the
right areas will really give you that
gorgeous sunkissed glow and then for the
lips she looked like she had like a
really nice pale pink nude on so I
wanted to mimic this as well as I could
I'm starting off with a Rimmel
retractable lip liner and just applying
this one to my lip line and I'm also
going to kind of fill in my lips with
this a little bit as well this will just
kind of make our lips look opaquely pink
because the lipstick I'm going to be
using is quite sheer and this is one of
the YSL rouge Valachi lipsticks and I
thought it looked a little bit too pink
so I did go on top of that was a little
bit of honey love lipstick from Mac I
also popped in a flower into my hair so
I would look like her because she did
have a really nice pink flower but that
is the end of this look guys I hope that
