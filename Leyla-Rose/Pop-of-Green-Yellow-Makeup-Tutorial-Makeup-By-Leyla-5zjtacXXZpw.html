today's makeup tutorial is this soft
makeup look with this bright pop of
yellow and green on the eyes which is
going to be perfect for some
so we're gonna get started off by
prepping our eyes and I'm gonna be using
a full coverage concealer for this just
because I was feeling something a little
bit different to the soft ochre Paint
Pot because the paint ball could be
quite drying on my eyes so I'm just
gonna be applying this all over with my
fingers and I'm gonna be applying a
Peach Smoothie
eye shadow from makeup geek into my
crease as our first transition shade we
basically want to keep everything on the
lid very very neutral because the rest
of the colors on the inner corner and
the bottom lash line are going to be
very very bright you're going to keep
all of the neutral tones in the crease
and also on the lid so I'm just using
this Peach Smoothie shade to blend into
my crease and then I'm also going to be
taking creme Brule also by makeup geek
and be taking this on that same brush
and just applying it into the deeper
part of my crease just to give us a
little bit more definition
then I'm gonna be taking maca which is
also a makeup the eyeshadow and just be
applying this again into the deeper part
of my crease and I'm also gonna be
taking this into the outer V just to
define the outer corner to lift our eyes
upwards and then I'm just gonna be
taking that brush from before and just
blending everything out
and then I'm gonna be taking magic act
which is my favorite fold eyeshadow from
makeup geek it's just the most beautiful
liked gold and it's so shimmery and it
just goes on absolutely perfectly so I'm
just applying this all over the lid to
give us a nice pop of shimmer and I'm
just gonna be making sure to kind of
create a tiny little cut crease effect
and then I'm gonna be taking this Urban
Decay moon dust eyeshadow I believe and
just be applying this onto my lid on top
of that just to give a little pop of
pizza and then I'm gonna be taking the
ILA
1 to 6 lashes I just wanted to show you
guys a close-up because look how
gorgeous these are I think I'll have
really stepped up their lash game their
lashes just so gorgeous these are just a
really nice pair of lashes to define my
eyes and you can completely go for just
a little bit of mascara if you wanted
but I wanted to go it for a little bit
more of a dramatic look even though it
is quite natural at the same time and
then I'm just gonna be tight lining my
waterline the top waterline and this is
just going to kind of blend my lashes to
my actual eye a little bit better next I
want to be priming my skin as always
with my makeup forever step 1 smoothing
primer is without a doubt become one of
my favorite primer it keeps everything
on for such a long time and it just
absolutely smooths my skin so
beautifully and then I'm gonna be
applying my foundation I mixed together
the l'oreal true match foundation and
also the maybelline dream satin liquid
just because I wanted a medium coverage
nothing too heavy
because this is a summer look I wanted
it to be quite a light base so I applied
this all over and then I'm building up
coverage on the areas where I feel need
a little bit more coverage I wanted it
to be quite light and natural so I'm
just applying some concealer under my
eyes and this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer this is my favorite concealer
because it's actually really lightweight
and it doesn't feel like you're wearing
too much makeup and I'm just applying
this in all the areas that I want to
bring forward and then I'm taking my
sponge again and just blending that into
the rest of my complexion
again to all these little areas my
sponsor cannot reach I'm gonna be using
the Sigma through the HD precision brush
this is my favorite brush you guys know
that by now and then I'm gonna be taking
my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
and this is just going to set everything
make everything look nice and matte and
it means it's gonna stay on a really
long time next I'm gonna be filling in
my eyebrows and I'm using a new brow
pencil for the first time you guys know
that I always use my Mac brow pencils
this is a soap &amp;amp; Glory brow archery
pencil I really like this guys it's
really natural and you guys know that I
like to go for a fairly natural brow now
and it's just really nice because you
can define your shape without it looking
too harsh and the color that I'm using
is hot chocolate and as you can see it's
really nice it's not too dark and it has
a little spoolie on the other end of it
just like the Anastasia brow Wiz and
it's just really good and very very
cheap as well so I highly recommend this
I can see this becoming one of my
favorite brow pencils ever and I'm just
also going underneath that with some
concealer just to tidy everything up
then I'm gonna be applying the NYX jumbo
pencil in milk onto my inner corner and
my bottom lash line this is just going
to make the colors we apply on top of it
appear a lot brighter and then I'm gonna
be taking this sleek ultra matte bright
color palette I believe and I'm just
gonna be taking this bright green color
and be applying it with a pencil brush
onto my bottom lash line and I'm also
just gonna make sure to take it out and
join it to my outer corner and then I'm
gonna be taking this very bright yellow
color and just be applying this onto my
inner corner and this is what ties the
whole look together and just makes it
look so bright and summery and this is
just a really fun way to wear yellow
when you don't want to wear too much of
it and this is just really nice and
wearable at the same time and then I'm
also taking that NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and be applying that to my
waterline to make my eyes look nice and
bright and then to finish off I'm just
gonna be applying some mascara to my
bottom lash line
then I'm just gonna be bronzing up my
skin I'm using the mineralized
skinfinish in dark to just give myself a
little bit more of that bronzed glow and
then I'm also gonna be applying some
blush which I actually never do because
I had lots of color going on I use the
baked blush by Milani and never know so
and then I'm just taking some Becca opal
highlights and just the applying that
onto the high points of my face and then
for the lips I wanted to go for a really
neutral lip because the eyes kind of do
the talking in this look so I'm just
gonna be applying strip-down lip pencil
from Mac and then on top of that I
wanted to apply something peachy but not
too peach at the same time so I decided
to use peach stock lipstick also from
Mac and this is just a really nice peach
nude so guys at the end of this look I
hope that you enjoyed this really simple
but easy to achieve makeup look it's
really really simple and I am so in love
with it I just wanted to let you guys
know as well I won't be uploading this
