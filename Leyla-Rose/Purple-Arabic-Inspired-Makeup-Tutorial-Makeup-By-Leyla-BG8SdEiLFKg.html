today I'm going to be showing you this
purple Arabic inspired makeup look I am
so excited to show you guys this because
you guys really wanted to see another
Arabic tutorial and plus I just love
recording it so the first step is going
to be priming my eyes with my soft ochre
Paint Pot from Mac and you guys know
that I love to use this to prep our eye
for any eyeshadow or eyeliner just
because it makes it blend so much easier
and it makes the colors appear more
pigmented next I'm taking this red from
this crown palette that's really random
palette that I've had from ages ago and
this is because this is the only red
that I own and it's to be honest it
still comes out kind of pinky so if
anyone knows a good red eyeshadow please
do let me know I was thinking of
Illamasqua as one but yeah I'm just
basically taking the red into the crease
using a fluffy tapered blending brush
and I'm just blending that upwards quite
high you want to make sure that color is
very obvious when we apply the more dark
colors so I'm going in with that same
color with a more densely packed brush
so I'm using a Mac two one seven and
what that will do is just pick up so
much more of that product and just make
sure that it's really packing it on into
our crease and then I go back into our
tapered blending brush and just blend it
upwards you want to make sure to blend
it as best as possible to be honest the
this eyeshadow isn't a good quality
eyeshadow so it's quite hard to blend
then I'm gonna take the morphe three 5s
palette and I'm taking this flat brush
and applying this matte purple on our
lid and this is gonna create a really
nice conflict between the two colors
they almost clash but they go really
well together at the same time so I'm
gonna be applying that onto my lid and
then just blending it into the crease
I'm just taking that same 207 Mac brush
and just blending it into the crease
then I am taking this dark purple color
and applying it with that same brush
into the outer corner and this is just
gonna prepare for the dark colors that
we're gonna apply so you just wanna
apply as much of that there as
then I'm just gonna wipe away excess as
usual just because it gives us a
guideline of where we want to put our
black
next I'm going in with black bean jumbo
pencil from NYX and this is just going
to be the base for our black to make
sure the black looks at really intense
then I'm taking the black from that same
morphe palette and using a pencil brush
to densely pack on that black we want to
make sure that we make it look as
intense as possible and we want to make
sure that we're blending in between each
step as well so I've just gone in and
applied the black and then I'm going to
take that same at 207 brush and just
begin to blend that into the other color
that we used you want to go back and
forth on brushes and colors yeah I'm
using a clean tapered blending brush
just to blend out the colors together
and then I'm going back in with that
brush just to make sure that the colors
look nice and blended together then I'm
just wiping away again just so that we
can see clearly what we are doing and I
just like to do this because I just find
it easier to see where to blend what to
blend and it just yeah it makes life a
lot easier you can use tape if you want
I just don't like doing that anymore so
now I'm going to be applying some more
black just to regain that depth that we
have before and we're just going to be
packing that on in patting motions then
I'm going to take this sugarpill loose
eyeshadow and apply it over that matte
purple that we used this just gives it a
little bit more of a glisten and it just
looks a lot more sparkly and it looks a
lot more pigmented as well
then I'm gonna take this light color
from the morphe palette and apply that
to my inner corner as my highlight now
I'm gonna do my line art I'm gonna do a
long flick but it's completely up to you
you guys can do just a normal liner or
you can do a flick as well I wanted to
go all out because I'm going to be doing
a double when liner as you guys will see
later in the video so I wanted to do
just a normal thickness and then just
bring out the tail quite far and then
just join up the lines
now I'm going in with some glitter liner
just to give it a little extra sparkle
I'm just going to be applying some
mascara and my false lashes the full
sashes that I'm using are the red cherry
102 lashes these are so intense and it's
just perfect for a look like this I feel
like I can never really wear lashes like
this unless I'm wearing a lot of eye
makeup otherwise it's just too much then
I'm going to be applying my giorgio
armani luminous silk this one is my baby
I love this foundation it is the one
that just works the best for my skin I
haven't used it in a week or so and when
I applied it I was just like oh my god
why did I ever stop using you it's just
the best foundation me it just gives me
the most glow that my skin can go
without it being too oily looking
because I do have an oily skin tone and
also because my skin gets a little bit
dry it is also really nice for this time
of year as well because it doesn't make
it look any dry either so it's great for
any skin type then I'm just applying a
nyx HD concealer under my eyes and on
the high points of my face and then I'm
just gonna apply a little bit of matkah
light boost highlighter on the high
points of my cheekbone and then I'm just
blending that all together with a more
Fuji one brush and this is just gonna
make everything blend together really
seamlessly
then once I'm done with that I'm just
going to go over my face with the powder
the powder that I'm using is my trusty
L'Oreal True Match powder I love this
and it just makes my face look so smooth
so I'm just going over my whole face
with that you can obviously not do this
if you want because it does create more
coverage so you can just go with a
normal translucent powder if you didn't
want the extra coverage then I'm just
filling in my eyebrows horribly and my
eyebrows are growing out at the moment
so I just feel like whenever I do my
eyebrows it just doesn't look right so
yeah don't worry about my eyebrows at
the moment they just look a mess so yeah
I just filled them in with a Mac brow
waterproof brow cream and then I'm going
to start doing the eyeliner so this bit
is quite tricky but you want to make
sure that you're using a really small
brush I'm using a very small detailing
liner brush from zoeva and it's just so
easy when you've got a small brush just
to get in all the little crevices so
what I'm doing is just creating a tiny
little in a corner and triangle on the
inner corner then I'm filling my
waterline with Mac fascinating.i pencil
and I look a bit crazy but what I
basically done is just taking that all
the way underneath my eye and boy it all
the way underneath the flick that we've
done as well then what I'm gonna do is
take a gel eyeliner and just to begin to
draw almost like 8fo waterline so it
makes the eyes look a lot more open then
what I'm going to do after is start to
blend the eyeshadow and it all does come
together at the end it does look pretty
crazy until it's all blended out but
yeah it's just to basically make your
eyes look a little bit more open and I'm
also drawing a extra wing as well on the
outer corner of my eye so I'm taking
that matte purple eyeshadow that we
applied on our lid and I'm just using
that to blend out then I'm going over
that line a little bit more with a black
eye shadow
and I'm just going along the very top of
the line and just making it look a
little bit more defined then I'm
applying something bottom lashes of
course this is optional is again I kind
of ruin all out for this one and this
just creates a more definition it's
really great for photo shoots and stuff
like that and it looks amazing in photos
obviously I just can't wait to get them
off because I find them really
uncomfortable but this is completely
optional then I just bronze to my face I
don't wanna go too crazy with the face
because there's so much going on on the
eyes and then I'm highlighting my face
with mary-lou manizer by the balm
then I'm just lining my lips with my
trusty cream Oh spice at lipliner from
Mac and I'm going for like a kind of
pinkish lip just to go with the eyes I
wanted it to be a really light pink so
yeah I'm using a nude lip liner and
obviously you can pick any one but I
just love this color because you can use
it with so many different lip liners
because it's kind of got an undertone of
pink so you can use it with nudes or you
can use it with Pink's as well so I love
this one and then I'm going in with
Gerard cosmetics Buttercup and this is
just the most stunning pinky nude ever
and it's just perfect for this look
because it's quite minimal but it's also
really pretty and glamorous at the same
time and so I just applied that all over
and I am also going to be putting my
discount code in the description box so
if you did want to get money off their
website I will put it down there for you
as well
definitely check that out then I'm just
topping that off with the draw cosmetics
butter cream lip gloss and I just love
this so much it just creates the most
gorgeous glossy pinky nude and I just
think it looks gorgeous
