today's makeup look is going to be this
purple and gold glamorous look if you
guys want to see how to achieve this
makeup look then please just keep on
watching
so the first step is going to be priming
my eyes as always I'm using my soft
ochre Paint Pot from Mac this is just
going to clear all of the pigmentation
and just make it a really nice fresh
blank new canvas to work on I'm just
going to be applying this all over with
my finger from my brow bone all the way
to my lid then I am taking a morphe
palette and taking this purple color I'm
going to begin to apply this into the
crease as our first transition shade
this kind of comes onto the lid as more
of a popularly pink so when we apply bit
deeper purple this is just going to help
blend out to that deeper purple so I'm
just using a really fluffy brush to make
sure this looks really nice and buffed
out then I'm taking sugar pills poison
plum which is probably the most
pigmented purple I own I'm just using a
thicker blending brush and just applying
this into the crease and going back and
forth just to make sure that it is
really well blended
I'm also going back into that other
brush that we first used to apply the
pink just because I want to make sure
that everything is really well blended
go back into that purple as many times
as you need to to make sure it's as
pigmented as possible
then I'm just going to be cleaning up
these sides of my eye before we apply
our black eyeshadow this is corrupt from
makeup geek and I'm just going to be
using a pencil brush to apply this into
my outer V this is just going to add a
little bit of depth and smokiness and
it's just going to make the whole look
kind of come together and I'm just using
that brush that we use to apply the
purple to make sure this black is really
well blended again go back into that
black as many times as you need to to
ensure that it is as pigmented as
possible next I'm going to be taking
magic act which is also a makeup geek
eyeshadow this is one of their foiled
eyeshadows and I'm taking a synthetic
brush and just using this to apply it
all over my lid
I'm almost creating sort of a cut crease
effect because I don't want this to be a
really buffed outline I want it to reach
our crease and then it's top so I want
it to be fairly harsh and just want to
make sure that it's quite pigmented and
it covers the whole lid then I'm taking
makeup geeks shimmer shimmer and just
applying this as our inner corner
highlight with that same brush next I'm
going to be taking some gel eyeliner and
a small eyeliner brush and I'm just
going to begin to kind of line my eyes a
little bit I'm actually not going to be
winging this out but I'm gonna just sort
of take it out so it blends into that
black a little bit and I'm gonna try and
make sure this wing is as thin as
possible because I wanted this look to
be more about the eye shadow that a
really thick winged up eyeliner but the
eye liner is going to help to lift up
our eyes as well I'm also going to be
creating a tiny little feline flick on
the inner corner just to drag our eyes
downwards a little bit and to give us a
really nice feline effect then I'm
applying my mascara and I'm going to be
applying some false lashes I'm using the
red cherry 47 lashes
next I'm going to be getting started on
my skin and I'm using the makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer and I'm just
going to be applying this all over the
areas that need some smoothing and this
is the best primer to smooth out my skin
I have really been loving this and I'm
just applying this all over with my
hands and then I'm taking some of the
Laura Mercier silk cream foundation and
this is an e-collar sand beige and I'm
just applying this all over my skin and
I'm going to be blending this in with
the Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge
once that's all blended in we're going
to be applying some concealer to our
under eyes and also the areas that we
want to highlight I have done my
forehead my chin and the bridge of my
nose just because these are the areas I
want to bring forward I'm going to be
blending that into the rest of my
complexion using the same miracle
complexion sponge from Real Techniques
and then as always to get into the tiny
little areas that my sponge cannot reach
I'm using my Sigma through the HD
precision brush and I'm just using that
to blend in the concealer I'm just going
to be using this kick-ass powder from
soap &amp;amp; Glory to set my under eyes and
also the other areas where I applied
that concealer
next I'm just going to be applying some
concealer underneath my brows and I'm
going to be filling them in I'm using
the Mac waterproof brow set in quiet
brunette and then I'm also going to be
using the Mac lingering pencil
to finish off the eyes I'm going to
apply some of that same gel liner we
applied on the top lash line and apply
that to our waterline and I'm also going
to drag a very small amount of it on the
outer corner of our eye just underneath
the lash line and then I am taking some
more of that sugarpill poison plum
eyeshadow and just applying that to the
bottom lash line just to kind of balance
the top and the bottom lid so that they
look like they're all connecting and it
just supposed the look together then I'm
applying some mascara to my bottom
lashes and the look is complete
to give my skin some color I'm using the
mineralized skinfinish from Mac in the
color dark golden I'm just using this
all over the outer perimeter of my face
just to give myself a little bit more of
that bronzed effect and then I am taking
the bombs Bahama Mama bronzer to contour
and then I'm taking this Kiko eyeshadow
in number three and just using this to
highlight I did wet my brush beforehand
to give us that really nice intense
highlight and I'm just applying it onto
my cheekbones and also the tip of my
nose I also contoured my nose a little
bit as well and then to finish off for
the lips I am using sort lipliner from
Mac and I'm just using this to go all
along the outside of my lips this will
just create a really nice full lip line
because soar is a really great color to
make your lips look a lot further and
then I'm also going to be taking berry
smoothie lipstick from Gerard cosmetics
and applying this all over this is
basically the color of soar in a
lipstick so this is a really really nice
color and I'm also going to be going
over with buttercup lipstick also from
Drori cosmetics and just using this to
lighten up my lips a little bit just
because I felt like it was a little bit
too dark and that is the finished look
