Channel today I'm going to be showing
you this tutorial on this purple I style
and it's a nice style with an inner and
outer corner smokey look so I'm really
excited for this I'm going to be
applying my primer as usual my primer is
a must for a flawless I application so
making sure to apply a base then I'm
also going to be applying a white base
on my lid and blending that with my
finger this is the NYX jumbo pencil in
milk then I'm taking passionate by Mac
and applying that with a blending brush
above my crease this is a very crucial
part of the lip I feel like the pink
really helps to blend out the purple and
the other colors will be using
I'm just using loads and loads of
blending motions
then I'm going to be taking these two
silver colors from my Smashbox at full
exposure palette and applying that to
the center of my lid and we may need to
go over this afterwards as we are going
to be applying bright colors on the
inner and outer corner I'm just passing
that on with a flat brush then I'm going
to be taking poison plan by sugarpill
and applying that on the outer and inner
corner with a blending brush then I'm
going to blend that upwards and just
blend it side to side connecting the two
parts then going back with that other
brush with passion on it and going to be
blending that all together this look
requires a lot of blending so just keep
blending then I'm going to be taking
more of that poison plum color and a be
applying it on my outer and inner corner
again it's important to build colors up
very very slowly rather than just
putting on loads at once that way it
makes it a lot more blendable so then
I'm just blending again with that brush
we're passionate on it again then I'm
going over that silver to make it pop
the silver in the center really makes
the eyes look a lot more rounded and a
lot larger so that's what the kind of
look that I was going for then I'm going
to be taking my black from that same
Smashbox palette and applying it in the
outer corner and also in the inner
corner this is just going to give our I
more definition and it's going to give
us a really structured I this is why
they call it the halo I because it
almost perhaps a ring around the eye
then I'm going to be blending again
making sure that that purple is blending
into that pink then I'm going to be
wiping it away the sides of the eye to
make it look nice and finished off then
I'm going to be taking a purple eye
pencil and be putting it underneath my
lash line and I'm also going to be
blending that color out with the black
and the purple mix together on a pencil
brush
next I'm going to be applying liner to
the top of my lids this is just going to
make the eye look even more defined and
I'm going to be doing quite thick liner
with no wing and this is just going to
make our I look even more rounded
because I'm going to be doing a rounded
shape of eyeliner if I was to bring the
eyeliner outwards it would make the eyes
more extended but what I'm doing is
making sure that the eyeliner is round
rather than extended next I'm just
putting that NYX jumbo pencil on my
inner corner and in my waterline and
this is just going to make my eyes look
so much larger and as you can see I've
already applied my false lashes and my
mascara now I'm just buffing in my
foundation with a sponge this is the
real techniques sponge and then I'm
going to be applying my foundation I
mean my concealer as usual so I'm
blending that out with my finger and
then I'm going to go further in to blend
it with the same sponge and this just
gives it a really flawless finish and
just blend that into the rest of our
face
next I'm going to be going over that
concealer with a powder using the same
sponge and it's just going to mattify
the lip next I'm going to be filling in
my eyebrows a little bit differently I'm
going to be flicking my hair's upwards
with a tinted brow gel by Mac and this
is just going to let the hairs obviously
stick upwards and as you can see my
eyebrow shape has changed a very small
amount and I really like to do a
slightly more natural brow nowadays I've
been really preferring it and because my
arch isn't very defined I'm just adding
a little bit of an arch but keeping the
inner corner free of anything i'm just
using my natural hair and sort of the
natural shape that i already have next
I'm going to be highlighting under my
brow with some concealer and this is why
a light to conceal us i'm just going to
be going underneath to sort of help the
shape and also to lift my brow next I'm
going to be running as normal with my
Bobby Brown bronzer and golden light and
it's just going to structure my face and
also going to give it some color then
I'm going to be highlighting with my
mary-lou manizer by the barn and this is
just going to give me a really nice glow
I wanted the face and the lips to be
really simple because the eyes are so
much and here's the most boring step
ever applying my same diploma that I
always do and to the line of my lips
next I'm going to be applying my Gerard
cosmetics lipstick and nude absolutely
love this color this is a really nice
peachy color but I wanted to make it a
little bit more pink so I put a soft
matte lip cream I will have the colors
in the description box hey I'm just
putting this on top of that color so
guys once your lipstick is on that look
is complete I hope you learned something
new today and you enjoyed don't forget

see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
