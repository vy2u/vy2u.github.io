gonna be showing you how to achieve this
pabu smokey eye you guys have been
requesting a makeup look that involves a
little bit more color lately also don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already and if you do wanna see
how to achieve this look then just keep
on watching
so the first step is gonna be priming my
eyes as always you guys know that I'd
love to do this just because it makes
the eyeshadows stick and blend a lot
easier so I'm just using a concealer to
prime my eyes and I'm also just gonna
make sure I set it into place so that
it's not too sticky and also that it
stays in place as well so I'm gonna be
taking the makeup geek mani MUA palette
and I'm just gonna be taking the color
Sora and I'm gonna be applying this into
my crease this is very similar to makeup
geek
latte it's a very similar kind of color
it's just a little bit more Orange II
but this is just gonna help the darker
color to blend a lot easier then from
that same palette I'm taking the color
Mars and this is the reason why I'm
actually using this palette because it's
the only reddish matte shade that I
actually own so I'm just gonna be taking
this and blending that into the crease
and just making sure that it's blending
really evenly this color can be quite
hard to blend and to make it look nice
and pigmented in the crease we do want
to go back and forth between your
brushes so it looks nice and pigmented
to make the powerful that I'm gonna be
applying onto my lid pop a little bit
more I'm gonna be taking the NYX jumbo
pencil in milk and I'm just applying it
all over my eye just on the lid area I
don't wanna go over the crease colors
that we applied and I'm just gonna be
taking a brush and just kind of patting
it in the area that I did apply it just
to make sure that it's not too sticky or
thick this is just kind of blend out a
little bit before I apply anything on
top of this on top of that I'm gonna be
applying a mixture of wisteria and
curfew eye shadows from makeup geek and
first of all just taking wisteria and
this is a matte lavender shade and I'm
applying this on the inner corner and
then I'm gonna be taking curfew and
applying it on the other half of my eye
more towards the outer part and I just
found that this combination was really
nice I felt like the curfew shade was a
little bit too dark on its own so that
little pop of brightness on the inner
corner just really adds some dimension
to the whole eye and as always we need
to do a little bit of extra blending
because blending is so incredibly
important and I'm gonna be going back
and forth in between the red Mars shade
and the curfew dark purple color this
will just make sure that those colors
blend a lot easier and then I am just
taking a little bit of cherry color also
from makeup geek and applying this onto
the outer corner just to add a tiny
little bit of smoke
and also just to act as that little
transition between the dark purple and
the red I'm just gonna be wiping the
sides of my eye to create a really nice
sharp edge I personally really like the
way that this looks that you can totally
leave it nice and soft if that is the
kind of look that you want to go for I
really like to drag it upwards because I
feel like it really changes the shape of
my eyes and because I wanted to do it
something a little bit different rather
than an actual winged liner with liquid
eyeliner today I'm just taking a low bit
of this cold pencil from zueva and just
applying it onto the outer corner and
I'm just taking a little bit of black
eyeshadow and just allowing this to
blend upwards instead of it looking
harsh that way it just looks a little
bit more wearable and also just gives a
little bit more smokiness to that and
I'm just making sure to blend it really
nicely as well so I don't have you guys
have noticed that every single color
that I've used so far is totally matte
so to add a little bit of sparkle onto
the inner corner I'm gonna be taking the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in the
shade whimsical and this just gives a
little bit of pop a very very light
lavender on that inner corner and I just
think it changes up everything and it
just makes it look a little bit more
brighter on that inner corner and of
course finishing with a pair of lashes
and some mascara as always
moving onto the skin I'm gonna be
priming my skin using the strobe cream
from Mac and my skin has been a little
bit of a pain recently just because I
have been eating really badly and when I
eat badly like when I eat unhealthy food
it really shows in my skin I'm taking
the NARS sheer glow foundation and just
applying this all over and I'm gonna be
blending this in with my Beauty Blender
the reason why I chose this foundation
today is because not only is my skin
breaking out like I've got a few bumps
under my skin but it's also been really
dry as well which I don't know if that's
linked to the food I don't know what's
going on but it's really dry and this
foundation is really nice and full
coverage but it's actually really
moisturizing at the same time I'm
actually gonna be cream contouring and
highlighting today which I very rarely
do so to just count try it with my dark
under-eye circles I'm just gonna be
color correcting a little bit with this
peachy toned concealer and then I'm
going to be going over the top of that
with a cream contour kit which I was
actually trying for the first time in
this video is the iconic London cream
contour kit and I have never tried this
before but I've seen it everywhere and I
was just so excited to try this this is
genuinely so creamy so I'm just applying
this onto the sides of my nose just to
narrow my nose and then also under my
eyes just to of course lift my eyes as
well and to give me the appearance
cheekbones also gonna be applying this
onto the center of my forehead and my
chin as well just to bring all the
attention and light to the center of my
face and I'm just gonna be blending this
in with my Beauty Blender as well and as
you can see it's a really gorgeous
yellow toned color and it looks really
creamy and even though my skin was
totally dry it didn't make it look more
dry which is perfect and to contour I'm
just gonna be taking this color right
here this is actually such a gorgeous
tone I don't know if you guys can see
but it's absolutely perfect for me if
I'm gonna contour it would definitely be
using a tone like this because it's dark
enough to actually show up on me but it
does have a nice cool undertone which is
absolutely perfect because if you want
to contour a cool tone it's definitely
perfect and also I don't really like a
strong contour just because it looks
like too much on my face so this looks
really nice and natural which I love now
I'm just gonna be baking my under eyes
and also a lot of the other parts of my
face as well using my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and I applied
it really messily today don't know
what's going on I'm just applying it on
pretty much the areas where I applied at
the high
color and I'm gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows off-camera and I will lick the
tutorial down below just dusting away
that powder because it was sitting on my
face whilst I'd done my eyebrows so now
that I'm dusting that away I can bronze
my skin and stuff like that so I'm just
bronzing my skin with a little bit of
the bronze shade from the shade and
light palette again like I said I'm not
going for anything too crazy on the skin
as usual to be honest it's very rare
that I do go for a lot of the skin
anyway and I'm just very quickly
finishing off the eyes not doing
anything too crazy I'm just applying
some of that black pencil we applied on
the top and just applying it on the
waterline and the bottom lash line and
just literally blending it out that's
all we're gonna be doing I use a tiny
little bit of brown eyeshadow just to
help it move a little bit better but
that's pretty much it and then I
finished it off with a little bit of
mascara as I always do and I'm just
gonna be applying it some highlight onto
the tops of my cheekbones as well this
is a strobing stick from iconic London
or so and I'm just gonna be applying
this on the tops of my cheekbones and
blending out with my Beauty Blender and
for the lips I decided to go with the
whole Barbie theme just cuz it looks
kind of pinky powerful I decided to
apply candy cane lip liner from Kylie
cosmetics onto my lips and then fill in
the lips with the Coco K liquid lipstick
from Kylie cosmetics also and I like the
mixture of this I like to personally go
for a darker lip liner with a light
liquid lipstick just because it suits my
lip shape better and it makes me look
like I have for the lips which is
perfect this is the finished look I
really hope you enjoyed if you did the
