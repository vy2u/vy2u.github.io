today I'm going to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A with
you I am really excited about this video
I have honestly went to do a Q&amp;amp;A for so
long and so many of you have joined me
in the last few months I've only other
done one Q&amp;amp;A before and it was ages ago
I was way in the beginning of this year
I have grown so much since then as a
person and I just feel like you know you
look back and you just think that person
is completely different to how you are
now that's how I feel about that I will
link the other Q&amp;amp;A down below if you
want to see that Q&amp;amp;A cuz obviously
different questions would have been
asked I asked you guys on YouTube and
also on Instagram what questions you
would like to ask me and I got a ton on
Instagram and I also got quite a few on
YouTube as well so I decided to do both
of them just in case some of you didn't
have Instagram all of you guys do follow
me on there but if you don't I did ask
on YouTube as well and yeah I'm really
excited I don't a blob on too much
because I have so many and I want to try
and answer as many as I can so let's
just jump straight into it I'm going to
get started with the Instagram questions
and then I'm going to do the YouTube
ones after the main one I think I got
about 40 comments literally on the same
thing I have said this before and i'ma
say it again so I have got this one
question over and over and over and over
and over and over honestly every single
day I get asked where do you originate
from what is your nationality where is
your motherland and it's so question
like that I get all the time
I am turkish cypriot of origin but I was
born and I've lived in London my whole
life
so target Supriya is just my origin this
is a big broad question I'm gonna try
with the names but if I can't pronounce
it I'm just gonna pop the name up here
anyway so even if I do mispronounce a I
am very sorry I am like the worse with
pronouncing things I'm very sorry okay
so Heidi boo xox o asks how tall are you
what do you do to stay fit and did you
go to cosmetology school okay so the
first one is how tall are you I am 5
foot 4 so I am pretty average hi I'm not
short extremely short and I'm not really
tall either I'm just like just under
average I think I'm still pretty small
I'm quite petite in size what do I do to
stay fit I am honestly the worst I used
to
got a lot more than I do right now right
now I'm doorman really done mug I'm
gonna start training within the next
couple of weeks the reason why I haven't
been training is because I've had a
little bit of health issues I have got
into the way of me exercising when I do
go back to training and what I did used
to do is I used to do a lot of weight
training I like to stay away from cardio
because I do have a very fast metabolism
and my aim is to gain muscle instead of
losing weight and I want to sort porns
mass I did lots of squats and lunges
with very heavy weight for my size to
try and build muscle when I do get back
into gym life a little bit more I will
definitely do workout routines with you
guys because some of you may know or may
not know my boyfriend is a personal
trainer so he's amazing he gives me the
best information possible and what I do
is definitely the best thing for my body
type so when I do get back into a better
regime of training I will definitely do
some workout videos for you guys and
then she also are still I go to
cosmetology school and yes I did go to
cosmetology school which is basically
like beauty school here in the UK
princess anastasiya or Anastasio I don't
know the right way to pronounce that
people say I pronounce the brand wrong
I'm really sorry I don't know it's my
English accent makes me pronounce
everything posh when did you first
become a Christian tell us more about
your faith I love this question if you
guys have known and followed me for a
while you would know that my faith is a
very huge part of who I am I became a
Christian four years ago just over four
years ago and I went to the church that
I am at currently now and it honestly
changed my life it made me realize that
there was a huge gap missing in my life
like I didn't find myself until I found
the God that I saw my faith gives me
strength and without my faith I would
have crumbled a long time ago I owe it
all down to my faith in Jesus they got
by Natalie Katie ex-us what's your
favorite memory with your boyfriend is
so hard to pick just one me and my
boyfriend we are literally best friends
in the sense that we do so much together
that I can I mean I'm sure other couples
do as well but we do other things that I
think friends do as well like we are
just so close he is probably the person
that makes me laugh the most in this
world and he is just so funny we make
each other laugh we crack up
we are just best friends so it's hard to
big just one memory I don't know if I
can pick one we've had a million it's
like we've had so many I can't even just
think of one I don't know I can't even
think Parrish Sloane asks if you could
choose one brand of makeup to wear for
the rest of your life what would it be
so you guys know I'm like probably one
of the most multi-brand people ever I
use things from the drugstore high-end
anywhere every single brand I'm open to
so it's really hard for me to pick just
one why I would honestly have to say Mac
not because Mac is my favorite brand
it's definitely not my favorite band I
just feel that Mac has the most
selection and I feel like if I only had
to shop it back for the rest of my life
I think I'd be content because they have
you know all sorts of different colors
for eyeshadows and foundations and
lipsticks they have a lot to suit all of
my needs so I think Mac would probably
be the one I'd go for and they are a
great brown but they're not my favorite
I just think they have the most
selection so major Alonso on describe so
sorry if I'm mispronouncing a name I'm
very sorry
he asks are you going to do a boyfriend
tag soon so they still think you're
gonna have to ask Josh every single time
I ask him he's like when you get to 100k
and then I bet when I get to 100k he's
going to be like when you get to 150 K
he's always trying to push it I think
he's a little bit nervous to come on
camera but I think he's going to come on
pretty soon I think we're gonna do a
boyfriend tag fast and then we're
probably gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A because you guys
are always asking so many questions
about us so I'll probably do a Q&amp;amp;A
dedicated to us both nice Josh fitness
questions you can ask us about our
relationship anything and I think after
the boyfriend tag he'll probably loosen
up a little bit so yes we are planning
to do one I just have to kind of push
him a little bit his Instagram name is
Jay Yanni go and follow him and pester
him and tell him that Laila sent you and
that we have to do the boyfriend tag
soon and I'm sure he will do it Liana
asks I can't pronounce your last name
honey I'm so sorry I'll put it down here
though what is your favorite lip color
my favorite lip color has to be if I
have to pick one would have to be honey
law from Mac just because it always
tends to be the color I always end up
going back to honey love is an amazing
mood it suits my skin tone beautifully
it has a little bit
pink undertone but it's still nude it's
matte which is my favorite and it goes
with so many lip liners I love it
Marisa asks some of your high school
experience in one word I didn't have the
best high school experience so I would
just have to say awkward like I think
awkward is a good way to describe it and
it wasn't like the worst experience of
my life and the beginning of secondary
school we call it secondary school here
and then beginning a secondary school I
was very not how I am now
I was very tomboy you wouldn't have even
recognized me and then as I started to
get older and older I started to become
a little bit more how I am now but it
was still awkward and I still never
really found myself in school I think I
was a late bloomer just didn't have the
best high school experience in my
opinion just gonna say awkward is the
one word to explain it cuz it wasn't
terrible but I didn't really like enjoy
school that much so I'd have to say
awkward is the word though if does nails
asks did you go to university if so what
did you study I did not go to university
I only did a college course for two
years so I done beauty for one year and
then I done a makeup course and then as
soon as I left I got my job at mug and
then I was there for almost two years I
would still be in uni now if I was still
in university or college I did go to
university though it probably would have
been for something completely different
probably something science related like
a zoology or something chemistry related
anything to do with animals or chemistry
I loved so completely different to I'm
doing now okay so Alexandra asked a few
questions and I do like a lot of her
questions I'm going to answer two or
three of Alexandra's questions she asks
what are you most grateful for I think
I'm the most grateful for my boyfriend
because we are like best friends and
I've been so blessed to have found
someone that just gets me so much he has
seen so much of the bad things that have
happened to me in my life and the bad
times and he's just stuck through me
we both stuck through each other and I
just feel like we're on such a good road
to an amazing relationship and
friendship Alexandra also asked what is
the thing you'd most like to change
about the world I would just like to
stop this world from getting so corrupt
that it is turn in
- I personally just cannot believe the
world is becoming what it has become
many things I would like to change but
just that everyone would just have more
kindness in their heart the glamour doll
asks what is some advice you can give to
an upcoming youtuber my number one thing
I would say to you is just don't give up
it's so easy to look at what you're
doing and to feel like you're not as
good as everyone else that you're
watching and to just feel that you know
you're not getting as much results as
you want it and just to feel that your
YouTube channel isn't progressing as
much as you want it is so easy to give
up and to put this effort in honestly
when you feel like it's not going well
don't put less effort in put more effort
in that's how you see results if YouTube
is something that you could honestly see
yourself loving more than any other job
you feel like it won't feel like a job
to you it's honestly a hard thing it's a
hard commitment and because I popped
three videos a week it's very hard it's
a huge commitment I have lots of people
I have to keep happy there's a lot to go
with it but if it's something that you
love then don't give up and that goes
for anything any dream that you may have
in life I would just say to you guys to
just not give up to just keep pushing on
and to just push as hard as you can and
you will achieve it you just need to be
positive optimistic and just love what
you do and love every moment of the
climb to the top and you will get there
I promise nonfiction B asks a very
amazing question and I love you for
asking this she asks I know your game of
Thrones geek like me have you heard of
the R + L equals J theory and if so what
do you think about so who do you think
is really as or high there's some
theories about being Daenerys John
Tyrion and even Sir Jorah I personally
do believe in the r plus l equals j
theory and you believe that Jon Snow has
a very important lineage and that he
comes from a bigger family the Targaryen
family I don't know what exactly
happened all I know is that something
happened in the Tower of joy I was just
reading the book recently and there was
so much emphasis on Leona dying in the
Tower of joy and I honestly believe that
he is Liana's son I honestly do believe
that because I just felt like Ned
two honorable and that for him to not
speak of it even his wife who he fell in
love with I feel like the promise to his
sister it's bigger than a promise to his
wife so I just felt that it's gonna be
something there and I personally think
Jon Snow is as or hi he's dead but he's
coming back I swear I honestly think
that John is azor Ahai Melisandre has
just got to Castle black
just before Jon Snow died and I just
feel that she's realized that Stannis
Baratheon was not as or aha I believers
are quote in the book at some point I
haven't read it yet I think it's in the
last book and it says something like she
was looking into the fire to see a Zora
hi and all she could see was snow John
freaking snow definitely Jon Snow I
honestly believe that I honestly looked
at so many theories I just who told
myself I need to calm down
and she also just asked if you had
dragons like Daenerys what would you
name them make their names now I don't
think I'd want to change them I think
I'd be awful at naming them I probably
name them something like Simba Mufasa
and scar Shaunie Scarlett says could you
do an in-depth video on how you got the
job at Merck of the interview processes
and why you decided to leave there
aren't a lot of UK Mac videos on YouTube
I will definitely do that video if you
guys like to see it
I left Mac well over six months ago and
it was probably the best decision I ever
made
I've never been happier it was great
working there and gaining some
experience but for me it just wasn't for
me I'm a lot happier with what I'm doing
now working for me
and just doing myself and just leaving
my own boss I love it um but I will
definitely talk about the experience and
how I got the job I don't know if the
interview process has changed no but I
will tell you guys all about my
interview process how it was for me and
yeah I'll tell you guys everything okay
so miss Byfield asked a ton of questions
on a popular question just here or where
did you learn to do makeup I was
personally self-taught a dunny course as
well just to get a qualification but for
me I felt like I learnt the most from
YouTube out everywhere and just
practicing and practicing and practicing
and if she also asked within this as
well what do you what did your boyfriend
think about you making a youtube channel
he is completely supportive of this he
love's why do he's my number one
Supporter Fatima underscore D asks how
old are you I am 20 I turned 20 a few
weeks ago and yes my 20s now not teen
anymore
Kylie underscore 0 3 1 5 asks when will
you start vlogging I really want to
start vlogging ASAP I just feel like I
don't want my vlogs to ever be boring
when I start to go on vacation and on
holiday I will definitely be vlogging
stuff like that but I don't know I mean
what kind of looks do you guys want to
see with me do you want to see following
me around vlogs do you wanna see a
day-in-the-life flogs do you only want
to see vlogs when I'm doing something
interesting I just don't know how I feel
about vlogs being like hey guys so I'm
just at a restaurant and we're just
gonna eat now like I don't know how you
feel about me doing that I just don't
bore you guys so it's really whatever
you guys will want to see so I will
start I've got the camera for it
I will start whenever you guys want to
see it so just let me know if you guys
want to see vlogs and what kind of vlogs
you would like to see and I will
definitely start ASAP really of my
Sansan asks where in London are you from
and would you ever do a meet-up lots of
you guys are actually asking if I would
ever do a meet-up yes 100% I would do
Meetup I'd probably be nervous as heck
but I would definitely do a meet-up I'd
love to meet you guys it's amazing to
put faces to the people that I talk to
you every single day I would absolutely
love to do me up I just didn't feel like
anyone would want to meet me Armani 101
asks what is your favorite everyday
transitional eyeshadow color or brand if
I have to pick one because I don't think
I have one if I had to pick one it would
probably have to be Matt uninterrupted
just because it's the perfect shade it's
in a single so it's really easy to take
with you it's amazing it's a really nice
yellow toned Brown it looks really warm
in the crease and it can kind of just
transform any eye look makeup by Sabrina
asks will you do a makeup collection or
vanity tour soon I've already done one
and pretty much is the same apart from
the fact that I have a lot more makeup
now I am hoping to move my beauty room
my setup will hopefully be changing
within the next 6 months we're doing up
our house at the moment so things are
changing and there's a spare room that's
a little bit smaller and I am just so
proud
in this room it doesn't look like it but
I have my bed my TV my vanity everything
is in this one room and it just drives
me insane because it gets messy so quick
really my setup and my vanity will be
changing soon so when it does I will do
another one but for the moment I do
already have one I will link it in the
description box because it's pretty much
the same the only difference is now
obviously I have accumulated more makeup
that's doing difference you know you
like all animals but if you had to only
pick one to live with what would it be I
think it would have to be the captain
Lee like all cats
I think big cats and obviously the small
cats I love my cat too they are my love
like I love tigers lions leopards I
honestly feel like cats have always had
a special place in my heart I love my
dog though please don't get me wrong
like I don't you guys I think I'm
favoring my pets I like my children I
can't favor them but the cat family in
general has to be my favorite so I just
have to say the whole feline family
could all live in my house and I have a
big house of cats like a crazy cat lady
Ikki Rhea Kiki here Rhea I think that's
what it says my eyes are like really bad
like Kiki Kiki really asks what camera
do you use and the lighting you should
do a video on how you film and the
filming spot I will definitely do that
for you if you guys would like to see it
use a canon 600d camera to film and I
also use a 15 millimeter lens on that
and that just kind of blurs my
background a little bit more the
background is just a net the lighting so
it's like a big light like that and it
just saw next down with lights and
because it blows the background a me
through the cool cool I use a ring light
and there's also a window right in front
of me and that's both of those
Lighting's
and honestly I'm not that happy with it
like I honestly want to change it soon
I'll probably always keep these lights
in the background but I just want to
change something there's something I'm
not happy with I think I'm just going to
keep it the same until I move into the
beauty room that I want to change up so
we shall see when we move in there what
we're gonna do I'm not sure I'm gonna do
yet boobie 1 2 3 asks a few questions
but I'm going to answer the first one
what age would you like to get married
like I said I don't plan things too much
but I would love to be married at the
age of 24 25 I think
it's perfect I'm 20 now so that still
gives me a good three years to get my
career going and to get my life going
and also my partner's life to get going
I think it's on account of when both of
us already and I will never want him to
do it if he's not ready to so when we're
both ready that is when we will get
married
Tania asks what is your favorite song at
the moment and I'm gonna play that for
you that is my favorite song it's tenor
you see by Ed Sheeran like I said it's
not new at all but it's the best song
ever it's beautiful I love meaningful
songs they just just pull on my own
strings Oh Stassi on YouTube asks will
make a mistake you used to make in the
past now that you are super embarrassed
about now probably my eyebrows I am very
happy with the shape of my eyebrows now
my eyebrows are just too harsh for my
face yes my eyebrows I'm really I'm
embarrassed about how my eyebrows used
to look sure Arslan asks are you from
and what is your boyfriend's ethnicity I
already I've said mine I am turkish
cypriot my boyfriend is half turkish
cypriot and he is half Greek Cypriot
he's basically half Turkish and half
Greek he is the same as me he was born
here he's lived here his whole life and
yeah that's Josh basically faith asks
love this look so much you're gorgeous
thank you what is your biggest pet peeve
with makeup or just anything in general
I think my biggest pet peeve would
probably not be a makeup thing because
makeup stuff doesn't really bother me um
but I think it would be mean people like
just people that I genuinely mean and
they just say horrible things to heart
people and they're just judgmental and
just like I just don't think it's
necessary like some people just go out
of their way to ruin someone's day and
it's when people use the words like ugly
really gets to me because I gleaned
Cooling someone ugly has deeper ways of
hugging
one then you can imagine it's like
knives the white ugly this I'm going to
end it on a really nice note and go for
a nice deep question Amina Rizvi says
love the video nothing new there
love you question for your upcoming
video would be what are the hardest
lessons you have learned in your life so
far love that question girl that was a
really beautiful question to ask the
hardest life lesson I think I've ever
had to face and you know we're always
still going through things is about
learning to love myself for Who I am to
stop comparing myself to other people to
stop putting myself down and to just
love Who I am to love everything about
myself is worrying about things like is
my youtube channel good enough like I
don't you know I compare myself to other
youtubers where their quality is so much
better and so much prettier and you know
I'm comparing myself to people
constantly and I just stopped one day
and I just said to myself hating myself
is not gonna push me to get to where I
want to be loving myself is going to get
me further and I just feel like we all
reach a point in our lives where we just
have to stop hating ourselves and to
just love who we are and love the person
that God made us into because God has
given us these individual talents
individual personality traits that
nobody else has there is not another
view in this whole entire world people
might look similar to you people might
act a little bit similarly to you but
there is no one with the exact same
personality no one with the same
fingerprint you are completely unique
the moment you realize how significant
you are is the day you realize that you
have to love yourself so you feel like
trusting God's judgement and just loving
the person that he created me to be
changed my life thank you so much
