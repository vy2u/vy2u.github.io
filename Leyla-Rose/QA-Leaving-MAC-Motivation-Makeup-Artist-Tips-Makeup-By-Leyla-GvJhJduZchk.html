today I'm going to be doing with you a
Q&amp;amp;A video so I asked you guys on
Instagram and also on YouTube what you
would like to ask me and I'm going to
answer as many as I can throughout the
video I'm just gonna jump straight into
it because I want to get as many
questions fit in as possible how did you
become a successful makeup artist to be
honest I'm still so young and I don't
cause myself as being successful yet
I'm just taking every day as it comes
and just doing what I love I don't want
to do something that I don't enjoy I
feel like life is too short to do a job
that you don't enjoy so what I'm doing
at the moment I am completely happy with
I think just trying to stay motivated
and just move it in yourself being
around people that make you feel good
about yourself is the way to just
motivate yourself to become better if
there was an aspect of makeup but I
wasn't really that good I would make
sure that I would push myself to the
best of my ability to make myself better
in that aspect and practice is just
everything I just made sure that
whatever I did I was practicing daily
and just bettering yourself and I think
that's the way that you can become more
successful is just taking hours and
hours to practice and what you do are
you currently in school if so what are
you studying no I am NOT in school I've
been up education for over two years now
I've been a professional makeup artist
for two years now so as soon as I
finished my education and makeup I went
straight out and got a job at Mac and
that's just how I started getting myself
out there as a professional makeup
artist
if you wanna make up eyes what would be
your dream career and why I love this
question I have a absolute passion for
animals and science so it probably would
have been something to do with biology
or animals I really wanted to be a vet
or a marine biologist I also loved
chemistry at school as well so anything
science related I really wanted to
become that so if I wasn't doing this
and I could pick anything it would be
some form of taking care of animals and
studying animals because I'm such a huge
animal lover what makeup school did you
attend so I didn't go to a special
makeup school I just finished school at
the age of 16 and then I went to a
college I just went to a normal college
that just does normal courses that you
can
for anything so I first did one year in
beauty and then I did a year after that
in makeup what inspires you life and
makeup related also are you going to buy
mattes this year I would love to see you
there to be honest with makeup and
generally in life I just feel like you
mainly have to inspire yourself I feel
like the main aspect of feeling inspired
is looking at your work
seeing how you've grown in the past
month or two months and just feeling
proud of yourself and feeling inspired
of the person that you become you need
to inspire yourself to be able to reach
success in my opinion there are
obviously so many other aspects to my
life that inspire me I've got amazing
people around me I've got so many loved
ones that support why do each and every
day and that obviously inspires me and
then another huge part of it is you guys
it sounds so cliche but it's so true
when I get to hear that I'm helping you
guys even the tiniest little amount that
to me inspires me to continue there's
times where I felt so crap about myself
and I feel like you know I should just
quit YouTube sometimes I just look at
the comments that you guys leave me and
it just picks me up and it just makes me
want to carry on because ultimately you
guys are the reason that I'm doing this
this is something that I love to do I
love helping people who I want to be
able to do is help you guys so you guys
inspire me and yes I am going to be
going to Imus this year I haven't booked
my tickets yet I'm hoping to go on these
Saturday and possibly the Sunday
so I will definitely let you guys know
when I have with my tickets and then
hopefully I will see some of you guys
that what is your favorite mascara and
what inspires you to become a makeup
eyes but my favorite mascara that I have
found it the Mac extended play mascara
you guys have seen me use in a lot of my
videos I love using it because at the
bottom it doesn't transfer unto your
concealer which I used to suffer from so
much no matter how much I used to set my
concealer it would just rub and just
transfer and it would just every single
mascara ever use it would do that
whereas the extended play just stays on
the lashes it doesn't transfer it
doesn't crumble and also it's not
waterproof and my lashes and eyes are
quite sensitive so I feel like it's
really easy to remove still it's just an
all-around good mascara and if you were
wondering what kind of effects
the lashes it helps to define the lashes
and separating all the lashes apart and
what inspired me to become a makeup
artist to be honest I didn't know I
wanted to become a makeup eyes when I
had finished school when I had done that
my GCSE exams I wasn't sure what I
wanted to do and I just went ahead and
done a beauty course because I guess I
was taking a little bit of a gap I
wasn't really sure what I was doing to
be honest I didn't really enjoy the view
course itself but when I had done the
tiniest little portion of makeup I
realized that I had a little flair for
it so I just kept going at it I watched
a lot of YouTube videos kept practicing
and then I went and done the course
afterwards and it just kind of happened
nothing really inspired me to become one
I didn't ever really look at someone and
think oh I want to be just like you it
kind of just fell into place and I feel
like sometimes if you're not sure what
to do in your life you should just be
still and just see where life takes you
and this is the road that I was taken to
and I'm just so happy
were you ever a chola and this comment
made me laugh you guys are referring to
the very thin eyebrows big fat winged
liner and the very very dark foundation
that stopped there yes of course I think
everyone has that face if you skip that
phase that's completely unfair because
we all need to go through that phase
before we get badness what is your
favorite makeup brand this is such an
unfair question I cannot pick one brand
I know I'm just gonna cheat I cannot
pick a favorite makeup brand that's
impossible
to be honest I've got so many favorites
for so many different things I don't
know where to begin that is just a
question that I can't onto that one I
love makeup too much what do you do for
fun you should do some vlogs giving your
subscribers a glimpse into your life and
to be honest I don't have a very
interesting life the moment I'm working
very hard just getting into my career I
just like to you it spend a lot of time
with my boyfriend we just like to go out
and do things it's hard to explain that
but if you guys would like to see vlogs
or if I'm doing anything exciting I was
thinking of vlogging and I'm us this
year so I'll definitely do that but if
there are any MOS that you guys would
like to see
please do let me know because I would
love to blog for you it's just I wasn't
sure if that would be something that you
guys would like to see obviously I am
here to create content that you guys
enjoy so I'm only gonna create vlogs and
if it's something that you guys would
like to see so if there are any video
requests or vlogs or tag videos or
personal videos please do let me know
because I would love for you guys to get
to know me a little bit better I feel
like doing drugs and other personal
videos could kind of break that wall and
to me just being someone you guys just
watch all the time and it could be you
guys actually getting to know me so
definitely let me know because I would
love to be on you and your boyfriend
didn't get married at the moment I'm
only 19 years old as he is as well with
both 19 we met when we were 14 so we've
been together for four and a half years
in total but we are still very young
that marriage is definitely something we
both want to do but not yet we're just
taking it slow because we don't want to
rush into anything and add any
additional pressure into the
relationship now that we've turned into
adults we are really enjoying our I
don't live together but we don't want to
rush into it
oh he's cooling now though yeah I'm
actually recording my Q&amp;amp;A now I'm just
so via like okay so yeah marriage is
definitely something that we both want
to do but we are still very young so
we're just taking things slow we
obviously want to do things the right
way
so we just want to take everything slow
and whenever it feels right on we're
both financially ready and just ready in
every way and that is when we will get
married and no rush
what we like with makeup in your early
teens so in my early teens I was
completely normal I used to wear like
the tiniest little bit of foundation and
it's like a little winged liner and a
bit of mascara and that was it
to school obviously I wouldn't wear a
lot makeup maybe like the Chinese Little
Neck because I always loved winged liner
winged liner with boys that love
I was completely normal or I had never
heard of filling in my eyebrows I was
completely oblivious to all that kind of
stuff so yeah I was kind of playing
actually I didn't really properly stop
at makeup on until I was like 15 what
advice would you give to any makeup
lovers who are just starting out any
tips obviously just keep practicing
practicing practicing practice makes
perfect that is no joke especially it
was something that is so creative and
something that is quite detailed you
want to make sure that you get
everything right so just practicing on
yourself practicing on your friends and
family depending on if you just want to
be good at makeup or you want to put on
a makeup artist practice is everything
don't worry about meeting to get loads
of expensive makeup because there's so
much cheap makeup out there that is so
amazing I have half of my makeup
collection is not high-end makeup it is
drugstore makeup or makeup that I bought
online that's just really affordable
there's no need for all that pressure
where you feel like you need to be
getting all these expensive Mac products
NARS products yep they're lovely to have
if you're just dying out don't stress
because there's so many products that
you guys could buy that are just as good
as the high-end makeup what is your
ethnicity I explained this in my 20
facts about me but I am turkish cypriots
I am from the country Cyprus with the
Turkish origins all the Turkish people
that went to Cyprus and that place where
I am from although I am British I was
born and raised in London and my mum was
born here only my dad was born in Cyprus
so I am I'm basically British my origin
is Texan player what's your favorite
part about being a makeup eyes but also
what products would you recommend for
oily skin regardless of the reason that
they'd be hiring me usually the outcome
is a me
and I feel so good at the end where they
are just in awe of how they look making
someone feel like a better version of
themselves is the reward in itself
makeup is just an amazing thing it may
not seem like a big thing to some people
some people may believe that makeup is a
nuisance and it's unnatural but in my
opinion I feel like it's a person's
chance of feeling different it just can
completely change how you feel and I
think that's an amazing thing just being
able to see the transformation in people
is so rewarding and it's my favorite
part
a hundred percent also my favorite
product for oily skin I don't know if
that means like a foundation or a
concealer but my favorite thing for
preventing oil to come out the skin this
emac face protect primer I have run out
of mine so I don't have a bottle to show
you but it's the face protect xpr-50 and
it is so good at preventing oil from
coming at the skin it completely
mattifies the skin and I was using it
constantly on holiday I would just wear
it all over and it would just make my
skin completely matte and it would take
away that kind of oil slick kind of look
but it still gives you that kind of go
so that's 100% my favorite put up all
your skin what hair products do you use
for your natural hair so obviously this
is natural hair now this is a couple of
days watch them is a little bit frizzy
now the curls kind of go down a little
bit but I do have a video now on how I
get my curly hair if you guys would like
me to do a haircare routine so the
products that used to wash it the oils I
put in my hair how I've sort of got it
to grow I will do a haircare video if
you guys want to see one and also how I
straighten my hair as well because
obviously my hair is curly you guys
might want to see how it string in it so
let me know if you guys want to see that
it's better than me explaining it in
this video but I will link my hair video
down below so definitely check that out
as well
I love your videos always enjoy seeing
them on my feet why did you decide to
leave Mac are you pursuing YouTube
full-time / freelancing so you guys have
been asking for this a lot because you
guys noticed that I am not working for
Mac anymore but was going to do a video
dedicated to it I'll just tell you a
little bit about it now the reason why I
decided to leave
MAC Cosmetics is because I had worked
there for a year and a half and I felt
like I started to not enjoy it anymore
plus I started to have some personal
issues at home as well so I just felt
like everything was getting too much for
me and it just felt like the right idea
to leave I left on completely good times
at the moment YouTube is not a job for
me YouTube is at the moment just hobby
because obviously I am not at that stage
where I am getting paid enough for it to
be a job I love doing it and I am not
expecting this to turn into anything
obviously I would love for this to
become a full-time thing for me
obviously I would love for YouTube to
turn into a full-time job because it is
an amazing part of my life I love doing
it is a huge passion of mine and it's
just the thing that I enjoy doing the
most in my life at the moment I've been
doing some private work just focusing on
on me for a bit and I may be getting a
job soon I'm not sure but I definitely
will update you guys if anything does
change but at the moment yeah I'm just
doing me for a little while so guys that
at the end of this video I didn't want
it to be a really really long video I'm
sorry if I didn't get a chance to answer
your questions I tried to answer the
ones that were being asked the most lot
of them were the ones I felt like we're
being asked quite frequently I'm sorry I
answered them first and then I answered
a couple of other ones so if I didn't
get to answer your question I am really
sorry I will definitely try and do
another Q&amp;amp;A you guys would like to see
another Q&amp;amp;A please do let me know
because I would love to do one I love
getting to talk to you guys more
