channel today I'm gonna be doing a Q&amp;amp;A
which by I'm so excited for I think the
last cuing I done was in July I think I
think it was just after my birthday
excited I really wanted to do a Q&amp;amp;A
because I know I just feel like it's
been a really long time and since my
last one I have gained lots of new
friends on my youtube channel
people like lots of you may have
questions that you may want to ask me so
I decided to ask on my Instagram though
if you guys don't already follow me on
snapchat don't forget to follow me on
there and also on all social media too
so you don't miss the next Q&amp;amp;A actually
New Year's Eve or right now and I've
decided to stay in with a family like
the little granny
I am so this is my attire for tonight
but of course my makeup is gonna be on
point always by the way I always say
this because I usually end up saying
some names wrong I am gonna put your
names just down here and the question
you ask but if I do pronounce your name
wrong I sincerely apologize I'm just not
very good at pronouncing things polina
asks if you could live anywhere in the
world where would it be
no I feel about this a lot and I would
probably say the u.s. sometime if I'd
actually want to set up shop and like
stay somewhere unless it was the UK or
the US I've always wanted to live in the
mountains and I know that sounds really
weird like a cabin and have like a
little dog and a little lake near me I
don't know maybe my retirement I could
live somewhere like that I'd love to
move to the US but I'm not really sure
where in the US I'd like to move I
probably want to travel around the US as
much as possible before I decided I'm
gonna spell this one out because I don't
know if I can pronounce it but
underscore CA X M asks what are your
goals for 2016 I love this question I am
one of those people that really like to
just set goals and try and hit them like
last year at the beginning of last year
I basically set my goals I left my job
and I wanted you to be my full-time job
and I definitely achieved it I
definitely feel like setting your goals
in the beginning of the year is really
important and just setting your goals in
general throughout the year is really
important as well my goals for 2016
is definitely to grow my YouTube channel
even more to do more on my second
channel and just to try and just enjoy
what I'm doing at the moment
as much as I possibly can because I am
loving what YouTube is taking me I
absolutely love everything about it and
I just feel like I've grown so much in
the last year so I really can't wait to
just grow more in 2016
also aside from YouTube other goals that
I do have is to travel more with Joshua
asks what are your new year's
resolutions now I know that's kind of
too similar to the goals for 2016 but
one of my resolutions is to stop putting
so much pressure on myself now if you
don't follow me on snapchat or you
didn't watch any of my blog you probably
don't know me much personally it can be
just one of those people that get
stressed out very easily too many
burdens get put on my shoulders I
personally just cannot take it I have
suffered from anxiety and stuff like
that in the past so definitely a
perfectionist so when it comes to my
YouTube I always put so much pressure on
myself and not a healthy amount of
pressure and to get exactly three videos
up a week and to just really put so much
pressure on me for everything to be
perfect 2016 I don't want it to be like
that because it definitely takes away
the fun and the enjoyment out of YouTube
and that is not what I want I love this
so much and I don't drain my own fun out
of this job really hope I'm gonna
pronounce this right sanaya asks will
you plan to visit New York any time soon
yes I really want to go to New York next
and up my next trip that is to the US
will most likely be to New York because
I've never been to New York before and I
would just love to go so 100% really
want to go soon I will update you guys
and let you know if I can come for a
convention or something that would be
really cool maybe I can come to
beautycon New York or something they'll
be amazing Ayesha asks would you rather
stay in with Josh or have a date night
it's the AL of both that going out with
josh is amazing and we love doing it but
we are both really like home orientated
to enjoy each other's company no matter
where we are we always have a good time
so I can't really pick I think a bit of
both
nice and equal but we do stay in a lot
more than we do go out well rich ends
that asks how do you deal with
negativity negativity online and
negativity in real life I guess the kind
of
different things but the majority of my
negativity does come from online of
course because YouTube is my job but the
negativity that comes to me online
always impacts me differently depending
on my mood like sometimes I can really
take a and it doesn't affect me and
sometimes if I'm you know feeling down
and the Dobbs and I'm not really feeling
that great and I get hate it can really
affect me and if it's in real life or
online responding to negativity never
really does enough for you having the
strength to just delete block it and
just book it from your life block it
from your mind forget that person even
said anything it's just the best way to
deal with it unfortunately that's not
always the way that I do think sometimes
I can't control myself and I want to
reply because there's nothing wrong with
replying and sticking up for yourself
guess it kind of depends on what it is
but yeah it does depend sometimes
negativity does get quite a lot for me
online but generally just removing it
from your life and not thinking about it
and just yeah removing it is the best
way that I could possibly say to deal
with negativity bullion asks are you
friends with at least one of your
subscribers that you didn't know before
starting your YouTube channel definitely
made lots of online friends even if I've
never actually had a one-to-one
conversation with you as you think of
every one of you as friends to be honest
and when I actually get to chat to you
guys properly yeah it does feel like we
are becoming online friends it feels
yeah that we have a connection Kansa
asks what was the best decision you've
made in your life and how has it
impacted your life that is a really good
question I love that um if I could think
of anything that was a proper decision
the most biggest decision I've ever had
to make it was 100% of leaving my job a
year ago but it didn't turn out to make
me as happy as I thought it would I kind
of just lied to myself and said to
myself that this is truly what I want
when truly deep down in my heart it
wasn't what I wanted and YouTube was
always always at the back of my mind
always I didn't have the time for it I
was working full-time I had no time to
even have a social life so that came to
a time where I honestly thought in my
head if I get given
the time and the energy to put into
YouTube I know that I can turn it into
something and leaving my job was a
really big decision for me I wasn't in a
financially good State for me to leave
my job I was leaving a job for nothing
at the point of where I was on YouTube I
wasn't making any money from it it was
very small I had ten less than ten
thousand subscribers when I left my job
and it's just unbelievable what has
happened in the past year leaving my job
was definitely the best decision I ever
made because I would not be sitting here
talking to you guys as I am right now in
the position I am right now and it's
just crazy because sometimes you have to
take a step of faith sometimes you just
have to put yourself out there and put
yourself in a really hard tough
situation and all you need to do is
believe in yourself and believe that you
can reach where you want to be because I
believed I could do it but I just
couldn't do it at the same time as
working from that underscore Rosie asks
will you and Josh get married anytime
soon
me and Josh of course want to get
married our relationship is totally
stable but we are still very very young
and we aren't of course financially
stable yet when we get married more I
kind of have everything sorted being
able to afford a wedding afford some
ways to live together we really want to
have everything sorted he's still 20
still he's not all of the meze same age
so we're both 20 you just want to have
our lives sorted bust before we get
married 20 is still very young in my
opinion maybe in a couple of years we'll
see I mean it's definitely up to him I
mean he's gotta pop the question I'm
obviously not in charge of that
ex Millie her asks how have you
enjoyment angel relationships
successfully for so many years advice to
new couples that compromise
communication all of those points are
really really important have to
compromise for each other you can't
always have your way a little bit of a
princess I like everything to be my way
and I can be a little bit stubborn to
compromise things because you're not
always gonna see eye to eye and
sometimes you may not be totally happy
with the decision or something that is
going on but sometimes you just have to
come to a compromise communication
there's a problem if there's good things
like there's bad things you need to talk
about it everything our communication is
the biggest thing it's forgiveness in
anything letting things go and just
forgiving each other it's just the
biggest thing if me and Josh didn't let
go some of the things that we have been
through the past we wouldn't be together
right now because you just have to let
things go
you do have to forgive certain things
depending on what they are of course but
you just can't hold a grudge you can't
hold on to things you can't be bringing
things up from the past all the time you
have to forgive and move on in order for
your relationship to grow you know if
you guys want to see a Q&amp;amp;A with Josh
because I think I'd be kind of cool to
see Josh's opinion on these questions as
well I want to do on very soon please
comment down below if you want to see
one F poll worth X I think that's how
you say it like really struggling to
pronounce some of these usernames once I
go three Holy Grail makeup items I'm
assuming your soap &amp;amp; Glory powder is one
yes so burglary powder is of course
number one second would probably be no I
can only think of base product two is
probably the ex1 foundation and then
number three probably three is makeup
geek eyeshadows just in general the
makeup geek eyeshadows are definitely my
favorite Olivia asks if you could give
any advice to teenage girls about
relationship what would it be
so relationship advice to teenage girls
would be don't have one honestly like I
know I met my boyfriend young but one
thing I would definitely give to you is
don't go searching for a relationship as
a teen if it falls into your lap then
just allow it to happen because you
don't obviously want to turn away your
fates or things that are meant to happen
for you can assure us we'll come to you
when you're least expecting if I and
enjoy your childhood as much as you
possibly can because getting into a
relationship
young definitely does mean that then
you're gonna have to grow up a lot
quicker if you want that relationship to
be successful just because things will
be different for you and if anyone has
had a young long-term relationship
before they would probably say the same
thing it is not easy and to make it work
all the way to being an adult you
definitely have to be very persistent
and I feel like
definitely have to grow up very quickly
so whenever someone asks me always that
just hold off as long as you can like I
said it before since your lap that's a
different story but just try and enjoy
being young try and enjoy just being a
singular us dot skirt really when it's a
circuit like that have you ever
considered Botox yes I'm not gonna lie
of course I have likely more like yes
I've thought about it will I get it I
don't know Matt she asks what is your
fitness routine what would you eat in a
regular day and what tips do you have to
be in good shape now something that I
need to tell you guys big confession I
am NOT a healthy person I have just been
I don't know if you'd call it a bless or
a curse depending on what your goals are
I have a very fast metabolism
sometimes if I'm not well if I'm not
eating enough weight we'll just drop off
me like that and I don't like that
because I'm quite petite and small in
general anyway and then also it is a
good thing because that way I can kind
of be who I want and I don't really have
to worry about it I'm gonna start
working out properly again I couldn't
for a little while because I haven't
been very well but I'm determined to not
allow kind of my illness to stop me a
cup by Lela underscore says how long
have you had Babu and storm so boo-boo
my little cutie pie sitting right next
to me but he's sleeping so I don't
bother him he doesn't like the bright
lights and every time I pick him up he
looks really miserable but he's really
not but strong for four years and I
think I had blue for eight years I have
one of those people that could just keep
buying kind of all those losers can you
prank call Josh this is brilliant oh my
goodness shall I do it
or shall I say
hi you're alright yeah where are you
when were you gonna come well I don't
know I think there's gonna be a change
of plans why well because Emma's not

you know I'm not a good liar I don't
like to lie and I definitely feel like
it was hard doing that because I'm just
not very good at lying so yeah I didn't
want to do anything to mean because I
don't know I didn't want to be mean to
him it's New Years Eve
