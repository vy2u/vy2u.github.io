so today I'm going to be showing you
this back to school drugstore tutorial I
am so excited to show you this I know
back-to-school season can be a little
bit of a sad time for some of you but at
least we can look a little bit glam and
this is a little bit more of a realistic
approach to an everyday back to school
makeup look so if you do want to see how
to achieve it then just keep on watching
so the first thing I'm going to be doing
is priming my skin and I'm taking the
one heck of a block primer from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I'm just applying this all
over my skin and this will just help
everything to look nice and smooth and
pushing it downwards just to make sure
that all of my little baby hairs on my
face and a stick downward so it looks
nice and flawless and the foundation I'm
using today is the wake me up foundation
from Rimmel I really like this
foundation for everyday wear because
it's just really nice and light it has a
light to medium coverage and it covers
everything you need to while still
allowing your skin to naturally show
through so I definitely feel like this
is a great option I'm just popping this
in with a slanted kabuki brush and I'm
just buffing this all over it's a very
true to skin tone like it's just a
really nice match to my natural skin
tone I feel like it looks really nice
and glowy you'll see after I kind of do
like a little bit of any side angles you
can see how natural and glowy this
foundation looks so I think this will be
perfect for back-to-school because it
doesn't look too cakey and as you can
see it gives me a really nice healthy
glow like skin and for my under eyes I'm
gonna go for something quite bright
because for me I have a lack of sleep so
I would sleep it off so I need something
to really brighten my under eyes and
first of all just applying a little bit
of the Maybelline fit me and then taking
a little bit of the NYX HD concealer in
quite a light shade and just applying it
in between the little stripes just to
brighten the shade a little bit I really
like a nice bright under eye so that's
why I like to go for something that's a
little bit more on the lighter side I'm
just blending that in with a Beauty
Blender just because I really like to
use a Beauty Blender for my under eyes a
sponge personally takes away all of the
excess product and I tend to suffer with
them little aligned you get under your
eyes and I just personally feel like a
wet sponge really prevent this for my
face powder I'm using the Rimmel stay
matte powder this is a oldie but a
goodie I really love this powder it's so
nice and light it doesn't feel heavy on
the skin
whatsoever and I just feel like this
will be perfect for everyday wear
because it doesn't look cakey it doesn't
take your face in almost a rail of
powder it just looks really natural but
keeps things nice and matte at the same
time so I'm just applying that all over
and moving straight into bronzer the
bronze I'm using is the bronze booster
from Physicians Formula now I know this
can be a little bit tricky to find in
the UK so I will leave and alternative
down below in the description box I
absolutely love this bronzer it's
relatively matte but it has a teeny bit
of a shimmer so it looks nice and
radiant which I feel like is perfect for
back-to-school season so I'm just
applying it on to the outer perimeter of
my skin underneath my cheekbones under
my jawline just to give myself a nice
amount of bronze and I'm also going to
be applying a blush what me a blush I
know right I'm just applying it because
I just feel like it will give me a
little bit of color which I feel like we
all need when we go back to school I
just feel like it will make us look nice
and glowy
just give us a tad of color and then I'm
gonna be applying at some highlight this
is actually an eyeshadow from ELF and
this is in the color enchanted and this
kind of speaks for itself
I mean take a look at this it's gorgeous
and I feel like it doesn't matter what
place you're in school home a highlight
always needs to be on point so I just
definitely decided that the highlight
needs to be you know shining needs to be
blinding so now that our skin is all
done I decided to keep the eyes a very
simple and taking this one eye shadow
color from this palette from makeup
revolution and I'm just playing it all
over the lid and also applying it into
the crease as well this particular color
does have quite a bit of shimmer so you
could use a bronzer you could use a
bronzer highlight if you don't have an
eye shadow and I'm just using a little
bit of this lighter shade again you
could use a highlight for this and just
applying it onto the brow bone and also
onto the inner corner as well extremely
simple because let's face it who has
time to do like a lot of stuff on their
eyes when it comes to everyday
back-to-school stuff and of course
applying a coat of mascara to my top
lashes only I'm using L'Oreal Paris
telescopic mascara because it's my
favorite when it comes to doing it on my
natural lashes it makes my lashes look
so much longer to what they actually are
because my lashes are actually really
short and I'm just applying two coats on
my top lashes only because my bottom
lashes are way too long and it makes it
look on balance so I'm personally
skipping at the bottom lash line
and finally for the lips I'm going to be
going across the outer edges with this
brown pencil from NYX and I'm just going
across all of the outer part just to
create a nice fuller lip line and then
going on the inside with this matte lip
cream from Milani now Milani isn't
actually available in actual drugstores
in the UK but it's very easily bought so
