today's makeup tutorial is going to be
on this rose gold with a pop of purple
on the eyes and a full face
and just levitate
so to get started as always I'm going to
be priming my eyes with my soft ochre
paper this is just going to prep my eyes
and prepare it for any eyeshadow we're
going to be applying then I'm taking a
makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow and
I'm going to be applying this as our
first transition color this is just
gonna make all of the other colors blend
really seamlessly and it's just gonna
give it a really nice base for
everything to blend on then I'm gonna be
taking frappe which is another makeup
geek eyeshadow and I'm gonna start to
apply this in deeper part of my crease
to start to deepen it a little bit and I
want to kind of create a nice smoky
effect without it being too dark so I'm
just taking another blending brush and
just going side to side and really
focusing that color then I'm taking
cocoa bear which is also by makeup geek
on another blending brush and just
applying that into the crease again
going in side to side motions and just
making sure that blends in very well
with the other colors then I'm taking
this other makeup geek eyeshadow which
is like a rose gold shade and I'm gonna
be applying this as our lid color today
with a big shader brush from Sigma and
just want to create a nice seamless lid
that's completely full of color
then I'm taking maca also by makeup geek
and I'm gonna be applying this with a
pencil brush into my outer corner and
this is gonna give us that really nice
smoky effect I'm just gonna be applying
it with the pencil brush and then I'm
gonna be blending it out with the brush
that we used to apply a Coco bear shade
and I'm just gonna make sure to blend
this as well as I can that way when you
get this all blended out it's gonna look
really seamless very smokey and just
nice and buffed out and then you can go
back into that mocha shade if you feel
like you need to darken it a little bit
more then I'm just cleaning up these
sides of my eye just to make it all look
really nice and sharp and this is also
gonna be a really nice guideline to do
your winged liner on then I'm taking
this super liner from L'Oreal and this
is gonna be the liner I used to so a
guide where I want to give my liner this
is a really good one because it's really
easy to create shape it's not the
darkest liner but it is really good to
create the kind of Islander shape that
you want so I'm just using this to
sculpt out the shape by one I wanted to
go for quite a long wing today so I'm
kind of just pulling out the eyeliner to
the outer part of my brow and just
pulling it upwards and then I just like
to connect the two lines together and
just gradually use lots of stroking
motions to create the thickness of the
wing that I want
then when I'm happy with the shape I
like to go in with another liquid
eyeliner and this will just kind of make
it look as black as possible this is the
bomb Schwing liner and this is such a
super black liner it's amazing so I just
want to go over everything and make sure
it's really nice and black then I'm
taking my eye allure won 2-6 lashes and
just applying them onto my lash line
this is such a gorgeous style of lash
and it's just really nice and full but
it's not too obvious at the same time
I'm just applying that with some eyelash
glue and then applying some mascara to
my natural lashes to make them blend for
my waterline I'm taking a Mac pair glide
pencil and this one is in designer
platform next I'm just gonna be priming
my face and applying some foundation and
use the Mac natural radiance primer and
then I'm taking the l'oreal true match
foundation i'm just gonna be applying
this all over my face with a real
techniques sculpting brush i have been
absolutely and loving this brush
recently to apply my foundation it's
such an amazing brush it just makes
everything look so flawless and i'm just
really enjoying this brush right now
next I'm gonna be taking some of the
tarte maracuja creaseless concealer and
just applying it underneath my eyes this
is in the colored light so it is quite
light and I'm just applying it in a
triangular shape and buffing out with
the same brush I used to apply my
foundation
and then to get into the old little
areas where the bigger brush can't reach
I'm using the tarte concealer brush that
comes with this particular concealer and
it's actually a really good shape I
really like it it's not gonna take place
of my Sigma 3 th to precision brush
though you guys know I love that one and
I'm just gonna make sure to set this
concealer really really well because
I've kind of been playing around with
this concealer and I feel like you
really need to set it really really well
otherwise it will crease even though
it's a creases concealer I don't know
i'm just using the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder and just really pressing
that powder into my skin to make sure
it's nice and set and I'm just really
pushing in that way I know it won't
crease next I'm taking some more of that
designer purple pencil and just applying
it to my bottom lash line
and just making sure to apply a lot of
this and then I'm gonna be taking a
makeup geek eyeshadow this is one of the
foiled eyeshadows this one is masquerade
this is such a gorgeous color and I'm
just gonna be applying it onto my bottom
lash line and seriously smoking this out
like you kind of really want to blend
this out and make it look nice and
smudgy it doesn't need to look really
neat you just want to make sure that
it's nice and blended out and as you can
see in the inner corners I applied a
little bit of eyeliner to create an
inner corner flick but I actually take
that away after so just try and avoid it
it was really annoying me and I didn't
like the way it looks so I actually
ended up taking that away afterwards
I'm just bronzing my face at the moment
with my mineralized skinfinish from Mac
in dark golden and just making sure to
bronze my face but not too much because
I feel like I really wanted this to be
all about the eye look and then I'm just
applying some of my Becca opal
highlights out I'm applying it with a
blush brush and just applying it onto
all the high points of my face
I want to have a really glowy face today
so I kind of went all out with that yep
and as you can see I've taken away the
inner corner of my eyeliner because I
really didn't like it I just felt like
it looked better like this and I'm just
applying my lip pencil this is the Kiko
501 lip pencil absolutely love this
color and Wilmers done of it already and
it's going by some backups because I
just love it and I'm also gonna be
taking the Gerard cosmetics nude
lipstick this is again one of my
favorites and I do have a discount code
