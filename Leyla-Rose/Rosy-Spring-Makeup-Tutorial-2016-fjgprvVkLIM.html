gonna be showing you how to achieve this
rosy spring makeup look this is so
glamorous but really easy to achieve at
the same time to be doing and see how I
achieved this look then just keep on
watching
it's against sight I'm gonna be priming
my skin using these Smashbox primer
water and just applying it all over the
skin and then I'm just taking my ex1
invisi wear foundation and just buffing
that all over my skin has been generally
quite good lately but I did have a
little breakout around my mouth area I
think around your mouth it's normally
hormonal
I'm not sure though that's probably why
and I'm just moving on to eyes and I'm
just gonna be priming them using the
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm
just gonna be buffing that in just to
cancel out all of the eyelids natural
colors next I'm just gonna be taking the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the color petal
pusher and I'm just gonna be blending
that into the crease using a blending
brush and I'm just building up this
color gradually I really want this eye
look to be nice and simple I want it to
be pink toned but I do want it to be all
about the lashes so I'm just applying
that into the crease and just building
off this color and then I'm gonna be
making sure to blend out the edges just
to make sure that it's nice and
transitioned into my skin and then
taking vintage eyeshadow from makeup
geek also I'm just gonna be applying
that to the outer corner only just to
give it a little bit of definition and
yeah just to deepen the area a little
bit and like I said I wanted to keep the
eyes fairly simple so these are the only
two crease colors I'm gonna be using and
again just go back into your previous
brush to make sure it's nice and blended
next taking makeup geek granted and
foiled eyeshadow I'm just taking that
and applying it all over the inner third
of my lid well actually like the inner
half of my lid and I just wanna make
sure this is nice and pigmented this is
such a pretty like rose gold color but
it does have a little bit of peach enos
to it as well which is perfect and then
I'm also taking this Topshop eyeshadow
as well this is a little bit more of a
glittery eyeshadow so I patted this on
top to give it a nice amount of sparkle
for lashes I'm gonna be taking the Koko
Queen B lashes these are definitely one
of my favorite style of lashes they are
so long and so wispy and it just
transforms a look so this is definitely
a look that is all about the lashes so I
definitely recommend going for some
stupid wispy lashes I'm also just
applying some of the
a contour stick onto the contours of my
face and just blending it out nice and
smoothly just to give myself a little
bit more warmth I haven't applied my
concealer yet but this is just to give
my skin a little bit more color because
I am quite fair right now and then I'm
just gonna be filling in my brows using
a new brow pencil for me this is the NYX
micro brow pencil and this is in the
color chocolate I believe and I'm just
using this to draw some hairs throughout
my brows to make my brows look nice and
full without making them look too
defined cuz I wanted to go for quite in
that true brow look I definitely noticed
that this color was quite warm for me so
I don't know if I could use this to
really define my eyebrows because it was
quite a warm brown color I also went
through my brows with a little bit of
clear brow gel as well next I'm just
gonna be applying some concealer
underneath my eyes and also on the
area's I was like to bring forward I'm
also just applying it underneath my
cheekbone to make my cheekbones look
more defined and I'm just blending that
in using a real techniques sculpting
brush and my skin was a really feeling
my skin today because you know when your
skin just isn't being itself that was
today for me my skin was just having a
bit of a nightmare but it happens it
happens to everyone
and I was adjusting my skin using my
soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
because it's my favourite and I'm just
using that to set all the areas we
applied the concealer and just generally
around the face as well for bronzer I
decided to use some of my Bobbi Brown
bronzer in golden light and just dust it
along the outer perimeter of my skin
using a big fluffy brush just to give
myself an all-around bronze I didn't
want to go for anything too strongly
contoured today but I did decide to go
for a nice amount of blush to make this
look look nice and spring-like
you don't mean spring you gotta have a
nice rosy cheek and I just applied some
highlights onto the tops of my
cheekbones as well just to make this
look look nice and glowy and I went for
more of a pink toned highlights are
rather than a gold which I usually go
for just apply that on the tops of my
cheekbones and also on to the high
points of my brow or forehead area just
to give me a nice glow to finish off the
eyes I'm just applying some more of that
foiled eyeshadow onto the bottom lash
line using a pencil brush just to give
it a little bit more of that sparkly
finish
and then to finish off the look I am
using some mascara just to coat my
bottom lashes I forgot to apply any
eyeliner into the waterline like a nude
so if you want to make your eyes look
nice and large you can use a white or a
nude eyeliner and then finally for lips
I'm just lining my lips with stone at
lip pencil from Mac just to give my lips
some definition this really makes my
lips look nice and full and makes it
easier to over line them so I'm just
over lining my lips a little bit just to
give it a little bit more of that
fullness and then I'm just filling in my
lips a little bit with this as well just
to give it a little bit more of that
ombre effect and then I'm using the NYX
soft matte lip cream in the color Cannes
and this is such a pretty color it's a
really nice rosy pink shade and just to
tone it down a little bit I went on top
of it with more of that stone at lip
pencil just leave it more of that movie
look so guys this is the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
is such a pretty look for spring and
this is kind of like a spring glam so
it's not like a natural spring makeup
but it's really glamorous but not too
hard to achieve which I love I love
everything turned out and I really hope
