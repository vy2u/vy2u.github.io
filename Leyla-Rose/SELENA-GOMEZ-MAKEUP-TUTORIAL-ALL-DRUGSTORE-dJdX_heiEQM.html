within today I have a celebrity inspired
makeup look for you guys I have not done
a celebrity inspired look for almost a
year which i think is insane because
celebrity inspired looks for something
that my channel was very very very
heavily consumed of when I first started
my channel so I want to get back into
this and what inspired me was Selena
Gomez I I love Selena and when I saw
these pictures I was like oh my gosh her
makeup looks amazing it's a really nice
but really easy to achieve feline I look
he has beautiful glowy bronzed skin a
nude lip and then the eyes are really
easy actually for Vogue and I love it it
got me in such a summer mood and I love
her so it's really got me in the
inspiration of doing celebrity inspired
looks what are we doing more celebrity
inspired look so if you do want to see
more than me she gets to do a big thumbs
up and comment down below who you want
to see next I'm thinking I'm going to do
Khloe Kardashian's you've done this
really nice pop of aqua blue or green on
the bottom lash line on one of her looks
I'll put the picture just here thinking
of doing that one next but let me know
down in the comment and like this video
if you want to see more and subscribe if
you haven't already to before my hair
blows up and I end up looking like
Hagrid let's move on into this tutorial
because I'm going for a total drugstore
look today I've already moisturized my
skin and I'm moving into the 17 skin Wow
glowing primer this is really really
nice it's kind of like a dupe for Mac
strobe cream it's just a little bit less
moisturizing if still doesn't register
eyes are just not quite as much but it
gives such a gorgeous glow and I really
wanted that for this look because
Selena's skin that looked incredible
under her foundation so I just applied
that all over and as you can see it just
makes your skin look really nice and
healthy and I'm going to be moving on to
foundation or the foundation I'm taking
the L'Oreal Paris infallible glow which
currently still isn't available in the
UK so I'm using the one that I've had
stocked up that I bought from the US but
I love this foundation it's so full
coverage but it's got the most amazing
glow so I'm really hoping that the UK
brings out soon because it's amazing I'm
just learning that out with a Beauty
Blender and
right now I'm actually having a really
really good skin day today and my skin's
been generally quite good lately so I
didn't need too much coverage but around
my cheek area there was just a few
little spots where just the foundation
wasn't covering enough so I applied a
little bit extra and then that was
pretty much it and I just wanted to have
a nice even coverage of this foundation
all over my skin so moving on to the
eyes for now I'm going to be taking this
concealer from Maybelline and applying
it all over my eyelids just to prep my
eyes for the eye shadow we are going to
be applying I didn't need anything too
brightening or anything too thick just
because I'm not really going for
anything too crazy on the eyeshadow
today I'm keeping everything matte and
we're not really going for too much
blending so it's okay for it to be just
a normal base of something quite light
and I said that with some powder and I'm
moving on to the NYX ultimate palette in
the neutral color and I'm going to be
first of all mixing these two shades
together and applying them into my
crease what I'm doing is just creating
kind of like a natural smoky look so
we're not taking anything shimmery onto
the eyes or keeping everything nice and
matte so what I'm doing now is just
deepening my crease and the reason why
I'm specifically doing this is because
Selena's eyelids she doesn't have a lot
of eyelid space like me and her lids are
quite deep set like her eyes are quite
deep Center into her eyes so it gives a
cross this really almost natural smoky
look I'm sure she was wearing eye shadow
but I don't think she was wearing as
much as I'm going to use but just to
recreate that kind of look she was
wearing I wanted to go with just a bit
of brown eyeshadow all over the lid also
just to deepen up my eyes and to give it
that Salina look so after making sure
that's totally blended I'm going to also
be taking this dark brown shade and
we're going to be using this as a
slightly deeper crease color now her
eyes did look quite smoky and they
didn't look like it just didn't look
like she was wearing that much it just
looked almost like a natural shadow I
can't explain it but when you see the
pictures you know I mean they didn't
look really super well blended it just
looked really softly grungy and I love
that so I'm just applying a little bit
onto the out
corners to extend my eyes because we are
going to be applying quite a thick liner
and just making sure it is blended as
well as you can without it being too
overly blended because like I said you
want it to kind of look grungy as well
and I'm also just applying some of this
brown eyeshadow onto the lids as well
because we want it to look a little bit
smokey around the area so that when we
apply our eyeliner
it just looks quite grungy rather than
to geometric would be eyeliner so I'm
going to be creating my eyeliner now and
I'm going to be using the epic ink liner
from NYX and I'm just going to be
creating a very thick wing on my eyelid
and it is quite long as well on Selena's
eyes it did take up a whole eyelid space
but of course I have a lot more space
than she does so it would look quite
ridiculous if I don't that on my eyes is
just look way too thick on her eye shape
there was roughly around the same size
so do see shape that suits your eye
shape the best and what I loved about
her look is that it didn't look totally
perfect it just looked like a sue at her
eyes so much and I just smudged it up a
little bit with some more of that brown
eye shadow to make it look a teeny bit
more grungy it still had a really nice
amount of shape to it but it didn't look
too perfect which I loved
I'm applying some mascara now and I am
going to be applying some lashes later I
wasn't going to but I just felt it
looked a little bit incomplete without
them so I did end up going and applying
some lashes afterwards I'm applying some
concealer now and this is the Rimmel
wake me up concealer it's one of my
favorites also and it's not too overly
bright what I really loved about
Selena's love is that her skin looked
relatively natural like not a lot of
highlight not a lot of contour it just
looked really natural on her skin so I
went for something that was brighter
just too bright in that area but nothing
too crazy where I was overly highlighted
under the eyes and once I blended that
in I am just going to be setting it into
place using my soap &amp;amp; Glory instantly
touch powder which you guys know and
reviews I absolutely love that and just
making sure it's all really nice and
smooth I didn't actually apply too much
powder I just applied it on the under
eyes and also on the center of my face
so I could really keep that glow on my
skin and like I said because her contour
looked so natural and her skin looks
structured but not too much
I went it with some cream contour from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and just applied this on
cause the contours of my face I'm not
using too much of this but the tone of
this is so perfect to create a really
natural shadow on my skin tone so really
love the way this turned out I just
blended this in with my Beauty Blender
and I didn't apply any powder on this
area so worked out really well cuz
actually decided in a stir the moment
that I wanted a cream contour but it
blended so easily so I love this product
and then I just went on top of this with
the makeup revolution bronzers from this
palette that I have and it has some
highlights in there and some bronzers
and I just mixed these two shades
together and I applied it onto my skin
using a brush and just creating a really
nice halo of bronze to kind of contour
and shape the face but in a nice way
where it looks from the instead of
really great toned which I usually like
to do on my skin anyway to highlight my
skin I'm going to be taking this eye
shadow from ELF
and I've used this in quite a few videos
it gives just a really nice golden glow
and I think that looks really nice with
this whole look and she just looks so
bronzy and awesome a zhing so I thought
this highlight was perfect and for my
eyebrows I really loved her eyebrows in
this shoot it was quite dramatic so I
did a little bit of a less dramatic
version but all of her eyebrow hairs
standing up words and it was a really
really pretty bushy looking eyebrow and
if you guys have watched my videos
lately you'd know I've been loving bushy
brows but this was a little bit more
dramatic so I pushed all my eyebrow
hairs up using this clear brow gel from
L'Oreal and I'm going to go in with this
NYX brow cream brow gel that's in this
little pot tube thing and I'm just going
to be squeezing some onto the back of my
hand and just creating loads of tiny
little brow hairs so I just first will
start with applying a little bit of that
on the bottom part of my brow and then
literally just start to replicate brows
and just flick them upwards and in the
direction that my hair grows in and I
feel like Selena's one very dramatic
meaning that the actual brow strands
were quite thick whereas I went for
quite thin ones and made it look as
realistic as possible because I wanted
it to be as realistic as possible as you
go to recreate this I think
natural bushy brows are so in so I
definitely what you guys
to recreate this in everyday life and
just to clean up the bottom part just
used a bit of concealer like I said I
went to apply some lashes now just
because I felt like I felt a bit naked
without it because the wing is so
dramatic I am going in with these
backstage lashes in the style Beverly
Hills they are quite sure and they don't
really do that much else apart from
volume for my lashes so I just felt like
it added just a little bit extra to a
good impetuous I'm going to do my hair
now and literally my hair is wet that's
that style of waves because in this
shoot Selena's hair was wet so I just
washed my hair enlisted I was the
easiest howsoever for a makeup tutorial
and for my lips I went around my lips
with this lip liner from next this is
their new suede lip liners they are
amazing and I just the truly went on the
inside with the soft matte lip cream in
ab derby from NYX also and then finally
to finish off with a glow I am taking
the pixie glow mist which is one of my
favorite setting braids ever just gives
such an incredible glow and that is the
finished look guys I really hope you
