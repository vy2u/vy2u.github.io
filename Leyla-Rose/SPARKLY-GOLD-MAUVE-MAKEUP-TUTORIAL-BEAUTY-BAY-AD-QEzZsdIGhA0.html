so today I have a video I'm gonna be
showing you how to achieve this makeup
look right here that I am wearing
actually show you this look with tulip
proportions I show you with a darker lip
option as well this video is actually in
collaboration with Beauty Bay and I
don't know if you guys know this but I
love Beauty Bay because they just stock
the most incredible brands I'm forever
ordering off their they just honestly
stock all of my favorite brands they
stock Anastacio which you guys know I
love they stock morphe just a bunch of
different incredible brands so I
basically use a bunch of different
makeup brands that are all available on
beautybay to create this makeup look so
this makeup look is actually a
recreation of one of the makeup looks
worn in the TV ad for beauty BAE it's
called hashtag queen BB which is so cute
this is actually the makeup look that I
recreated took like a lot of inspiration
from it I didn't want to recreate it
totally because there's actually a
tutorial for this on the Beauty paint
YouTube channel so if you want to see
how to achieve it exactly you can find
the link to that down below it's so
amazing especially for this time of year
and if you really want it to be super
edgy than you could go with the dark lip
which I also show you guys in this video
I think keep your eyes peeled for the TV
ad because I have definitely seen it
floating around and it's amazing so be
sure to keep your eyes out for that and
I will be sure to link all of the
products down below also forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and thumbs up this video for
more videos like this and let's get on
into this tutorial so the first thing
we're gonna be doing is priming our eyes
for eyeshadow and I'm gonna be taking
the Milani retouch and a raised light
lifting concealer and I'm just gonna be
applying this all over the lid
next I'm going to be taking the color
drain queen-of-hearts palette and this
palette is so gorgeous the first coat
I'm going to be taking is Royal
Prerogative
and it's this really nice warm brown and
I'm just gonna be putting this into my
crease these are super pigmented it's
actually crazy
I should o's blend it really easily so
it makes the job it's stupid easy for
you I'm just using a lot of stroking
motions just going back and forth in the
crease and taking this relatively high
but you do want to see a little bit of
your brow bone so don't
all the way up and you also want to kind
of like extend outwards as well I'm
gonna be mixing together the shades
ladyship and Duchess and I'm just gonna
be applying that farther into the crease
and don't worry about getting this on
the lip because we are gonna be cleaning
this up afterwards Peter I'm just gonna
be taking a low bit of concealer and
applying it onto a flat brush just to
carve out that half cut crease we have
going on this just really helps
everything to look nice and just precise
and then on top of that we're gonna be
taking these you a skinny dip ultra foil
shimmer eyeshadow palette and I'm going
to be taking the color skinny dip and
I'm just gonna be using a flat brush and
packing this on top where we applied
that concealer and then I'm just gonna
be taking a little bit more of that
color ladyship from the color drain
palette I miss on the outer half of my
eyelid to make it blend in really nicely
with the glitter is taking a makeup wipe
next and I'm gonna be cleaning up the
sides of my eye before we do our
eyeliner next we're gonna be applying a
liquid eyeliner and I'm using the ICO
skinny liquid eyeliner in black and
we're just gonna be creating a nice
defined wing just to really make this
look pop so it next I'm gonna be apply
some lashes and in this tutorial that
BTB did they actually use the style ash
calm little lashes I've decided to use
the Vegas style lashes just because I
wanted something a little bit more
dramatic because I wanted to add my own
twist to it
to prime my skin I'm gonna be taking the
laura geller sparkle hydrating
moisturizing eye makeup primer and I
love primers that are moisturizing so
this will work perfectly if for my
foundation I'm going to be taking the
Kevin a Quan sensual skin enhancer and
I'm using this in the color s x11 and
I'm gonna be using a Beauty Blender to
blend this in because this is quite a
thick product so I'm just gonna walk Y
slowly applying this to the skin
next for concealer I'm going to be
taking the Milani concealer again and
using this under my eyes this time I'm
just gonna be using my Beauty Blender
again just to blend this out to set my
skin I'm going to be taking the RCM a no
color powder and just putting this all
over just to make sure everything is
nice and matte
she burns my skin I'm going to be taking
the makeup geek Toni medium skin bronzer
and because the foundation was a teeny
little bit too light for me this will be
really nice just to add it like all
around to really give myself some more
color all my highlight I'm taking the
glow goals highlight gonna be popping
this on top of my cheek this is this is
intense then I'm also just gonna take
some of this as well and just pop that
on the inner corner just to make it pop
even more for my eyebrows I'm gonna be
taking the other Stassi eyebrows and you
guys have seen me do this a million
times I'm just going to be filling out
my brows with this
and I kind of want to go for something
that is defined but quite natural
because I really want everything to be
based around the pies today and I don't
want the browser to be cute overpowering
so I'm just flicking this through my
brows and crane little brow hairs then
I'm just gonna be taking the UH Nastasia
up Beverly Hills clear brow gel and then
just running it through just to set
everything into place and to finish off
my eyes I'm just gonna be taking some
more of that color
lady and just gently run this on
the bottom lash line and connect it to
the eye shadow on the top just on that
outer corner and then just dragging it
towards the tail of my eyebrow so for my
lips twice you're gonna do two lip
options to show you guys and taking the
derocker's mythix underground lip pencil
and just lining my lips with this fast
and to fill in my lips I'm going to be
taking a nude liquid lipstick from la
splash and this is in the shade in a sin
of X in pull the very dark option we're
gonna be going with a black lip and that
is the la splash lip cushaw in the shade
venom obviously this is super intense
but if you really want it to be super
dramatic then you could totally go for
this or you could go for the nude option
as well
so guys this is the finished look
obviously I kind of took my own spin on
the original look from the campaign I
love the way that it turned out you can
use this lip if you want or you can go
for the super dark lip as well if you
really wanted to do something super
dramatic like me and sometimes you get a
bit afraid by darker lip colors then you
can go for something like this or if you
love being bold you can also go for the
dark option as well don't forget to
check out the campaign you'll probably
see it on TV and stuff like that and
also don't forget to check out the
original tutorial as well on the beauty
Bay YouTube channel because they
actually show you how to recreate that
exact look this one is just kind of like
my inspired version of it hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did please

haven't already anyway guys I'm gonna
love you and leave you and I will see
you all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
