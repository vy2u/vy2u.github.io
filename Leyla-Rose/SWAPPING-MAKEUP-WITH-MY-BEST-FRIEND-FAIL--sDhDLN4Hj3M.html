my one of my closest friends I'm going
to be so many times makeup bags I have
to try and do makeup with her like
listen watch it like when I say well but
it's not in this budget I have given us
so many hand-me-downs bitch it just
destroys everything we're gonna attempt
to do each other's makeup we're gonna
attempt to do our own makeup using each
other's makeup and I refuse to use our
brushes because she doesn't clean her
brushes for hygiene behind you I'm not a
biohazard
aside from lashes because Ellie doesn't
my lashes and I wanted to learn actually
let me because she doesn't
apart from that everything that I'm
gonna try and use is gonna be hard if
she doesn't own something that I really
need then me I can't do my face of that
face powder so let me used makeup this
expensive like my face is really white
because like compared to everything else
because I use assets on my face to get
rid of my ah you thought she hit bad oh
yeah
Laila shines like the completely wrong
only baby skin from Maybelline which you
guys have seen use before anyways I hey
I finally express how much I hate using
a pencil I hate it Michiko
alright fair enough I didn't give you
options because that is my makeup bag or
if I was gonna do my makeup your house
that is genuinely the stuff these are my
lovely pants I love to the moon which is
really just trying to choke us on my
brother
Trixie keep scaring me everything is
over hit pan nothing in them hmm the
fake from eBay don't don't don't
underrate the hate don't hate hate the
fake okay the good thing concealer is
just disappearing to nothing okay don't
hate the fakes told you I told ya your
room
refuses to look at my brushes
I'm tango this is going back to my
school days Eddie's got / artist pearl
on wet concealer it's nothing you got
all the resources you need
where's me I'm just like anything I
don't it just disappeared

that okay okay I'll make it work jealous
cuz you get to use my face
this is why I used to go to school that
my uncle just doesn't feel right like it
just feels wrong like everything about

yeah actually thought I'd give it up
yeah like my motivation from the
beginning of this video we've gone
yeah I kind of knew though I knew it was
gonna be like this I didn't even think
like I'm sure we'll be fine I kind of
you know your trainer I'm just gonna
take this off literally straight after I
turned out to work in the full face of
makeup they will lit show you look at me
like what am i laying brush I'm using
the Lily lashes in the style it's not my
lashes that would be cool I could never
be a makeup girl ever like it wouldn't
work for me Oh
some clamor I'm going through my brows
what is this seventeen tonight is the
chin haunt but cool have you got
eyeliner pencil oh no no you don't know
you can't know I just wanna know
because it's important and you also
don't have proper once and now I'm gonna
cry
go away every time you come by my house
but like a man no not for me either see
that hard I don't but my skin texture
just looks awful with little concealer
on my face like everything you all kind
of doesn't look that bad no like
everything just looks wrong like it's
just like if someone looked at me just
be like man you just look oh yes I got
them
no I swear on my life it does not look
that bad mine now I look like a 12 year
old chap who's just the braids don't
know I just want to scream oh my god
like I can't I literally can't wait to
take this off like this feels wrong yeah
