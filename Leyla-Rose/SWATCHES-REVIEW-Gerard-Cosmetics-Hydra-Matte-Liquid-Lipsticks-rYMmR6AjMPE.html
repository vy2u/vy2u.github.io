channel today I'm going to be doing a
first impression review on the new
Gerard cosmetics hydra matte liquid
lipsticks these took a while to get to
me because I am in the UK why I'm so
excited to try these I haven't seen many
first impressions on YouTube I'm pretty
sure a few youtubers have done them but
I really just wanted to try them for the
first time on camera in front of you
guys swatch all three colors because
there's only three colors out at the
moment and I just thought I'd try them
all on camera so you guys can see what
they look like I think they have really
upped their game in the packaging their
lipsticks and the process is never used
to come in boxes but now they come in
the most gorgeous boxes I really like
the way everything is packaged from
their lipstick bullets to everything I
love how everything looks the Jacko's
Meg's
so definitely a thumbs up for packaging
so Before we jump in to the swatches I
just want to show you guys what the
packaging looks like so bear in mind I
have not tried these at all they
literally just came through this morning
and because there's only three of them I
thought it would be quite a good video
and it won't be too overbearing and too
many colors it will be a nice amount of
swatches just so you guys can see what
they have in range and if I ever do get
any more of them when they bring out new
colors I will definitely show them as
well I just want to try them on camera
for the first time because you know
we'll try things together you know we're
friends and I want you guys to see my
first impression of these products so
this is what the packaging actually
looks like it's really beautiful I'm
going to show you guys a close-up of
this the actual packaging where you can
see the color coming through is a really
nice matte packaging it looks almost
misty which is really nice it's a nice
touch it's easier to clean that way and
they don't look really dirty without
fingerprints on them these are really
nice they look really chic so on the box
it does say that these are cruelty free
which is amazing there are ingredients
on the box as well as all the
information that you need to know
including the color on the bottom - I'm
just really excited to try them so I'm
going to take off my lips I have one now
and we're going to start trying these
lipsticks on
you
member
you
you
let's just talk a little bit about the
formula I really really really like this
formula goes from quite a thick liquid
which is good you don't need to be too
watery because it's too watery it just
kind of slides everywhere and ends up
being patchy and it's not too thick
where it dries almost instantly and
again ends up being patchy it's a really
nice consistency that gives you enough
time to work with to place it we want it
to be this color which is called
Aphrodite is personally my favorite out
of the three furnace he was created by
mani MUA so he is a fellow youtuber he
did a great job on that beautiful color
I personally don't tend to go for pink
tones so much I like to keep towards the
peachy tones the peachy nude just
because I feel like a compliment
my particular skin tone a lot better
like these kind of peachy tones I love I
still like pink tones but just not as
much I feel like I'm gonna be reaching
for serenity a lot when I wear saw lip
pencil I feel like that is gonna go so
well over there I'm really excited to
see what kind of combinations I can
create I also feel like mixing serenity
and Aphrodite together would create the
most gorgeous like peachy pink a kiri
rising is a beautiful color although
it's quite out there it's definitely a
great color and they did a really good
job of it considering it's a liquid
lipstick and it's so bright overall the
consistency is amazing a dries matte
really quickly but the thing I really
like about it is that it doesn't go
completely dry it doesn't seep into all
the lines it looks really smooth I am
quite prone to dry looking lips and to
me this has gone on really smoothly I
personally really like the way that it
looks and I really like the fact that
you don't need a lip liner with it even
though I love lip liners I probably
won't be wearing these without lip
liners you don't actually need them
because they are pigmented and not to
use without lip liners they are very
comfortable on the lips I really like
these and I'm definitely impressed I
can't wait for them to come up with more
colors drawer cosmetics and never fail
to impress me if you guys would like to
buy these hydro matte liquid lipsticks

of video you guys would like to see next

try to think of things and I just can't
come up with ideas I don't know having a
bit of a brain for a moment but yeah if
you have any ideas and please come to
