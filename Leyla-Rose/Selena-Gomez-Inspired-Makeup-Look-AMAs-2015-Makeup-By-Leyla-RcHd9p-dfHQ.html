I am so super excited about this makeup
look because not only is it inspired by
the amazing Selena Gomez I've had so
many requests to do a look inspired by
her and when she wore this look at the
AMAs I was just like no it needs to be
done has to be done it's just the
perfect holiday look so I really feel
like lots of you guys would benefit from
this on this time of year I've had it
with the kind of lip that she was
wearing but you could totally pair this
with a very lip as well it's a really
nice cranberry eye with a smoky smudged
eyeliner look it uses the cranberry
colors it's actually really soft and you
can't see where anything starts or
begins it's just really soft and it
enhances the eyes beautifully I am just
in love with it and I hope you guys like
it too if you do want to see how I
achieved this look that's Lena Gomes war
at the AMA Awards then just keep tip
again I already went ahead and applied
some soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac all
over my lids and now I'm going in with
the makeup geek single eyeshadow in
creme brulee this is going to be our
first transition shade and I'm applying
this into my crease with a fluffy brush
just to really blend this out and to
really make all of the other colors
blend as easily as possible I am gonna
be building up this color because I do
want the warmth of this color to show
through the next colors we are going to
be applying then taking cocoa bear
eyeshadow also from makeup geek I'm
gonna be applying this with a 2-1 7
brush from Mac into the deeper part of
my crease so I'm gonna be applying that
just below that creme Brule shade I am
going to be applying it in an upwards
motion
dragging it was the tail of my brow this
will really lift up the eyes and when I
look at Selena's makeup her eyes were
really lifted upwards and I can really
tell the eyeshadow really went towards
the tail of her brows we want to kind of
copy that I almost are going back into
that previous brush to make sure that it
looks nice and airbrushed
next sticking makeup geek bitten
eyeshadow this is a really nice mapped
cranberry I'm taking that on the same
two one seven brush and applying this
into the crease to really change the
color to deepen it and just to add that
pop of cranberry onto the crease I am
just blending this in with side-to-side
motions very gradually packing on this
color and then once again going back
into that previous brush to ensure that
everything is really well blended you
can't see any harsh lines and it looks
nice and seamless next taking cranberry
from Mac this is a shimmery cranberry
Shea I'm gonna be packing this onto the
lid with a flat small shader brush I'm
gonna be gradually packing on this color
and we want this to be super vibrant we
really want to be able to see this as
this is the main color on the lid we're
not gonna be applying any other color
apart from the liner so we really want
this to stand out if you feel like you
need to you can apply a white base
underneath it to make it a bit brighter
next I'm taking makeup geek fits in I
shadow and I'm gonna start to apply this
onto the lid to create a smudgy flick
what I'm doing is just taking this on a
smudger brush and just gradually
applying this to create a wing just
applying it in the same way that I'd
apply an eyeliner instead I'm just
applying it with eye shadow has a nice
softness to it I'm applying this color
as much as I need to so that it looks
nice and black
and then taking a black pencil liner and
applying it as close to the lash line as
possible and then we're gonna go back in
with that shader brush and then just
smudge it out that way it gives a little
bit more definition towards the lashline
and it just adds more depth and drama
next we're just gonna be applying our
lashes I decided to apply the noir fairy
lashes from house of lashes I really
like the way these look but it's totally
optional you can use whatever lashes you
like it also went ahead and applied some
mascara afterwards as well to make my
natural lashes blend in a little bit
better to the false ones
next we're gonna be moving on to our
skin I am taking the makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer and just
applying it all over my skin and just
blending this in with my fingers to make
sure that my skin looks nice and smooth
before we apply our foundation for my
foundation I'm taking the ex1 invisi
where this is one of my favorite
foundations in the world I absolutely
love it and it just makes my skin look
so smooth I really like the effect with
this gives and I just really really love
it so I'm just applying this with my
Real Techniques sponge and I'm gonna be
applying two layers of this
while my concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline age rewind concealer and just
applying it underneath my eyes on my
forehead
the bridge of my nose and also onto my
chin I am gonna be blending that in with
the same sponge and I'm also going to be
using my finger as well to get into all
of these small areas that we sponge
can't reach
to set my concealer I am taking the
serpent glory instant retouch powder no
surprise that I'm always using this
powder I'm just using that on a sigma
f-35 and just using that to set any
areas we applied the concealer as for
the cheeks selena didn't look like she
had much going on so I decided to take a
big powder brush and just bronze the
outer perimeter of my face and the
reason why I'm taking a big Brush is
because that way it will define the face
and it will make me look bronzed without
actually looking too much and then I'm
gonna be taking this black kohl pencil
and applying it to my waterline to give
me a nice amount of drama and then I am
gonna be taking more of that cranberry
shade we apply it onto the lid and just
take it on that same shader brush and
run it on the bottom lash line and then
blend it out using the 207 brush I'm
applying some of that black eyeshadow as
close to the lash line as possible to
give a little bit of a smokiness and
then applying our mascara to finish
everything off all my brows I really
noticed that Selena's brows looked
really different to anything that I
think I've seen her wear before her
brows looks really messy but sculpted at
the same time so I took my uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills brow gel and I kind of
flicked all of my brows upwards it kind
of makes them look wild and messy and I
just really liked it to ensure my brows
don't expose I just took a bit of my
brows and just went through to fill in
any sparse areas
to highlight my face I'm taking the UH
Nastasia so Hollywood illuminator and
just applying on to the tip of my nose
and also on to my cheekbones and then
finally for the lips I lined my lips
with wild lipliner from Mac and I'm just
running that all along the lip lines and
then I am going to be filling in my lips
with this as well
and then just delights in it and make it
more comfortable to wear I am going to
be taking the NYX soft matte lip cream
in Cairo and I'm just gonna be patting
that in with my finger
