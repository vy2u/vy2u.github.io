favorites this is my very first
favorites video so I'm super excited and
I don't have loads of favorites this
month I always think of doing favorite
videos and they just either don't happen
or I just forget and it just yes or i
sat down today is the 28th floor 29th
today I believe and I'm just going to
sit down and do it while I have time and
get this up for you before the end of
sep tember so the majority of things I
have a lip products so let me do them
fast and so two things that I've been
loving a to new lip liners technically
they're not new they are the same type
for Sophia the Knicks retractable up
line is basically when I came back from
Cyprus I came back on the first or
second of September I was turned I was
completely a million times darker than
why I'm hughster being so the lip liner
that I loved sand beige you all know i
love it was not working for me so I
needed to find some new ones so I
instantly went on to the next website
and just was like oh my god oh my god oh
my god and I got too dark nude lip
liners so they're not the same but they
have been loving them recently before
outlining my lips and just making them
look really really nice and full and
also giving me that 90's vibe anything
90s vibe recently is making me happy so
these have been the best things ever
what I've interned and slowly going back
to my lighter color now so i can use
sand beige again but and the colors that
i have been using which i still do not
by the way on nutmeg and cocoa so not
meg is like an orange e spicy brown this
is really nice for a nice chicory kind
of lip so that's really nice and coca is
just a nice warm chocolate brown so
that's really nice as well for just
outlining the lip to give a definition
so those i have been loving something
else i have been loving which I've had
in my drawers for ages are never
actually used so this is the soft matte
lip cream in Istanbul and I have been
loving this this is obviously a cream
that dry snow matte finish and it gives
a really nice nude pink it's quite light
but it goes really nicely on top of a
lip liners I've been using saw lip liner
by Mac and then putting this on top and
it creates a really really nice nudey
pink kind of similar to what I'm wearing
now but a little bit lighter another
product that i've been loving is the mac
viva glam too so this is
the really nice cool brown pinky nude
it's nice because it looks different on
everyone it's a really really nice
lipstick that I've been passing on top
of loads of different liners and just
creating a different sort of look I've
been using this on top of loads of
miners to create that kylie jenner lip
I'm sorry for you might you want to kill
me right now I'll but yeah it does
create a really nice sort of kylie
jenner lip is actually a satin finish
but when you sort of just Pat it on top
of the lip liner it looks really nice
and matte so I've been loving this and
immerse fact for you guys as well is
that all the proceeds for Viva Glam goes
to the HIV and AIDS campaign that Mac
promote so all the proceeds so all the
retail price of this lipstick goes
towards them so I think that's really
nice and it's good to check that out as
well so that's really cool also my
ultimate favorites lips products of the
month are the new giraud cosmic
lipsticks oh my god these are amazing so
the 1995 and nude are incredible i'm
using the nude now on top of saw how am
I good is amazing these are an amazing
consistency very creamy I've used them
love them I promise you I would not give
any review that I do not believe in it's
absolutely amazing so oh my god in love
like they are amazing so that's what the
nude looks like and then the one my 95
is like a nice deep plum very similar to
the kylie jenner lip which i think they
were going for when they created this
considering the name 1995 so anything
nineties vibe like i said i love also
for the eyes i've been loving the
Anastasia Beverly Hills and Marie Z
palette so this palette has obviously
been raved about for a very long time
and I had used it when I was away this
was the only palette I took with me and
it was amazing like these are amazing
cutters very warm it's got some really
nice matte shades all really good for a
warm smoky eye and then they also have
some really nice light shimmery colors
and two pops of color as well so what
more could you want so when I was
traveling this was an amazing palette to
have it so slim very very pretty and oh
my god it's amazing so I've been
reaching for this pretty much every day
and my last makeup favorite is the Bobby
Brown bronzing powder so this is in
golden light I have stopped using this
and a little while back but I just saw
picked up again and I've rekindled with
it and I love
so this is really nice just to contour
and warm up the face I've used it today
and I just love it I just think it's a
really nice multi-purpose bronze are
really so I do love these they're
amazing so the fashion and favor of the
month all of these neck choker things
I've just sort of got into them and I
love them like I said they sort of have
that nice nineties thing to them and I
love them and yeah I've got a couple of
these and I just love the way they look
they're really really pretty and I just
think they edged up any sort of fashion
or makeup look so I absolutely love
these and I've been wearing them pretty
much every day so wearing them to work
to make it look like I made effort so
one other random favor of the month is
the fact that it is getting colder and I
know you're going to think later what
the hell is wrong with you you live in
London it's like cold all the time but
it had been a really long summer and
I've just been really excited for it to
get all nice and cool against we can get
snuggled up in a onesie and watch
Netflix all day and oh my god is just
the best feeling so I'm kind of loving
the fact that I can sit inside put some
candles on a bit loving can doors and
yeah it's my favorite kind of mood I
love to sing in and chillin I'm very I'm
a very chill kind of person so guys if
