today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this everyday natural makeup
look I just wanted to film something
that was really wearable and glowy and
just something really simple that I
think everyone could achieve I love
doing one natural makeup looks because I
feel like I always tend to do these
full-on glands and penis this is how I
look the majority of the time anyway so
I love doing everyday looks so if you
want to see how to achieve this makeup
look then just keep on watching so to
get started I'm gonna be applying some
eye cream around my eyes just underneath
and also on the lids as well I cream I'm
going to be using is the super skin eye
cream from Liz and this is such a good
eye cream something with really dry eyes
and this really helps me this helps to
kind of reduce the darkness under your
eyes as well make it look a little bit
more youthful but to apply a small
pea-sized amount into my finger I just
like to spread it in between my fingers
and just pop some underneath the eye and
then also on my lids as well I like to
use my ring finger because it's the
gentlest finger you can use and the skin
around your eyes is the most sensitive
skin on your face do you really want to
make sure you're being nice and gentle
with this area and then the same on the
top lid as well just me usual to really
pop this in I like to use this before I
apply my makeup in the morning and also
before I go to bed at night as well
because I feel like at night is where my
eyes get the driest after I've removed
my makeup this is especially nice in the
morning because not only does it reduce
the darkness of your eyes but it also
reduces the puffiness which can really
happen in the morning especially for me
I tend to get darkness and puffiness
just under the eyes next to add some
hydration into my skin I'm gonna be
taking me Lissa instant boost skin tonic
spritzer and I'm gonna be spraying this
all over my face this is my favorite
part of the whole day I use this in the
morning and the night and it just adds
some hydration it feels so cooling on
the skin it is so hot in England right
now so is gonna be a treat to spray this
all over my face because it's so cooling
and refreshing now that my eye area and
also my skin is nice and hydrated and
prepped I'm going to be taking my
foundation the foundation I'm using
today is the gorge
a healthy mix serum foundation I'm using
this in the color dark beige I'm gonna
be applying this all over my skin I love
this foundation especially for everyday
wear as a really nice light to medium
coverage and is buildable and it's very
hydrating which I thought is really
needed for it everyday wear at the
moment I'm kind of just dealing with
acne scars so I don't feel like I need
too much coverage just a little bit of
extra coverage on the areas where the
scarring is still there apart from that
my skin is getting really smooth I'm so
happy about that and this foundation is
really nice I'm only gonna be applying
one layer because I actually feel like
my skin doesn't need anything else next
I'm going to be applying some concealer
this is the Rimmel wake me up concealer
and I am using the color classic beige
I'm just going to be applying this in
all the areas I would like to highlight
that bring forward I'm applying this on
my under eyes my forehead the bridge of
my nose and also onto my chin and this
is a really nice radiant concealer I
really like this for it everyday wear
because it's not too heavy but it gives
me a nice amount of radiance and it
makes me look really glowy you can
totally go for Less concealer for an
everyday look but for me I like to have
a really nice bright under eye that's
kind of my main feature and everyday
look so you can totally apply less if
that's what you like but I like to make
sure my under eyes and nice and bright
what are just using my finger to get
underneath the eyes
but you set all that together because
it's super glowy and I just know my skin
it will just roll right off if I don't
set into place I'm going to be taking
these soap and glory in story touch
powder and just setting all the areas
that tend to get oily really nice
natural bronzy glow I'm going to be
taking the l'oreal glam bronze cushion
day so they fresh glow bronzer and this
is like the cushion foundation but a
bronzer version and this is stunning and
it's wet it's kind of like a cream
bronzer and i love it it gives such a
natural glow all over the skin it looks
very jewy which i love for an everyday
wear especially for spring so i'm just
gonna be applying that with my Real
Techniques sculpting brush you feel like
you want to make sure it's all blended
into the rest of your skin I'm just
gonna go back in with that foundation
brush and just Pat it on my skin and
just make sure there are no harsh lines
and just a really nice good ones finish
off the skin and make it look super
glowy I'm gonna be taking my Laura Gala
gilded honey illuminator
this is probably one of my favorite
highlights following the real club of my
cheekbone kind of going up in this
little curve
like to do just above my crowd as well
so that when I kind of tell my head to
the side just home on my point on my
brow that shines as well so on an
everyday basis me myself I like to go
for a little bit of a more softer brow
just because I feel like when I'm not
wearing a lot of makeup on the rest of
my face because I've got dark hair it
can really stand out there the first
thing I like to do is take an eyebrow
gel and this is a tension one to the
soap and glory artery of volume boost
brow fiber gel and this has a tiny
little brush so you can really get in
that my brows are very fine so this
comes in very handy you like to brush
this through the brows to tip them a
little bit and then if there are any
sparse areas I will just go through it
with some uh Nastasia Beverly Hills brow
powder and just fill in all the areas
that look like they have gaps and then I
just like to go underneath it with a
little bit of concealer just to clean up
the shape and also because I always make
a mess with tinted brow gels but my
brows are done I'm gonna keep the eyes
nice and simple I'm gonna be using any
eye shadow because I want the eyes to be
super simple I'm gonna be taking just on
mascara I'm using my two favorite
mascara I'm going to be taking the
l'oreal full scope mascara and i'm also
gonna be mixing it with some of the
L'Oreal telescopic Cobham that mascara
these two alike my babies and my
favorite mascara ever best of all just
like to start off by using the l'oreal
full / sculpt and really closing them
upwards and then whilst it's still tacky
I like to go in with the telescopic and
just really drag my eyelashes upwards
and really give them somewhere like I
was just two coats of mascara and it
really makes a difference those are my
two favorite mascaras you guys are
really short lashes try it without cuz
you'll love them but finally I'm gonna
be finishing off this look with my lips
typically I like to go for a nude lip
but you can go for any lip color you
want with this look it's super simple so
go for whatever you feel most
comfortable in first of all just taking
Gerard cosmetics lip pencil in the color
nude this is where new favorite I'm
gonna be lining my lips with this but
also filling it in a little bit as well
do you think a liquid lipstick this is
the Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
in the colour caramel
and then just to define the outer
perimeter of my lips I'm going to be
taking max trip down that line up this
is the finished wearing everyday makeup
look I love it it's so lightweight and
that really feels like I'm barely
wearing anything it feels super glowy
which is so nice flowy skin just makes
me feel really healthy it just makes it
look really nice and plump and youthful
and I just love the way everything looks
really nice and natural if you did enjoy
