today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to achieve this simple holiday glam look
it's so super easy and I also show you
guys a few lip options that will go with
this makeup do you want to see how I
achieve this look today and just keep on
watching so I'm gonna get started off on
my skin and I'm gonna be applying my
primer this is the Mac natural radiance
primer and I'm just applying it evenly
all over the skin for my foundation I am
taking my favorite this is my ax1 invisi
wear foundation and I'm just spreading
it all over my skin and then I am gonna
be buffing it in to my skin using the
Real Techniques sculpting brush and I
haven't used this brush in a while and
it really made me realize how much I
absolutely love it this brush is amazing
for foundation so I make sure I have a
nice even coverage and then we're gonna
be moving on to our eyes I'm gonna be
taking the Maybelline age rewind
concealer and I'm gonna be using this to
act as an eye primer just because it's a
little bit lighter coverage a lot less
drawing than the primer I usually use so
I'm just using my finger to spread this
all over my lid
and I am also making sure to set it as
well so that it doesn't move all day
next I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
creme brulee eyeshadow and I'm gonna be
applying this into the crease using this
crown blending brush and I absolutely
love this brush I'm just using this
color and applying it into the crease
just as our first crease color we're
actually only going to be using one
other color in the crease because I
wanted to keep this eye look very nice
and simple but because this color was a
warm enough I did want to go into a
burnt orange shade as well so once that
is all nice and blended just blend it as
evenly as you can you want to go into a
burnt orange shade i'm gonna be using
morocco from makeup geek and i'm just
gonna be taking this but the same brush
and just applying it on top all over
where we previously applied the creme
Brule shade this is just gonna warm
everything up and this is optional if
you don't like these tones of colors you
can just stick to a neutral Brown I
really wanted to warm things up in the
crease that's why I applied this
I'm also going to be taking magic act
soiled eyeshadow from makeup geek as
well and I'm gonna be spreading it all
across the lid this is one of the most
perfect holiday colors because it's just
so gorgeous and glittery the color
payoff is amazing and I just love the
color I think it's just so Christmassy
so I'm just applying it all over the lid
quite gently I don't want to pack it on
too much because I don't it to be too
thick on the lid and I'm just sculpting
out where my crease is and I don't it to
go above my crease I only want it to sit
just where my crease is and then I'm
also just taking some more of that
Morocco shade and just applying it with
a smaller blending brush just to deepen
up the crease a little bit and then I'm
gonna go back to that previous brush and
just blend everything out so that the
eyes have a nice amount of definition
then I'm gonna be taking makeup geek
afterglow Pigman and this pigment is
absolutely amazing I'm gonna be applying
this on the inner corner of our lid and
this is just gonna give it a touch of
sparkle this is totally optional you can
do this only if you'd like you don't
have to do this I just feel like I added
a little extra touch of sparkle and I
think that's really nice for the
holidays and for Christmastime and so
get do this if you'd like and then I'm
gonna be going into some lashes again
this is totally optional I am taking one
of my favorite lashes this is the eyelet
1 to 6 lashes I personally chose these
because they're not too long but they
give me a nice amount of volume you can
go for just a really thick coat of
mascara if you prefer that
but for me simplicity usually does still
involve full slashes but it's totally up
to you I'm just applying some mascara
just to make sure the lashes blend a
little bit better to the false lashes
and that way everything just looks a
little bit more seamless
so moving back to my skin I'm gonna be
applying my concealer and I am taking
the Maybelline fit me concealer I'm just
applying this on to all the areas I want
to highlight or bring forward so I'm
applying it under my eyes the bridge of
my nose or so on to my forehead and my
chin and then I'm gonna be blending that
out with the same brush we use to apply
our foundation just because I want a
really nice seamless look I don't want
to see any lines and then gonna be
setting my powder with my all-time
favorite this is of course this soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder and I'm
just setting all the areas where we
applied that concealer I'm gonna be
taking this NYX contour stick and I'm
gonna be taking the contour slide only
and just using it to sculpt out all the
areas I would like to appear more
sculpted I personally like to cream
contour when I'm going for a simple eye
or lip look because I do feel like a
nice structured glowy face is really
nice to pair with it but this is again
of course optional I'm just sculpting
out all of the areas I would like to
appear more chiseled so I contoured the
sides of my forehead my cheekbones my
jawline and also my nose too
I also applied someone to my Cupid's bow
to give myself a little bit of a contour
moustache for a little bit just gonna be
blending the hand with a real techniques
expert face brush and also using my
finger onto the areas that I love the
harder to just kind of blend in so I'm
using my finger onto my nose and then
why I'm doing as well is just baking
underneath my contour so I'm just
allowing some powder to sit there and
what that will do is just clean up the
contour and make it look super sharp and
then I'm just taking some of this NYX
matte bronzer and I'm trying this out
for the first time and it was quite dark
I did try to apply it as softly as
possible and then using that same brush
I'm just going to be dusting away the
excess powder
I'm also gonna be taking this blush from
elf and just applying it onto the apples
of my cheeks and just kind of rolling it
upwards and outwards a little bit and
this is just gonna create a really nice
rosy cheek and to give me that really
nice healthy glow I am going for the
mary lou manizer and this is just the
most luminous highlight ever every
single time I use that I realize just
how amazing it really is and I'm also
applying this onto the tip of my nose
too
I did go ahead and do my eyebrows
off-camera but I will link my tutorial
down in the description box to finish
off the eyes I'm just taking that small
blending brush again with some more of
that Morocco color and just applying it
onto the bottom lash line and just
finishing off with some mascara I did
also apply a nude eyeliner into the
waterline but it totally cut that bit
out so I apologize for that
you can go for a white or renewed
eyeliner into the waterline next moving
on to lips I wanted to go through super
glossy lip by I'm gonna be showing you
guys a few different lip options at the
ends I just wanted to pair with a super
glossy nude lip I'm first applying the
Mac strip down at lipliner and then I'm
taking Tom Ford sable smoked lipstick
and then after that I did want to apply
some gloss so I took the NAS a Greek
holiday gloss and just applied a
generous amount of this to the lips
so guys that is the finished look and
that is how it looks with the nude lip
but I did want to just quickly show you
how versatile this whole look is - the
lip you can wear this look with any lip
color I know that lots of people do like
to go for reds or for deep colors around
the Christmas time so I wanted to show
you guys how it looks with this girly
pink also wanted to show you guys how it
looks with this glossy red which I know
is a super popular one for Christmas and
then also if your feeling to go to the
dark side you can totally go for vampy
lip - I personally will like to stick
with the nude but it's totally up to you
