channel today I'm going to be doing a
hair tutorial for you guys I'm going to
be showing you how to achieve sleek
straight hair especially when you have
frizzy hair my hair is so frizzy it's
actually a lot fuzzier than this all the
products I used in this tutorial really
help to cut down the frizz I say it's
usually about twice as frizzy as this so
if you do want to see how I achieved my
sleek straight hair and cut down for is
then just keep on watching so I'm
starting off with freshly washed hair
and I have shown you guys in the past
what I use to wash my hair so I will
link down below my curly hair tutorial
because it's exactly the same as that so
to prevent my hair from getting too
frizzy I'm actually gonna be applying
some products to help cut down on the
frizz I'm taking the Liz L botanical
shine nourishing hair oil first of all
and just applying it throughout my hair
and making sure to try and avoid this
right close to the root because of
course oil can cause grease eNOS so if
I'm applying it to the top of my head
I'm not applying it right into the roots
I'm just applying it around the hair and
I do like to make sure that whenever I
apply a product I like to brush it
through especially when I'm
straightening my hair because I
definitely feel like this helps to kind
of stretch out the hair and prevent it
from getting Karly you guys have
probably seen in the past how curly my
hair actually is so my hand actually
wants to wring wet up whereas brushing
it through just kind of helps to drag it
downwards
it makes the whole straightening process
a lot easier then I'm going to be taking
the red can pillow proof blow-dry
Express primer and this is meant for
blow-drying but I personally like it
when I'm straightening my hair this is
kind of like a primer for your hair it
has heat protection which is kind of
like a two-in-one and it was a really
softens and allows the hair to look nice
and straight so I really like this and I
definitely feel like it makes my hair
look nice and shiny as well I also
realized at this point that it does not
taste nice I'm just doing the same thing
that I did with the oil and just
brushing it through my hair just to make
sure that it reaches all of my hairs and
also again so I can kind of stretch out
the hair and ensure that it dries a
little bit straighter now usually I'd
allow this to air dry because I
personally feel like you get a lot less
frizz this way but I decided to rough
dry my hair today because obviously I
wanted my hair to dry a lot quicker so
this is what I look like
once I have rough dried my hair
it looks pretty frizzy but like I said
before my hair would look a lot frizzier
if I didn't apply all of these products
in it so this definitely has cut down
the frizz in half believe me you do not
want to see what it looks like when I
have no product in it it's horrible so
I'm just going to be sectioning my hair
off into two halves I'm going to be
doing one half first just so I can show
you guys a before and after but of
course you can walk in whatever sections
you find easiest and the key to
straightening your hair especially when
you have thick or frizzy hair you want
to work in quite small sections so what
I'm doing here is just doing first a
small section and taking my GHD gold
large straighteners and I'm just going
to be straightening through my hair
whilst I brush it with my tangle teezer
this is probably the number one tip I
could give you is to try your very best
to straighten and brush your hair
through at the same time I am not
kidding you you will not need to go over
your hair as many times and I have just
found that this has saved my life so I'm
going to be doing the exact same thing
with the next section in between each
section I do like to spray my hair with
a little bit of hairspray the one I'm
using is the red can fashion walk 12
versatile working spray just because
it's quite a soft hairspray that doesn't
make your hair feel hard so that's one I
personally like to use and like I said
when you brush through your hair with
the strainer at the same time I feel
like you're joining to go over your hair
as many times once I have sprayed my
hair with hairspray what I like to do
also is just go over it and smooth it
down with Tangle Teezer
and again this just makes everything
look a lot more sleek and it just makes
everything lost a lot longer as well
when you do it in between each section
and the rest of it is kind of
self-explanatory I just do the exact
same thing through every single section
brushing it through as I straighten it
the top section is exactly the same like
I said it's very self-explanatory and
when it gets for the top section and
especially the front you just want to do
the same thing and ensure that you
really are brushing it through and
making sure to apply a really nice
amount of hairspray especially on the
top layer to prevent that static nurse
and just those little baby hairs I like
to stand up and that is how I get my
sleek straight hair so this is just a
little reminder of what the before looks
like it's actually crazy and I
definitely feel like each of these
little tips will really really help you
to reduce frizz I'm going to go ahead
and speed through and get the other side
done
and yeah let's just speed through this
you
so guys that is the end of this sleek
straight hair tutorial I really hope you
enjoyed and you found out something new
today that could maybe help you prevent
frizziness because I have been there
growing up with curly hair I just feel
like you just get so used to your frizz
and you just find ways to reduce it I am
in by no means a expert at hair and no
means whatsoever I feel like I'm such an
amateur but if you do enjoy hair
