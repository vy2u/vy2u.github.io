today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this smokey feline makeup look I
absolutely love this makeup look it is
so simple but so effective so if you do
wanna see how I achieved it and just
keep watching to get started I'm gonna
be priming my skin using my Mac natural
radiance just to give my skin a bit of
moisture I'm just blending the end with
my fingers and then I'm gonna be moving
on to foundation I am taking the L'Oreal
infallible 24 hour liquid foundation and
just applying it all over with my
fingers and then I am going to be
blending this into my skin using my Real
Techniques sponge and I just want to
apply one even layer all over my skin
and once we're done with that we are
gonna be moving on to our eyes if you
feel like your eyes are gonna be quite
messy you can do the eyes first and then
clean everything up and do the
foundation later but today I just
decided to do my foundation first next
I'm just gonna be priming my eyes using
my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac and I'm
just using my finger to blend that all
over my lid then taking l'arte eyes
shadow from makeup geek I'm just gonna
be taking that on a blending brush and
just applying this into the crease
straightaway and then I'm gonna be
taking a fluffier brush and just
blending out the edges I don't wanna go
for anything too fancy for the crease
color I just want one even color and
then we are gonna be going in with a
darker shade to start to create that cut
crease I am taking maca from makeup geek
I'm just going to be taking that with
the same brush and just applying it into
the crease we're gonna be creating that
cut crease afterwards so don't worry if
it's a little bit messy you can go back
and blend with your previous brush to
make everything look nice and seamless
next taking this emphasized powder from
Mac I'm gonna be using this as an
eyeshadow and just patting it with a
shader brush all over my lid and I'm
gonna be using this color to carve out
that cup crease this will just clean
everything up and I'm just gonna
gradually apply this all over the lid to
create a nice opaque color then I'm
gonna be taking a pen eyeliner and just
creating a nice feline flick I want to
go for quite a large wing because we do
want this to really stand out
next I'm just gonna be applying some
concealer first of all I'm just taking
the amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
and just blending that in with my sponge
and then I'm gonna be going on top of
that with my Maybelline fit me concealer
this is a really good combination and I
like to mix these two together because
it really brightens up that under-eye
area and then I'm going to be applying
this on all the areas with light to
highlight as well I'm just gonna go
ahead and blend that in with my Real
Techniques sponge and just make sure
that everything is nice and blended
I do also go in with my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush which you guys know I
love to get into all the little areas
just to blend everything in
I'm also just gonna be baking my
undereyes using the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm just
using the sponge to kind of fake all of
the areas we apply the concealer and
then we will be dusting away all this
powder afterwards I'm gonna go ahead and
do my eyebrows off-camera but I will
link the tutorial down below so once
I've done my eyebrows I'm just gonna be
taking a big powder brush and just
dusting everything away and then I am
gonna be applying some false lashes the
false lashes I'm applying are the House
of lashes iconic
I'm also just applying some mascara to
blend in my natural lashes and then to
smoke out the bottom lash line I'm just
taking some gel liner and applying it to
my waterline and then I'm gonna be
running this all the way on the bottom
lash line to to really create a nice
amount of smokiness and then I will be
kind of blending that out a little bit
just to really soften everything up so
I'm just taking the eyeliner and making
sure that it's nice and bold on the
bottom lash line and then taking some
black eyeshadow and really smudging out
that bottom lash line because this is
what makes everything look really really
smoky and I'm just taking that on a
pencil brush and then going back in with
my blending brush just to soften up the
edges I did also create a little inner
corner flick and applied some mascara to
the bottom lashes to
I'm just gonna be bronzing my skin and
I'm just taking a big fluffy brush and
just bronzing the whole outer perimeter
of my face I don't want to go for
anything too crazy but I do go
underneath my contour with a little bit
of a loose powder just to define the
face a little bit more even though I did
really go too much into contouring and
whilst that's baking I'm just gonna be
applying some highlight this is Becca
opal highlights applying that onto the
cheekbones and was on to the tip of my
nose also I'm gonna be applying my lip I
decided to go for wall lip pencil and
this is just a really nice Modi pink
brown shade and I'm just applying that
all over the lip and then I'm gonna be
going in for the la splash liquid
lipstick in the colour innocent vixen
and I'm just applying that all over and
then once that's done I'm gonna be
dusting away the rest of that powder and
then this book is complete
so guys I really hope you enjoyed this a
makeup look I am actually obsessed with
this look I actually really like the way
that everything complements each other
and not to mention this eye look will go
really well with any lip color I hope
