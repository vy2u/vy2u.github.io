channel today's makeup tutorial is going
to be the smokey eye with a pop of
purple
so much higher
sky
so the first step is going to be
applying our primer as always I'm going
to be applying Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
all over my lid just to make sure that
all the eyeshadow blends and stays on
perfectly next we're going to go in with
the Urban Decay smoked palette and
taking this light nude color I'm going
to use this as our first transition
shade and this is just going to make
sure that everything blends really
really well I'm just using a blending
brush and applying this into my crease
and just going backwards and forwards to
make sure this is really nice and buffed
in all the colors that we're going to be
using today are going to be mapped so
it's gonna look really different to how
usually my looks will look next I'm
going to take this pink Sigma eyeshadow
and apply this into my crease and I'm
just gonna make sure that it has an
essence of pink within it because we are
gonna put purple on the bottom lash line
next I'm gonna take uninterrupted
eyeshadow from Mac and you guys know
this is one of my favorites I'm gonna
take this on another blending brush and
start to apply this in the deeper part
of my crease and on the outer corner of
my eye then I'm just gonna brush it
inwards and make sure this is really
well blended into the other colors that
we just applied
next I'm going to take this dark brown
color from the same smoked palette and
just start to apply this into my outer
corner with a pencil brush and this is a
more larger pencil brush and then I'm
going to go back in with the other
blending brush that we use to apply the
uninterrupted shade and just use that to
blend out that Brown go back as much as
you need to to make sure that that Brown
is blown out and really nice and blended
next I'm going to take the lightest
color from that smoked palette and apply
this all over our lid this is just gonna
be a really nice easy I should have look
on the top lash line and then we're
gonna go in with a really thick wing of
liner I'm using an eyeliner pen and this
is from soap &amp;amp; Glory and this is the
super cat eye liner this is really good
if you want to apply a really thick wing
this isn't good if you want to create a
really nice thin line this is better if
you want to create a more dramatic wing
it's very stiff but a lot of product
comes out so it's really good if you
want to have a really nice intense wing
so I'm just applying some eyeliner on my
top lash line and then I'm creating my
wing and then once I've created my wing
I'm gonna make sure that I line it up
with the other eye and I'm gonna connect
them together as you can see I'm just
connecting the two lines that we just
drew and connect it to make a wing shape
and as always I like to start off thin
and then gradually build it up because
it makes sure that we don't go too thick
too quickly
next I'm gonna apply some mascara and my
false lashes today I decided to go for
some really thick full slashes these are
the red cherry 102's
I haven't worn these in such a long time
and these are one of my favorite
eyelashes just because they are so
dramatic and thick so this really tops
off the look so pick any lashes that you
love next I'm gonna get started on my
skin I'm applying the Mac natural
radiance primer and just apply this all
over my skin to prep it's before
foundation this will just make
everything go on a lot smoother and make
everything look a lot more hydrated then
I'm gonna go in with my silk cream
foundation and this is in the color
cashew beige because I am a little bit
lighter than usual I haven't tanned so
this is my color for the moment I'm just
applying this all over my face and
blending it in with my Real Techniques
sponge
then I'm gonna apply some concealer
under my eyes this is the Maybelline age
rewind concealer and I'm just applying
this under my eyes I'm gonna make it
into kind of like a triangle shape to
highlight my under eyes and then I'm
also going to apply some of this onto my
forehead
and then I'm also going in with the
Maybelline fit me concealer and just
applying this on the higher points of my
cheeks and also on the bridge of my nose
then I'm just taking that same sponge
and blending that into the skin that
this just makes everything blend in
really really easy and everything just
looks really seamless
then I'm taking my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush which is one of my favorite
products at the moment just because it
gets into all the areas that I find hard
to reach and then I'm also gonna go back
over with my sponge just to make sure
that everything is blended in perfectly
then I am setting my under eyes and
baking them a little bit with my Mac CC
correct powder in the color neutralized
and I'm just gonna leave this on my skin
for a couple of minutes and whilst
that's sort of baking on my skin I'm
just gonna be bouncing this on the areas
that need a little bit more powdering
like my forehead then I'm just brushing
this all the way with a real techniques
setting brush next and we've been
applying the Mac designer purple
eyeliner into my waterline and also
applying some of this underneath my lash
line as well this is what's crucial for
the look because this is what gives it
the amazing purple smokiness that this
look has so you want to make sure to
apply a good amount of this and then
we're gonna go in with sugarpill poison
plum eyeshadow and start to blend this
out with a flat morphe brush and I'm
just gonna make sure that we gradually
blend out the pencil that we just
applied and then we're going to go in
with a pencil brush and make sure that
it's all really blended out the whole
point of this look is that we want to
make sure that it's really buffed out so
the bottom lash line is very very smoky
and you also want to make sure that
you're taking this powerful into the
inner corner which you wouldn't usually
do but this is gonna really help to
create a gorgeous cat eye effect next
I'm going to apply some mascara unto my
bottom lashes and this just going to
balance the top and the bottom lashes
and just finish off the whole eye look
and then to finish that cat eye effect
I'm gonna go in with that same eyeliner
I used for my top lash line and just
create a tiny little triangle on my
inner corner and this will just kind of
look like a feline effect next I'm gonna
be bronzing my skin I'm not gonna go too
crazy with my skin because there is a
lot going on on the eyes so I'm just
bronzing the perimeter of my skin I'm
just making sure that it looks like I
have lots of color running through my
skin
I'm also applying a blush I'm using the
NARS Super orgasm blush and just rolling
it backwards on my cheeks and I'm also
taking my Becca highlight in opal and
applying it onto my cheekbones and today
for the lips I'm gonna be lining my lips
with two Rimmel London lip pencils and
this is a pinky one and then I'm also
gonna go in with a darker pink it's kind
of like a spicy color I think it's
called spice and I'm gonna go over that
as well just to add a little bit more
definition because this is quite a light
pink I'm just going around the edges as
you can see just to make my lips look a
little bit fuller
then I'm going to be applying a lip tar
onto my lips to finish everything off
and I'm just using my fingers to blend
this in and make sure that this kind of
blends into the lip liner and there are
no harsh lines so guys as the end of
this look I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial I am so in love with purple I
don't know why I have a warm purple in
