today's makeup tutorial is going to be
on this soft brown eye makeup look
so the first step is going to be
applying our primer and starting with my
face today because the eyes are going to
be quite soft and I felt like I could do
my skin first instead of doing my eyes
and I'm using the makeup forever step 1
smoothing primer and then I'm mixing
together two foundations I'm using the
Bourjois healthy mix of foundation and
the Maybelline Dream satin liquid
foundation and just mixing them together
and this just gives a really nice medium
coverage finish it's quite jury so you
do need to powder it a little bit I kept
it quite dewy today because I just
wanted to look quite fresh because the
eyes were quite soft and I just wanted
the vase to look quite fresh and dewy so
I didn't actually powder anything but
you can go for effort you feel and I
just blended that in with the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge and
then I'm priming my eyes as always with
my soft ochre Paint Pot because you guys
know I absolutely love this primer it
just smooths the eye and just clears all
the color and then we just have a really
nice smooth canvas to work on then I'm
going to be taking makeup geeks Peach
Smoothie eyeshadow and just be applying
this into our crease and this is just
going to be our first transition shade
and it's just gonna make the rest of the
eyeshadows blend absolutely perfectly
next I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
a frappe eyeshadow and I'm gonna be
applying this into the crease also this
is just gonna darken it by I'm gonna be
applying this a little bit closer to the
crease this will just kind of darken it
and make it look a lot warmer next I'm
gonna be taking Coco bear eyeshadow also
by makeup geek and be applying this into
the crease
with a slightly more tapered blending
brush it kind of tapers into a point
which means it has more precision and it
applies it more into a precise point so
I'm applying this into the deeper part
of my crease and making sure to blend
this really well with the first brush we
use to apply our first eyeshadow and
this will just make sure that everything
is really nicely blended out and I'm
just making sure to blend it as well as
I can because I am gonna be going back
into that Coco bear and just deepening
that color slightly just cuz I want it
to be quite deep because we are gonna go
for a slight cut crease effect look then
I'm gonna be taking a blank type eyes
shadow from Mac and just be applying
this all over our lid this is an
off-white color it does look almost
white but it's actually an off-white so
it's a little bit more of a cream color
and I'm just gonna be creating a slight
cut crease effect and just be using the
edge of the brush to carve out that cut
crease and just be following the line of
my natural crease and just make sure
that color is really pigmented and that
line is quite sharp and I'm just going
on top of that color to make sure that
it's really pigmented
next I'm going to be applying some
eyeliner this is the maybelline lasting
drama eyeliner in brown I'm just gonna
be applying this with an eyeliner brush
and just flicking it out slightly I'm
starting off on the outer corner and
applying half of a wing and then I'm
gonna start blending them out because I
want to make sure that this eyeliner
looks really nice and diffused and as
you can see when you just keep pushing
it and blending it it just creates the
most gorgeous blended effect once you're
done blending you can go over and do the
rest of the wing apply as much as you
need to and then blend it out as quickly
as you can because this eyeliner does
dry so once I've applied the next half
of the isle I go back into that smudging
brush and just make sure that it's
really well blended closing my eye to
make sure that it is as blended onto my
lid as possible
next I'm going to be applying my false
lashes these are the Euler 100 lashes
which have a lot of individual lashes if
you guys do want to know how I
customized my lashes I will pop a link
into the description box next I'm
applying some concealer to my under eyes
and I'm also going to be applying it
onto the other high points of my face
and this is just gonna bring these areas
forward and just kind of finish off the
eye look because it just makes the eyes
stand out a lot more and I'm just going
to be using the Maybelline fit me
concealer
and I'm going to be blending that into
the rest of my complexion using the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
and I'm also using my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush to get into all the
little areas that are harder to reach
with my sponge so my camera went
completely out of focus I am so sorry as
you can see I wanted to show you guys
roughly what I was doing I did was apply
some cream eyeliner into my waterline
and applied some eyeshadow and mascara
to my bottom lash line i bronzed my face
and highlighted it and then I realized
that my camera was completely out of
focus so I'm so sorry
you didn't miss too much thankfully but
now I'm gonna be applying my lip color
and this is a Kiko retractable lip
pencil and I wanted to go for a really
natural lip color just because I wanted
it to be all about the eyes although the
eyes looked really really natural
I kind of wanted it to be a really
neutral lip so go forever lip you won
because this look actually will go with
any lip color you choose so I'm just
gonna be applying this lip liner all
over my lip and then I'm gonna be
applying a Mac mineralize lipstick and
this is in pure power this is such a
gorgeous color and it's one of my
favorite lipsticks for summer just
because it's so hydrating and it looks
really plump and beautiful
so guys as the end of this look I hope
