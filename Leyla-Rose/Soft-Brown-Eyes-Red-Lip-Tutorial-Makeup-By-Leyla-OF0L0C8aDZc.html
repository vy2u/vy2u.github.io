today's makeup tutorial is going to be
this soft brown eye look which is going
to be paired with this bold red lip
so to get started as always I'm going to
be applying my soft ochre Paint Pot all
over my lid and this just gonna prep our
eyes before we apply any eyeshadow this
is gonna make all the eyeshadows blend
and stick a lot better and it's also
going to cover up any pigmentation today
I'm going to be using the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette and first I'm
going to be taking this peachy brown
shade and this shade is completely matte
this is gonna be our first transition
color and I'm taking a big fluffy
blending brush and just be applying this
into the crease and making sure to blend
this a very thoroughly to make sure it
looks fully blended this is gonna make
all the other crease colors we apply it
blend very easily and you just want to
make sure that you're packing on that
color so that it's very pigmented next
we're going to be taking this milk
chocolate shade and we're gonna be
applying it with a slightly denser
blending brush into the deeper part of
our crease this is gonna begin to dark
and be shadow and I'm just applying it
really into that deep part of our crease
and I'm also gonna be taking it into the
outer corner as well so I'm just gonna
kind of be flicking it onto my lid a
little bit to create a little V on the
outer corner and then I'm taking that
first blending brush and just making
sure that both those colors blend
together very evenly then I'm taking
this dark dark brown shade it's almost
like a black brown and I'm gonna be
taking a much much denser blending brush
and I will start to apply this into the
outer V and this is just gonna start to
give it that a little bit of smokiness
and I'm gonna keep this color closer to
the outer V I don't apply too much of it
into the crease because what this will
do is it will drag our eyes upwards and
outwards and this will just give us that
nice cat eye effect and then I'm just
going into that previous brush and just
applying a little more of that brown
shade to make sure that it looks nice
and blended into the other transition
shades then you can go back as many
times as you need to to make sure that
color is nice and pigmented next I'm
taking this gold shade also from that
same palette and I'm gonna be applying
it with a small precision brush just to
make sure that we get it precisely onto
the lid this will just make the eyes
reflect and make it look really nice and
bright
and I'm just gonna be cleaning up the
slides of that look also just to make
sure that it looks nice and straight and
it brings our eyes upwards next I'm
gonna be applying some false lashes I
skip the liner today if you can of
course go for a liner if you wanted to I
just wanted to keep the eyes a little
bit more on the simpler side because I'm
going for a darker lip but you can of
course go for whatever you'd like I'm
using the oiler one to six lashes these
are one of my favorite lashes fr I
really like these lashes at the moment
they're nice and they're full and
they're layered and textured but they're
not too heavy where they look you know
really unnatural and I'm also gonna be
applying some mascara to my natural
lashes just to make them blend into the
false ones a lot better and also to make
it blend in I'm also gonna be taking
some an eye liner and just be applying
it onto my inner corner to blend the
lash band into my eye a little better
for the face I'm gonna be prepping my
skin with the makeup forever step one
smoothing primer and it's just gonna
smooth out all my pores all my uneven
skin texture and it's just gonna make my
skin look a lot smoother and for my
foundation I'm going to be using the
Laura Mercier silk cream foundation and
this is the best foundation for me at
the moment because it just covers up
everything that I need to and I'm just
applying it all over my skin and I'm
kind of applying a fairly light layer
for the moment and spring it with a bit
of fix plus and this will just make
everything blend in really really well
and I'm blending that in with a damp
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna be
bouncing that into my skin and making
sure that this layer isn't too heavy
because we are gonna go in with another
layer to kind of cover up the areas that
are a little bit harder to cover so my
spotty areas that kind of show through
I'm gonna go over it with another layer
so like I said I just applied a little
bit more coverage on the areas that are
a little bit harder to cover and because
we applied a thin coverage first it just
means that everything won't look too
cakey once that's all blended in I'm
gonna go in with some concealer this is
the Maybelline age rewind concealer I'm
gonna be using this to highlight my face
also and I'm just applying it in all the
areas I would like to highlight this is
under the eyes on my forehead the bridge
of my nose and also my chin
and to blend that into the rest of my
complexion I'm going to be using my damp
Beauty Blender again just to make sure
that everything looks nice and smooth
and there are no harsh lines
I'm also gonna be using my fingers to
kind of blend in any areas that are a
little bit harder to reach and I'm just
using my finger to kind of tap that into
the skin
next I'm resetting my under eyes with
the banana shade from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour care and I'm just
using a real techniques setting brush to
do this and this is just gonna brighten
my under eyes and also make sure that I
can see that it doesn't crease
I'm also going to be using this on the
other areas where I applied the
concealer on my forehead nose and my
chin next I'm going to be bronzing up my
skin and I'm using the mineralized
skinfinish in dark golden this is my
favorite bronzer at the moment I've just
been absolutely loving it for this
summer it just gives me a little bit of
a glow and just makes me look more
tanned even when I am my lightest this
is the lightest shade I go I'm not tired
at all at the moment so this just kind
of gives me that nice glow that I always
feel like I need so I'm just using a big
fluffy brush to apply this all over the
outer perimeter of my skin and then I'm
gonna be going in with a slightly darker
bronzer from the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and just be applying it on
the upper part of my cheekbone and this
just means it's gonna kind of bronze
this area because I am gonna be
contouring as well on the bottom part of
my cheek area I'm also gonna be applying
this on these sides of my forehead as
well then I'm gonna be taking form which
is a slight grayer color which means
it's gonna look a lot more like a
contour and it's not going to look too
warm in my cheekbones and I'm gonna be
using a Real Techniques contour brush to
just apply this in the areas where I
want to appear more sunken in and this
is just going to slim down my face and
it's just gonna make my face look a lot
more structured and then for the blush
today I decided to go for this Sigma
spotlight powder and I'm just gonna be
applying this onto my cheeks and this is
a really nice car it's really reflective
so it kind of highlights at the same
time as well so you don't necessarily
need a highlight but me I love my
highlight so I'm going in with my laura
geller baked gelato highlighter and
gilded honey and I'm just applying this
with a little techniques sculpt brush
and this is just gonna create a really
nice glow on the tops of our cheekbones
I'm also gonna be applying it above my
eyebrow and also on the tip of my nose
for my brows today I'm gonna be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is I've
absolutely been loving this recently if
you watched my favorites video you would
know that I've been loving this I'm just
filling it in with the pencil side and
brushing it through with the spoolie
side and I'm just kind of filling them
in quite naturally today I'm always
filling in the outer part of my brow a
lot thicker than the rest of my brows
I'm just making sure that i enhance my
arch and darken the outer part but leave
the inner part quite free of product and
then I'm just gonna be brushing through
with the anastasia beverly hills clear
brow gel and this is my baby i love this
and this makes my brows look exactly how
i want them to look and it also keeps
them in place and then i'm just
highlighting underneath my brows with a
little bit of concealer
next I'm just gonna be applying a brown
pencil from Sigma into my waterline and
also onto my bottom lash line I'm also
just going to be smudging this a little
bit as well with a smudger brush just to
make it look a little bit more smoky and
then to finish off the eye look I'm just
gonna be applying some mascara onto my
bottom lash line and I'm also going to
be highlighting my inner corner and my
brow bone with another shade from the
chocolate bar palette this is like a
pink and gold color it's like a pinky
gold I'm just gonna be applying that
into the inner corner and also my brows
to give my eyes a lot of definition and
shine
and then for the lips I'm gonna be
lining my lips with cherry lip pencil
from Mac this is an amazing lip pencil
and it's perfect whenever you want to go
for that statement red lip and I'm just
gonna be kind of lining my lips today
I'm not gonna be filling in all of my
lips because the lip color that I'm
using is a little bit more of a pinky of
red and I want that to be quite obvious
that it's a little bit more of a pinky
red so I didn't want to kind of fill in
my lips completely with red I wanted the
pink to show through so I'm just lining
my lips all around the lip and then I'm
going to be going in with the Sigma lip
base in math this is the star of the
show I've absolutely loved this it's
probably one of the most comfortable lip
colors to wear it's not drying at all
it's extremely hydrating and the color
pigmentation as you can see is amazing
so I've been loving this I love that
it's in a jumbo pencil form it's easy to
sharpen and I just love it it's great if
you want to keep it in your bag because
it's just so small I love it and this is
just the kind of highlight of the show
it pulls the whole look together and
I've just been absolutely loving this
lip color recently
just to finish off the lips I'm just
making sure that I'm cleaning out the
edges just to make them look nice and
precise and making sure that they don't
look messy it does happen with a bold
lip sometimes you just want to make sure
to clear it up so guys as the end of
