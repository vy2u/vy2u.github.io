hey guys and welcome back to my channel
today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this soft copper makeup look and
this is just gonna be the most perfect
makeup for summer
so the first step is going to be
applying our primer as always I'm using
my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac and I'm
just using a zoeva rounded brush to
apply this all over the lid so it's a
nice even layer and I'm just gonna make
sure this is all over from the brow bone
to my lid then I'm gonna be taking Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek and just
applying this into our crease as our
first transition shade this is almost
the same color as my skin but what this
will do is just ensure that all the
colors blend very evenly after you apply
this next I'm going to be taking rule
from Mac and this is just a really nice
muted orange color and I'm just gonna be
applying this into the crease and just
blending this very well so it blends
into that Peach Smoothie color and I
just want to make sure this is a really
nice soft edge then I'm taking cocoa
bear by makeup geek and just applying a
really small amount of this into the
crease just to slightly deepen it on the
very deepest part of my crease because
we want to create some deepness and some
definition so I'm just using a very
small blending brush to apply that into
the crease
then just add a little bit more warmth
I'm taking makeup geek bitten which is
like a reddish-brown and just applying
this into the crease further and just
making sure that that other colors we've
previously applied are all blending
together very seamlessly then for the
star of the show I am taking flame fro
with is they fold eyeshadow from makeup
geek and I'm just applying this all over
my lid with my finger and as you can see
guys look at how pigmented this is this
is just absolutely crazy this is my
favorite fold eyeshadow from makeup geek
it is so gorgeous and it's just the
perfect copper color so I'm just using
my finger to blend that into the rest of
the colors very gently and then I'm just
cleaning up the side of my eye using a
q-tip
then I'm just gonna be applying some
mascara and then our false lashes the
false lashes I'm applying all the red
cherry 47 lashes when you apply thick
lashes you do want to try and hide them
as much as possible so a little bit of
eyeliner just on the top of it will kind
of hide the lash balance I'm just doing
a very thin layer and then I'm gonna be
priming my skin I'm gonna be taking the
makeup forever step 1 primer and this is
the smoothing one and I'm just gonna be
applying this in all the areas that
means smoothing so basically the center
of my face and for my foundation I'm
gonna be mixing the Maybelline Dream
satin liquid and the l'oreal true match
foundation to create my perfect color
and consistency and i'm just gonna be
applying this all over my skin making
sure to kind of rub it into my skin a
little bit so that when i do use the
sponge to bounce into my skin it just
kind of blends a lot more evenly and i'm
just gonna be bouncing this in in one
even layer all over the skin
then I'm gonna be taking some of my mac
prolongwear concealer and NC 30 and
applying it under my eyes onto my
forehead onto the bridge of my nose and
also my chin that this is just gonna
highlight those areas and also cover up
any more redness that the foundation
didn't cover then I'm just gonna be
blending their in with that same Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge and
just making sure that it blends in very
evenly to the rest of my complexion
then I'm just gonna be taking my Sigma
3d HD precision brush which you guys see
me using every single video I absolutely
love this brush just to clean up any
areas where my sponge can't reach and
then I'm taking my sponge with a little
bit of some mac mineralize loose
foundation powder in extra light I'm
just gonna highlight the areas that I
concealed and then I'm just brushing
away the excess using my Real Techniques
setting brush
next I'm just gonna be filling in my
eyebrows now I'm using the Mac
waterproof brow set in quiet brunette
and also highlighting under my brows
with some concealer and then I'm gonna
be going in today with the Mac brow
pencil in lingering this is quite a
light come up I wanted to go for quite a
soft brow today I really like going for
a lighter brown color just because I
don't like to go for too dark brows now
because I just feel like they're just
too harsh on my face so lingering is a
really nice cool brown shade
next I'm gonna be taking witting pencil
brush some of that flame for our
eyeshadow and just applying that to the
bottom lash line and making sure to
thoroughly blend this out I really want
to make sure this looks really nice and
blown out because we don't want it to be
too harsh or anything like that and I'm
just applying some mascara and some nude
pencil to my waterline just to open up
my eyes I didn't want this to be a smoky
look I wonder this to kind of be just
like a really soft makeup look with a
pop of color and then this is a NYX Paul
mania pigment and I'm also applying
makeup geeks shimma shimma on top of
that just because the pigment was a
little bit pink toned and I just wanted
to brighten it up a little bit on the
inner corner for the skin I'm gonna be
bronzing up my skin using the dark
golden mineralized skinfinish from Mac
and this is one of my favorite bronzers
just because it's just the perfect tone
it's not too orange it's nice and brown
but also golden at the same time so I'm
just applying it in all the areas I
usually like to bronze just under my
cheekbones and these sides of my
forehead and I'm also gonna be
contouring with my Bahama Mama bronzer
which is one of my favorite things to
contour with because it's still nice and
warm but it's cool enough that it
actually defines your face so this is
one of my favorites and I'm also using
some of that on my nose as well just to
give my nose a little bit more shape
then I'm gonna be applying some blush ah
this is the hot mama blusher from the
balm and this is just a really nice
peachy color and I'm gonna be applying
the balm mary-lou manizer onto the tops
of my cheekbones also gonna be applying
some of that onto my nose also I'm
applying some of that onto my brow bones
for my lips I'm using the Mac
stripped-down lip pencil I wanted to go
for a really simple cool nude just
because I didn't want to go for anything
to you peachy just because I wanted all
the focus to be on the eyes so I'm just
lining my lips with this trip down
pencil and then I'm gonna be filling in
my lips with honey love lipstick also
from Mac
