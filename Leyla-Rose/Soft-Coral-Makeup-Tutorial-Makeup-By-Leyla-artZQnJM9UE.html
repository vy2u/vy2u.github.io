today I have another makeup tutorial for
you I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this soft coral makeup look
first of all I've just tied my hair up
in this little left-footed
thing in my hair so don't mind that I'm
gonna start by prepping my eyes by
priming it with my soft ochre Paint Pot
my eyes were a little bit dry and
irritated today so this probably wasn't
the best prime option but I actually
don't have another one that I like so
that's why they look a little bit dry
but I'm gonna be taking the morphe
Jaclyn hill favorites palette and taking
this light coral color I'm gonna start
to apply this into my crease and
blending it outwards and I'm starting to
use my new zoeva rose gold eye care
oh my gosh I am obsessed with this set
of brushes guys these are amazing they
just kind of do everything every brush
has its own job and they just do its job
perfectly so I'm taking a tapered
blending brush and just applying this
coral color into my crease and just
blending it and then I'm taking a fluffy
a blending brush with nothing on it
just to blend that color upwards I'm
just making sure to repeatedly blend and
blend and blend just to make sure that
color is nice and seamless
and I'm just going back into the coral
just to make sure that color is nice and
vibrant and then I'm going back in with
the clean blending brush just to make it
nice and seamless again next I'm going
in with this warm brown color and I'm
going to be applying this into my outer
V and I'm taking a luxe crease brush and
this is like a pencil brush but a
blending brush at the same time that
this brush is amazing I can't believe
I've never actually had this in my life
before and I'm just going to use this to
apply it to my outer V and then going
back into the coral I'm going to be
blending that color outwards I want the
eye shadow to be quite simple today and
this is just gonna be a nice amount of
color just going around the eye and then
we're gonna go with a nice wing of
eyeliner so I'm just going back into
that brush and just repeatedly going
back and forth between brushes just to
make sure that the color looks nice and
blended into one another
next I'm gonna be taking this single
eyeshadow from Sigma and I'm gonna be
applying this with a flat brush and just
applying this onto my lid this is a
really gorgeous coral color again and
I'm just creating a really nice light
lid to complement the rest of the darker
coral so this is a really light one it's
almost like a soft wash of color and
it's just gorgeous then I'm gonna be
going with the lightest color in the
palette and just applying it onto my
inner corner this is like a very light
dusky pink color and it's just really
pretty it's just like a really light
light pink color it's really nice and
it's just gonna open up our eyes this
kind of look is really good for someone
with smaller eyes just because it helps
you open up the eyes and then applying
the darker color on the outer corner
just helps to kind of enlarge and
elongate the eyes because I'm gonna be
applying quite a thick wing of eyeliner
of course as usual with the thickness
and the style of the liner is up to you
this liner just suits my eye the best
and I just wanted to go for something
that wasn't too long but was quite thick
so of course choose whatever style of
eyeliner it suits your eye the best
next time when you are applying a thick
pair of false lashes I've been loving
these lashes recently these are the Mac
36 lashes and I have put on a ton of
individual lashes which just makes them
so much more fuller longer and wispy ah
I will definitely do a tutorial on how
to customize your own lashes because I
have not used any lashes recently that
aren't customized so I've just been
loving doing that recently and the next
I'm going to be applying some
moisturizer to my skin this is the
bodyshop vitamin e intense and moisture
cream and then I'm gonna be applying my
foundation and the foundation that I'm
going to be using today is the Laura
Mercier silk cream foundation mixed with
a little bit of my aamir flora argan oil
and I absolutely love mixing my
foundation with oils just because it
helps you smooth it onto my skin a lot
my Sun a lot more flawlessly and I'm
just blending that in with the Real
Techniques miracle sponge and I'm just
gonna be bouncing this onto my skin it
just to create a nice flawless even
coverage
next I'm gonna be doing my eyebrows and
they done them off-camera and I will put
the link in the description box for my
eyebrow tutorial just because I do it
the same every single time and I thought
I would just link it just to make this
video a little bit less boring then I'm
applying my pro longwear concealer in NC
25 to my under eyes and blending that in
with the same sponge and this is just
gonna give us a really nice bright under
eye and I applied it in that kind of
upside-down triangle shape and then I'm
going over with my dream Lumi touch by
Maybelline and this is in the color
ivory and just applying this on top of
that just to give that super bright
under eye highlight and again I'm just
going over that with the same sponge
just to create a really nice flawless
blend with the concealer and the
foundation
next I'm gonna be setting my under eyes
and I you use just a little bit of a
translucent powder and then I'm gonna be
going in my waterline with the Rimmel
scandaleyes nude eyeliner and this is
gonna brighten and open the eyes up so
much more this is such a pretty way to
open up the eyes without making it too
obvious and I've just been loving doing
this for spring because a really pretty
doll I'd look it is just so gorgeous for
spring then I'm gonna take that same
crease brush that we use to apply the
coral into our crease and we're gonna be
taking that under the lash line and the
reason why we're using a big fluffy
brush is it just cuz it kind of gives us
that kind of halo effect around the eye
and it just makes it look like your eye
is kind of like floating around the
color effect makes sense and then going
closer to the lash line with a smudger
brush using the same dark brown that we
applied into our crease
next I'm going to take some mascara and
apply it to my bottom lashes and this is
just going to complete the look and also
balance the top lashes with the bottom
lashes and also this is going to open
your eyes up so much more and just make
them look nice and bright then I'm gonna
take my bronzer on my luck's face brush
by zoeva and just go around my face just
to bronze the perimeter I didn't want to
go too crazy with any contouring today
just because well the eyes are kind of
bright and I didn't want it to be too
much so it's completely optional but I
just wanted to bronze and that was it
and I'm also gonna apply some
highlighter as well just to give us a
little bit of that spring glow and I've
been loving the Becca cosmetics
highlighter and opal recently just
because it's a really gorgeous gold and
it looks nice and bright but it doesn't
look too much at the same time and then
I'm gonna be taking a boldly bad lip
liner from Mac and this is just a really
pretty coral nude lip liner and this is
just really nice just to line the lips
and I'm also gonna be filling in the lip
with this as well next I'm gonna be
taking a sigma lip vex and this is just
a really gorgeous
full-coverage lip gloss and it just
gives full coverage color and this is
just the most gorgeous nude gold color
it's just amazing so I just applied that
on top all over the lips
so that is the end of this look guys I
