showing you how to achieve this soft cut
crease with a pop of blue under the eye
this is a really nice look for any
occasion just if you fancied something a
little bit different so the first step
is going to be applying our NYX jumbo
pencil in milk and I'm going to be
applying that all over the lid this is a
really nice step to use if you want to
make your eyeshadow appear brighter so
I'm just gonna be patting this onto the
lid just to make sure that that color
stays on the lid rather than just
rubbing it away
then I'm going to be passing on a
off-white shadow so it's not a pure
white on top of that pencil that we just
put on the lid then I'm going to be
taking a charcoal brown color and I'm
going to be applying this just into my
crease with a small crease brush and I'm
making sure that I'm not blending the
lid color and the crease color together
that's what's gonna give us the cut
crease look so I'm using more vigorous
motions as I get further up towards my
brow this is gonna make sure that we get
a nice
next I'm going to be taking a small flat
brush and I'm taking a slightly darker
brown and I'm applying that into my
crease I'm doing this to make our cut
crease look a little bit stronger and
then I'm going to be blending that again
finally I am going to be taking 8 black
into the crease and this is just gonna
finish up our cut crease making it look
nice and dramatic
I'm just putting on the same shadow I
applied that fast all over my lid again
this is just gonna make sure that none
of the darker shadow has fallen onto our
lid doing this just gonna make sure that
it sounds out a little bit for now I'm
just applying my liquid liner I'm gonna
be doing a nice big wing on the lids
next I'm going to be applying my pencil
liner onto my waterline and I am going
to be making sure that my waterline is
nice and black so our lip looks nice and
dramatic now I'm going to be taking a
random blue pencil that I've heard in my
makeup cabinet and I'm going to be
running that under my lash line and this
is just gonna give us that nice pop of
blue that we've won then I'm going to
take a bright blue shadow and I'm going
to be smudging this downwards this is
just going to give us more intensity now
I am just passing onto my lid a little
bit of a liquid glitter liner from
collection mm I know it's gone onto for
my liquid liner but I do go over it
afterwards then I'm taking a blue gel
liquid liner from the same brand and I'm
just going to be running that underneath
on top of that blue and I know this is
gone all my lashes again but this I'm
gonna take this off after next I am
applying a really thick pair of false
lashes this is just gonna give us that
extra bit of drama as you guys know I
love for drama just pinching them next
to my natural lashes so they look a
little bit more natural if they can't do
and that is the end of this lip guys I
hope that you enjoyed this I focus
obviously I have a buzzer at the end of
this tutorial I hope that you enjoyed
watching please don't forget to
subscribe and please leave a comment if
you want to let me know where you
thought the video or if you want any
more videos please let me know any
suggestions let me know down below what
format of videos you prefer if you
prefer voiceover videos or you prefer me
talking as I go through it to be fair
the voice overs obviously are a lot more
easier to record because I can just
record me doing my makeup and then
voiceover when I am free so recording
voiceover videos probably means that
I'll be able to get more videos up I
would like to know what videos you
prefer recording anyway definitely let
me know down below also let me know any
video requests that you've got me to
record and I will see you in my next
video guys thank you so much for
watching and take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
