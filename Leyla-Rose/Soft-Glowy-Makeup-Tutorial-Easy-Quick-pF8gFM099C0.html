today I'm gonna be showing you a super
quick
glowy tutorial that's really soft and
very very easy to achieve I love this
makeup look it's appropriate for
everyday it's appropriate for if you
want to look a little bit more glam but
not true at the same time I absolutely
love this makeup looks if you guys do
want to see how I achieved it then just
keep on watching I've already applied my
Primus and I'm just going straight in
for foundation the foundation I'm taking
is the Bourjois healthy mix and I'm just
buffing it into my skin using this crown
buffing brush and I really like the
Bourjois healthy mix because it gives a
really nice glowy finish and not to
mention it's quite light on the skin so
it doesn't feel too heavy which makes it
quite appropriate for an everyday wear
so I'm just buffing this all over to get
a nice even coverage all over for my
concealer I am taking the Rimmel wake me
up concealer this is perfect especially
if you want to go for a nice glowy
finish I love this concealer because not
only does it brighten but it gives a
really nice amount of radiance it's a
radiant concealer so I do really like
this just to brighten up these areas and
to really give me a nice glow I'm just
blending that into my skin using the
morphe g2 brush and I'm just applying on
all the areas I would like to bring
forward I'm also just taking some of
that and applying it onto my lid as well
and just setting my concealer using my
soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
although we want it to be glowy we don't
it to move about into look or elesif
setting it is definitely important
especially if you have an oily skin type
if you don't and you have a drier skin
type you can just set the areas that get
a little bit oily throughout the day
I'm also taking that same powder and
just taking that on a smaller brush and
setting my eyelids and then taking a
larger brush and just using that to set
the whole face that way everything will
not move and it will stay on all day for
my eyes I'm gonna be taking the zoeva
nude spectrum palette and I'm gonna be
taking this a brownie beige color I'm
just gonna be taking that on a blending
brush from morphe and just building this
up into the crease
I'm just gradually gonna pick up this
color and pack it on in the crease and
blend it just to create a nice amount of
definition and also just to give the
eyes a little bit of shape then taking
this shimmery brown shade I'm gonna be
applying that all over the lid just to
give the look a little bit of a shimmer
to make them look a little bit glowy and
yeah I decided to put shimmer but you
can use a matte if you prefer something
a little less sparkly next I'm just
gonna add a little bit of glam using my
Ardell wispy lashes I'm just applying
them with some glue and some tweezers
and just applying them to my top
lashline
I personally love false lashes but you
can use some mascara if you feel more
comfortable next I'm just gonna be tight
lining my top waterline and applying
some mascara just to make the natural
lashes blend in a little bit bad to the
fullest ones and this I feel just makes
everything look a lot more natural
I'm also just applying some mascara to
my bottom lashes just to balance the top
and the bottom and to make it look again
a little bit more natural now just gonna
be filling in my brows using my uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz and this
is in the color dark brown and I'm just
filling in my brows just to go with my
shape and just to fill in any sparse
areas I don't want anything too dark or
crazy so I'm just applying it onto all
the areas where I feel like there should
be hair and then just brushing it
through some clear brow gel to make all
of my brows stay in place and not move
all day next I'm just gonna be bronzing
using my makeup forever Pro bronze
fusion bronzer and I'm just taking that
on a big powder brush just to give a
light a veil of color all around the
outer perimeter of our face and then I'm
just highlighting a little bit with my
Becca opal highlighter and just applying
it onto my cheekbones and also onto the
tip of my nose and for my lips I decided
to go for a nude because I just feel
like a nude lip goes a lot better with a
nice soft glowy look than a colored lip
and I'm going for stripped down with
pencil from Mac and just applying this
all over my lips and first of all just
lining my lips and then I'm gonna be
filling in my lips with this as well
and then taking mac naturally
transformed lipstick I'm just gonna be
filling in my lips and then going on top
of this with a gloss the gloss that I'm
gonna be using is the luster glass from
Mac any color love nectar and this just
makes everything look super glowy I love
the way a glossy lip goes with a glowy
makeup look so I decided to go for a
gloss today so guys that is the end of
