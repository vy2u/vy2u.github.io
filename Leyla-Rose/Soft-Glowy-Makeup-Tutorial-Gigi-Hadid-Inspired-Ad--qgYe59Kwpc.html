channel so today I have this makeup
tutorial for you and I'm so excited to
show you it's this beautiful soft glowy
angelic makeup look that will be perfect
for any time of year any party everyday
is to start it for everything if you
want to look glowy and healthy it is
inspired by Gigi Hadid she always looks
so beautiful and glowy so if you do want
to see how to achieve this look then
just keep on watching so starting off
with moisturized skin I'm going to be
taking the baby skin primer from
Maybelline and just applying it onto my
skin just to smooth everything out
before any concealer to color correct
are going to be taking me Maybelline
master camo palette and lights and I'm
first of all going to be taking this
green shade right here this is going to
help cover up all of those redness and I
also have some old acne scarring which
tends to be quite red on my skin and
this green will really help to color
correct and even out that skintone I'm
just applying that everywhere where
redness shows and also anywhere where I
have those old acne scarring I asked you
can apply quite a bit this because the
formula is quite light so it doesn't
make my foundation like any thicker
which I really like next moving on to
this apricot shade I'm going to be
applying this underneath my eyes to
conceal my under eye circles this tends
to happen with me through a lack of
sleep so I'm just applying that and just
making sure to blend this in all
together like I said it's a really light
glowy coverage that's very easy to blend
in and it looks amazing
even on its own as you can see it's cut
down on all of that scarred without even
applying foundation but the foundation
I'm gonna be finding is the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless which you guys
know is one of my favorite foundation
ever and just applying this all over
just to create a really nice even
coverage I really like the way this
makes my skin look it just looks so
smooth and poreless and I just love it
so I'm just making sure to get a nice
even base and this just helps to help my
face match to my body before my face is
much paler than the rest of my body
I like to go for quite a bright under
eyes I'm going to be taking this light
yellow tone shade and just applying it
underneath my eyes to really create a
really nice brightness underneath there
I feel like this makes you look more
awake and it goes really well with the
color correction we did beforehand so
I'm just tying that in with my finger
and just making sure also to set it into
place with a little bit of powder just
so that it doesn't move all day because
we are going for an angelic look I'm
going to be taking this shimmery
highlight shade and applying it onto the
top of my cheekbones I'm going to
further intensify this is another
highlight afterwards but this just adds
a really nice bottle glow I'm going on
top of that with the master strobing
liquid from Maybelline also just popping
that on top like I said just to
intensify it that teeny little bit more
for my eyes I'm going to be taking the
Maybelline the nudes eyeshadow palette
I'm going to be taking this shade right
here two acts of our first transition
color just popping this in the crease
with a blending brush and it's a
beautiful matte Brown it just looks
really natural and just adds a little
bit of shadow into that crease area and
then I'm going to be taking a slightly
darker shade this one is just a little
bit darkest this adds a little bit more
of that intensity in that crease area I
personally really really like the way
that this kind of style looks on my IR
so much it really lifts upwards so I'm
really focusing this on the outer corner
area and just using it to kind of create
a v-shape on that outer area and that
way it really turns my eyes upwards to
add some shimmer onto the lid I'm going
to be taking the Maybelline Color sessue
and this is a really long-lasting a
cream shadow I'm just going to using my
finger to pop this onto the lid and as
you can see it's just beautiful
champagne shade which i think is perfect
for a look like this I also just wanted
to go in with a little bit of extra
shimmer of brightness so I went in with
this color from the palette also I just
patted this all over we just applied
that color tattoos and this just created
a little bit of extra shimmer and I did
focus this a little bit more on that in
a corner area to really give it that pop
of brightness on the inner corner
using the Maybelline master precise
liquid pen eyeliner I'm just going to be
creating a wing that really turns my
eyes upwards really going to prepare the
eyes for the mascara and the flattery
lashes that we're going to be creating I
really wanted my eyes to turn upward so
I created a relatively thick wing that
got thicker towards the outer edges for
my lashes I'm going to be taking the
Maybelline falsies push-up angel mascara
and I'm going to be pushing this through
my lashes the brush is super unique on
this and SCARA it's very curved but very
very precise so you're able to get right
to the root of your lashes and add a lot
of length and volume personally my
lashes are super stubborn really they
don't do much but this mascara really
really adds a lot of volume and honestly
I was quite amazed how much volume
actually gave me I like mascara I can
build up volumes as I personally feel
like you can kind of stop when you saw
that you've got enough and that's
definitely what you get with this
mascara you can definitely choose how
much volume you want and I really really
like the fluttery and beautiful look
that it gave my lashes and finally for
my lips I'm going to be taking my
Maybelline Color drama lip contour kit
and starting off with this little prime
section it has a little lip primer in it
which I could get so good so I'm just
using the lip brush and is using that so
a quiet first of all then I'm applying
this beautiful lip shade I wanted to
keep it super simple which is so
different for me I wanted just a nice
wash of color all over the lips that
looked really natural just to go with
the whole angelic look we've been
creating and I did also want to add in a
little bit of shimmer to the center of
my lip so I took the highlight section
and just popped a little bit on my
fingers to the center of my lips to add
a little bit of softness which I think
really finished off the look so everyone
at the end of this makeup tutorial I
really hope you enjoyed this beautiful
soft glowy angelic look that I was
really inspired by gigi hadid so I
really hope you liked it if you did
