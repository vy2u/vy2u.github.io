today's makeup tutorial is going to be
on how to achieve this soft full neutral
makeup look to get started I'm gonna be
applying my matte natural radiance
primer all over my skin before we apply
foundation this will just hydrate my
face and also just prep it so my
foundation goes on smoothly and then I'm
taking my ax1 invisi wear foundation and
just applying it all over my skin and
just kind of dotting it everywhere and
then I'm going to be blending that into
my complexion with the Real Techniques
sculpting brush and I'm just kind of
going in circular motions and Cyborg
motions just to kind of buff this into
the skin and I want to kind of get the
most even layer as possible because we
are going to be applying concealer so we
don't really need to apply a second
layer of this so one layer will be just
fine and just making sure that the whole
of my face is covered because this is a
darker color than my face because it
matches my neck so just make sure that
it's all blended in I have gone ahead
and filled in my brows off-camera if you
do want to see how I do fill in my brows
I will pop a link in the description box
for you so you can see how I do it next
I'm just going to be taking my soft
ochre Paint Pot and just applying this
all over my eyelids to make sure that
the eyeshadow I apply sticks and appears
more vibrant
then I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette and I'm gonna be starting
off with this peachy brown shade and I'm
going to use this as my first transition
color I'm going to be taking this on a
big fluffy blending brush and I'm just
going to go side to side and make sure
this is really well blended into the
crease as always because this is my
first transition shade you want to make
sure this blends in really well to the
rest of your eye that way all the other
colors you apply will just blend it
really really seamlessly so just blend
it as much as you can
then taking this milk chocolate shade
I'm going to be applying this into the
crease also I want to very seamlessly
create a smokey effect I want it to be
very soft so graduating into a darker
color slowly that's the best way to
create that effect
so I'm just going to be applying this
into the outer V increase area and then
going back into that previous brush to
make sure that it's really well blended
into each other that way again there's
no harsh lines and that smokiness is
going to look really really effortless
and just really well blended then I'm
taking this warm brown shade and I'm
going to be applying this into the outer
corner also this will just prepare it
for the darkest Brown we're going to
apply and it just makes that dark brown
blend a lot easier and it just gives
that really nice
airbrushed effect which is what we're
going for with this look so just blend
that as well as you can also and then
we're going to go into the dark fudge
color that's just right here and we're
going to be applying that into the outer
corner with a separate brush we want to
keep this color as close to the crease
as possible
we're gonna take out too far because we
are going to blend it out a little looks
really seamless
as you can see I'm just kind of going
back and forth between brushes then I'm
just taking a q-tip and just cleaning up
the sides this will just make everything
look a ton neater
next I'm just going to be taking this
cool brown shade and I'm just going to
be applying it onto the center of my lid
this will just kind of create that
really nice shimmery effect
I'm just taking this really nice peachy
light shimmery shade and I'm just going
to be applying that on the inner part
that Brown we just applied will make it
transition a lot nicer and it'll just
make it look like it's just blending
into the rest of the eye
next I'm just going to apply some lashes
these are the Vegas nail Iowa grand
glamour lashes I absolutely love these
these are so gorgeous and you just don't
need to do anything and it just
transforms the look into such a
glamorous look so I'm just applying them
with some tweezers and just making sure
they're really well stuck on because I'm
not applying any eyeliner you want to
make sure they're stuck as close to the
lash line as possible then I'm just
taking some mascara and applying them to
my natural lashes that way they blend
into the false ones a lot better and you
can't tell where your natural lashes
start or finish next I'm going to start
on my concealer I'm applying my
Maybelline age rewind concealer
underneath my eyes and I'm kind of
taking in an upwards motion to give
myself that really nice lifted effect
I'm also applying some of this on my
forehead down the bridge of my nose and
also on my chin as always this will just
highlight these areas and really bring
them forward and this will just kind of
stroke to your face really really well
and to blend it into the rest of my
complexion I'm going to be using it the
Real Techniques sculpting brush again
this is the same brush I used to apply
my foundation and it just blends
everything so flawlessly
then I'm going in with my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush you guys know I love
this brush just to get into all the
little areas that a larger brush cannot
reach is the perfect shape my base
always looks so flawless when I use this
because it just gets into all those
little areas then I'm going to be
setting my under eyes with the soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder and I'm
taking it on a sigma f-35 brush and I'm
just making sure to set all the areas
where I applied my concealer that way it
won't budge and it also will prevent
shine also
and then I'm just taking a larger brush
and just applying it on the rest of the
areas also just to make sure that
everything is nice and set next taking a
large shader brush I'm going to take
some of that warm brown color onto the
bottom lash line this is just going to
create a really nice balanced effect
from the top and the bottom lash line
and to make it look a little bit smoky
er I'm going to take that darkest Brown
we applied and I'm going to apply that
as close to the lash line as possible so
as you can see I'm just kind of pressing
it against the lash line and this will
just kind of create a really subtle
smoky effect without it being too much
and then I'm taking this champagne color
and I'm going to apply this on my inner
corner as the highlight before that
inner area and this will just make the
eyes look so much brighter and it will
just kind of finish off the look as well
next I'm playing some nude eyeliner into
the waterline this will again just make
the eyes look larger more brighter and
it just kind of makes it look a little
bit softer then applying black if you
were to apply a black it would look a
lot heavier so this will just kind of
give it that softer effect and then I'm
just applying some mascara to my bottom
lashes to balance the top and the bottom
and that way the whole eye look is
complete and then we are ready to move
on to the bronzer
to Brunn's my skin I'm gonna be using
this shade from the Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour kit in lights and I'm just
going to use this on that big zueva
brush I always love to use I simply love
this brush and I'm just going to be
bronzing all of my face because I just
kind of feel like this look is quite
neutral and I just want to make my face
look nice and warm and because I'm gonna
be applying blusher I like to wear
bronzer and blush together because I
just feel like it looks better on my
complexion so I'm just kind of bronzing
the perimeter of my face and then I'm
gonna be going in with the form color
from that contour kit also and I'm going
to slightly contour the cheeks also and
this will just kind of give my face a
little bit more shape without it looking
too harsh
I love using this phone shade on the
nose as well because it's cool and after
contour but it is warm enough to look
normal at the same time without looking
too gray I'm just using a small blending
brush to just go around the corners of
my nose to make it look slimmer and then
I'm taking this blusher from the balm
and just applying it onto my cheeks you
guys know I rarely wear blusher but I
wanted to apply some because this is a
full look and then I'm taking my Becca
opal highlighter and just using this on
the tops of my cheekbones to give us
that glow I didn't want to apply too
much of this and this just kind of gives
us that champagne glow without being too
gold or summer so you can still look
glowing
but you're not going to look as golden
so also applying some of that on the tip
of my nose and then I'm going to be
moving on to my lips and firstly
starting off with stone lip liner from
Mac I'm just going to be running this
along the outside of my lip bone and I'm
just going to be using this to cool down
the lips before I apply the next shade
and then going to be applying a Rimmel
lip liner I'm not actually sure the
shade of this liner but as always
everything will be down in the
description box
I just wanted to combine the two colors
to create a really nice deep mode I
didn't have a lipliner that would sort
of match it so I just kind of created my
own
I love customizing lip liners I feel
like you can create such a nice touch
with that
I don't even know how to explain this
color but it's basically like a brownie
pink mauve color this is one nine nine
five from gerard cosmetics and i'm just
going to be applying this all over the
top just to warm it up a little bit i
feel like this limp is perfect for the
autumn but i did want it to be a little
bit more matte so i did set my lips with
some translucent powder this is the same
pad i used to set my under eyes so guys
this is the finished look I hope you
