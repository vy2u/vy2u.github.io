Channel today I'm going to be showing
you my very first Valentine's Day
tutorial this is just a really pretty
soft romantic look so the first step is
going to be applying my moisturizer i'm
using my moisture and fusion serum by
mac and then i'm taking my strobe cream
by mac also and applying it all over my
skin and this is just going to give us a
really pretty pearlescent glow and then
i'm just going to be taking my
foundation this is the giorgio armani
luminous silk in 6.5 and i'm just going
to be buffing that in with a rounded so
ever brush and I'm just going to be kind
of patting it into the skin and also
buffing it as well and to create a
really nice full coverage look
next I'm going to be taking my painting
paint pot by Mac and usually I like to
use soft ochre but I wanted to use this
one today because we are going to be
using pink tone colors I thought we'd go
with it pink toned base as well so I'm
just making sure that's all over the eye
and then I'm going to be taking on Naked
3 palette and the naked 3 palette is
full of nice rosy pink toned colors so
I'm just going to get started with this
very light matte color and this is
almost like a cream and I'm just going
to be applying that all over the lid to
create a nice base for us to apply our
next color and then I'm going to be
taking this other color just next to it
and it's quite shimmery so I'm going to
be wetting it with my mac fix+ and I'm
just going to be applying that all over
the lid this is a really pretty color
but it does fall out so i definitely
recommend wetting it so once I've
applied that all over the lid I'm going
to take this matte color and applying it
into my crease and this just going to
give us a little bit more definition and
what I really like about this palette is
the colors aren't too pink they are
quite pink tone so they obviously do
have that Rosie undertone but they're
not too pink in the sense that they look
really unnaturally pink and so I'm just
going to be applying that with a
blending brush into the crease and just
making sure that I'm blending that
really really well
then I'm going to take this dark and
matte color and start to apply it into
my crease with a 217 Mac brush and this
is just going to help us create a really
beautiful blend and it's just gonna make
the crease look a little bit deeper set
as well so I'm just going to apply it
more towards the outer corner then I am
on the inner corner and just making sure
that I'm blending that all together next
I'm going to be taking Mac reflex
glitter and red it's basically like a
clear glitter and it has like a red
undertone so it looks really pretty and
pink on the eye so i'm just applying
that on to the inner corner more so than
the whole lid and this just looks really
really pretty obviously this is optional
but i think it just gives it a really
nice look then I'm going to be applying
my liquid eyeliner and I'm just
basically going to be creating a really
nice feline flick and it's gonna be more
straight than usual so it's not going to
have a huge flick upwards it's going to
look a little bit more straight and the
liquid eyeliner that I'm using is the
schwing one by the bomb
next I'm going to be applying my
concealer under my eyes this is the fit
me concealer by Maybelline and I'm just
going to be buffing that in with eight
morphe brush and I'm just gonna make
sure that the under eyes and nice and
bright before I start on anything else
so I'm just making sure it's nice and
blended before we set it and then I'm
going to be taking my bare minerals well
rested concealer powder and just setting
that under the eyes and it also makes it
look nice and bright as well so it gives
us a really nice highlighted left
I'm filling them in using my whitening
lightning brow bar to go and his me
darker shade and I'm just going to be
flicking this color through my brows and
gradually building up a darker color
you
next I'm going to be flicking through my
eyebrows with a slightly lighter brow
tin and that just makes my eyebrows up a
little bit less harsh because they are
quite dark and my hair is quite dark so
it just makes it look a little bit less
harsh and then I'm just going to be
going underneath a little bit of
concealer just to make sure that it
looks nice and perfected then I'm just
going to apply my false lashes for a
really nice fluttery look and I'm just
pinching them together with a tweezer
just to make sure that they're adhered
really well to my lid next I'm going to
be applying my jumbo pencil in milk to
my waterline to give us a really nice
bright waterline lick and then I'm also
going to go underneath my eye with a
shadow and then apply some mascara to my
lashes you want to make sure that your
coating your lashes really really really
well just to make sure that there's no
white on the lashes because I find that
it does happen when you use the jumbo
pencil then I'm just going to bronze
with my Bobby Brown bronzer and golden
light and I'm just making sure to make
it nice and bronze just to give us a lot
of color rushing through our skin
then I'm taking my cabana boy blushed by
the bomb and just applying it to the
apples of my cheeks and taking a little
bit upwards as well
then i'm applying my lancome teint
miracle highlighted pan I'm just
applying that on to the very tops of my
cheeks and then i'm always up taking my
soft and gentle and applying that to my
cheekbones as well to give us a really
pretty glow and then I'm lining my lips
with saw lip pencil and this is just a
really pretty pink color I never really
go for pinks like pink isn't my first
color that I'd go for i usually tend to
go for more like a peachy nude instead
of a pink so it was nice change then I'm
taking buttercup Linux sick by Gerard
cosmetics and i also have a discount
code in the description if you guys do
want some money off the whole website
and this is the first lip option so you
can keep it like this or you can do i'm
doing now and i'm just applying that
same glitter we applied on the guys and
applying it onto the lips and then i'm
also going to be taking a clear lip
gloss and what this does is just creates
a really different dimension it just
looks really voluptuous and very very
glossy so that is the second lips option
