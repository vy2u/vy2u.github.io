today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to achieve this sparkly Christmas a
makeup look I decided to go for this
bold red lip paired with these gold
sparkly eyes and it's just so festive
and I absolutely love it so if you guys
would like to see how I achieve this
look then just keep on watching
to begin I'm priming my eyes using my
Maybelline age rewind concealer just to
cancel out all of the colors and also
just to act as a base so that all of the
eyeshadows will blend and stick
perfectly I'm just blending that in with
a brush and then I'm going to be setting
it with a powder to make sure that
doesn't move
the first eyeshadow I'm gonna be taking
is Peach Smoothie from makeup geek and
I'm gonna be taking this on a nice
fluffy blending brush and we're going to
be using this as our first transition
color this is going to make all of the
other colors blend perfectly
next taking frappe from makeup geek also
I'm just going to be applying this into
the crease as well but we are going to
be focusing this more on the outer
corner area we do want to create a
slightly upturned eye and to give us
that feline effect in a way just to turn
our eyes upwards you want to blend it
really really well just so that it
blends with the previous color be
applied
next taking this Kiko cream eyeshadow
I'm gonna be using this as a base fully
pigment we're gonna be applying onto the
lid and I'm just using my finger to Pat
this onto the lid area and then we are
going to be taking a pigment this one is
from makeup geek gets cooled but they
wish I think and I am gonna be applying
this really flat synthetic brush and
just patting it on top of that cream
eyeshadow this is kind of like a rose
gold shade in some lights it looks rose
and in some lies it looks more golden I
just thought this was such a lovely
color and then I'm gonna be taking this
polka bear shade which you guys know I
love this eyeshadow it's a really pretty
red turned brown and I'm just gonna be
applying this into the outer corner or
so and dragging it inwards slightly just
to blend into the rest of the colors
really nicely and then I'm going back
and forth between brushes just to make
sure that everything blends really
nicely and you do want to apply this
eyeshadow quite a lot so that it does
appear quite pigmented on the outer
corner that way any eyeshadows you apply
on top it will still look nice and red
and you'll see that color peeking
through really nicely
next taking americano it's a really nice
move toned brown and I'm going to be
applying this into the outer corner as
well I'm gonna be building this up
gradually to create a nice soft smokey
effect on the outer corner of our eye
and again this is gonna make our eyes
turn upwards
I have also gone ahead and applied a
little bit of a matte black eyeshadow as
well just because I did feel like it
needed a little bit of extra smokiness
but you can totally skip this step if
you want to go for more of a softer more
natural smoky eye if you really don't
want the look to be too intense you can
skip the black just decided I wanted
this look to be a little bit more smoky
so I decided to go for some black and
just applied it in that same outer V
area so I'm just taking makeup wipe and
cleaning up these sides of my eyes to
make it look nice and straight and again
this will lift the eyes upwards
perfectly for my eyeliner I decided to
go for a winged liner I'm not going for
anything too thick so first of all I'm
just lining the top lashline and just
creating a nice straight line on the
upper lid and then I'm gonna be creating
a flick on the outer corner and just
connecting all the lines together
next I'm just gonna be taking some of
this gold glitter liner from next and
I'm gonna be applying it all over the
lid area rights where we applied that
pigment and this is gonna give it the
most beautiful Christmassy gold you're
just gonna look like you have a
Christmas ornament on your eyelids and
that's exactly what we want you can skip
this step if you don't like anything too
sparkly but for me I personally feel
like glitter just makes everything ten
times more Christmassy so you can
totally go ahead and skip this if that's
not the way that you like to roll I'm
going ahead and applying some lashes too
because I just feel like it complements
the look of beautifully these are the
eyelet one two six lashes and I'm just
applying these with some tweezers and
then I am going to be applying some
mascara to just to apply on to the
lashes - I don't usually do this but the
lashes were fairly natural they were on
the more natural sides I just wanted to
give them a little bit extra volume
for my skin I'm taking the natural
radiance primer from Mac just to give my
skin a bit of extra hydration and just
to really plump up the skin before we
apply any foundation the foundation I'm
applying today is the L'Oreal infallible
24 hour liquid and I really like this
foundation and I'm just blending it in
with a makeup geek buffing brush and I
just love the way this foundation looks
whenever I apply I just realize how good
it really is because my skin just looks
so flawless afterwards it dries to a
matte finish so I do feel like it's a
really good for a nice long day for my
concealer I am taking the Rimmel wake me
up concealer and I absolutely love this
concealer it's in a super bright color
so it's really gonna wake up the
under-eye area by I'm going to be
applying it on the areas I would like to
highlight also so I'm gonna be applying
it onto my forehead the bridge of my
nose and my chin also I'm gonna be
blending that in with another makeup
geek buffing brush this one is a
slightly smaller brush and it's a little
bit bad for concealer
as always you know that I love to use
either my finger or my 3d HD precision
brush from Sigma and you know I had to
do it went ahead and use my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush to get into all those
little areas that are a little bit
harder to reach I am gonna be setting my
powder as well I am using the soap &amp;amp;
Glory instant retouch powder because
there is just none other like this I'm
aware that this actually isn't available
in the US yet but if it does you need to
get it all of the people in the UK need
to get this powder because I just
haven't tried a powder like this it's
really really good so I'm just using
that to set all of the areas I applied
that concealer
for my brows at the moment as you may
have already been able to tell my brows
are growing out at the moment because I
am trying to film a tutorial of how I do
my eyebrows so I've kind of let them
grow out so I did want to go for just a
really natural look so I'm just flicking
all of my brow hairs through with a
clear brow gel and then because my brows
are quite a full shape at the moment I'm
just gonna sculpt out the shape a little
bit with my brows and just fill in any
sparse areas but apart from that I
wanted to keep my brows really natural
I've been liking that really natural
brow look recently for my eyes I am
gonna be taking a black kohl pencil this
is the Rimmel scandaleyes one I applied
that in the waterline and now I'm just
applying it onto my bottom lash line to
really give me some smokiness
I really want to soften this I'm taking
some of that coke about eyeshadow and
just applying it and just really
softening up that eyeliner
I just wanted to make sure that black
did stay quite intense but I wanted to
smudge out the edges so I did go back
into that eyeliner and then back into a
bigger blending brush to make sure
everything looks nice and soft and then
to finish everything off I'm just
applying some mascara and the eye look
is complete oh and to top things off I
did decide to apply a little bit of a
highlight color on the inner corner of
my eyes too just to make my eyes really
pop for my bronzer I am taking this elf
bronzer duo and just applying this all
over the outer perimeter of my skin just
to give me a healthy glow all over I
didn't want to go for any contouring
today I actually haven't been into
contouring too much lately
I just took a little bit of this on to a
contour brush and just took it into the
contours of my face but that's it and
then it also applied some blusher this
is the warm sole blush from Mac and I'm
just applying this onto my cheeks and
just pushing upwards to my temples just
to give me a really nice glow and then
to add a super glow I hope they give me
a Nastasia so Hollywood highlighter and
just applying this onto the high points
of my cheekbones and this will just give
me a super gorgeous glow and I feel like
the Christmas you want to go for a good
I mean come on and then to make this
totally festive I decided to go for a
nice cherry lip and I'm using cherry lip
liner from Mac for that and I'm just
lining my lips with this and this is
just the most perfect cherry red ever my
favorite red lip liner by far
and then to fill in I am taking the NYX
soft matte lip cream in this red shade
and I will find out the name and I'll
leave it down below with all of the
other products as always but I do want
it to be a little bit darker than this
so I did take a little bit of copenhagen
NYX soft matte lip cream as well just to
deepen it a little bit and you can
totally add a gloss on top of this if
you'd like but I decided to go for a
matte lip because that's just my
favorite type of lip ever I love a matte
lip and but this would look amazing
glossy as well so guys that is the end
of this makeup look I hope that you
