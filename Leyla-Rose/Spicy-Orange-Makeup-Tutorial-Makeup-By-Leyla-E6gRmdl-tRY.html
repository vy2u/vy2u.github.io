channel today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to achieve this spicy orange
makeup tutorial this really reminds me
of like pumpkin spice like if pumpkin
spice was a makeup look I think it would
remind me of this if you do want to see
how I achieved this autumn for makeup
tutorial then just keep on watching
so to get started I am taking this serum
from the body shop this is the vitamin E
one and I just applied it all over my
skin before foundation for my foundation
today I'm taking the Bourjois healthy
mix foundation and mixed together two
shades because I do find that I can
create a better custom color to my skin
turn a lot easier this way I blended
that in with a brush from ELF
moving on to eyes I am taking the Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm just gonna
be applying it all over with my finger
just because I really want to achieve a
nice evened out eyelid so we can apply
the eyeshadow on top and then taking
makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow I'm
just applying this with a blending brush
into the crease just to act as the first
transition shade so that every color
will blend really evenly after it next
taking rule eyeshadow from Mac I'm gonna
be applying this next to really warm up
the crease I'm just using this on the
same brush and just building up this
color gradually I really want to create
a nice orange toned crease taking makeup
geek Coco bear I'm just gonna be
applying this with a separate blending
brush into the crease and instead of
creating a V on the outer corner like we
usually would I'm just gonna be applying
this into the crease only and just
dragging it outwards towards the tail of
my brow this will create a soft cut
crease effect
and next taking this nyx po mania
pigment i'm just going to be applying
this all over the eyelid I really wanted
to go for a really nice orange turn on
the lid as well instead of going for a
different tone to the crease I wanted to
go for an orange as well so I just
applied that all over the lid with a
flat brush and then to add a hint of
glitter I applied this glitter from NYX
this is just a gold glitter and I'm
flying it on to the inner corner of my
top lid only
I had already applied some lashes these
are some really long lashes that get
longer towards the end so you can
totally add whatever lashes you like but
I went for some super dramatic ones for
my concealer I am mixing two concealers
together first of all taking the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm just
applying this under my eyes only and
because I'm quite fair at the moment
compared to what I usually am this is
probably the lightest shade I go I just
wanted to apply a little bit of a
lighter concealer just to brighten up
the areas I want to bring forward I'm
applying this onto my under eyes
forehead nose and my chin as well and
then I'm just blending that in with a
more Fiji - brush I believe I think it's
a g2 brush but I'm just blending that in
and just making sure that it looks
really nice and seamless I love this
brush I've mentioned this brush before
and I just love the way it blends in my
concealer
to highlight my under eyes I am taking
Mac emphasize highlighting powder and
I'm just using this only under eyes only
because I'm gonna be sitting the rest of
the face with a separate powder so I'm
just taking this on a sigma f-35 brush
and just getting it right underneath my
eyes to make sure that my concealer
doesn't crease and then taking the same
powder I use in every single video this
is the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder and I'm just using this to set
all other areas to make sure they don't
move either for my brows today I'm using
again the same product I always like to
use this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow Wiz and I like to use the color
dark brown and then I am also gonna be
taking the clear brow gel just to set my
brows into place - I do have a full brow
video that I have made so I will link
that down below if you do want to see a
full tutorial on it
next stick in this gel eyeliner from
maybelline I'm gonna be applying this on
to the waterline of my eye and also onto
the bottom lash line too and taking it
on this flat I brush and I really like
the shape of this brush for the
waterline I've actually never tried this
brush for this area of my eye but
actually really like it was really easy
to apply and I'm also gonna be just
taking it below my bottom lash line too
and then I'm gonna be smudging that out
with some more of that Coco bear
eyeshadow we apply it in the crease and
this is really gonna smoke out that
bottom lash line and I really want to
create like a really diffused bottom
lash lines I'm first taking you on a
smaller brush and then taking it on a
big fluffy brush this is the one we used
in the crease and just making sure to
really blend out any harsh lines on that
bottom lash line and then to top
everything off I'm just taking some
mascara and applying it to my bottom
lash line to balance the top and bottom
lashes and also just to finish off the
whole dog she bronzed my skin because
let's face it I really need it today I'm
really looking pale I'm applying that on
to the outer perimeter of my face this
will just give me a nice natural bronzed
look instead of looking like I've made
my foundation color totally different to
the rest of my face this will just give
us a hint of color and make us look
darker without it being too obvious and
I absolutely love this technique just
applying it all around the outer
perimeter just gives you that healthy
golden glow to highlight I'm taking some
of the Anastasio so Hollywood
highlighter and then just applying it
onto my cheekbones for the lips I
decided to show you guys two lip options
the main lip option is this one that I'm
trying right now it's basically just a
lip liner all over the lips
it's nutmeg lip liner from next and I
just applied it all over the lips I lied
my lips and then I also filled in my
lips with this also I really love the
way this looks but it's not my type of
lip color like I very rarely wear colors
like this I wanted to show you guys a
different lip color too so this is what
it looks like with the darker lip liner
I actually really like how it looks with
this dark lip liner but it's just not a
lip liner I'd wear a lot myself this is
the other lip option I applied Aphrodite
liquid lipstick from Gerard cosmetics on
top and I totally prefer this
this is definitely more of a lip color
that I prefer I definitely love it a lot
more so I just wanted to show you guys
what it look like with this as well
I hope that you guys really enjoyed this
video if you did then please like it for
me and subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already I love you guys so much
thank you all for watching and I will
see you all in my next video bye guys
mwah hey everyone and welcome back to my
channel today I wanted to do with you a
quick video on something that I don't
think I've seen many British people do
before like makeup in the UK is a lot
more expensive I thought there's a lot
less you can find for under 5 pounds in
the UK many people that I watch always
do these videos and I love watching them
but I always find that there aren't many
UK ones so I'm just gonna tell you guys
my top 5 favourite products that you can
get in the UK for under 5 pounds if you
are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
