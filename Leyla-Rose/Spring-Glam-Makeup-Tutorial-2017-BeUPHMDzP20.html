so today I'm back with another makeup
tutorial and this one is a spring one
and I'm really excited because I've used
some like a pinky and loeb shades and I
just think it looks really really nice
in my opinion this is quite for me but
it's not too overly springy where people
will look at you and be like you're
trying to be too bring on you want to do
more spring tutorials and also summer as
we approach summer so let me know down
below what colors you want me to use
what types of makeup looks you want to
see if you want to see some natural ones
if you want to see more dramatic ones
like this let me know and I will
definitely do them for you by the way if
you've noticed I'm filming in my bedroom
today just because I don't know it felt
like changing up I've been doing up my
bedroom but yeah if you haven't
subscribed to my channel yet please make
sure you do and continue the clums up as
well and let's get on into this makeup
tutorial let's go alright you guys so
I'm first of all starting off with a
clean face with a bit of moisturizer on
it and my eyebrows on
I will leave an eyebrow tutorial down
below if you want to watch how I got my
eyebrows like this I'm putting on some
of the glam glow glowing moisturizer
just to use as a under Preiser
I like to use a lot of primers on my
skin and it really helps my face to look
nice and flawless so I definitely
recommend doing this if you find that
your face gets quite cakey to add a
little bit more moisturization into my
skin and a bit of a glow I'm using be
laura geller
tinted spackle primer and is using that
all over also and then I'm going in with
a little bit of my Porefessional from
Benefit and just using it on the areas
that get a little bit bumpy and again I
recommend this if you have textured skin
but also get dry skin at the same time
that is me so I'm just losing a little
bit that on it mainly the center of my
face and I'm going in with my Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless I'm just
taking that all over my skin and just
blending that in with a Beauty Blender I
have missed this foundation I use it all
the time and in day to day life this
week I haven't been using it and I'm
just when I use this all like oh my gosh
I miss the foundation so much so
whenever I stop using it for like a few
days I realized how much I missed it so
just blended that in with the Beauty
Blender and then we're going to be
moving on to the eyes once that's all
blended in for my eyes I'm taking a
little bit of concealer and I'm applying
it onto the tops of my lid
is going to act as our eye primer you
can use an actual tinted eye primer for
this but I like to use concealer just
because I saw that it works just the
same and I'm going to make sure to set
that into place as well because you
don't increasing all over the place
before my eye shadow I'm going to be
taking the meet met adore palette from
the balm and I'm using this shade first
of all I believe this palette is brand
new and I don't think it's got to be out
yet I'm not entirely sure but this is
the newest one I just used that first
shade to use as my first transition
color it didn't really show up on my
skin that much but then I went in with
this shade right here and then I did
that into the deep part of my crease I
added a little bit of the color that was
just the right of this to add a bit of
peach eNOS and that acted as a really
nice color for my crease then I went in
with this brown shade and bear in mind
that all of these are matte colors in
this palette which is why it called the
matte palette and I'm just taking that
on the outer corner of my eye now what I
really want to create with this is a
really nice elongated eye so what I'm
doing is applying on the outer corner
but also applying it slightly onto the
outer half of my lid as well and making
sure to really blend them out and then
finally I'm taking some of this Doc sort
of like an off black shade and just
using a little of this to add a bit more
depth into that crease area this makes
it look a little bit more smoky and
dramatic so you can leave this out if
you want it to look a little bit lighter
on the eyelid but you do want to make
sure to blend this out if you are using
that black shade for my eyelid I'm
taking this loose pigment foiled
eyeshadow from makeup geek and using it
on my lid it's in this really pretty
almost like a peachy pink shade which I
really think is really nice
the spring and then I just applied that
on to the inner half of my eyelid and
then just applied a lot of concealer
underneath this is in a little bit of a
weird order just because I found that
applying some concealer underneath my
eyes is just going to clean everything
up so that I could finish off the rest
of my eyes I know it's in a bit of a
weird weird order so don't mind that now
you just blended that out with my Beauty
Blender and I'm just using the edge of
my Beauty Blender to create a really
nice sharp line on the outer corner and
this just makes my eyes really elongated
of course I'm making sure to set my
concealer so it doesn't crease or budge
and it stays in place and I'm using my
soap &amp;amp; Glory in
retouch powder to do that because it's
one of my favorites I'm taking another
one of the makeup geek forward pigment
and just using that on the inner corner
of my eyes really brighten this area and
again it's slightly pinky gold color so
I really wanted to stick with that theme
just to brighten that inner corner and
now I'm using the NYX epic liner pen for
my wing and this is one of my new
favorite eyeliners I love it I just went
for a standard wing I did kind of go for
a little bit of a straighter wing that
was quite long just because it was what
I was feeling in that moment you can go
for whatever I learned her style like
but I just wanted to go for something
that would really elongate my eyes
because that's the look that I was going
for applying some lashes now and then
want to apply my lashes I'm going to be
applying some mascara just to make them
blend in really really nicely to the
false lashes and I find that doing this
afterwards just looks a lot more
seamless than doing the mascara first I
personally prefer this way to finish off
the eyes I'm just taking some of that
brown eye shadow entity only very bottom
lash line and a little bit of the black
eye shadow right up close to the lashes
and then applying some mascara to finish
off the look I also applied some nude
eyeliner into the waterline but I don't
know what happened to that clip it was
covered by my how it so sorry about that
but I just applied that and then I'm
going to be moving on to the rest of my
face I just applied some bronzer and
some highlight nothing too crazy I
wanted to keep the skin really fresh and
nothing too much on the skin and then
for my lips I wanted to go for something
really really nice and possibly pink I
didn't want to go for anything to move
this time because it's kind of what I go
for all the time so I went for a capital
e pink shade which would be perfect for
springtime but is totally still wearable
as well so guys at the end of this
makeup tutorial I really hope you
