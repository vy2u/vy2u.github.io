channel today's makeup tutorial is going
to be on strobing if you guys have been
on YouTube Instagram or any social media
recently you guys would have seen it
strobing everywhere strobing is actually
just intense highlighting just without
contour and today I wanted to show you
guys a way to highlight and strobe your
face without it being too oily
so first of all we're gonna start with
some primer I'm taking the natural
radiance primer from Mac this is a
primer that I know is definitely gonna
work for me because it hydrates my skin
it smooths my skin so that my foundation
goes on a lot nicer and it also makes my
skin look more radiant then I'm gonna be
taking my favorite foundation mixed in
with a little bit of a lighter
foundation just to create a little bit
of a more watery consistency I've mixed
the Laura Mercier still cream foundation
and the dream satin liquid foundation
from Maybelline this is in my perfect
shade so it's exactly the color that I
am at the moment so this works really
well and I'm just buffing the inner to
my skin with a real techniques sculpting
brush and I'm just wanting to create a
nice even coverage and the thing to go
for when you have an oily a skin type is
to go for a matte finish a foundation or
a foundation that you know is gonna last
on you don't just switch to a super
glowy foundation just because you want
to stroke your skin if you do want to
highlight a lot you can still go for
your normal map base and then we're
gonna start to create that highlighted
effect with other products then I'm
going to start to highlight under my
eyes and I'm gonna be using the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm using
this to just highlight these areas and
to also conceal my dark circles I'm also
gonna use this to highlight my forehead
at the bridge of my nose and also my
chin
and then to blend that all in I'm going
to be using the same brush I use to
blend in my foundation I'm also going to
use my fingers for some parts of this
just to get into all the little areas
that my brush can't reach
so once you've blended everything in
don't be afraid to set your face people
with oily skin know if they don't set
their foundation it is going to move so
I'm gonna be taking my normal powder
that I know is going to work for me it's
a light translucent powder and it's not
gonna look too heavy I'm gonna use this
on the areas that I know get really oily
and that's my forehead and also at the
bridge of my nose my chin and also under
my eyes so it's kind of in the center of
my face and also under my eyes to stop
it from creasing
next I'm going to be taking a glittery
eye primer and this one is from Kiko
this is just gonna give us a really nice
pop of shimmer on our lid and this is
gonna make the look but really nice
together because we've got so much
shimmer going on on our cheeks it'll be
really nice to kind of complement that
and apply that onto the eyes as well
then I'm just gonna take a little bit of
Mac vanilla pigment and just apply that
on top just to set it and to finish it
off as well they are both a very similar
color and then because I thought that it
needed a bit of a contrast I just took a
little bit of bronzer and just applied
it to a small brush and I'm just
applying this into the crease area and
just kind of fluffing it upwards I don't
want anything too harsh I just want
something to sculpt my eye a little bit
next I'm gonna be applying some mascara
today I am going to skip before slashes
but you can of course go for any mascara
or eye look that you want to this is
just something that I thought would
complement this look really nicely
because I wanted it to be all about the
skin I just wanted to apply some mascara
and make my lashes look nice and long
but also natural at the same time
next we're gonna get started on
highlighting our skin this is a cream
color base from Mac but it is a limited
edition color they do lots of cream
color bases that are in their permanent
line I just wanted to show you guys some
alternatives if you don't own this color
the BB + illuminator from Gerard
cosmetics is a very similar tone and so
is Sunbeam from benefit so if you don't
have this one then you can go for these
two colors but today I wanted to use a
cream I don't own lots of cream
highlighters so I was kind of limited to
which one I was going to pick so I'm
just using this on my finger and just
applying it onto the tops of my
cheekbones
and I'm also gonna be kind of patting it
into the skin so the cream color bases
are really nice from Mac they don't move
and they are really good for your skin
and because I wanted to use a cream you
can use any type of color that's gonna
match your skin tone this one just has a
slight gold undertone by applying it
onto all the areas I wants to bring
forward above my eyebrow and the tip of
my nose my cheekbones any area that I
feel like I want to make look nice and
glowy then I'm gonna take my powder
highlighter this is the Laura Geller
gilded honey highlighter this just
intensifies things so much more the
cream highlights that we put underneath
this just makes everything look a lot
brighter and makes it pop a lot more and
applying it with our finger just means
we can pass on as much as we need to
gradually so everywhere we put the cream
product I'm patting on top of there's
some powder product
next I'm going to apply some blush I am
NOT a huge blush person but a lot of
people tend to apply blush when they are
strobing I'm applying a little bit of
super orgasm blush from NARS just
applying it in an upwards motion to
create the illusion of a lifted cheek
and then I wanted to apply a tiny little
bit of bronzer please forgive me because
I do really need it I'm quite pale at
the moment and I just wanted to use it
not to contour but just to apply a
little bit of a bronzed effect onto my
skin so forgive me if I just buff that
into my skin to make myself look a
little bit darker and then I'm just
applying some more of that laura geller
highlights on to the inner corners of my
eye
I'm also gonna be applying some of that
mascara onto my bottom lash lines and
I'm also gonna be applying a nude
eyeliner into my waterline this is just
gonna make our eyes look nice and open
and we're just gonna finish off the eye
look and make our eyes look a lot more
bright which is exactly what we want for
this kind of look
as you can see guys my eyebrows need a
little doing so I'm gonna be doing them
off-camera and then I'm taking that
laura geller highlighter again and just
applying that onto my brow bone if you
guys do want to see my brow tutorial by
the way I will link my brow tutorial in
the description box for you guys and
then for the lips I'm going to finish
off with the mac mineralize and lipstick
in pure pout
it's just a really nice soft lipstick I
didn't want to go for anything too crazy
because I thought this would be really
nice to just add a little bit of a
simple touch to the lips and I just
wanted to gloss things up a little bit
just applying a matte crushed glass onto
my lips and then finishing off my face
with some mac fix+ to add a little bit
of glow and to sit the skin and make it
all look really nice and glowy so guys
