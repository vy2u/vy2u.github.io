do when I wake up pretty much is go
straight onto my phone I wake up at
about a half eight so I have some time
to kill and I like to go through my
Instagram and just alike away
I love inspo pics and just liking quotes
and stuff like that
I love reading stuff that will make me
feel more positive about the day so I
like to do that and also don't forget to
follow me on Instagram if you haven't
already because I love Instagram I also
go onto Twitter a lot as well because
it's my favorite platform to chat to you
guys it's very easy to reply and
favorite and just make sure that I am
seeing everything you guys are sending
me see if you want to keep in touch and
definitely recommend following me on
Twitter as I like to chat with you guys
a lot on there and yeah all my social
media is makeup by later so I'm very
easy to find and another favorite
platform of mine is also snapchat I love
to catch up with what everyone was up to
whilst I was sleeping
and also I don't know if anyone else is
like this but I like to watch my own
story from the day before I don't know I
don't
else we watch their story so now that
I've been on my phone for a little while
it's time to stretch and get up I'd like
to make my bed in the morning as many
days as I can I feel like it's really
important to make your bed because it
just makes everything feel a lot more
organized makes you fall up more put
together and it just makes everything go
a lot more smooth
yes I'd like to make sure I'm doing that
now I like to put on my dressing-gown
and go and get some breakfast because I
am a type to not miss breakfast
whatsoever so breakfast is my favorite
meal of the whole day so I'm very
excited around this time and especially
in the summer I really love to have
lemon iced water it's so refreshing so I
like to carve some lemons have some ice
and some cold water and put it all
together into a glass and it's my
favorite beverage to have in the summer
time
so for breakfast I like to have a really
nice-sized meal because like I said it's
my favorite and it does give you the
energy for the day so I like to have a
mixture of bananas and strawberries
because they're my favourite fruit and
for the kabhi part of my meal I love to
have white bread with reduced sugar jam
on top
I know white bread isn't the best for
you and it's a little bit more
artificial than brown bread but I love
white bread it's a little bit of a bad
habit of mine so that's probably the
least healthy as part of my breakfast
but I love it so I kind of still like to
have it every now and again I am
currently weighing all the food that I
eat on a daily basis because I need to
make sure I'm getting enough macros for
my diet
I'm currently bulking so that means I
need to be eating enough of every single
part of my meals so that means I need to
be having enough carbs and our protein
and our fats to build muscle basically
so it's a little bit of extra time but
it means I'm gonna make some gains
when I eat I like to do something as I
do eat so I'm kind of just going through
my videos and just seeing who's uploaded
so I'm just watching a little bit of
Josh's video and also a little bit of
Sabrina's video as well I love her
channel I'll link it down below and this
is also the time where I might do a
little bit of work just because I feel
like this is when I can be the most
productive so before I do anything else
I'm going to make sure I brush my teeth
and wash my face and I like to do this
after I eat personally just because I
like to get all of the food taste out of
my mouth
and then of course wash my face before I
do anything else for the day
okay guys so it's time to go to the gym
and I'm really excited because going to
the gym is one of my favorite things to
do in the morning I like to go afternoon
time for the rest of the year but when
it gets to summer I like to enjoy it
more of the day I usually tend to go to
the gym on my own but because josh was
free this day we decided to go together
and he's my favorite workout buddy so
yeah let's go to the gym
I can never ever find the right words
there's no way this is real life there's
no telling you're the right girl so I
can only say that it feels right
say that it feels right
s'alright s'alright s'alright I'm just
going with the guy never had a doubt
right like this is just the was for me
in perspective I'm the deepest in the
card everybody tune in one this is just
for us now we know I ain't gonna hear no
oh no I don't call them back girl let me
see you hold it down we gonna have a
blast I just want to know what you're
gonna do with all of that ain't gotta
say a word I know so you can have it all
watch me live it up I'll admit it you
got me feeling has enough people when
it's going down know that we gonna live
it up young shot I wanna know that you

I can never ever find the right words
there's no way this is real life there's
no telling you're the right
so I can say they feel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
