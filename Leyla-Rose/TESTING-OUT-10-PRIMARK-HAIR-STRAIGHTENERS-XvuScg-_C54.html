so today I'm going to be doing another
testing product and video and I'm so
excited to do this because I just
haven't found any products lately that
I've wanted to try and then when I heard
of this I was so down for it
for today's video we're going to be
testing a hair product which I've never
done on my channel before and I'm going
to be testing at the Primark hair
straighteners that are ten pounds what I
saw Emily Canham
try this out on her channel I haven't
really seen anyone else try these
because I believe they're quite new but
these are basically 45 watt
straighteners that go all the way from
80 degrees Celsius to 210 degrees
Celsius now I believe my PhD to try to
use go up to 230 degrees Celsius so not
far off at all and these are only ten
pounds like I just don't think you can
beat that so actually not sure how well
these are going to work because if you
guys don't know I have super curly hair
so I thought we would cut this to the
ultimate test to see how it works on
thick curly frizzy hair because yeah I
just thought would be useful to see how
it works out so thank you to Emily for
giving me the ideas for this video if
you want to check out her video I'll
leave it down below my hair is currently
super greasy so I'm actually gonna wash
it and dry it fresh to you by so that
you know I haven't done anything
previously to it I'm just what you're
gonna wash it dry it how I normally do
when I dry my hair I rough dry it but
brush through it as I do it so subscribe
if you're new to my channel if you want
to see more testing out videos because I
am planning to do a lot more in the
future and yeah
let's get on into this testing video
because I am so excited to unbox this so
guys as you can see I have a lot of hair
with a lot of texture so this is going
to be a real test for sure reason why
the texture doesn't look Chloe's because
as I dry it I run my turns and Caeser
through it and I just sort of run it
through my hair as I do it so that way
it just looks a little bit straighter
that is how I do my drying every single
time I straighten my hair so I want to
make it as fair as possible I don't
wanna leave my hair all curly and then
to attempt to do it with the
straightener because I would do that
anyway
so so I think everywhere should be dry
now I'm pretty sure so what I'm going to
do now is section my hair they probably
live throughout the whole of my hair I
probably section it into about five or
six sections and though some people
would be do less than that I feel amount
of hair I normally take so obviously I
am comparing these two pretty much my
ghd's because that is all I use so yeah
I'm just going to do it as I would
normally and see if it can take it so
now that we've got our hair sectioned
let's open this up and see what it's
like inside so inside this box we have
straight nerves and looks like we have a
manual or instructions yes so we just
have instructions that seem to be in I
think looks like German Oh
signe this German instruction to the
tiny little leaflet that's it English
just has a sound everything on but I'm
pretty sure we can watch this out okay
usually takes about 25 minutes to
straighten and sometimes I can do it
quicker than that depends on how far I'm
being and this will really lightweight
quite good for traveling I'd probably
say like this is probably a really good
thing to travel with if they work of
course the biggest difference is
probably the fact that these are the
skinny ones which I know that you can
get but my ones the ones I use of the
white one so it gets more hair which is
better for my hair type okay so I've got
it here it flashes up blue so I'm going
to put the temperature up pretty much so
on it's not turning on this leg
literally isn't turning on it just says
off I don't know what to do though well
it's such a hold it down hold it down
and then you go up to be like my one I
did that though I swear over an
afternoon I was laughing
apart from that little miniature fail
that we had we can move all which is
really good so thank you thinking the
way that I usually tend to straighten my
hair is take a section this would
usually be an okay section in my last
straighteners I'm going to have it for
the first one just because they are
small arms and I'm just not sure so I'm
taking a section that is about that size
compared to my palm and then what I
usually do is put my brush through it
hold it like that
and then I brush it through as I
straighten it so it has I believe heated
up so hot and we are about to try this
for the first time so this is how I
always always always around my hair so I
just want to treat it as normal business
as I would normally do oh that is pretty
damn good for the first time I do feel
like my hair still looks a little bit
poofy which I kind of thought would
happen to be honest because I don't know
my head could just be like that
sometimes and it's just used to the hair
straighteners I use so I'm asked to go
over a few times but yeah I think it
looks good I'm actually really really
impressed with that the one thing I do
have to say a little bit because they're
so glide II like they glide so much I do
feel like a little bit it's a bit poofy
because it's not really getting deep
within the hair so apart from that
though I'm really really happy with this
and I really like the way that this
looks so it's hard to tell with just one
section so we're going to go through the
whole head now I'm pretty much just
going to go through everything and then
when I get to the top section I'm going
to carry on talking to you guys so that
we can have a chat with have fun
experience I am going to be timing how
long this takes me because it usually
takes me about 25 minutes with my normal
straightness so I'm going to start to
time this now because I'm not going to
be talking or anything I'm just going to
do it straight and we'll see how long
this takes so I'm going to start the
timer now
all right guys so I'm on to my very last
section on this side and honestly like I
don't really know how I feel about this
to be honest I feel like it's very um
like a core bit of like mixed emotions
about it I think is extremely good for
the price I'm sort of had to go over my
hair to try and get this to look Dee
Fritz is a lot now I know you guys
probably thinking there but your hair is
so so so frizzy it is so so frizzy but
with other statements that I use I can
do this whole routine and it looks so
straight and people don't even know I
have curly hair like they know I have
like thick hair but they probably
wouldn't know how actual like the
colours I actually have so quite
experienced with doing my own hair and
this has been an interesting experience
but I'm just going to finish this last
section and then I'll tell you guys what
I really think of this straightener
pretty much like around 40 minutes to do
my hair and it looks not all that great
like is it straight yes it is straight
is it shiny not it's not shiny it still
has the texture for is in there whereas
where where I usually do my hair usually
it just has a really nice shine to it
because I've been brushing it through as
I've been doing it so if I wasn't
washing it through with everything
straightening it would have been even
worse than their so I think it's totally
not suitable for a hair type like mine
but for me when I straighten my hair I
want it to go pin straight because if I
was to go out now and it was humid
weather it would puff up even more than
this so I would want it to be a sleek
straight the moment that I straighten it
and then it gets a little bit humid or
there's any moisture in the air at least
then you know if my hair pops up it will
only puff up a little bit but it's kind
of already looking a little bit puffy as
it is so it's not the greatest time out
by it's better than I expected because
one it's only ten pounds and two it is
really small for someone that would use
this as their primary straightener it
would definitely have to be for someone
with probably someone with not as much
hair as me because I got light hair this
if he did have a lot of hair than I
would say that it would be better if you
didn't have a naturally curly texture
because because it's so smooth it's like
it solid grip on and it's really hard to
really pull straight it was quite hot so
that's really good it definitely keeps
true to their promises on the
temperature and I would just say that if
I was to use this again which I probably
will it's going to be one that I keep
probably in my bedroom just to top-up
but if my hair is already straight and I
want to top-up it can do it but it's not
going to be super super sleek and it's
still going to have some of that texture
within it because my hair not every
single source strand of my hair is
totally done like I said before if you
guys want me to try the 2m1
straightener and coal which I probably
use to call my head and let me know
because this is also ten pounds and it
would be cool to try that so definitely
let me know down below in the comments
and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel already because I've got a few
products coming that I'm going to be
testing on this channel and yeah I hope
