channel so today I'm going to be testing
out a foundation and I don't think I've
done this in a really long time
I recently done the testing Primark hair
straighteners and you guys really liked
that video so I decided to do another
testing video today today we're going to
be trying the Elizabeth Arden a flawless
finish mousse makeup and this basically
applies like fun and I saw many anyway
do this and when I saw it on his channel
I was so intrigued so I really wanted to
try it
I'll leave his channel down below
because animotion really intrigued to
try this this product out on my own
so when I was watching I was like right
I'm gonna watch any more book if I don't
to see what he thinks about everything I
didn't I didn't want his opinion to
change my opinions basically so when I
purchased this I have no idea what mani
thought of it or like literally anyone's
opinion I really don't know all I know
about this that it's kind of like like
coverage and it goes on basically like
shaving foam at the first time and you
might be missing my reaction and then
I'm also going to come back in a few
hours to see how it wears as well so if
you guys interested in these kind of
videos be sure to give this a big thumbs
up so as you guys enjoy them and
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and let me know down the
comments if there's anything else you
guys want me to try their foundations or
just general makeup products you want me
to do these kind of reviews on let me
know and without further ado let's test
the Elizabeth Arden force finish mousse
foam foundation miss cold okay guys so I
have absolutely nothing on my skin I
haven't even moisturized here I thought
I would do everything on camera so just
totally clean skin and as you can see I
do have a few blemishes right now so I
think it will be a good test to see how
this covers now the foundation is
actually called the flawless finish
mousse makeup now of course it comes out
like a foam but it says it's the normal
skin and natural coverage with the
translucent finish makeup so flawless so
natural it looks like your own skin
this light airy cloud of color covers
just enough to let the skin breathe and
yes but it looks really interesting and
I'm just really excited so the color I
have is in beige 40 which
I purposely didn't tan today because I
ordered this online and I hate making
vivacious out online because I just
always get it wrong I didn't want to buy
multiple of these just in case I didn't
like it and then it was a waste I've
already watched this on my hand I can
tell there's going to be too light so
I'm gonna have to bronze quite a bit
also just going to mention that in this
video the live may go up and down it's a
really kind of like sunny day but there
are clouds so when the Sun goes in and
out it really affects this wind notice
behind me and this was only self I could
use today so I do pull the drives it's a
little bit like this like it gets
brighter and darker but come a little
bit closer and I'm just going to be
prepping my skin as I normally would for
foundation just moisturizing which I
always do before I start my makeup so
just applying a set amount of
moisturizer to my skin and aren't you
running out of this moisturizer and I
need for my moisturizing primer I'm
taking the Stila aqua glow perfecting
primer stick and then just applying this
onto the skin this is new for me and I
absolutely love this primer it just
feels like water on your skin is so good
and to finish off I'm just taking some
of the Too Faced primed and pour the
skin smoothing primer and I like to put
this only on the areas that need it so
just it's almost forehead where it can
get a little bit bumpy on my nose and
then on my cheeks and chin so kind of
just focusing that on the center of my
face definitely put so much of that has
to be so my face is prepped and primed
so now really what I would do if I was
normally doing my foundation is
color-correct these blemishes because I
want you guys to see actually the
coverage I'm going to leave the color
correcting todaywe're thing about this
foundation it's pretty much the fact
that it's in an aerosol can the same
kind of thing you would get like shaving
cream or something pump it up into my
hands and now so you guys can basically
see what it's like so once you apply it
it kind of like expand I'm going to do a
close-up of this so you guys can
actually see what it's like close-up but
it's just so weird and when you push it
basically
all the bubbles kind of dissolve and
then it ends up being a really light
whipped consistency foundation is
relatively pink so I'm not sure
how well this is going to go but let's
try this actually on the face I'm really
quite scared about this so I'm going to
put it onto my finger first and just
build so we're like I sense all the
bubbles just popping on my head feels
like it's going to drip alright I'm just
going to start off with the forehead and
just one sheet first of all the brush
I'm going to use is this brush from
Primark it's the PS pro spoon brush I
don't even know and I'm just going to
apply this into the skin
you
this is so weird
ah literally went straight on to my Teva
are you kidding okay so this is what one
normal layer looks like I didn't apply
them at the massive amount I mean half
of one pump did fall onto my t-shirt
this is how one layer looks I think I'm
going to add one extra layer before I do
the rest of my makeup and we are going
to see how this lasts through the day I
do really really like the way this feels
I just wish the color was a little bit
better but that's of course like not the
foundations for I would definitely do a
foundation filled like a natural
coverage it really does feel like skin
and you can see the little blemishes do
look a lot less noticeable you can still
see your skin showing through so yeah I
don't know I think it's exactly kind of
what it says on the box it just looks
natural but it's still covered I
wouldn't quite call it like a flawless
finish because it all depends on the
skin type I see that it starts off as a
white coverage and then you can build it
to maybe a light medium I don't think it
could go past that and then feel like a
very buildable texture it just feels
like you can apply two layers and if you
apply too much it's just going to feel
very sticky so yes that's pretty much
that
it looks really glowy and healthy but
the only reason I feel like I look
really dead is because of the color when
I do the rest of my makeup I think I'm
just going to bronze my skin a little
bit to make myself look a little bit
more normal
so that's what I'm going to do right now
I'm just going to do the rest of my face
and then do the rest of my makeup off
camera
so I've applied like a really like a
normal amount of bronzer nothing too
harsh or anything like that just saying
to give my skin a bit of color I've
applied some concealer and some powder
and that's it I don't apply highlighter
anything and my skin still looks really
glowy even though I did powder it quite
quite a bit so I'm probably going to do
the rest of my makeup off camera and
come back and about and we'll see how
long it'll be but after a good few hours
to see how this foundation has lasted
I'm going to be like doing a few bits at
home today just like tidying and stuff
like that but it is quite warm I'm
really hot in here so I think it's going
to be a good test to see how it is
my skin is combination so I do get oily
throughout the day so I think it would
be really good to test it but so far so
good
it's just a little bit pale for me
because I just thought it makes me look
a little bit dead yeah this looks really
glowy and natural let's see how it
laughs throughout the day when I've got
makeup on and yeah I'll catch you guys
in a few hours
okay guys so I'm back it has been about
just like just under five hours since I
like finished off my makeup so I
probably say it's been over five hours
since I finished the foundation
application now it doesn't take a genius
to look at this and realize that it is
oily as anything it hasn't even been a
full eight hour day and it's very oily
so the pulling the only circumstances
that I would use this foundation is to
literally like just run up to the shops
if I know I'm going to be taking it off
pretty soon and I want to look glowy
that is probably the only circumstances
I would do this because it's just so
oily I'm not typically the oiliest
person in the world and it's just really
greasy but really greasy I don't know if
you guys can see that I'm left out in my
face at all but to go over to be power
in my face throughout the day isn't
something I really tend to do unless I'm
on camera just because I don't know like
in day to day where I just start so like
it's necessary and bear in mind that the
lights you make the oily notes look a
lot worse but even in real life but it
does look really oily so I'm just
powder offs you guys can see what it
looks like after powering it I just
think maybe if it was just a little bit
more long-lasting I'd like this
foundation a lot more just because I
know now that if I was to wear this it's
not going to last me an eight-hour day
and I'm going to look greasy and I'm not
the oiliest person in the world I do get
oily but not to this extent what
happened today foundations I like to
wear daily are the make up forevers face
and body
I like the Urban Decay Naked Foundation
what else do I like I also like the YSL
Touche Clark like anything glowy like
that I love to wear them in everyday
basis but they never get oily like that
once I've set it so this is quite
voluminous compared to the other thing
so maybe this would be nice to make
similar foundation I'm not too sure but
that is my opinions of it what I
recommend their sister someone that has
really dry skin and that doesn't suffer
with oiliness and that wants to look
naturally glowy anyone that gets any oil
I just wouldn't recommend it we'll only
had to sing this again no will I be
using this maybe like to mix in with
stuff and like I said if I'm going from
really pale once also if I'm going to
like a really quick thing for like two
hours or something and love that it's
like a foam I just love it I think it's
so unique so I'm going to be on the
lookout for more foam foundations if I
can find anything like this that maybe
is a little more lasting
