today I'm going to be showing you how to
achieve a fuller more natural looking
brow by using this very simple makeup
technique I'm going to show you guys
basically how to transform your brows to
look a lot fuller so the first step is
going to be brushing your hairs all the
way upwards because we really want to be
able to see the grain of the brow and
then I'm taking an eyebrow gel this one
is from an X and I'm going to be taking
this on a very very thin angled brush
you really want to have the thinnest
brush you could possibly find because
we're going to be creating tiny little
hair strokes and of course has a very
thin so you want to replicate that I'm
just going to be drawing along my brow
very small strands of hair just to make
the eyebrows look really full don't
worry if it's messy I'm just going to be
very gradually building up the look of
hair but it doesn't need to be very
natural because we are going to go
underneath with some concealer you want
to follow the natural growth of your
hair so when it gets to the inner corner
you want to flick them upwards on the
middle you want to kind of diagonal them
towards the arch of your brow and then
as it comes to the tail it kind of comes
down loads a little bit everyone's brow
hairs are different you just need to
look at the natural growth of your hair
and just basically replicate that it's
really really simple another important
step for me is applying clear brow gel
and we are going to be layering this and
applying a little bit more later on but
what that will do is just add a lot of
texture and make the brows look a lot
more full and make the hairs look
thicker the main technique within this
is just to go slowly and just to build
up the hairs very gradually you just
want them to look kind of messy and just
going underneath the brow with some
concealer now and this bit is quite
important if you want to go for quite a
structured brow and of course I'm going
underneath the brow but I'm not going
all the way up to my natural hair we're
just going just underneath that just so
that the brows look a lot pull out on
the bottom part of the brow and of
course you want to make sure you blend
out that concealer and just make it look
as natural as you can possibly make it
and then once you can see where the brow
stops after you put the concealer on you
can just apply any finishing touches and
apply some more brow gel again layering
the brow gel will just make the brows
look thicker in texture and it will make
the actual brow hairs you do have on
your brows look nice and thick very very
full so that's a really important step
you can use a colored brow gel if you
like but clear one works better because
you can see the work you've done
underneath there and then again just go
back and do any finishing touches and
that's pretty much it it's a really
simple technique I mean my brows are
quite full to begin with I don't have a
very thin shape but for someone that
maybe wanted to grow their brows out and
they just couldn't this I think would be
an absolutely perfect technique for them
I love that compared to the other brow
of course it looks a lot fuller in shape
but once you look at the brow quite
closely it looks like this actually has
their although it may be a little bit
more time-consuming if you really wanted
to make your brows look nice and full
and natural in the sense that those
hairs there I think this would be
perfect this is how the brow looks
before and after and personally I'm just
in love with the before and after when
you look at it closely it really does
look like natural hair and I did also
just want to show you guys what it look
like if you wanted to go for a little
bit more of that messy bushy brow which
is quite nice for editorial or whatever
you want to go for if you want to just
look like you have them really super
messy brows so I hope you guys enjoyed
