so today's video is really really
different to anything that I've done
before I was trying to be as imaginative
as possible as I want to do in the
moment tutorial this week so this week I
decided to transform my mom into looking
as much like me as I could make her that
was the challenge my mom has never been
on my channel before so she was nervous
and obviously she didn't wanna like talk
or anything so that's why I'm doing the
intro on my own and throughout the video
there is a much chatting it's mainly
voiceover but just because it's my mom's
first time but she's brave so please
give a thumbs up for her for going on my
channel with no makeup on Lima isn't it
like one of my best friends I'm so happy
that I got to do a video with her and
I'm so excited to you guys to actually
see this video I decided to create like
this kind of makeup look that I'm
wearing I'm not going to show you now
you have to wait to the end of the video
to see what it ends up being like but if
you want to see the transformation and
helping look like towards the end then
it just keep on watching make sure you
subscribe if you love videos like this
and comment down below what kind of
videos like this you'd like to see next
you like to see me transform anyone else
I could transform one of my friends to
look exactly like me or I could
transform I don't know let me know I
really transform a subscriber to that
like me that would be cool seen a lot of
videos around there like transforming my
best friend doesn't like me but I hadn't
seen a mum one and neither one really
don't look alike but we're both cypriot
but we look really different passing
like if you wouldn't think I'm separate
I really don't look like I am so yes we
look kind of different so making her
look like me was not like the easiest
task to be honest just because I don't
think we look like anyway so yeah anyway
we're gonna get slide into this video I
really hope you enjoyed it be sure to
share this with your friends if you love
the concept and yes I love you guys so
much I'm so grateful for the support and
let's get on into this video and eschol
all over one of me you know alright mom
let's get started okay guys so we are
going to get started off with
moisturizing my mom's skin I'm taking me
glam glow glow starter moisturizer and
I've been loving this on myself lately
and I just find it so nice and glowy
so I'm applying that all over her skin
to add some glow and moisture and this
is in the blonde shade which is really
good for what we're going to be doing
and then on top of that I'm taking me
make up forevers step 1 smoothing primer
just to smooth out any of my mom's
textured skin she has a couple of open
pores so that really helps and then we
are taking the NYX total control
foundation and I'm mixing two shades
together now I'm just saying you guys
know my mom's face is going to be quite
a bit darker than the rest of her like
neck area but I do take it down to her
neck just because if she wouldn't have
looked as much like me if we didn't make
her skin darker just because I am a lot
more than her as you can see and even
then like even when you see the end
result she still looks lighter than me
just because I am quite a bit I'm more
tan than her so yeah I wouldn't usually
do this of course but it's just for the
sake of making her look like me and I'm
just taking some color corrector just
adding that to the under eye area just
he says it will help us later before we
conceal and I am using a Beauty Blender
to push that into the skin now I'm going
to leave the skin as it is for now just
because we have a lot to do on the eyes
and I find that because I mean a lot to
me when I do my makeup I had to spend a
lot of time doing them so I am taking
some of the NARS concealer and I just
used that as a primer just pop that all
in using this 3d HD kabuki brush from
Sigma which I'm still loving by the way
used to love this oh gee youtuber days
and I'm just making sure to set that
concealer into place and we are going in
with our eye shadow so I had to speak
this up quite a bit just because showing
a full face really can be time-consuming
but I'm just creating a really nice
smokey eye which you guys have seen me
create on myself quite a few times so
moving lots of warm Browns and darker
shades to really create that like
elongated eyes shape that I love to wear
on myself and as you can see I really am
creating that out of V even though my
mom does have slightly hooded eyes you
can get it done you just really need to
make sure that you are really working at
the colors and building them up
gradually just because if you went in
straight away like sometimes I do on my
own eye shape you might find that the
colors get lost in the crease which can
happen with hooded eye shapes and my
mom's eyes aren't super hooded but
because of her age now she is going to
get slightly more hooded eyes so I just
applied the eyeshadow made sure to clean
up the edges and then I'm
in some concealer and just creating a
semi cut crease because it wouldn't be
me without one and I'm just taking this
colour-pop eyeshadow in the color amaze
and just patting it on top to give us
that really nice golden go listening at
color which you guys know I love to wear
on myself and just applying the base
underneath it really helps to make it
look more vibrant which I love to do and
I'm just making sure to like Pat this on
gradually just because if you apply too
much at once it can have a lot of
fallout and I just love the color this
is so pretty and I'm just applying some
warm I shadow to blend that gold into
the darker colors that we apply it on
the outer corner I just feel that this
really adds a nice amount of dimension
to the eyes and makes them look more
rounded when the eyes are shot and then
I'm just applying a little bit of a
darker color to the out of the area just
to make it a little bit smokey eye and
like I said I really do build the eyes
gradually just because I find that
that's the most accessible way to do it
now I'm applying some concealer to the
under eyes as you can see I do do makeup
on myself and other people in a really
weird order I don't know why I do it
I'm taking that same NARS concealer and
just using it to really exaggerate my
mom's under-eye area because I do like
to go quite bright on myself I would
never do this with her skin type if I
wasn't if I was just doing her makeup
normally I wouldn't do this basically
but obviously for the sake of the video
it is meant to be dramatic this would be
how I do her makeup for her but it's
just because I'm doing it as I would do
it all myself that makes sense so I'm
making sure to blend that in with Beauty
Blender and also a brush and then I'm
taking the Born This Way powder from Too
Faced which I've been loving by the way
and I'm just applying it onto her skin
and just making sure to set every single
little area and just making sure that
it's a nice and mattified
okay so moving on to bronzer now this is
super important and I actually apply
more bronze or later because I realized
how important it should be both just
because I do love bronzer on my skin and
just adding that on to the outer
perimeter as I face really does start to
shape the face but also add the color to
the skin as well which I find super
important when creating a Layla look
because I do love to look bronze and
then I just applied it some brightening
powder from rodeo just under the under
eye area on the chin of the forehead
just to brighten them and then some
contour to the hollows of the cheeks as
well I didn't go too crazy with this
just because my face is quite around
round-faced anyway I don't really have
like a super defined cheekbones but I am
making sure just to go underneath my
mom's jawline because my jawline is a
little bit more defined design has is so
that's why I'm in head and done and just
contoured a little bit more around that
area rather than the cheekbones right
now the eyebrows are probably the most
challenging part out of them all just
because as you can see my mum has quite
a round eyebrow shape so I went in with
a little bit of the benefit brow primer
just to set them into place before I
start filling them in now I found it
really hard because I needed to stand in
front of the power and I didn't want to
block the camera so it was hard to get
quite a bit of it in but what I did was
when underneath the brow first of all
and I tried to make it as straight as
possible just because obviously my
eyebrows are quite straight compared to
hers it does have an arch but they are
quite straight and I did that would be a
Nastasia brow is fast and then I went in
with some actual like a brow pomade and
started to create hair strokes and I did
go underneath it with some concealer as
well just to add a little bit more drama
to it even though I don't really do this
on myself anymore because we did fake
the eyebrow shape the concealer really
helped and I do show you a little more
on the other eyebrow as well just
because I found it I found it so hard to
capture this on camera because it was
just like it was quite a mission because
her eyebrows is such a different shape
to mine as you can see on the kind of
center part of the brow I'm really
flicking upwards to create the effect of
hair so now I'm doing some winged
eyeliner and again you can get it done
even if your eyelids are a little bit
more hooded so the way that I did it was
making her look forward so I can see
where her creases and then create
when I didn't go for anything too crazy
just because it didn't make much sense
to do that
but I just I did still get that wing
done because it wouldn't be a look of
mine without one and I replaced a
mascara and of course my false lashes I
applied House of lashes iconic on her
because they are one of my favorites and
they were the ones that I was wearing
today or I was wearing the cocoa goddess
that they're super similar so yeah I
applied them on my mom's I'm so weird
because they are really heavy and I just
made sure that we blend it in with the
rest of my mom's eyelashes okay so next
I'm going to be applying at some pencil
Kohl eyeliner into the waterline just
because this really does help to close
up my mom dies a little bit because she
does have actually bigger eyes than I do
for sure I have quite small eyes so yeah
and I applied some bronzer again and I
started to contour her nose just because
it kind of like narrows it down a little
bit and I always contour my nose as well
so I went and applied some of that and I
highlighted the center to really make it
look a little bit more narrow and then
went on top of that with a Beauty
Blender just to make sure it looks nice
with the rest of the skin and I did
apply some highlights as well to on the
skin of this is champagne pop by Becca
and then want to buy two too much even
though it is quite highlighted just
because of her skin texture I didn't
want to go too crazy with it and then I
did over why my lips a lot a lot I know
that obviously I would never there's so
many things about this look that I would
never do on her if it was down to me but
because I was creating something that I
would wear and I wanted her to look as
similar to me as possible
I had to over line it quite a bit so I
used cappuccino that line up from Rimmel
and the NYX soft matte lip cream and
that is the finished look guys thank you
guys so much for watching and we hope
you enjoyed this video a mum is what you
think I think I look a bit like you a
little bit I think we've never really
looked like I like to like I look like a
different race I think and I kind of
have to make you a different race
because you were quite a bit darker I
mean you're quite a bit lighter to make
you darker but and yeah like this is how
it came out obviously there's a limit
but like jannat go say
I'm very impressive the eyebrows like
well I've already shaped them
differently like can obviously like
everything looks very different on me
because my features all show but it's
very over lined okay obviously in about
this is how came out my mom and we're
gonna go now thank you for watching
thumbs up to see you and subscribe I'll
see you guys and actually on me fix it
