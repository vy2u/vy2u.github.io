channel so today I have a hole for you
and you guys know I love holes and I
just love buying clothes and stuff I
hadn't bought anything for a really long
time just because I've been trying to
save money but I needed to buy a couple
of things cuz I went to Paris and I was
just feeling choppy so I went on a
little shop on a sauce pretty little
thing and misguided the usual those
three are just my top let me know some
stores that you love to shop from or
that you'd love to see me buy from and
maybe try out my channel because I don't
know I just really want to know I just
wanted to apologize as well for being a
little bit inactive this year again on
my channel I had kind of got in the mode
of uploading twice a week then I kind of
like decreased a little bit I've just
been feeling a little bit uninspired
I've actually been blogging more lately
so be sure to follow my blog channel too

would really like the vibe of my vlogs
if you haven't already seen them so be
sure to check it out if you haven't
already I think you guys would really
like it and that's where I've been more
I feel like I've been putting more
effort into my second channel just
because it's been making me really happy
I'm sorry I'm still creating but I'm
just trying to think of what kind of
videos I'm gonna be putting on this
channel let me know be specific or the
kind of content that you want to see
from me just because I don't know I just
feel like as I change the path on my
channel isn't gonna stay the same so I
just kind of need you guys let me know
what you guys want to see and I
obviously still want to create the stuff
that I love which I feel like is kind of
going up on my little channel at the
moment so yeah be sure to check that out
I'll leave my last video up here on the
I icon of which side I think it's this
side I'll leave on my latest video I
actually show you guys how I edit my
Instagram pictures so be sure to watch
that after this one and then be sure to
follow me on Instagram after this - I
don't want to start mumbling now
subscribe to this channel subscribe to
my second channel and let's get into
this whole let's go
so as you guys know I'm a nice sauce
addict I hold my hands up and I'll say
it I love a sauce pan shape or pair of
sunglasses and they're all the way
across the room and I really don't want
to get up does anyone relate to me I'm
gonna pop a picture right here what
these sunglasses look like but I've got
these from a source and the funny thing
is I actually ordered another
as something different came but I feel
like I preferred the glosses actually
came by mistake I just love anything
circular honestly I think they're so
cool I just love that kind of like I do
have look from Paris up by the way are
very proud of it like I would literally
love that book so much
yeah be looking in the eye just here as
well be sure to check that out because I
freaking love it it's honestly just like
one of my favorite blogs ever I also
picked up which I am just I love this I
got this
vans jumper and I am obsessed it's the
colors are just amazing it's got this
stripe kind of print going all across
it's on the back as well so it's kind of
just like the same on the front on the
back and it goes across the chest area
of saying vans of course with the
stripes and I just love this retro feel
to it and then it's got the Vans check
going down the arm a really good quality
sweatshirt I feel like it's like nice to
keep you warm but it's not too thick as
well so then this is great for winter
spring I also picked up this coat from
ASOS and this was my life in Paris it
kept me so warm but it looks amazing at
the same time so you're that kind of
like faux shiny leather esque material
it doesn't feel like leather at all and
then it's got of course like the faux
wall on the inside too I really like
this it's actually from the brand Bosch
got only I think 70 pounds but for a
coat like this
I know 70 pounds can be quite a lot of
money before a good coat I honestly love
this and I've been looking for a good
coat that could keep me warm for a while
and I love this and it looked so nice as
well from ASOS and then lastly I got a
pair of shoes I haven't laced these up
yet because they're vans and if you guys
have ordered vans before all port vans
before you'd know that they never come
laced so I actually bought these and I
know things are kind of crazy because
they're not laced yet but they're
checkered and they have like the two
different stars of checkered on them and
the lodge like original og band check
and then you've got that kind of like
smaller change you guys know I love vans
and when I saw these I was like yeah
they're very me so I just decided to
pick those up and it would it be
available without a pair of trainers am
i writing on the topic of shoes I picked
these up from pretty little thing if you
guys watched my vlog then you may have
already seen these the notorious shoes
that make me like 6 foot and I'm kidding
I'm only 5 foot 4 so I'm not tall at all
but these made me literally like 510 or
something
these are freaking massive like look
look at this compared to the size of my
head like can we just I will ease all
night there was super comfortable and I
really really like these the only thing
is that they do make me super tall super
tall also from pretty little thing as
you guys know I love being comfortable
this isn't more so to style this is more
because it just looked like the most
comfortable thing I've ever seen in my
life and that's this um hoodie
actually has a wool on the inside it's
got this like cream camel color fur on
the inside not real fur obviously it was
like an unsaturated Navy so it looks
kind of like a gray Navy I don't know
how I would style this I generally just
got this because it looked really warm
and I love wearing hoodies around the
house so I kind of just picked this up
for comfort more than anything
also from pretty little thing I picked
up this shot and oh my goodness you guys
I love anything with stripes on it I
actually got this in a medium because
they ran out of small and I just love
this stripe detail it's so retro looking
and I just love anything like that it's
cropped but because I have a medium it's
quite oversized on me but I really like
that actually it looks even more
old-school if that makes sense so I
really like the way that this looks I
love that it's white you can't go wrong
with simple t-shirts like this but I
love that it has that rainbow stripe
detail on it I just literally love it
guys know I love a bit of bread I've
been coming off red a little bit now
that we're in spring but I saw this and
I just decided to get it because it's
just a basic you'll notice that a lot of
the stuff that I kind of walked
throughout this hall there a lot of them
are just basics and I really love that
so I decided to get this because it's
kind of like off-the-shoulder
it's nice and red it's like really
romantic looking I really like this I
think it's just really simple so I
decided to pick this up too and I really
really like it and it's just like that
normal stretchy thin material so I can
wear this all throughout summer which is
great it is cropped as well and it just
fits really nicely next to a pretty
little thing I have this oversized
hoodie it's in this camel nude color and
I did wear this in Paris as well I love
this because it's oversized they've kind
of covered my butt so I wore leggings
with this and it was just the perfect
kind of like winter outfit it like I
said it's still cold in Europe so me
being in the UK and then
well this in Paris it was perfect for
that but I know that we are obviously
going into spring so a lot of you guys
could just wear this on its own by
actually layered that biker jacket that
I bought on top of this and I love the
way that it look because I got this and
I actually have the funniest story to
tell you about this cropped crewneck
I've gotta buy another one because I
loved it so much or I need to get the
vanish out and try and get this stain of
it because I'm so glad you took this to
Paris as well and I was wearing it and I
took it off I put it in my suitcase and
there's actually these little cupcakes
that were brought to our hotel room and
then I had like I had this bright pink
icing on it and it like fell into my
suitcase and the icing was so soft it
just like went all over the sleeve and I
was like oh look how dark that is that's
how much food coloring must have been in
it anyway I like tried to get it off but
it was like this was all I could do I
don't know how much I'm gonna be able to
get this off I'm gonna try my hardest
I'll keep you posted on the Instagram
stories if I manage to get this off but
um honestly I was so good like when
Sabrina was in the room with me and I
was there Sabrina look what happens just
love this so much I honestly you feel
like it's such a nice basic to have and
I know I'm gonna wear it a lot if I
manage to get the stain off if not I'm
buying another one because that's how
much I love this this is of course from
pretty little thing as well and it's
just like nice and simple and I really
love simplistic stuff also from Berlin
thing I picked up this top that I'm
wearing now it has the frills at the top
and then from the bottom and around the
sleeves like really simple and nice and
I just really really like this so and
lastly from misguided I actually pulled
more from misguided I had to return it
because a couple of things didn't walk
out I actually bought this hoodie and
it's quite oversized but it's not
supposed to be I bought this in a size
14 that way it's really oversized it
just looks like an oversized hoodie with
a really interesting fit because it's
ruched around the arms and around the
bottom hem so it just looks really
different to a normal black hoodie and I
decided to wear this again in Paris I
just wore as I could drape to kind of
hoody effect this was really nice just
to layer on top of what I was wearing
and it just looked really nice and
oversized then lastly I picked up two
basic t-shirts it's just literally a
cropped t-shirt in a
I also bought the same in gray which is
inside-out currently what the same in
great that is the true the last that I
bought as you can see I didn't actually
buy as much in this haul as I normally
do just because I don't know you guys I
sometimes feel like it's really
stressful and boring going through too
many clothes because it kind of means I
can't talk about it and also don't want
to do it to be too too long let me know
if you like slightly shorter hordes or
if you want me to just gather my clothes
closer together and do want massive haul
but I'm gonna try and do at least one
haul a month from now on just because
from here on out especially as the
weather is getting warmer I just and I'm
going to be in so many clothes so
definitely thumbs up for more hauls and
let me know again like I said down below
if you want to see me try and buy stuff
from eBay Amazon you want to see me like
buy things from other places that aren't
the typical you know normal places then
be sure to let me know down in the
comments just to switch things up a
little bit and if you guys are feeling
hopeful today please them you know what
kind of content you want to see on this
channel like I said I'm feeling a little
bit uninspired but I'm trying to just
like keep my mind at the most inspired
place like I said I've been creating a
lot on my blog channel so be sure to
check out my vlog channel too and that's
it for me today I love you guys so much
I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
