Oh
because we are
and to find a way in fear
if I could see hey guys and welcome back
to my channel today's makeup tutorial is
this teal and warm brown makeup look
that's perfect for spring and summer but
you own that I want
so as always our first step is going to
be priming our eyes and I'm using our
soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac this is
just going to cancel out all of the lids
natural colors and it's going to prep it
as a base for all the eyeshadows we're
going to apply then I'm going to be
taking these Smashbox full exposure
palette and taking a blending brush and
this soft brown color and starting to
apply this into our crease as we want to
create a nice soft brown halo effect
around the eye before we apply the teal
then we're going to take Mac
uninterrupted eyeshadow and taking a
smaller crease brush and start to apply
this into the deepest hollow of our
crease what we want to create is a
really nice warm crease that's going to
go around the tail to make it look a lot
more wearable than just the teal on its
own then I'm going to take this dark
chocolate brown and start to apply it
into the crease as well this is going to
add some depth and it's going to give it
more of that smoky effect so as you can
see I'm just going back and forth just
to create that depth and definition in
the crease
next I'm going to be taking my makeup
forever flash palette and taking this
teal color just here and patting it onto
my lid with my finger this is just going
to act as a base as it's going to make
the teal color pop a lot more than using
just an eye shadow on its own so I'm
just using a brush to sort of spread
this over the lid just to make sure that
it looks nice and neat this is quite
pigmented so you want to apply a really
small amount of this then I'm going to
take the revolution ultimate collection
eye palette and just mix this blue and
this green together to create more of a
teal color and then just start to Pat it
onto my lid and these are matte colors
so they're not going to be that
pigmented so you want to use lots of
patting motions to make sure they look
nice and vibrant then I'm just going to
take that crease brush again just to
soften the edge so that it doesn't look
too much like a card crease then I'm
going to take the black from the full
exposure palette and start to apply it
onto my outer corner using a pencil
brush this is completely optional but
this just gives the look more depth
makes it look more smoky and it also
starts to shape your eyes so then I'm
just going with that small crease brush
again and just blending out the black
this is just creating a really nice wing
for me to extend my eyes outwards and
then I'm taking another blending brush
just blend every color together and then
I'm just going back into that black just
to make sure that looks nice and defined
and I'm just going to clean up with a
q-tip and some makeup remover this just
kind of makes the look look a lot more
precise and a lot more polished then I'm
going to take this highlight color on
the center of the palate and start to
apply this on our inner corner just to
open up our eyes a little bit it just
makes the color blend in to the rest of
your eye a lot better next I'm gonna
apply a thin line of eyeliner onto the
top of my lid just so that we can apply
some false lashes this is completely
optional you can go without the eyeliner
it just makes it a lot easier especially
when you're applying a thick powerful
slashes like I am
next I want to apply some mascara and
then my false lashes the false lashes
that I'm applying are the Mac 36 lashes
with lots and lots of individual lashes
added on top next I'm going to be
prepping my face for foundation and I'm
applying some serum to my skin and also
a primer the primer that I'm using is
the natural radiance primer for Mac and
it's just going to give us a nice amount
of hydration before we apply our
foundation the foundation that I'm
applying is the Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation and I'm just applying this
all over my face and bouncing on top my
Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge and this just makes it blend
really evenly and creates a really
flawless coverage
next I'm applying some concealer to my
under eyes and I'm using the Maybelline
fit me concealer and this is in quite a
light shade to give me a nice
highlighted effect and then I'm also
taking Mac light boost and applying this
under my eyes on the bridge of my nose
my forehead and my chin then I'm just
going to blend it all in with the same
sponge that we used to apply our
foundation
next I'm using a separate sponge to push
in some powder to the areas that get
earlier and I'm also using a powder
brush to buff on some powder to my skin
then I'm going to apply a brown eyeliner
to my waterline and also underneath my
lash line this is just going to create a
really nice wearable effect to this look
because we're not applying a teal to the
bottom of the lash line as well it just
creates a really nice wearable effect
and it doesn't look too overwhelming so
I'm just smudging that with a smudging
brush and this is quite a dense brush so
it just makes the eyeliner look nice and
fluffed outwards and then I'm also
taking a fluffy brush with some of that
uninterrupted eyeshadow just to make it
look nice and soft so it sort of blows
outwards then I'm just going to apply
some mascara onto the bottom of my
lashes and our eyes are good to go
next I'm going to bronze my skin just to
give us a little bit of that bronze glow
because the eyes don't go too crazy with
the blush or anything so I just went for
a really soft bronze around the
perimeter of my skin
then I'm also going to be going into the
revolution of baked bronzer and just
applying this onto my cheeks sort of to
act as my blusher just because I don't
want to have too much pink on my skin
because the till is quite an
overwhelming color then I'm just
applying my Becca opal highlighter and
just applying this to the high points of
my cheekbone and this is just going to
give us a really gorgeous glow and the
lips I'm going to be lining my lips with
strip-down lip pencil from Mac and it's
just a really nice beige nude pencil and
then I'm also going to be going round it
as well with cork lip liner because this
is a slightly darker version of this
color and it just goes around the lip
that makes it look a little bit fuller
and just makes the lips look more
defined so of course this is optional
but this just makes my lips look a
little bit fuller so I like to do this
and then I'm also going to be going over
my lips with miss lipstick from Mac as
well this is quite a light color so
making sure to blend it in with my
finger to make it look a little bit more
natural and not too concealer looking
and I also go over my pencil just to
make it look like it blends into the
liner so guys that is the end of this
