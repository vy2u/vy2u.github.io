today I'm going to be doing a full face
of first impressions I just created this
makeup look using pretty much all
products that I have never used before
basically what I'm going to be doing is
trying out a bunch of products that I've
never used before all at once and just
give you guys my little first impression
on it this isn't gonna be like a review
video where I show you guys how it looks
throughout the day I'm just doing my
first impression of them if I like here
what I like about them and you guys just
basically get to see me trying out these
products for the first time if you like
this type of video then don't forget to
thumbs up and also follow my social
media for more of me if you want to keep
up to date with everything that's going
in the Lalor life if you do want to see
my full face of first impressions then
just keep on watching
okay so please don't mind my hair
because right now it's so curly I just
washed that it's still kind of like a
little bit wet so oh my god like I can't
even carry this this Sephora bag is full
of the stuff that we could be doing my
first impressions with so excited cuz I
literally can't remember the last time I
done a first impressions first thing
that I'm going to be testing out today
is the MDK pore perfecting complexion
primer potion and I've never tried any
of the Urban Decay primer potion for the
skin this is what it looks like I
haven't tried any of their face primers
before so I'm really excited it looks
like a gigantic um eye primer potion
it's so cute I love okay so I don't know
if I applied too much of this okay I may
have applied a bit too much of this so
it has like a little bit of a pink tint
to it like I don't if you can see that I
really feel like I've applied too much
for my gun oh this definitely has a nice
smooth almost silicone II feel to it but
it does have a bit of grit I often feel
like some silicone primers just kind of
slip too much and I don't really like
them kind of primers because I feel like
when I apply foundation on top of it it
just doesn't adhere properly whereas
this has almost a teeny bit of tackiness
to it which personally I really like
doesn't feel super thick and it does for
relatively
so that's really nice and this is
probably the biggest thing that I've
been the most excited about to try I
haven't tried it because I wanted to try
it on camera with you guys because I
know that a lot of you in the UK
wouldn't have tried this yet because
it's not yet available in the UK I do
believe that at some point it will be
available but this is the L'Oreal Paris
infallible Pro glow foundation I don't
know what shade I'm going to be I have
208 Sun beige and 205 natural beige I'm
thinking I'm going to be 205 probably I
think that more so than the two away I
don't think I missed and is that I wish
I was but I'm not so it says on the back
of this that this is a lasting glow
foundation never dull never greasy and
that just sounds like my ideal
foundation it says that it's really in
24 hours and air light so I'm super
excited I'm not sure how I'm going to be
applying this year I think I'm going to
go with a Beauty Blender first of all
because that's just my favorite method
to apply anything cuz I've just dumped
into my Beauty Blender I did what
happened but like some I don't know if
that's eyeliner or something has gone
onto the Beauty Blender and it won't
come off like I can't clean it I've
tried with everything okay so as the
product comes out it's quite runny like
if I was to tip my hand upside down it
would come straight off my hand so it is
quite runny and I do have some redness
and scarring today so it will be quite
interesting to see like how well that
covers it it's actually quite funny
because I feel like lots of people have
been raving about this but I've never
actually watched a review or anyone test
this out so I'm not sure like what I'm
going to think about this actually
so my forehead is quite clear there's
nothing really much on there so it just
looks nice and smooth it definitely does
look quite natural in my opinion I did
just use a Beauty Blender and I feel
like that does pick up a lot of the
product so it does make everything look
a lot more natural but right now it does
look really nice it definitely does look
more on the natural side and that's
definitely not a bad thing because that
is the type of foundation I tend to go
for nowadays anyway my redness I don't
know if you can see but it definitely is
hopping through a little bit I could
have a few scoring pilots just around
here so it's definitely some showing
through so if you don't have any
scarring then this will probably cover
everything just fine
I definitely feel like it has a skin
like finish which is really nice and
it's definitely something that I look
for in a foundation just kind of
building it up on this area and a second
layer looks beautiful and it covers it
or really well so I just applied a teeny
little bit of the la girl pro conceal
color corrector under my eyes that's in
the orange shade obviously because I
look so weird the concealer I'm going to
be using today is another first
impression this is the naked skin
weightless complete concealer and I have
never tried this before everyone raves
about this in the shade fair neutral now
this is very very light I like to go for
a really light under-eye but even this
is quite light for me so I'm hoping this
is going to be okay okay it's okay it's
quite light but we can we can deal with
that I'm going to be a blending this in
with my Beauty Blender now from what
I've heard this is a minty crease it's
meant to be really smooth I've just
heard really good things about it okay
so it definitely looks strange because
it's so bright and I haven't set it yet
so I'm definitely loving the way it
looks but I do want to see what it looks
like when it's all set together
I actually did a buy a powder and I'm
quite shocked that I didn't buy a power
because I love buying powders it's going
to be setting it with a powder I already
own this is my favorite this is my soap
&amp;amp; Glory instant research powder and I'm
just going to be setting everywhere
where I applied that concealer and also
on my t-zone area next I'm going to be
trying out the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer kind of looks like it's a
luminous kind of bronzer and it does
look like it's going to be a very
natural shade on me so taking this on a
real techniques blush brush oh so the
formula is very creamy but the color is
definitely a very very natural bronzer
and I'm building up quite a bit and it's
just giving a really nice
your bronze look so I think this would
be really nice for it everyday we're
absolutely quite like the way that that
looks I think that's really nice it does
take a little bit of building up to you
know create quite a bronze look which is
what I like to go for okay so for
highlighting we'll be trying out the
Urban Decay Naked illuminated shimmering
powder for face and body we more of a
glittery rather than like intense
highlight it's more kind of natural but
with the little hints of glitter I just
bring my brush with a little bit of mac
fix+ and I'm just applying a little bit
onto my cheek okay that is intense okay
look how gorgeous that is just wet your
brush beforehand before you actually
touch it onto the skin it just makes
everything look so nice okay so moving
on to brows I actually don't have an
eyebrow pencil or anything like that to
try out for the first time today so I'm
gonna be annoying and just go and do my
brows off camera because I've shown you
how to do it a million times a link
below the tutorial and where I show you
how I do my brows and that'll be just a
lot for my eye shadow I'm going to be
trying out for the first time the NYX
ultimate eyeshadow palette and this is
in warm neutrals now I have been dying
to try this because oh I mean look at
the colors
you're already picking something up from
the palette it seems like these colors
are super pigmented so definitely making
sure I'm going to tap off the excess and
oh I'm so flattered honest
the lens relatively easily considering
that it's an inexpensive matte eyeshadow
this could actually become one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes it's on my
camera just stop recording I have no
idea why so annoying I took some of this
maroon shade just here and honestly
these eyeshadows are so pigmented
they're blending together so well and I
just love this it also took some of the
color pop stupid stroke eyeshadow and
this is in the shade game face
I just tried this so knowing that you
guys don't get to see my first
impression of this but I just took this
and I applied it on my lid area with my
finger and honestly copper is one of my
favorite colors and I just love the way
this I should have looked so much it's
just so intense and I just love it but
also from the next ultimate palette I'm
just going to be taking some of this
shade and I'm just going to be applying
this onto my inner corner just to add a
little bit of brightness it is also just
as intense as the matte ones honestly
I'm so impressed with this palette
moving on from eyes shadow I'm going to
be trying out a brand new liner which
I'm so excited about this is the Kat Von
D tattoo eyeliner and this is how
waterproof liquid liner and this is in
the brush form I think I think she has a
pen and then this one is the one with a
little brush tip I have the one with the
brush tip so I'm really excited to try
this
I love this already it was so so easy to
create the shape it was really really
easy to get it to a really nice point
and I love it like I don't know what
else I could say about it it's super
black it's really like consistent it
doesn't feel like it's coming out too
thick or too thin the feeling when you
get a new eyeliner is a mini boom okay
so I'm going to put on some lashes and
mascara the lashes I'm using all the
Callisto lashes from certified
so I'm also just applying some mascara
to my natural lashes right at the base
and then also on my bottom lashes as
well and I leave for my lips I'm going
to be taking the Urban Decay 24/7 glide
on pencil in 1993 just applying this all
over the lip line
I have tried these pencils before but I
don't believe I've tried it in the 1993
shade I'm not too sure I could have
potentially tried this when I was in
California but I really can't remember
and for my liquid lipstick I'm going to
be taking the Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipstick which I have never tried
before in my entire life I'm so excited
to try it so I'm just taking this liquid
lipstick initially when I was applying
this formula I didn't think it reminds
me so much of something else it does
have a relatively unique formula
it feels liquidy but not so so that
quitting dries relatively fast and the
color is everything I love this color so
much I love this sort of much I honestly
feel like the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
are gonna be probably my favorite ever I
don't know why it's taking me so long
whenever I've tried to find them in the
u.s. they're just always sold out this
is the finished look and this is how all
the products came together pretty much I
liked almost every single product a lot
like every single product is pretty much
impressed with which is really normal I
think when you're doing your makeup for
the first time with stuff that you
haven't used before I definitely feel
like when you try product for the first
time it always ends up looking better
the time after that all the time after
that because you kind of get used to the
formula and you feel like you know how
to work it I probably say that out of
all the things that I loved the most
I love the liquid lipstick so much I'm
so happy that I finally got to try the
Kat Von D liquid lipsticks also the
eyeshadow palette from NYX was one of my
favorites and I think I'm really gonna
love the base as well the Loreal Pro
glow I'm so happy I got to do this first
