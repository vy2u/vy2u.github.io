channel today I have a makeup tutorial
for you and I'm going to be showing you
how to achieve this gorgeous party New
Year's Eve makeup look it's smoky and
sparkly and it's just perfect I love it
so much and you can actually replace the
silver glitter for any color glitter
it's quite Universal and I just love the
way that it turned out I forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and subscribe to my vlog Channel
and also down below with all my social
media links and all the products I use
today
so if you want to get into this video
and see how I achieved it then just keep
on watching since you get started I'm
going to be priming my eyes using the
Urban Decay primer potion in Eden and
I'm just going to be popping this onto
my eye and just blending it in with my
finger making sure it's thoroughly
blended out and dry before I apply any
eyeshadow for my eyeshadow I'm gonna be
taking the Urban Decay ultimate basics
Naked palette and I'm gonna be taking
this shade right here and I'm gonna be
popping it into my crease using a
blending brush because I'm gonna be
using silver I do want to keep the
crease relatively warm because I feel
like it blends in a lot better to my
skin tone because that way it doesn't
look super super cool so I'm blending it
in as smoothly as I possibly can making
sure that it has a really nice soft
blend and then I'm going in with this
shade right here which is just slightly
darker and I'm pushing that into the
deeper part of my crease and I'm going
to start to apply it in the outer V area
to create more of a point on the outer
corner of my eye
to make the eyeshadow look even more
smoky and to add a bit of a pop of 10
I'm gonna be taking this shade right
here and just popping this into the
outer corner in V again this will just
again help to make it look a little bit
smoky and add a little bit of that
purple tone for my lid I'm going to be
taking the body shop eye color stick and
this is in the shade cairo granite I'm
popping this all over the lid to start
to create that gray smokiness that you
see on my other eye I'm gonna be popping
glare on top of this but this is
actually a really nice subtle glittery
shadow stick on its own you're not a fan
of glitter you could totally use this on
its own as well I'm just going to be
smoking out the outer corner using a
black eyeshadow and a pencil brush again
I'm just popping it on the outer corner
and kind of pushing it upwards towards
the tail of my eyebrow to create a
little bit more of that upwards turning
shape and this just looks so flattering
and I do want to make sure to blend this
as well as I can into the other colors
we applied previously and as always I do
like to wipe away the sides with a wipe
to really create that beautiful shape
that I love and then taking which is my
opinion the star of the show this NYX
glitter I love this it's so gorgeous and
the bodyshop base acts as such a good
base for this I did use a little bit of
the NYX glitter glue on my brush
beforehand just to make it here a little
bit better but for all the little gaps
of the glitter you literally couldn't
see anything but just a gorgeous sparkle
and I feel like like I said the bodyshop
base really went really well with this
glitter and they just made such a
perfect pair for my lashes I'm taking me
backstays lashes in Rodeo Drive these
are so long and fluffy and I thought
this was just so perfect I'm skipping
the liner today so that all the
attention could be on the glitter and
lashes but you can of course do a liner
if you like if you are going to do a
winged liner do do it before you do the
glitter before we finish off the eyes
I'm going to be starting on the skin I'm
just taking some green concealer to
cover up my redness and I'm just
applying this on all areas that I feel
are red and blending it in with a kabuki
brush I do want to just push this into
the skin so that's already for
foundation I'm actually using a
different foundation today because I
want it to be more of a long wearing
Foundation and I haven't picked this one
up in a really long time I'm using the
Mac Studio Fix fluid and oh we haven't
seen this one on YouTube for a while
well like everyone's kind of forgotten
about this I haven't used it either but
then when I saw it in my drawer I was
like I haven't used this in ages so I
blended it in with my Beauty Blender and
I didn't really like it but I do have so
many foundations like I do prefer over
this so I just used it for my concealer
I'm just taking some of the Maybelline
fit me because it's one of my favorite
formulas and it just suits so under my
eyes boo decided to make a cameo and he
just stuck his tail right there in my
face and then he just jumps down and
scared the living daylights out of me
and then to brighten up that concealer a
little bit I'm gonna be taking some of
the Tarte shape tape concealer and this
is in I think the light is shape that
they make I'm just applying this on
those areas that I just applied the
previous concealer and I wanted to go
for something that was a little bit more
vibrant compared to what I usually do
because I'm going to be contouring so I
wanted quite a contrast between my
highlighting and contouring today which
I don't usually tend to do I just
blended this in with my Beauty Blender
and just made sure it was super blended
in and I set it with my usual favorite
powder the soap of Glory instant retouch
powder because you guys know how much I
love it
for my bronze I'm gonna be taking this
shade from the Kat Von D shade and light
palette again this is one of my
favorites and it looks stunning in
pictures so I decided to use it again in
this tutorial I'm kind of bronzing quite
heavily and I'm applying it on all of
the sides of my face underneath my
cheekbones and like I said I'm kind of
going quite intense with this because
this does contour and bronze at the same
time and I just love the way that it
looks and I just feel like it created a
really nice contrast between my
highlighting that I just did again
because it's a part you look I
highlighted quite a bit heavier than I
usually would I used Becca champagne pop
and I just applied that on to the tops
of my cheekbones and then to finish off
the eyes I took some black kohl pencil
and applied it on my waterline and the
bottom lashline and then I smudged it
out using that purple shade from the
naked ultimate basics and I kind of just
went quite messy with the bottom lash
line and just smoked it out to make it
look quite smudgy and then I finished
off with some mascara
and then finally for my lips I'm going
to be lining my lips all the way over
using matte stripped-down lip liner and
then I'm going on the outer edges using
Mac stone lip liner just to add a little
bit of that kind of definition on the
outer corners and then to really finish
off and to add a perfect color I am
taking the bodyshop matte a lip liquid
and this is in the shade Windsor Rose
which is actually one of my favorite
colors I've been loving it it's just my
perfect nude and I just love the way
that it turned out this is the finished
look guys I really really hope you
enjoyed it if you did the don't forget
to smash your big thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
