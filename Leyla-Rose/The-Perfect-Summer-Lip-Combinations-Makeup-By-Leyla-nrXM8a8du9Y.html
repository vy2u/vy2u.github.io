today I'm gonna be showing you five of
my favorite lip combinations that are
perfect for summer the first one is this
light beige nude and it's just the most
perfect beige nude that you can wear
with a nice golden look like the one I'm
wearing now it's just a really nice
effortless nude so I'm just starting off
with NYX retractable lip liner in
natural and I'm just lining my lips with
this and I'm also filling in my lips as
well this will just make it last a
really long time because these lip
liners last forever and then I'm just
going on top of that with a chi doll
lipstick from gerard cosmetics and this
is like the highlight of the show
because it just gives them as a gorgeous
beige nude but it's still quite nice and
light and then I'm going on top of it
with Sigma's lip vexxt in slip and this
is just the most gorgeous nude with a
nice gold undertone and this just
finishes off the look and it just looks
so gorgeous and effortless and just
perfect for the summertime and the beach
next is this peachy nude as you guys
know I love my nudes so I wanted to show
you guys one more nude option this is
slightly darker and it has more peach
running through it I'm starting off with
Keiko's smart lip pencil in number 700
and just applying this all over my lips
again just to give us that really
gorgeous peachy effect this is like a
peachy Brown lip liner and this will
just kind of structure the lips before
we apply the lipstick we want to apply
and this is gonna be a little bit more
of a matte lip option compared to the
previous one and then I'm taking the
drawers metics nude lipstick and this is
just the most amazing nude lipstick ever
it's very peachy and very gorgeous on a
lot of skin tones and again you can
switch it up depending on the lipliner
you use and then I'm taking NYX almond
jumbo lip pencil and just applying this
just to the center of my lip to give a
slight ombre effect this is just perfect
again for the beach or just for an
everyday wear this is just one of my
favorite lip combinations next is this
bold pink coral you won't catch me
wearing a bold lip often but this is
just absolutely gorgeous
this is just a lipstick alone so it's
not really a combination but I really
wanted to feature this this is a
Maybelline Color sensational lipstick in
shocking a coral and this is just the
most gorgeous coral pink and it's just
perfect if you want to add just a pop of
color to a neutral look like I'm wearing
here and it's just the most gorgeous
color so I really really really can't
wait to wear this more often
next is this pastel lavender this is
more fully more daring girls out there
again it's just the lipstick alone
because it's kind of hard to find a lip
liner to pair up with this but this is
lilac moon from gerard cosmetics also
and this would look absolutely gorgeous
on a slightly fairer skin this is just
absolutely gorgeous and it's really good
if you want to make a really cool fun
statement
and lastly this is my favorite out of
them all this is the bright red pink and
I've just absolutely been loving this I
have just posted about a million
pictures on Instagram of me wearing this
because it's absolutely gorgeous for
olive-skinned girls not to mention also
it look absolutely gorgeous on deep skin
tones also so I'm just lining my lips
with cherry lip liner from Mac and just
making sure to line my lips as precisely
as possible because we are using quite a
dark lip color and this is more of a
matte option but you can switch up with
a gloss as well and then I'm just going
on top of that with relentless deep
breath lipstick which is also from Mac
and this is the star of the show because
it just creates the most gorgeous just
pink red and it's just absolutely
gorgeous and there aren't many colors
like this it's quite unique and I just
absolutely love it so this is the final
lip option
