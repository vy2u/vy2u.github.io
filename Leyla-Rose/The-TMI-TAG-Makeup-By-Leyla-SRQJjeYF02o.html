today I wanted to do a more personal
video because I just recently hit 20,000
subscribers I am so happy that I have
reached this milestone with you guys
youtube is literally my passion and I'm
so happy that you guys love what I do
I'm so happy I love what I do and I'm
just loving where this is going so thank
you so much for supporting me all the
way and I am just want to see so
thankful and I can't wait to hear more
milestones with you guys and just take
you all with me I kind of want to take
all of you with me on this journey
thinking to all of you that have
commented liked subscribed and even you
just viewing one of my videos is
supporting me seriously for like all of
you guys are like my friends so thank
you so much mr. bullying me and because
I hit 20,000 I wanted to do more of a
personal video because I haven't done
one in a while and I thought I'd do
another kind of half video so I thought
I'd do the TMI hey guys I'm just gonna
ask I because I'm not sure how long this
video is actually gonna be this video is
actually fifty questions so I am looking
on my phone at the moment if you guys
are wondering why I'm looking down so
I'm just gonna read the questions from
my phone and I'm just gonna answer them
so let's just jump straight into it
so number one is what are you wearing at
the moment I am wearing not very nice
stuff actually I'm wearing this crop top
from Primark I'm wearing EES necklaces
from new look and I'm also wearing my
boyfriend's track suits because whenever
I film I always wear something really
comfortable on the bottom so I'm wearing
something really comfortable and just
some fluffy socks as well next question
is have you ever been in love yes I have
been in love of course number three is
ever had a terrible breakup my current
boyfriend broke up for a couple of
months and it was a really hard time in
our lives and once we got together after
about two months we realized that we
could work on it and now we are stronger
than we ever were and it just taught us
both that you know there's no need to
give up you just gotta push through it
and you will end up being better for and
stronger together oh it's all on you I
am 5 foot 4 so I'm pretty small I'm
quite petite in size as well so I'm like
dinky little package and yeah pretty
small nothing too large and how much do
you weigh I reckon about 122 because the
last time I weighed myself was about a
couple of months ago and then I have
form weight which is good as I reckon
about 120 223 pounds
number six is any tattoos no I have no
tattoos and no plans tattoos for the
moment I mean I might one day but at the
moment until I'm absolutely sure I want
one I am NOT gonna get one number 7 is
any piercings yes I have my ears pierced
and then I also have the second hole
pierced as well just above it but I
never actually use it so those are two
four and then I also have my bellybutton
pissed
I have contemplated taking my
bellybutton ring out but I do like ya at
the same time our donor take out and
then you know what I get it passed again
I probably wouldn't get it pierced again
I don't think I would Barney as we'll
just keep it in I'll probably take it
out in a couple of years but while I'm
still young may as well keep it in 8th
is OTP I really don't know what this
means
I tried searching it and I think it
means like the perfect pairing of two
people you'd want to eat together with a
game of Thrones fans I think you'd be
Daenerys and Jon Snow because I mean
come on
Justin number nine is my favorite show
without a doubt it's Game of Thrones is
absolutely my favorite show I'm reading
the books as well it's just one of my
favorite things a couple of other shows
that I love is Pretty Little Liars
Grey's Anatomy Breaking Bad I do watch
The Walking Dead I think it's a migraine
I'm not really a huge fan of that
anymore
what else yeah I do love series I'm more
of a series person rather than film
person like I just love watching series
so yeah I love that but 100% Game of
Thrones is my favorite number 10 is
favorite bands literally I am the most
open person when it comes to music I can
listen at one moment to a green day and
then the next one would be listening to
Selena Gomez and then after that be
listening to the soundtrack of Game of
Thrones which is like an orchestra
version they were with me when they say
like I don't really like one specific
band or artists or something I just like
listening to different songs does that
make me happy so ya don't really have a
favorite band number 11
something you missed I think I missed
being young in a sense and just having
less responsibility I think we all take
advantage of that point in our lives
where you know you're kind of careful
you don't have to worry about you know
financial things you don't have to worry
about anything you just go to school you
come back you enjoy time with your
friends and I think I really took that
for advantage and I do miss that I miss
Anna don't listen look if I didn't
really enjoy school
I just miss having no responsibilities
and just enjoying myself number 12 is
favorite song that's really hard because
I go through different phases where I
love a song and I'll let you play until
I kill it but I think one of my favorite
songs that will always be one of my
favorites is Emma nice and a clown
because it's just one of the most
beautiful songs that has so much meaning
and it's all about that she hides behind
this mask and that she's really you know
someone else and that everyone kind of
laughs at her and judges her on the
outside when really they don't know who
she is and that really does apply to me
a lot in different parts of my life and
I just think that's one of my favorite
songs of her life is just an amazing
song with so much meaning number 13 is
how old are you I am still 19 years old
I turned 20 on the 18th of July so it's
my birthday in a couple of months I'm
almost out of my teen years and no one
ever thinks I'm 19 sometimes I'll like
mention it in a video like you know my
skin is weird for a 19 year old and then
I'll have loads of people commenting
like did you just sing oh 19 what I
thought you were in your thirties and
I'm just like what I think it's my
mannerism I'm not sure people have never
treated me like a teenager I literally
got a job as soon as I got out of
college and I've just literally been in
an adult business mindset just wanting
to reach for my goals as soon as
possible and just the way I carry myself
I think it's very above my age I still
act like a child though
speak I could really do ask anyone
that's close to me number 14 is the
zodiac sign I'm I can't stop I don't
really believe in them I just don't
think the time you're born says anything
about you I think we're all individuals
but hey that's what you want to believe
that's okay number 15 is a quality that
you look for any partner I think Trust
is the most important thing ever if you
cannot trust the person you're with then
what is the point like what kind of
relationship can you build if you cannot
trust them and I'm so blessed to have
someone I can trust with everything like
literally I completely trust him with
all my heart so I'm very blessed for
that I think trust is the main thing
because I think you build trust and then
everything else builds on top of that 16
favorite quote I have multiple I am such
a quote person last couple of weeks I've
been putting a different quote every
single time I upload a deep bottom of my
description box so if anyone's ever
scrolling through and they happen to see
it I just like giving a little hidden
message for them to make them feel good
and it's always a positive message
there's something I've always wanted to
do is kind of like send a positive
message the favorite quotes is don't
worry about tomorrow for today has
enough troubles of it's phone it's one
of my favorites I'm a huge warrior and
sometimes that fits me into perspective
sometimes so I absolutely love that it's
you know one of my favorites number 17
is favorite actor
I think Will Smith just because he's so
versatile and all of his films I always
loved I always loved his films there's
barely any of his films I don't enjoy he
can just do anything and I think he's
just incredibly talented and the guy
does not age for 18 is favorite color
it used to be purple like purple was my
favorite color I still do really love
pup all but recently it's been great I
have to do love grey matte grey like
really nice cool great I really love it
it's amazing and beige beige is gorgeous
as well number 19 is loud music or soft
it really does depend like sometimes I
literally have like a clump sir in my
room and literally play my music so loud
and then sometimes I'll just play music
really softly in the background while I
read a book or just soft relaxing music
Tuesday really does depend what kind of
mood I'm in so it could be either one of
the two twenty where do you go to when
you're sad I think my room my room is
like my sanctuary if something's like
off balance in my room I kind of relax
until I fixed it so when I'm sad I think
my room is just my calm place I'll just
watch something on TV place the music
read a book I love my room especially
when I want to be alone I love coming to
my room it depends what's upset me but
usually as well I'll go to my boyfriend
because my boyfriend internet cheating
my rock we just go through everything
together he is my rock and my best
friend so I literally will talk to him
about pretty much everything so I'll go
to my boyfriend as well I'm sad if he is
the problem then I'll come to my room
4:21 how long does it take you to shower
I like baths to bathe it takes me about
25 minutes all the way up to an hour
depending on how much time I have me -
how long does it take you to get ready
in the morning it really does depend
what kind of makeup I'm doing like if I
am just you know heading out the door
one upon a really natural makeup I can
get ready in like 15 minutes but if it's
something where it requires me putting
on a glam it can take me anything up to
an hour half like I can really take my
time like I could do it quickly but if I
have time I will take my time as well so
when I used to get ready for work when I
worked at Mac it used to take me an hour
for everything I'd give myself an hour
number-23 ever been in a physical fight
no I am literally the least violent
person ever I would never hit someone
I think that's just not the answer
number 24 turn on a sense of humor
sensitivity I'm being able to be
sensitive to mean because I am literally
one of the most sensitive people ever so
you need to like understand what I'm
going through
as far as physical goes I love a good
tan skin nice smile and like dog hair
basically my boyfriend
Josh's you know he's everything turned
off you know I think swearing like in
every other why'd you say I don't
understand swearing when you're angry
but but someone's just like FS and after
that and just that kind of something
that's disgusting and also especially in
this country when people still talk like
a bad man the reason I joined YouTube
pinky down I always wanted to join like
it was always something I wanted to do
scary especially because I was quite
young when I first joined and I wasn't
that good at makeup when I first
actually started like if you look at my
first video you'd know what I mean like
I still have my first video of but yeah
I don't know I just always wanted to do
it and now the reason why I continued
with YouTube is that I love teaching
people and I love being able to tell
people what I've learned just try and
help them out just so that they can
reach their goal quicker than I did and
just you know want to share my story
with you guys and it just feels natural
this is my dream I love it number thirty
is the meaning behind your youtube name
but actually like I know it's makeup by
Laila considering obviously my name is
Laila and I do makeup but it was my name
on Instagram first so that was my name
on Instagram and then I made my name on
here if I was picking my name now I
would actually change it I'd rather it
just be my name Rob with a makeup by
available cuz obviously I'd do more on
here now than just makeup like I do
personal videos hair videos I'm gonna do
some more fashion stuff I'm gonna get
more in and I kind of feel like I'm
annoying it is makeup by available cuz I
want it to be more
then just makeup if that makes sense
number 31 the last book I've read I
haven't read a book in a really long
time but the most recent book I've read
which I'm still in the middle of reading
is Game of Thrones I'm like cooler of
the way through I stopped because I'm
just so I playing this new game that I'm
like in love with it's The Witcher 3 but
I'm such a nerd is ridiculous but I've
just been doing that that's been
literally taking up all my time so that
is all they've actually been doing in my
free time so yeah I've kind of stopped
reading it but that's the book I'm still
currently reading 32 the book is
currently reading uh well I just said
that number 33 the last show you watched
literally when I was recording this
makeup look I had Sponge Bob Squarepants
on in the background I haven't watched
spongebob in so long but it used to be
like literally one of my favorite things
in the whole world one of my favorites
apart from that it would have been the
office and the office is one of my
favorites as well the u.s. office so
good number 34 the last person I talked
to my mum because she went up she came
back and we tried for a bit
she said I'm actually like my makeup and
then she left then she went out again
that was interesting the relationship
between you and the last person you
texted the last person I texted was Josh
who is my boyfriend number 36 favorite
food mm-hmm this is so hard to make with
my love food
I think it's gotta be steak like
or ice cream this ice cream truck or he
likes the common one for me my favorite
food has got to be steak steak ours
Quinn Miller and Carter and it is just
my favorite steakhouse in the whole
world
it's quite expensive but they do the
most amazing steaks their steaks
literally taste amazing like they're
incredible so that's probably my
favorite food like an actual mean of
course 37 place you want to visit oh my
gosh this is impossible like there's so
many places I actually want to visit
ridiculous I definitely want to go back
to America I want to go to you la New
York probably Florida again I've been
there before when I was a little bit
younger just although I'd love to do a
road trip around merica America is like
literally one of my favorite places in
the whole world I think I was meant to
be born in America because when I think
in my head it's an American accent it's
that weird that's like literally when I
think but when I think about what I'm
gonna say sometimes in a tutorial I
think in an American accent
it's really weird so I want to go to
Thailand so badly so about I want to go
to Thailand Mauritius I want to go to
Rome I just wanna go to so many places I
hope one day
YouTube will take me traveling because I
would just love to travel so much it
would be amazing number 38 the last
place I was I haven't left my house in a
good couple of days but the last place I
went was a couple of days ago I went to
Oxford Street with my family
I wasn't feeling that well so it was
kind of like it was a nice day it was
really nice weather and stuff I haven't
been feeling well recently and it's
really annoying because I barely leave
my house now sorry because I've been
feeling unwell so much so yeah that was
a good couple of days ago an apartment
on I actually haven't left my house good
old interesting life I have 39 do you
have a crash oh I yes I have a crash
scandal its life I have
and of course last time you kissed
someone not yesterday the day before
which was of course again my boyfriend
number 41 the last time you're insulted
don't get insulted that easily I'll be
honest with you it takes a lot for
someone says to me to really get to me
like sometimes I'll be a bit like oh
that's a bit like unnecessary you don't
really need to say that but whenever I
get hate on one of my videos I usually
just delete it I always get really
tempted to reply but I don't like losing
anything I don't think of one just
sometimes they hate I get is a bit
unnecessary but I don't wanna see let it
take me really to my heart
I just think forget it just forget it
favorite flavor of sweet right resis
buttercups they're not miniature ones
the big ones the huge ones resits
buttercups are literally my favorite
thing in the whole world like I'm not
joking like if you give me a bag I will
finish it like that no no even joking
like everyone knows you want to make me
happy bring me a bag of those and
that'll be the best thing what
instruments do you play I used to play
the guitar but I am not about to good
anymore I used to play when I was really
young and I pretty much forgotten
everything I think I might really put my
mind to it I could favourite piece of
jewelry it would probably have to be
these earrings which I got Oh a while
ago like everyone always compliments me
on these these like rose gold gems in my
ears I got them from new look all
forever 21 a good couple of years ago by
cohn remember which one I got them from
and apart from there is all my favorite
pair of jewelry they are one of my favor
the last sport you played I haven't
played sport since I left school which
is probably four years ago so a long
time ago or I don't know going to the
gym counts but I go I went to the gym
and lifted weights so that was the last
sport I played so I don't know if that's
a true gathers as a sport both the gym
camps then the gym which I haven't been
for a while by the way if you're
thinking I'm really good and I'm really
fed I'm not trust the last song you Sam
