today we're going to be talking about
the best high-end foundations the first
on our list at number three has to be
mac face and body due to its light
waterful consistency making it perfect
for foundation for everyday wear this
foundation offers a satin shine finished
giving a dewy moisturize and natural
glowing effect to the skin this is
perfect for dry to combination skin
though it can be manipulated with
primers and powders for a more oily skin
type this foundation is the perfect
candidate for anyone looking for that
natural sun kissed skin with an
effortlessly blendable liquid feel Mac
offers a wide range of colors to suit
any skin tone on the spectrum also
offering two sizes in 50 mils and 120
mils ranging in price from 21 pounds 50
228 pounds this has to be one of my
favorite foundations due to its
versatility and its ability to build
coverage beautifully the next on our
list at number two the runner-up has to
be the silk creme foundation from Laura
Mercier this foundation offers a high
amount of coverage that covers a wide
range of imperfections such as
hyperpigmentation redness blemishes and
fine lines this thick creamy formula
glides effortlessly and is very easily
blended onto the skin not only does it
provide a beautiful and smooth look but
also has long wearing formula that will
stay on the skin perfectly a little bit
of this product goes a long way so a
small amount apply with a sponge creates
the perfect airbrushed effect this is
one of my favorite foundations for an
evening wear as it covers and smoothes
all of my imperfections and this cream
on a bottle sells for 35 pounds with 35
mils next to some foundations that
didn't quite make it to the top three
but are worth mentioning the NARS sheer
glow foundation is a beautiful sheer
liquid that offers a glowy and radiant
finish to the skin it offers a beautiful
medium buildable coverage that is
perfect for any occasion the Mac
matchmaster foundation is almost
high-tech in a way it offers a medium to
buildable coverage that has a long wear
mattified feel it's color technology
helps to match to the skin
using a ratio of color pigments and
clear pigments science aside it just
looks beautiful the Double Wear
foundation from Estee Lauder has a
liquidy consistency but offers a full
coverage that covers any imperfections
it's quick-drying matte finish is
incredibly long wearing if you couldn't
tell by the name it offers 15 hours of
long way plus is non-transferable smudge
heat and humidity resistant and finally
my number one goes to in Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation if you've
watched my tutorials you would have seen
how much I love this foundation it's
lightweight silky formula provides a
medium coverage that captures only the
best parts of your skin and allows them
to show through it it covers all
imperfections while still allowing your
natural skin texture to show through and
actually look like skin this is another
little bottle of glow perfection this
foundation makes you look like you're
glowing from the inside out and it's
buildable coverage means it's just
perfect for day and night the feel of
this foundations consistency feels like
little drops of luxury for 3452 3650
depending on where you purchase it from
you get 30 mils of pure perfection it's
just so worth it when it's this amazing
