today I'm going to be doing a lip swatch
video with you I haven't done a lip
swatch video since way back last year so
I thought maybe I could get into the
swing of doing a couple more lip swatch
videos just because I kind of missed
them and I do have a lot of different
brands in my collection so I wanted to
start showing you guys some different
lipstick swatches and lip gloss swatches
and just different stuff that I own and
I thought would be good for you guys
because whenever I'm ordering online or
whenever I am searching for a lipstick
or something like that
I always check swatches because I like
to see how they look on different skin
tone haven't seen that many tomforde
lip swatch videos so I have six
lipsticks and there may not be a lot of
lipsticks but they are very very very
expensive so these are definitely more
luxury lipsticks and if you are going to
buy one you're going to want to make
sure that you like the color so I wanted
to kind of swatch each one for you guys
and I'm just going to talk about them a
little bit before I get into the
swatches I just wanted to tell you guys
a little bit about the lipsticks I'm
going to tell you guys like a little
mini review on them my packaging is very
expensive very heavy and very luxury
feeling completely black box cube with
gold around it now what is more luxury
than black and gold
I don't think there's anything more
luxury than that but they are just
amazing they can look incredible you
feel pretty bossy taking these out your
past and putting it on you know they are
very high-end and luxury so as these are
all used lipsticks I can't show you how
the lipsticks actually come but they do
come with the TF on the very top of the
lipstick as well when you get them new
they do have the TF imprinted on the top
of the actual lipstick product as well
so when you open it it's all fresh it
just looks absolutely gorgeous very
high-end feeling and you know it's just
gorgeous so it does come in a really
well presented way a very creamy formula
and the pigmentation is very high
they're not very sheer it does give you
an opaque color payoff but it does also
feel creamy at the same time you can
make the map by applying a translucent
powder on top of it but they do have
quite a bit of shine only one that I own
that has a different kind of formula is
vanilla suede and this is the lightest
one I own it's the palest nude I think I
own is very very light but it almost has
a sheen of gold running through it it's
a very weird texture but it doesn't go
on as creamy as the other ones I just
feel that the other one's gone a lot
smoother and this one kind of goes on a
little bit busier this one is my least
favorite the six I own just because the
color isn't that wearable I do use it to
mix with other colors but when you're
buying lipsticks this isn't really the
brand to go for when you want to mix
colors together you kind of want it to
be the perfect lipstick especially
because of the price now all the ones I
own they have a very creamy texture very
opaque consistency and they're amazing
they do look really nice the formula is
very comfortable it feels quite
luxurious on the lips they're not very
drying and I really do like the way that
they feel the one thing that I actually
don't like about this product is the
smell it's quite shocking for me because
this is never usually a problem for me
with lipsticks but the smell is just not
a high-end smell if that makes sense it
kind of has a plasticky smell it doesn't
smell vanilla II like matte lipsticks it
doesn't have like a really nice smell it
kind of just smells like they haven't
really put anything into it so there
still is a very light scent there but it
does still have that plasticky smell
that's coming through I like the smell
of like MAC lipsticks and the NYX butter
glosses and just like really nice sweet
smells I do understand that some people
don't like that but this just doesn't
smell that great to me and that's the
only thing that kind of disappoints me a
little bit because the smell of a
lipstick is quite important you're
applying it onto your lips and if you
don't like the smell of it it can kind
of make you feel like apart from that I
love these lipsticks they are very
high-end I was checking online to see
how much they actually are some places
are saying 26 pounds which doesn't sound
right to me because I think they are a
lot more than that I checked on House of
Fraser and they sell them for 37 pounds
but then on another website I saw 26
those are completely different prices so
I'm not entirely sure on how much they
actually cost I'm just going to go buy
the majority of what I saw and the
majority was 37
I'm not gonna go into the lips put you
down to the ground what goes around
comes around you won't put the flame out
you can't get to me say what you want to
say go take it all the way but I'm here
to stay you know you can't get to me and
there is no very Kelly then shoot me
down
i'ma have you
I'm a happy way
I'm a heavyweight
you
Oh
at the end of this swatch video I hope
that you enjoyed this is just a quick
informative video just to show you guys
a lip swatch or a certain type of
lipsticks if there are any type of
lipsticks you'd like me to swatch then
please do let me know in the comments
below I'd love to do more of these for
you I was going to do my Mac a lipstick
collection today I just don't have
enough time for that
I must have 50 plus matte lipstick so I
have a lot and it's a lot to go through
so I think I'm just going to do that on
another day I'm really scared to tackle
that because there's just so many and
yeah so I hope that you guys enjoyed
please don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up and comment down below any
other lip swatch suggestions and I will
see you guys in my next video so I will
talk to you later bye mwah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
