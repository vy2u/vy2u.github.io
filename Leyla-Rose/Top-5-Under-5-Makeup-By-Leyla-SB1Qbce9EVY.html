channel today I wanted to do with you a
quick video on something that I don't
think I've seen many British people do
before like makeup in the UK is a lot
more expensive I feel like there's a lot
less you can find for under five pounds
in the UK the only people that I watch
always do these videos and I love
watching them but I always find that
there aren't many UK ones so I'm just
gonna tell you guys my top 5 favourite
products that you can get in the UK for
under 5 pounds if you are from the US or
Canada it will be a lot cheaper where
you're from in the UK I don't know why
makeup is just a little bit more
expensive just like everything else
right everything else is expensive here
oh this video to be too long so I'm just
gonna jump straight into the video I
tell you guys my top 5 cracks under 5
pounds so you guys know that I love to
set my face always with a powder that
you won't ever catch myself and not
setting my whole face with a powder just
because I do tend to get oily throughout
the day even though I do get dry patches
a lot of my skin it does tend to get
quite oily so I love to set my face and
the majority of the setting powders I
tend to use are usually from the
drugstore anyways I love to use high end
powders to set my foundation I love
finding powders from the drugstore that
are really good you guys know that my
favorite one is the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouching powder absolutely my favorite
out of high-end and drugstore but my
favorite powder under 5 pounds has to be
the Rimmel stay matte this is so
affordable and I absolutely love the
consistency and I love the formulation
of this powder is really light and soft
it really is nice and mattifying without
drying out the foundation at the same
time I think doesn't make it look cakey
it's a light veil of powder where it
doesn't feel too heavy I absolutely love
this and I do feel like it comes in a
ton of different colors it does come in
a translucent shade as well as if you
can't find your exact shade go for the
translucent one this one I have is in
silky beige by doufu like it's such a
light veil of color you could barely see
it anyway so I do feel like it's mainly
a translucent powder i absolutely love
this powder and this is only 399 which
is pretty amazing if you haven't tried
this already and you're on a budget this
is definitely a powder that is worth
trying thanks
I have another Rimmel product who talk
to you about when I want to open up my
eyes or whenever I want my eyes to
larger or more awake I always tend to go
for a nude eyeliner I have Mac nude
eyeliners I have Urban Decay and nude
eyeliners and you have probably barely
seen those eyeliners in my videos I know
that you guys would always see is this
one right here this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes nude Kohl pencil and this is
in the color
0:05 beige I absolutely love this not
just because the color is so brightening
and beautiful and it just feel like it
really does open up the eyes this is
such a beautiful formula feels almost
like a gel consistency like it dries on
the waterline in a good way
and that means that it stays on all day
when I wear this pencil it doesn't move
I have the most watery eyes ever and
this does not come off do you really
feel like it's just my favorite nude
pencil I haven't tried any of their
other pencils from this line but if they
do a black one I think I'm gonna try it
because it really is waterproof and I
never feel it moving on my eyes I just
feel like it always stays so if you
haven't tried this I definitely
recommend it this is only 399 as well
it's great for everyday just to give
your eyes a little bit of a pop and to
make your eyes look nice and bright the
next thing that I wanted to mention is
this blusher and bronzer duo these are
fairly new in my life but I just feel
like they are so amazing I had to
mention them when it comes to drugstore
or affordable brands for bronzers and
blushes I definitely feel like they're
hard to come by really good quality ones
and if you've been watching my recent
videos you guys would have noticed I've
been using pretty much the same bronzer
in every single video first using this
elf bronzer and blush duo I feel like
I've already indented it so much and I
haven't had it for that long this comes
with a bronzer this one is a matte
bronzer blush but they do have its
shimmery shades as well this one is
particularly my favorite duo I
absolutely love it I think the packaging
is so cute really nice and sleek and it
feels like nice quality it doesn't feel
cheaply made at all but the product
itself is absolutely incredible they are
both so pigmented and I just love the
bronzer so much for me it's the perfect
color but the formulation itself is
amazing I wanted to show you guys this
one as well this is a shimmery version I
love the blush on this one I personally
just feel like the formula
both of these are absolutely incredible
and elf as a whole brand I think is
amazing because they do so many
incredible products for such a decent
price sitting you get a bronzer and a
blusher you know in a really good size
as well like it's a really good size of
each one plus it comes in a really nice
compact is this only 459 which i think
is just insane if you haven't gone on
the elf website yeah I definitely check
it out because they do offer free
shipping to the UK it is super amazing
and they have so much choice on there as
well so absolutely lovely next I wanted
to talk to you guys about pretty much my
favorite pigments ever these are the
berry M dazzle dust loose eyeshadows I
think they could I just call them
pigments because I think they're as
pigmented as a pigment a pure pigment
they are amazing i absolutely love berry
em I love their nail polishes but
they're loose pigments are absolutely
incredible if you haven't used these yet
just swatch them while you're in the
drugstore I don't know if these are
available worldwide I'm not sure if you
can get these in the US or anything like
that
100% if you're in the UK check them out
and Superdrug or boots they are just my
favorite these are definitely a huge
dupe for Mac pigments Mac pigments are
17 to 18 pounds now these are only 4
pounds 50 guys these are absolutely
amazing not to mention that you will
most likely never run out of these like
I've never gone through them and I have
used some of these almost every single
day at some point love these and for 450
they are unbelievable and they will just
lost you forever
the last product I wanted to mention is
going old-school if you guys watched my
YouTube since I started it or about like
a year and a half ago maybe you guys
would have seen me use these all the
time specifically one color that
actually their have anymore
these are the NYX retractable lip liners
now these were my babies like I still
use them a lot but these were my
absolute go to when I started my channel
just because they are so affordable and
it was really easy for me to stock up on
a ton of different colors not to mention
I personally love retractable lip liners
I like to apply them all over the lips
to get a super matte finish these are
definitely the most pigmented
retractable tip line is I have ever used
more pigmented than man
more pigmented than Kiko more pigmented
than rim or any other retractable lip
liners I've ever owned I certainly love
them and they come in such an incredible
color range I even have a black one of
these I don't even know where that is
these are only four pounds 50 on the NYX
UK website I just love these these are
always been my favorite lip liners to go
to and they I think they always will be
because they are just so unbelievably
pigmented and creamy and matte and I
just love them and they just define the
lips exactly how you want them and I
just love them so if you haven't tried
these yet definitely recommend them
because they are so affordable and just
the best so guys that is the end of my
top 5 under 5 pounds the video I hope
you guys enjoy a little bit of a
different video I haven't done this kind
of video in a while I don't think I
don't think I've done this type of video
in a while I'm just kind of chatting to
you guys about some products that I love
and I love telling you guys some cheap
products that I love because who doesn't
love a bargain right even if you're like
me and you like to splurge on expensive
makeup and cheap makeup I personally
