channel I just wanna wish you all a very
happy new year and I hope that you had
an amazing 2014 and 2015 it will be
amazing for you
so I'm actually filming this on New
Year's Day and as you can see I'm still
in my onesie my hair is tied up and I am
not wearing any makeup I think New
Year's Day is the day to just relax take
a day off and just chill out so I
thought this would be a great day to
film a first impressions video on a face
mask that I received from an amazing
company the face mask that I received
was from true self organics and they
gave me this really cute little package
and I'm really excited to try this so
what I thought I'd do is just do it
today because I'm gonna be pampering
myself today I'm not wearing any makeup
so I thought I would just get this
filmed for you and get it up on my
channel you guys laughed my last first
impressions video so I thought that I
would get another one done for you
so before I start the first impressions
a video I just want to give you guys a
little background on my skin just so
that you guys can relate if you've got a
similar skin type or just so that you
know what I'm talking about if you've
got a different skin type but my skin
tends to be more on the oily side and as
it's gotten to the winter it's really
bitterly cold where I am in London so it
can get quite drying and my skin has not
dried out in a lot of areas if you guys
have watched some of my previous videos
you would have seen I broke up a lot and
my skin has thank God settle down a
little bit more now this is what my skin
used to look like and this is what it
looks like now it's only really been
within the space of a couple of weeks
but my skin has really gone down and the
blemishes and the breakouts have gone
down I've still got congestion in a lot
of areas so congestion means like
blocked pores and just like stuff still
hiding in the skin I really want to get
out so this is why I really want to try
this mask and get all the toxins out of
my skin Lissa's around that this part
just here it says it is all-natural acne
detoxifying pore minimizing wrinkles
blemishes and that it
is handmade all-natural and that it has
no bad stuff in it it also healthy
website there so you can go and
thoroughly check it out and their
website is true self organics calm and
what it actually is it's a powder form
that you have to mix yourself with water
before I prepare this and mix together
the mask I'm going to go at my face as I
usually would so I'm so super excited
for this so yeah let's just I'm trying
to
as I've let my skin rest for a couple of
hours and that this is what it looks
like I can feel a huge difference in my
nose area and I feel like my nerves just
feel so much smoother look the nose can
really build up a lot of blockage in the
pores and I feel like my nose definitely
does show especially when I wear makeup
but when you apply powder you can really
see the tiny little bumps that I've got
within the pores and I just feel like
this is completely smooth now when I
first took off the mask I was really
shocked because my skin had gotten so
bad I'm not sure how it looks on camera
because I know my skin always looks so
much more red on camera than it does in
real life especially because in this
harsh lighting and but yeah I noticed
that all around this area was really
really red and I was really worried that
my skin had had a reaction so I
researched into it a little bit more and
I found out that on your first use of
using this product or anything like this
if you use calcium bentonite which is
the main ingredient in this clay mask it
can be a lot for the skin to handle so
the skin it gets red and the blood
rushes to the surface but at the end of
the day it's not a bad thing when the
blood does circulate it is a good thing
and that also does detoxify as well I've
read as well that for it to grow pink
it's just a normal thing to happen every
time you use the mask I'm not prone to
redness in the sense that only when I
rob will touch my skin or on certain
scarring areas I get redness
I don't really tend to get redness at
any other point so it was quite a shock
for me and I was like oh my god has
something what happened but it was okay
and I had a little bit left and my
boyfriend also tried it and the same
thing happened to him anything about
first impressions especially with
skincare is that you do want to see how
it works and my initial thought on this
is that it's great but I do want to see
how this goes in the future as well give
you guys an update and see how I like it
for the next month or so and yeah I'm
just gonna keep using it once a week and
just see what difference is it has a
long time don't forget to your comments
like and subscribe and I will see you in
my next video
bye as you can see guys it's done
wonders for me yet online that it is a
natural reaction to happen especially if
it's the first time well I can't have
coughing in the back
