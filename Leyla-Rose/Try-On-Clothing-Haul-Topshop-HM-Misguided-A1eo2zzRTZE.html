channel today I'm going to be doing a
trial haul
I am super excited about doing this and
I have wanted to do a trial whore for
what feels like forever I love these
kind of videos I love to watch them so
to create one was definitely something I
have wanted to do so today I'm gonna be
doing a try on haul of all the clothes I
have bought recently I recently like in
the last two weeks or so have shopped at
Topshop
H&amp;amp;M misguided and River Island so then
for shops dirty of the pieces are quite
pricy in each one like not all of them
but a few of them so that's why I feel
like I didn't get a bunch of clothes I
am hoping to go to Primark as well and
do a big shop in Primark because you
guys know I have a huge Primark ban like
I wish so much from Primark so the first
thing I wanted to talk about was this
jacket this is the only thing that I
bought from Topshop this is a bomber
that I bought from Topshop this is from
their petite range and I actually have
this in these size for believe me guys I
am NOT a 4 I honestly think these come
up oversized him on something oversized
I wanted it a little bit more fitting so
that's why a for fit me usually I am a 8
usually is what I purchased and this is
just definitely my favourite purchase of
them all because I have one in one of
these for so long if I see any more
colors I will definitely buy some more
buy really wanted this color this is in
a khaki color with gold detailing you
guys already know my obsession with gold
feel nice and warm as well it's
definitely not a winter coat but it does
feel quite nice and warm which is why I
don't want to take this to LA a very
girly dresser
some things I like to wear are girly but
I tend to always no matter how girly I
tried to make something look it always
ends up looking more on the edgy side
but that's just personally the way I
gravitate towards that was all I bought
from Topshop to ensue H&amp;amp;M I ordered from
H&amp;amp;M online and I also bought one thing
in the H&amp;amp;M store as well from H&amp;amp;M online
I purchased two pairs of jeans I
actually purchased three but one of the
jeans I decided to send back because I
just didn't like the way they looked on
me the first pair is this one right here
and this is I wouldn't say it's the pure
black because it does look kind of like
a washed out black but this is these
skinny pair of jeans and it does have
slits on the knees this is a
really nice pair of jeans it's very
fitting it fits me absolutely perfectly
than the other pair of jeans I got was
this this is kind of just a traditional
Jean color like I don't know how to
quite describe this Jean shade but it's
a little bit washed out and again it
does have rips on the knees it's not too
super ripped but it does have rips along
the knees I will try and link them down
below for you because I don't know the
exact name of these but all I know is
they are super skinny and this is just
in a normal denim shade and then also
from H&amp;amp;M I bought this in store this is
a jumper that I bought to wear on
Christmas Day I'm particularly a really
Christmassy jump up I personally don't
like wearing ugly Christmas jumpers or
traditional Christmas jumpers I just
like wearing like really pretty knitted
jumpers so this is a cream in it to
jumper and this went down in the H&amp;amp;M
sale and so I bought this for 15 pounds
I believe but I think it was originally
something like thatI again like I said
I'll try and link it down below but
because it was a sale item I don't know
if they do it anymore but I only bought
this about a week and a half to two
weeks ago so not long ago at all but I
really like this that was all I got from
H&amp;amp;M so let me show you guys what I
bought on misguided so I bought four
items on misguided
the first one was this top that I'm
wearing right now this is actually a
super cropped t-shirt and I really love
these kind of tops it's like wearing
basic items because I like to dress
things up with jewelry I like to layer
things I went to like wear jackets and
cardigans on top of stuff quite high
above your belly button so I think this
would look really good with a
high-waisted pair of jeans a high
waisted pair of leggings the next top I
wanted to show you was this one of right
here this is a faux leather t-shirt but
this is a really pretty top and I don't
own anything like this would look nice
with an all-black outfit with some like
chunky gold jewelry now this top was on
sale and I'll be honest I don't really
like this one that's why I think this is
my least favorite piece it looks super
creased on so it definitely needs to be
ironed but like I was saying I've
literally taken this tray out of the
packet so that's why it looks like that
it has these studs around the arms and I
really like that and I like the way that
it looked online but it's just unusually
loose this didn't really hug my body as
much as I hoped it would I guess the
material I wasn't expecting it's not a
stretchy material at all the last top I
bought from misguided is definitely a
different one for me
I'm kind of on the fence like sometimes
I like to really dress up and kind of
show your curves and to really you know
accentuate your so I just feel a bit out
of place if I'm showing too much skin if
that makes sense so this is definitely a
strange purchase for me not sure if I'm
gonna show a Tryon of this because it is
so revealing for me and but I will just
show you guys the top so this is the top
that I purchased this probably the only
one I'm not going to try on just because
it does make me feel quite insecure
putting this online I don't know I don't
know what what you guys think but yeah
kind of like a antique gold color almost
like an olive Gold it kind of looks
green in some lights and then black and
gold in some others keyhole cutout and
it is really nice I'm just not used to
wearing this kind of stuff I guess I
didn't expect it to show that much
because I do have other keyhole cutout
clothing but this one really does come
down and I don't really own anything
that you know shows this much cleavage
just there's y'all pack up some
confidence one day I don't know the
Internet is me lastly I just wanted to
show you guys some stuff that I got from
River Island this is a ribbed top from
River Island it's this pastel pink shade
and it has this polar
neck and around the arms in this gray
shade and I just really like the color
combinations and I don't really wear
pastels and so I decided to purchase
this and I really really like it it's a
very high neck and then also the arms
are like three-quarter length sleeves
accidently told one of my subscribers I
got this in a size 8
I'm very sorry I really hope it fits you
and I honestly thought I blew it in an 8
and when I looked at it I was like oh I
blew it in a 6 it fits me very tight
very very tight in the last item I have
to show you is this pair of shoes I have
wanted a pair of boots like these for so
long and I finally purchased them half
of the boot is suede and then I believe
the other side is leather or faux
leather I'm not even sure I really like
is these tassels that come on the side
and the heel size is really nice as gold
details on and I just absolutely love
that though guys that is the end of this
try on haul I didn't want it to be too
too long because it is my first one
