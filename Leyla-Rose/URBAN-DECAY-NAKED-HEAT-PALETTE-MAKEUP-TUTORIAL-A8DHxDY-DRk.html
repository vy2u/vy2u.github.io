I'm so happy to have you all back if you
are new the make sure you subscribe if
you haven't already and if you're not
new then make sure that you click the
little bell down below I don't usually
ask you guys to do this but YouTube kind
of messes up and I feel like a lot of
you guys sometimes miss my videos
because you don't get a notification so
clicking the bell and then pressing off
you click the bell always notify me
means you'll always be one of the first
ones to watch my videos which would be
so cool so today's video is going to be
based around at this bad boy and this is
the new Urban Decay Naked heat palette
this palette is I mean it's absolutely
gorgeous obviously I just created this
look with it and it's just so warm and I
just think I think this is my favorite
Naked palette now this is just topped
everything for me because these kind of
colors are exactly the colors I love to
wear they are super warm some of them
aren't as warm as others and then there
are some though just straight-up red
copper undertones I love it so this is
going to be my new travelling palette
for sure especially this summer and
going away literally tomorrow and I'm
taking this bad boy with me so this is
what this video is based on and I
created this look and you gave the Urban
Decay it kids one of my favorite brands
and I just feel so happy that I've
managed to get this so early you guys
you guys do you want to see how I
created this look using this palette and
also one of the new collection and
lipsticks as well then people watching
okay guys so to get started off we're
just going to be priming our eyes with
some concealer I am using a cream
concealer I'm not setting it today
because I find that's the way that decay
eyeshadow is work the best and of course
we're taking our star of the show and my
first color is sourced I'm just going to
be applying that into the crease and
that's going to be our first transition
shade - really gradually because I don't
want this to apply too much too quickly
because we really want to get a nice
even blend so that all the colors blend
so evenly together and I just find that
the first color is really important to
this so I'm learning it super well and
extending this outwards towards the tail
of my brow and just really creating the
shapes that we're going to want to be
creating with this color
okay so next we're going to be taking
the shade low blow and this color kind
of reminds me of uninterrupted by Mac
and that was one of my favorite colors
I'm going to be taking this and applying
that on the film's crease but I'm
keeping it towards the outer part of the
crease because I do want to extend the
eyes outwards and then I am just
applying it on a part of the outer
corner eyelid just to again create that
v-shape but I do want to make sure that
I am blending it super well and I'm
using lots of colors in the palette
today I'm now moving on to Cayenne which
is a little bit more of a reddish brown
and I'm taking that onto the outer
corner more precisely on the lid and
just a little bit in the crease and
again making sure to blend that really
really well and continuously building up
these colors before moving on to the
next shade and because we've got a whole
palette to work with you can use as many
of the colors as you want and I like to
use a lot cuz imma make good use of it
and then taking in flavor which I really
like ting over of that one and I'm just
applying that with a pencil brush on
that same area but it's as you can see
it's kind of getting more and more
precisely into that out of the area and
this just creates such a nice gorgeous
blend and I like doing it this way so
I'm applying the color with the pencil
brush but I'm making sure again to go
back into that blending brush to blend
the edges and then the final color that
we're going to be using is the shade
ashes and that's this color right here
and this is just a little bit more of
that dark purple but with a red
undertone and I'm just applying that on
the outer corner and really creating of
the extending it outwards and then just
buffing away the edges because we do
want to make sure that it doesn't look
really harsh we want to make sure this
blends in with all the rest of the
colors
okay so next I'm just going to be
carving out a source semi cut crease and
I don't want it to look super cut greasy
like we're keeping to the actual shape
of our eyelid I just wanted it to be a
little bit more precise rather than just
creating it with eye shadow so I used
concealer as a guideline and I'm going
to be taking the shade I don't always
say this lumber I think that's how you
say it I'm using that and it's just this
beautiful rose gold color and I'm
applying it all over the whole eyelid
although when it gets to the center part
of my lid I'm going to be taking the
shade dirty talk and that's going to be
a little bit more of a copper if you add
on to this whole I don't know it just
adds a little bit of dimension to it so
that rose gold blends into the copper
and I'm keeping that towards the darker
colors that we've got and I do want to
make sure this blends because it is a
really shimmery color blending into a
matte one so I'm just going back in with
that pencil brush just to make a nice
even blend and because I really like a
nice bright in a corner I'm taking the
shade out and I'm using that on the very
inner corner and a tiny little pencil
brush just to really brighten up that
area and yeah just create a little bit
of brightness on that inner corner so
before I move on I'm just going to be
using a makeup wipe just to very gently
clean the edge of the eye shadow now I
love the way the eye shadow looked
before but because I'm using eyeliner I
thought would be nice to wipe away the
edges to create a nice guideline for us
to create a beautiful wing so I'm just
taking a felt tip eyeliner and creating
a nice feline flick as you guys know I
love this and I haven't actually done I
feel winged liner on my channel in a
little while maybe I'm probably just
imagining that I don't think I've done
it in my last tutorial but that's long
enough for me and I'm just doing the
usual I like my wings quite thick just
because I find that it suits my eye
shapes better than a thin one and then
I'm just applying at some backstage
lashes and I think this is in Beverly
Hills that's the one so now for my
waterline I'm taking the 24/7 glide on
pencil in the shade torch and this is
from the heat collection and then also
from the heat collection I'm taking
another pencil and this is in the shade
alkaline I've just run that underneath
at the bottom lashline and I really like
the combination of these two colors I
really feel like that really warm color
on me on the inside of the eye really
makes the eyes pop and it makes my eyes
actually look a lot lighter than they
are if you have colored eyes these are
going to make your eyes pop so much and
I just love the combination of the two
so I smudged it put some mascara on the
bottom lash line and that is our eye
look but I finished off my skin
off-camera because it's all about the
eyes today and then I finished off the
lips on camera to the lipstick that I'm
using is the Urban Decay vice lipstick
in the shade you'll and this is a cream
formula I've obviously been loving cream
formulas lately I don't know what it is
maybe it's my new hair color but I've
just been loving a little bit of gloss
to my lips so I love the way this
finished off the look they're actually
another two lipsticks in the collection
but I found that this one just suited
this looked a little bit better and
that's the finished look guys I really
hope you enjoyed it if you did then
