so today I'm going to be trying an
Instagram pack and this one Instagram
you always make me laugh
this one is heating foundation with fire
and I know it sounds crazy I can't
believe I'm doing this
but I'm so curious to actually know if
this works
heating foundation with fire seems to be
the latest trend in 2016 it was using
anything but makeup brushes to apply a
makeup and it seems that in 2017 heating
things with fire is the new trend so
although I thought this is an extremely
unsafe way to manipulate how your
foundation feels we're going to be
testing today to see if this hack
actually works or if it's just used to
get people to like watch the videos
which we know it happens a lot on
Instagram I'm going to be doing is
testing a foundation on one side of my
face without fire and then I'm going to
be heating it up with fire on the other
side of my face to see if there's a
different on a little disclaimer there
me doing this video doesn't mean I'm
telling you guys that I think you should
go and light things with fire
I just I'm very curious and I thought I
would test it on camera to actually see
because I want to know if this hack
actually works and yeah I wouldn't
recommend anyone to use fire with
anything playing with fires in the joke
so just on its further disclaimer out
there me doing this is a way of me
having to do this so you don't have to
do so I don't you guys playing with fire
please don't go play with fire and yeah
let's just see if this hack actually
works and yeah just wanted to get that
difficulty we're out there Oh
after all that rambling and a disclaimer
make sure you subscribe to my channel if
you haven't already for more videos like
this and thumbs up this video for more
videos with hacks and yeah
let's get on into this video let's go
okay so I pretty much have nothing on my
skin just some moisturizer so we're
going to prime and then we're going to
do just a bit of color cracking because
I have a few little spots and I want to
cover those so that we can get the
optimum coverage and when I color
correct I kind of color great every day
so I want to do my normal routine so I
can actually see if this works I'm just
going to very quickly whizz through my
prime and color correcting routine
okay so my face is slightly tinted green
and that's normal so now I'm going to
move on to foundation so the financial
area to use today is a foundation that
I'm very very familiar with this is the
ex1 invisi wear foundation and I use
this all the time and just because I'm
so familiar with the actual formula I
thought it would be good to use this
because I've just used it so much today
we're using this on my right side which
probably looks like the left side on
camera and I'm just going to use this
normally and I'm just offering this in
with a brush which I always use with
this foundation okay so this foundation
is very easy to blend in I'd like to
burn the end with a kabuki brush so it's
already blended in it looks nice and
flawless while still looking like the
texture of skin as you can see it's like
quite glowy whilst having like a medium
to full coverage so like I said I'm very
familiar with this formula I think
nothing's gonna happen I personally
think that this is just for clickbait
conveying has become so popular in
Instagram you know obviously when you're
scrolling through Instagram the actual
photo you see before the video starts it
always seems to be something as I
caching as possible sometimes it's
something that isn't even used in the
video so click baiting has become very
recently very popular on Instagram so I
think that this is something that people
do as far as clickbait goes I don't see
what this is going to do as far as the
foundation I'm hoping that this can
actually do something so it won't be for
no reason really hope I have something
good to say about this but at the same
time I kind of hope it doesn't work as
well because I don't want anyone to have
to try this I kind of want this to stop
so a few pumps of foundation into a
spoon because that's why I see everyone
doing and fire not all my five is around
now boys going on today
what is happening this one's gone as
well literally the third lighter and the
last layer I have in my house this is a
work then no fire today
finally getting that fire to work I
think I lit this up for like I don't
know like 30 seconds maybe and the
consistency has just gone like it's not
watery this foundation is quite moosie
so like thick like whipped feeling so
there is air in there so let's try it
it does feel warm it's not hot like when
you touch the spoon you can feel that
the spoon is very hot but the foundation
itself is not burning my face but I
would call it warm hot this foundation
is whipped I think it's kind of like
reacted with the air that's within it
reason it does feel a little thick I
mean currently it kind of looks the same
but let's blend it in and see if there's
any different I see I just don't see the
point in this I really don't want to
sell what anyone does it I just don't
get it I don't understand honestly say
it does look a little bit different but
as it like improved it dramatically to
the point where it's worth setting my
foundation on fire no I don't think so I
really think that this is for clickbait
and Amin oxidize a little bit and if you
guys can tell on camera but this side
does look slightly bit darker which
makes sense because we've put fire on it
and there's air in it's probably the air
is reacting that's inside the foundation
make sense like set down the brightness
a little bit you could see the texture
of my skin a bit because sometimes it is
really hard to show a camera this side
just feels a little bit more full
coverage compared to the other side I'm
kind of just looking at a mirror it
looks a little bit dark I don't know if
you guys can actually see but Jen
generally it just looks the same just
slightly different which is bound to
happen when you burn your foundation
okay guys so that's pretty much that
I honestly at the moment don't see the
point of why anyone would do that I'm
just going to very quickly finish the
rest of my makeup just to make it look a
little bit more as I normally do my
makeup and then I'll come
I can let you guys know my final
thoughts on this makeup Instagram hack
so this is actually unintentional and I
ended up wearing my makeup for a lot
longer than I was meant to before I
thought my outro and intro but this is
how it looks after about 3 hours of
application and honestly I still don't
see the point honestly my opinions of
this is that I think it's a bit
pointless I didn't see a notice on my
skin I just think it's a bit extra
having to heat something up with fire I
just think if I wanted something to
change like the formula I honestly would
just I'll use another foundation or
manipulate the product in another way
rather than fire because I just think
it's unsafe and all of that so if I were
you I would just totally skip this hack
so this was a bit of a fail but I hope
you guys like seeing this anyway and you
learn something new learn that this
Instagram hack in my opinion doesn't
actually work let me know down in the
comments if you have a different opinion
if you've tried it and you've liked it
or if you agree with me like this video

videos like this and I will see you all
very very soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
