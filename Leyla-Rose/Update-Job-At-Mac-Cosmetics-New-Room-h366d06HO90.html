been a really long time since I have sat
in front of a camera and recorded it was
so good to be back but I thought I'd
just give you a little update of what's
been going on if you care what's going
on in my life I thought I'd just share
with you anyway I just want to let you
know that the reason why I haven't
popped the video for about 4 months is
because just after my last video I got a
full-time job with MAC Cosmetics you
probably know already if you follow me
on Instagram or anything like that but
this is just for anyone that does not
know they don't you know follow me or
anything like that yeah I just get if
one job with MAC Cosmetics so that is
why I haven't put up a video and so long
it was really really hard I was just
clearing up my room and I was getting my
room back and we decorated so I moved
into a completely different room and
I've been like trying to sort out a way
to film so with on my days off and all
that kind of stuff I've been trying to
figure out a way that's gonna be easiest
for me to film so that is why I hadn't
been able to record anything I really
really did miss recording but I'm back
now so I definitely expect more videos
to come I didn't get a chance to get
into the mode of YouTube I am definitely
back and I'm still working this I'm
still full-time so I hope that you guys
can bear with me with the this or speed
that videos get put up um obviously five
days a week I am working really really
long hours and I love my job there I
really do love working for markets such
an honor to be able to work for them and
especially the fact that I got the job
at 18 years old and never thought it was
like a a dream that I wanted to sort of
get to further on if you know I mean so
I didn't think I'd get there that
quickly but I'm so blessed to be able to
work for an amazing company and to be
able to achieve my dream so quickly but
then deafening me is that there is has
to be time for YouTube YouTube is
another passion of mine definitely
something that I want to continue so I
just wanted to let you guys know that I
am working full time so I'm not like
forgetting about YouTube it's definitely
still in the cards for me I really do
want to pursue
the dream of getting into YouTube more
so I really do hope that that can go
forth as well apart from that what does
this happen yes my groom
so obviously before my recording way of
doing things was really different no
this is my room this is my new room that
I am in which I pretty much don't leave
to be honest apart from going to work I
like laughing in my room it's so cozy
you know I've made it such a nice homely
place for me to be so let me know if you
guys want to see like a little room tour
anything like that let me know and I
really enjoyed like doing my vanity and
stuff like that so that was really fun
if you do want to see a makeup
collection one day as well please let me
know and I'd love to do that cuz I love
watching my makeup collection videos
apart from that what is new with me
nothing is really new to me I work all
the time but yeah so I just wanted to
quickly update you guys of what's going
on just do not until I come back and
start videos and just forget that I was
gone for like four months I really do
and I'm excited to be back into YouTube
I really can't wait to just get started
and record all these new videos there's
something I really want to ask you guys
please let me know any video requests
that you would like please write them
down below and I would check all of them
and I will definitely put into each one
into consideration and try and record
each and every one it really does mean
so much that you guys give your feedback
what you think of the video I have tried
to improve camera and lighting lighting
hasn't been too good today so and a
couple of my previous videos that me
I've been up I'm trying to get my
lighting situation together as well but
in general like my camera is a lot
better now which is great I'm really
happy that I've got like a good camera
that can capture what the makeup
actually looks like but the lighting
it's just a bit like unpredictable using
natural light in its just sit didn't
really work today when I recorded the
look that this is so I feel like my head
is like zooming through my own voice too
but yeah so guys thank you so much for
all the support you've given me I hit a
thousand subscribers that means more to
me than I can ex
it was 500 where I left and it doubled
and that means so much I really really
can't thank you guys enough for
supporting me and giving such lovely
comments I am back so don't worry I'm
not leaving again David thank you all
for watching guys and I will see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
