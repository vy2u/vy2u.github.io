eyebrow routine this has been highly
requested because my last one was quite
a while ago so please enjoy today I'm
going to be using my brow bar to go and
first I'm using the color on the far
left this is the best color for a dog
hair like myself because the one in the
center is a little bit more reddish I am
going to be using a small amount of that
after just to warm up my brows a little
bit but this color is perfect just an
off black Brown which is amazing so I'm
just running that through the inner part
of my brow leaving a tiny little part on
the very inner corner of my brow that's
how I'm going to fade it in a little bit
just to make it look a little bit more
blended now I'm just defining my heart a
little bit just slowly applying that
color through my brow picking up a
little bit bit by bit
making sure not to take too much
gradually building color I want I do
like a nice defined brow but at the same
time I don't want it to be too harsh the
reason why I do like a define brows
because I've got quite dark hair and
dark features if my brow is too diffused
it just looks messy and on my particular
features it just doesn't look right so I
feel that and more defined brow is a lot
more suited for myself so now I'm just
exaggerating my arch a little bit just
bringing it up slightly that way you can
just lift my face slightly and yeah I
just prefer the shape like this
unfortunately I don't
so yeah just putting a little bit more
product through and making sure that
looks as opaque now I'm just taking a
little bit of that maroon brown color
and I'm gonna be applying that through
the brow also I'm gonna be using quite a
small amount of this as you can see it's
quite pigmented this just warms the brow
a little bit
I don't like my brows to look too dark
and too much like my hair color because
my hair is literally almost black if it
looks too much like my hair color it's
too harsh for my face so I'm just
blending that in a part of my brow like
I said I was going to do I haven't put
any more product onto the brush
sometimes I like to apply a slightly
lighter color to blend that color
inwards but for today I'm not going to
be doing that I am also using my Bobbi
Brown creamy concealer in light beige
and I'm going to start carving out the
bottom of my brow this just helps again
to make it look for more defined which I
think suits me a lot better I love a
crisp sharp brow I think it just suits
my features a lot better rather than it
being a softer brow I forgot to say guys
that the brush that I was using before
is a Mac 266 brush I absolutely love
that brush for brows nothing else can
top it for me and the brush that I am
using at the moment
a Urban Decay good karma brush it's
amazing I've always stuck with this one
before covering up my browsers browser
screeches I'm just carving up the shave
more and more bit by bit just to make
sure that it doesn't take away too much
at once and I'm very very carefully just
going to carve the top part of my brow
as well making sure not to use too much
of the concealer just because it is a
little bit light so I don't want to make
it look like my brows are popping out so
I'm just altering the shape slightly
just so that I can take it down and over
it's a good way to just to find the
shape it is to change it if you've done
a little bit wrong as well
lovely so one shall finish with that
that is the end of this load
as you can see that compared to that I
need to be something a member so I'm
just fast forward that and done that
off-camera but as you can see guys it
makes such a difference and this is how
it looks with a full face of makeup I
hope that you enjoyed watching guys
please give me a like as well and I
receive video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
