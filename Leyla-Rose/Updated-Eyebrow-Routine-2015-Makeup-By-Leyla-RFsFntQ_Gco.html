channel today's tutorial is going to be
on my updated brow routine this has been
highly requested as I have changed off
the way I do my brows the shape is
different the style is different and
this is in my opinion the best my brows
have ever looked so I definitely wanted
to share with you guys how I like to
fill them in and what products I've been
loving to use to fill them in too so
firstly I'm going to be taking my
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz in dark
brown and I'm gonna start off using the
spoolie side and this is just gonna help
me to brush my brows through and just
make sure that I can see very clearly
where I need to fill in
and when I start by taking the pencil
side of the brow is and I'm gonna start
to draw on the bottom parts of my brow
and as you can see all I ever do is just
constant stroking motions almost
imagining that I'm drawing on a tiny
little hairs this will just give off the
most natural appearance and it won't
look too colored in even when I'm
applying in a bigger area you will never
see me coloring in I'll always be doing
it in soft little strokes
I'm doing at the moment is justifying my
arch and then I'm taking these spoolie
side again and just brushing it through
to make sure it looks nice and natural
and what I'm doing now is just giving
myself more of an arch because
unfortunately I don't have a natural
arch in my brow so I'm just applying
that on there just to look it a little
bit more lifted to lift my eyes upwards
and I'm always using the stroking
motions that's probably one of the most
important parts of the way I do my brows
then I'm taking these Fuli side and
brushing all my hairs into place this is
the place where I want my brows to be
when I set them so I just want to see if
there's any places where I need to fill
in a little bit more just then there was
a little gap so just want to fill in any
gaps then I'm taking the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow duo powder and this
is in the color dark brown also and I'm
gonna be taking a zoeva brow definer
brush and just defining the bottom part
of my brow again and also just flicking
it upwards its hiney bit just to give us
a little bit more of that fuller effect
then I'm taking my Anastasia Beverly
Hills clear brow gel and this is the
star of the show this makes my brows
look so much fuller I like to apply my
brow gel in an upwards motion towards
the inner part of my brow and then as I
get to the outer part of my brow I like
to push it towards the direction that
the hair naturally grows so here I'm
just kind of pushing it towards my ear
and this brow gel just make sure I brows
look so much fuller more texturized and
it just makes it look like there's a lot
more hair there so almost gives the
appearance of a much fuller brow and I
just love using a really good amount of
this because it keeps your brows in
place all day then I'm taking some
concealer this is a Kiko cream concealer
and I'm just gonna be applying this on
to the bottom of my brow not only to
highlight and lift but also to clean up
any of them little stroking motion lines
that the pencil cause this will just
kind of clean everything up and just
make it look really nice and clean I
like to use an angled brush for this
just because I feel I can get a lot of
precision
and then just to perfect the shape a
little bit more I like to go in with the
brower's again just to fill in any gaps
and also to apply a few little strokes
on the inner corner of my eye so guys
that is the end of this tutorial I hope
that you enjoyed as you can see this is
so quick and easy and it's one of my
favorite ways to fill in my brows
obviously I do like to change it up
depending on the makeup but this is the
brow shape that I like to use the
majority of the time and I hope that you
