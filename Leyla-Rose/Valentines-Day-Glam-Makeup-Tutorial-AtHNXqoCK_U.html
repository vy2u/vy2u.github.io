today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve this glamorous makeup look that
will be perfect for Valentine's Day
to get started I'm gonna be priming my
skin using my Too Faced hangover primer
this is just gonna give me a really nice
amount of hydration next I'm gonna be
taking some of this salmon tone
concealer and just applying it onto any
dark areas on the skin just to kind of
color correct very slightly just
underneath so none of the darkness shows
to your foundation
I'm just buffing this in with this Sigma
brush and just making sure it's all
blended in before we apply our
foundation foundation I'm applying today
is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD and I'm
just applying it all over to give myself
a nice flawless finish I love this
foundation because it's not too heavy
but it really gives a nice flawless
finish I'm just blending that again all
over with that same Sigma kabuki brush
for my eyes I'm just gonna be priming
with this Maybelline concealer and just
blending it in with this little kabuki
brush this will just act as an eye
primer and also just cancel out any
colors on the lid next I'm just gonna be
taking the Urban Decay Naked palette and
taking this first shade here this is
just a really nice baby brown color and
this is gonna be our first transition
shade this is gonna make all of the
other colors we apply blend really
easily and it's just gonna give a really
nice amount of definition in that crease
next I'm going to be taking buck which
is this color right here and I'm just
gonna be applying it into the deeper
part of our crease and also the outer V
I want to keep today's eyeshadow look
quite simple I'm all the really gonna be
applying any more eyeshadow colors apart
from this I just want to make sure both
of these colors are really well blended
together next I'm just taking this
eyeshadow primer potion from Urban Decay
and just applying it onto my lid and
blending it in with my finger this is
just gonna act as a base for the
glittery eye shadow we are going to be
applying I'm just applying a go-to
adhesive directly to my lids to the
pigment glitter we're gonna be applying
will adhere a lot better this is one of
the new makeup geek sparklers and this
works really well when patted on top of
a glitter adhesive so I just applied a
little bit there and just patted it on
top just to make sure that it's stuck
properly now I'm just applying my lashes
these are some really pretty lashes from
flutter lashes next I'm just gonna be
applying some concealer underneath my
eyes and I'm just gonna be highlighting
these areas and just giving us that
really nice bright under eye look I'm
also just gonna be highlighting my
forehead and my chin just to bring these
areas forward a little bit and also just
conceal then I'm just taking some of
this pixie setting spray this is one of
their glow sprays and I love this this
just makes everything look a look glowy
ah and I wanted my skin to look just
glowy and fresh so I'm just blending in
my concealer using this morphe brush
that I'm obsessed with brushes from the
elite collection and it just blends
everything in so flawlessly
I'm gonna be using my soap and glory
instead research powder as always sorry
guys I just can't not use this cuz it
just makes my skin look so flawless I'm
applying that on all the areas where I
applied the concealer I'm just taking a
big fluffy brush and just setting
everywhere else to taking some of that
Brown we applied into the crease on a
pencil brush I'm just gonna be applying
that on the bottom lash line just to
make the bottom lash line balance from
the top and just to give it a little bit
more definition on that bottom lash line
and to finish off the look I'm just
applying some mascara
to make that inner corner look nice and
bright I'm taking this light shade from
the palette and just applying it on my
inner tear-duct
I'm just gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows off-camera but I will link my
tutorial down in the description box I'm
gonna be highlighting and contouring now
I already did a little bit of
highlighting using my concealer I'm just
taking these NYX contour sticks I'm
first taking it in the medium shade and
applying it onto all the areas I would
like to appear more sunken in so I'm
just applying it on to the rounds of my
forehead under my cheekbones my jawline
and also onto these sides of my nose and
just at the tip of my nose as well to
shorten it and then I'm taking these
same contour stick but in a darker shade
and just applying it on the areas that I
would really like to appear more sunken
in and I'm just gonna be blending the
end with the same brush I used to blend
in my concealer and I just want to make
sure that it looks nice and flawless
this product blends in really really
nicely and I've been loving these NYX
contour sticks a lot lately and once I'm
done with blending all of the contour in
any areas where I wanna kind of chisel
it out or bring forward I'm just
applying some of the highlights side
from that contour stick and I'm just
blending that all in using the brush and
my fingers
to set that contour I'm just gonna be
taking this bronzy shade from the Kat
Von D shade and light palette and I'm
just gonna be applying this onto all the
areas I would like to bronze and set the
contour and then for blush I'm taking
matte peaches my get to the apples of my
cheeks to give me a nice flushed color
onto my skin
because I really want to go for that
glow I'm gonna be using two highlighters
today the first highlight I'm applying
is this cream highlight from Mac and
just applying it onto the tops of my
cheek bone and then taking uh Nastase as
highlight I'm just applying that on top
to give me that super strong glow and I
look so glowy I'm in love with this
combination and I'm also just applying a
little bit of that on to the tip of my
nose as well just to give my nose that
little button nose defect and of course
for the final and star of the show I'm
gonna be applying my lip color and first
of all just taking this Urban Decay 24
hour lip pencil and just applying it
onto the outside of my lips and then I'm
gonna be taking what is probably my new
favorite red ever liquid lipstick this
is the dose of colors Merlot
lipstick now this color I am obsessed
with it has a slight pink undertone
which makes it look so perfect for
Valentine's Day
it dries to an absolute matte finished
while still looking amazingly smooth not
to mention it's kiss proof as well which
is perfect for Valentine's Day so I hope
