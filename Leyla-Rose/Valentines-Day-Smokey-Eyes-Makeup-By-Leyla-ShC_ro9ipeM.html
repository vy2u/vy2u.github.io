today I'm going to be showing you this
Valentine's Day nude smokey eye I'm
gonna start by priming my eyes with soft
ochre Paint Pot as normal I'm gonna take
it right from my brow bone all the way
to my lid and I just find that this
helps to blend colors more seamlessly
next I'm going to be doing my inner
corner highlight and I'm going to be
using the NYX jumbo pencil in milk and
using a white pencil is just going to
brighten that inner corner and make the
eye shadow that we're using going to
stand out a lot more
next I'm going to take a shimmery
eyeshadow and I'm using dazzle lights by
Mac and I'm just going to be applying
this with a very small brush onto that
but we just applied and this is just
gonna create a really pretty a very
bright in a corner and this is going to
brighten the eyes then I'm going to take
all that glitters by Mac and I'm going
to apply that all over the lid and this
is just gonna be our general LED color
this is a very very very light gold and
it just looks almost nude so that's
gonna create the whole new defect and
then I'm also going to be taking texture
which is a warm brown color and applying
it into our crease and this is our
lightest transition shade so you want to
make sure that you blend this really
well and this make sure that all the
darker colors are gonna blend a lot more
seamlessly after next I'm going to take
on a smaller blending brush this is a
207 brush from Mac and I'm going to be
taking Folie eyeshadow from Mac also and
apply this into my outer V and this is
going to create depth in the outer
corner and this is gonna prepare for the
black that we're going to apply and it
just makes the black end up blending a
lot better and then after I've applied
that I'm going to go back into that
texture color with the blending brush
and just blend that Brown upwards so
what I like to do when I'm working with
dark colors is go back and forth from
colors so I'm going back in with that
dark brown and then I'm gonna blend that
up again and just keep going back and
forth then I'm just going to wipe the
side of my eye and what this is going to
do is just create a really sharp
seamless line and it just looks a lot
more well done and flawless then I'm
going to take feline eye pencil by Mac
and apply it to to my outer corner and
it's going to deepen the crease even
more and make the black appear more
intense I'm taking black out by Urban
Decay this is the blackest black I own
and I'm just applying that with a pencil
brush and patting it on top of that
pencil and it just makes the black look
a lot deeper and like I said before I'm
gonna go back on for from brushes and
colors so I'm gonna blend out that black
and then I'm gonna go back in to black
and then keep blending it out so I just
like to go up back and forth and just
keep blending every step so here I am
just applying a little bit more black
with the same pencil brush and then I'm
going to go back in with that same
blending brush and blend out even more
so once you are happy with the depth of
the eyeshadow that you are doing you
want to start to apply your eyeliner I
found it really hard to capture it on
camera today so you're not gonna see a
lot of it I just did a really thick line
of eyeliner on my lid and this is really
simple I did it quite thick but you can
do it however thin or thick you want I
just thought a thicker line just goes
with the whole dramatic look and I
didn't want it to be too winged out
today so I kept it to be just a normal
line on my lids then I stuck on my false
lashes and I'm just applying them with
my tweezers and I find that this really
helps to just create a really nice
fluttery effect next I'm going to be
applying my foundation onto my skin I'm
using my Giorgio Armani which is my Holy
Grail foundation and applying it all
over
and I'm just gonna be buffing this in
with a rounded real technique brush
there's no technique to this really I
just sort of going round motions
I don't want anything to full coverage
because I am applying some concealer so
I'm just applying that concealer under
my eyes this is the Maybelline of fit me
concealer and I'm just applying it under
my eyes and also the other areas that I
would like to highlight and I'm blending
that in with the same brush because I
want to create a really seamless effect
I don't want to be able to see where the
color starts and finishes you wanted to
or blend into each other very seamlessly
then I'm just going to powder my skin
just to make sure that my foundation
stays on really really well and of
course as it's Valentine's Day you want
to make sure that your foundation does
not come off so I'm making sure to
powder it really really well and then
I'm gonna be drawing in my eyebrows
unfortunately at the moment I am trying
to grow out my eyebrows so drawing my
eyebrow shape has been a little bit
differently recently so I'm just taking
a pencil and just drawing out the shape
that I want and it never looks as clean
and crisp as when it's freshly and done
and when the hairs are plucked out but
as I am trying to grow them I'm trying
to leave them alone and then I'm just
brushing that through as well then I'm
going to take feline eye pencil again
and apply that to my waterline and then
I'm also going to take it in between my
lashes and underneath my lash line and
this is just going to create further
definition on the bottom lash line and
this just makes it look a lot more
balanced because again there's a lot
going on at the top you want to make
sure that looks a balanced with the
bottom and then I'm gonna blend that out
with texture again and just make sure
that it looks a nice and smoked out then
I'm gonna take sarmat mascara onto my
bottom lashes and then we're gonna get
started on two of my a bronzer I'm going
to be bronzing all over my skin with my
Bobbi Brown bronzer just to give us that
beautiful golden look
so I'm just applying my highlight and
the highlight that I'm applying is the
mary-lou manizer and this is the most
gorgeous highlight in the whole world
and then I'm applying my lip liner which
is creamer spice lip liner and this is
my again a Holy Grail lip liner I love
it and I'm just going to be lining all
my lips with this color and then I'm
gonna go in with Gerard cosmetics nude
lipstick again it is an amazing color so
I decided to go with a nice simple nude
and what I love about this is that it
has a really nice peach undertone so if
