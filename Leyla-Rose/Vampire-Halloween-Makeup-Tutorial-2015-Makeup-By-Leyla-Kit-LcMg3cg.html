today I'm going to be showing you all
how to achieve this a vampire makeup
tutorial if you do want to know how to
transform yourself into a vampire for
Halloween this year and just keep on
watching
to get started I'm going to be priming
my skin using my makeup forever step 1
smoothing primer this will just smooth
my skin and just prep it for foundation
for my foundation I'm gonna be taking
the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
in the color bone I wanted to go for a
fairer skin but I didn't want it to be
extremely white so I just took the
lightest foundation that I owned and I'm
just going to be applying this all over
my skin and just bouncing my Beauty
Blender all over just to blend it in to
the skin I didn't want to go for
anything
pure white so that's why I'm not using a
face pain or something like that if you
are naturally fair then just go for your
normal shade of foundation you don't
need to go for a pure white if you're
naturally fair if you do have a deeper
skin tone then just go a few shades
lighter
I'm also just blending that around my
eyes to act as a base for the eyeshadow
we're going to be applying to set my
under eyes and also the rest of my face
I am using mac emphasized powder and
this is just going to set everything in
place and also just mattify these areas
also to contour I'm going to be taking
Mac copperplate eyes shadow this is
because I needed to go for something
very gray toned
- seriously contour and make the cheeks
look a lot more sunken in first of all
taking it on these sides of the forehead
just to kind of bring my face inwards
and to make my face look more narrow and
also I'm going to be taking it under the
cheekbone this is really going to make
our face with a lot more gaunt because
it's such a gray shade it's going to
look a lot like a contour so if you use
a gray shade it really will start to
change the shape of your face
you
I'm also going to be using that same
shade on a smaller brush and just use it
to contour my nose to deepen up the
contour and to warm it up a slightest
amount I'm taking this contour powder
from Mac and I'm just going to be using
it to really deepen up the deepest part
of the contour so right in the hollow of
the cheek and also on the sides of my
forehead as well and as you can see it's
just giving it a lot more dimension it's
really making it look like I have very
defined cheekbones when in reality I
have one of the roundest faces over for
my brows I'm just going to fill them in
using my uh Nastasia Beverly Hills brow
Wiz and I just wanted to go for a fairly
natural shape and just kind of the way I
usually tend to fill them in just
because I didn't want to go for anything
too crazy but you can fill them in with
like a jet black if you wanted to or
make them super thin I just wanted to
stick to my natural shade
I'm just going to be taking some of that
foundation I used for my face and just
use that to shape the brow a little bit
more and then I'm going to be using my
Anastacio clear brow gel as well just to
set them into place I'm going to go
ahead and do one hi off-camera and we'll
get started on the next one to get
started on the eyes I'm going to be
taking makeup geek Peach Smoothie
eyeshadow and this is going to be our
first transition shade this is going to
make all of the dark and dramatic colors
just blend a lot more easier and I
definitely recommend using a color like
this which is more similar to your skin
tone too just make everything blend more
flawlessly then taking makeup geek
bitten I'm gonna be taking this into the
crease as well and this is definitely
the star of the show this is what gives
it that really bruised and bloody effect
all around the eyes it's a really nice
reddish cranberry shade and it just
really adds to the whole effect so I'm
just taking this into the crease and I'm
dragging out towards the tail of my brow
to really extend the eyes upwards and
I'm gonna take it in the inner corner
again to create that bruised effect on
the top lash line then taking Mac black
track eyeliner I'm just going to be
taking this onto my lid and using it as
a base for the black eye shadow we're
going to use this is going to make the
black eye shadow and put a lot more
pigmented
then taking makeup geek corrupt
eyeshadow I'm going to be patting this
on top and like I said it's just going
to make it appear a lot more pigmented
and it is going to set this eyeliner in
place as well so it won't move all day
I'm going to take this black shade into
the crease as well to blend into that
partly red shade I'm just making sure to
go back into that previous brush just to
make sure I blend it really well next
taking these Eldora false lashes aren't
these just the most gorgeous lashes
you've ever seen they're so stunning
they are perfectly wispy they do extend
towards the end so they're really going
to drag our eyes upwards I'm just
applying those and also applying some
mascara to make my natural lashes blend
into the false ones next I'm going to
take that same bits and shade and we are
going to start to take this all the way
down onto our bottom lash line and just
smudge it all the way down almost to our
cheek and this is going to make our eyes
that really bruised and it just makes us
look really almost unwell like a vampire
so I'm just gonna make sure to smudge
and blend this well we don't want it to
look too neat because you know bruising
isn't necessarily natural blended
eyeshadow but I'm going to be taking a
black kohl pencil as well and apply this
into the waterline and I'm also going to
take this on the bottom lash line as
well and we are going to be smudging
this to make sure that it looks nice and
blended and smoky
to create the veins on the bottom
lashline I'm going to be mixing these
two shades from the makeup forever flash
palette to create a deep purple a red
shade and I'm going to be using this
with a very very small brush and just
creating little branches to create veins
as you can see I'm just drawing lines
and then branching them off almost like
a tree you can look at pictures of veins
if it makes it easier for you but as you
can see I'm just drawing lines in random
areas and then just kind of branching
them off and again this just really
gives it that horrible dead looking
effect and then I just mixed in some
more of the blue to create a little bit
more of a dark purple shade and I just
applied a little bit of this just
because I thought it would look a little
bit more realistic having two shades of
veins because we actually do have blue
veins in our body as well so I just
thought it would add a little bit more
realism to it if there is any realism in
this
I'm just blending out that black a
little bit more just to make it look
super smoky and I'm gonna be applying
some mascara onto my bottom lash line to
for my lips I decided to go for a deep
red lip just because I thought it was
necessary you can go for any lip color
you want I definitely feel like a red or
a purple shade is really going to top
off this look and just make it look
vampy I mean there's a reason why they
call it vampy vampy vampire you know
I've been I'm just using V no lip liner
to line my lips and then I'm taking Mac
sin lipstick and this is just a perfect
shade it's a really nice deep burgundy
but I did want it to be a little bit
darker so I went on top of it with
Jerrod cosmetics cherry cordial to
create the little bite marks on the neck
this is totally optional you don't have
to do this but this is just a little few
extras I wanted to show you guys I've
just applied a little bit of that bitten
eyeshadow in two circles and just
blending it on the neck
just applying a little bit of black into
the center just to give it a little bit
of depth where the teeth were to sunk in
and then just blending that out
and then I'm taking some of this blood
paste and just applying it in the center
as well this does dry so I'm waiting for
it to dry and then I applied some fake
blood just to drip down it and again
this just gives it a really nice top job
it looks like we've just been bitten and
we've turned into this crazy vampire
basically and then of course you can go
for a little bit of blood down the side
of the mouth I definitely say you can
totally go for some contacts I think red
contacts would look amazing with this
and not to mention some fangs as well so
