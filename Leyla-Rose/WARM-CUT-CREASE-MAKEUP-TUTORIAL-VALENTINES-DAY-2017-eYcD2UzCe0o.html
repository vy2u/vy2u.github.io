amang main hey guys and welcome back to
my channel so today I have this makeup
tutorial for you it's a very eyes
focused look it's you know kind of all
about the eyes so I've gone to this pink
toned cut crease with a glitter accent I
love the way this was turned out and I
hope you guys love it as well make sure
you subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already and also give this video
a big thumbs up for more makeup
tutorials I want to do a few more
Valentine's Day inspired makeup look so
comment down below and let me know what
kind of look you want to see apart from
that let's get on into this talk-through
tutorial okay so stars is one of my eyes
already done and I'm going to go
straight into the other eye I'm just
taking some concealer firstly and just
popping onto my eyelids I kind of like
to put a lot of concealer on my eyes and
I'm doing a look like this because you
really want it to be totally clean
because it's all about the blending it's
all about how the eye shadow actually
looks wanna make sure that area is nice
and clean of any colors or just the one
solid shade so I like to use a lot of
concealer in this area and then I'm just
going to be setting that with some
powder just to make sure that it's not
sticky and it all had too much powder
just enough to make sure that it's not
like sticking to my eyelid so today I'm
going to be using makeup geek eyeshadows
and when I first take Peach Smoothie
which is a really great fast transition
shade it kind of uses in any look just
to make things blend a lot easier I want
to take this on a large blending brush
and just kind of be pushing it into the
crease this step is very standard if you
just want to apply this all over the
area where you're going to be applying
eyeshadow in the crease and then we can
move on to the next shade if we're going
to be having a lot of detail as well
because obviously on this size you can
see the ocean it does go up quite high
you can take up this first transition
color quite high up to the eyebrow not
all the way up you still want to see
your skin tone but because it's quite a
light shade on my skin tone it's okay to
go up quite a lot onto this to have it's
like Valentine's Day theme so I've
decided to go for a few little pink
shades throughout the island this is
totally optional like it's still really
wearable when it doesn't look totally
pink because I know that pink isn't
really a car that a lot of people like
to wear are we taking a makeup geek
cupcake and I'm going to be a
this into the crease also visually I
like to go for quite a like orange toned
crease but this just adds a little bit
more of that pink tone to it and it is
really fast to transform that color
slightly so I'm going to be using this
in the crease and we will be using the
same shade later on the lid as well to
stop this out for orangie shades if you
prefer that or even cool tones this is
very open I'm just using these kind of
shades because I wanted to be quiet
sometimes it's tiny for me personally I
like to wipe it and as you can see on
this slide it comes down quite low so
don't be afraid to kind of just blend
this outward next i'm going in with
makeup geeks cabin-fever does our next
color I'm going to be popping this into
the deeper part of our crease this is
obviously a brown shade but it is warm
so it just adds that same kind of warmth
to the eye and now we're going to start
to curl up the mortgage shape so I'm
keeping this in the creams don't worry
about getting on the lid because we are
going to be cleaning the up later on
with concealer and I'm kind of just
making sure that when my eye is closed
that that color is just peeping up above
the crease we see everyone's eye shape
is different but I like a good way to
judges to look straight because you can
see where your crease actually creases
because if you do it like that and then
sometimes you look upwards it doesn't
look the same it's going back with a big
brush of the bear fat cupcake shade and
just blending out the edges to make it
look nice and smooth taking Americana on
a smaller blending brush this one is the
zoeva two to four brush and I'm just
going to be focusing this darker Brown
into that crease area and this is a lot
more concentrated you don't miss to be
going up this high but this does create
a lot of that smokiness and then you
want to kind of focus it a bottler outer
corner and we are going to be applying
some black later on so this is just kind
of helped to prepare for that black are
we taking some concealer from this Mac
concealer palette and I'm just going to
be taking any cream concealer it doesn't
have to be this this is just near me so
improvement onto a small definer brush
and just using that to carve out a
half-cup crease on to the front
of my I coven ill-being eyeshadow from
makeup geek also I'm just going to be
setting that whole portion of my eye and
just setting that whole area before we
go in with any other colors okay so now
that must totally start I'm just going
to be taking a lot of cupcake and just
placing that on the center of the lid
but like I said you don't have to do
this if you feel like pink isn't your
color like you're not really soft about
Valentine's Day or I don't know you just
want to use another color that you could
totally like switch this out for
anything
next taking corrupt which is a black
eyeshadow I'm going to be taking this on
a pencil brush and then popping this on
the outer corner of my eye to create
some smokiness so right on this outer
portion where that cut crease is I'm
just going to be putting some of it
there I'm just going to be blending this
and making sure that it's starting to
blend in really well with the rest of
the shadows so now is one of the most
satisfying part I'm going to be cleaning
up the edge just to kind of like make
everything even into know what shape we
want to go for now that we have our
clean and you know we can see exactly
like the shape we're going for so now I
know how much black I want to add and
then I'm just taking a little bit of
that brown eyeshadow use in the crease
and just using that to blend together
the black and the pink right here on the
lid now eyeshadow is pretty much good on
the lid I'm going to be moving on to
eyeliner now I can never speak of I'm
doing this but the kind of shape that I
want to go for kind of just a straight
line going across the lid just to
complement the eye shape nothing too
winged or anything like that and then we
kind of just want to smudge the edges a
little bit just to blend in to the rest
of the eyeshadow and I'm going to be
taking this part how to use eyeliner to
do this next we're going to be adding
that glitter to accent right on that cup
crease and literally all you want to do
for this is just follow the shape that
you created for the cup crease and just
draw on some glitter I decided to use
silver for this because I always go for
gold whenever I do anything glitter so I
decided to have silver today just to
make it look a little bit brighter and
different and finally for my lashes I'm
going to be taking these sizes
why I shall ashes and I'm going to be
popping them onto my lashline as well as
some of the scar to just blend them in
together be sure none of my eyes are
done I've decided I'm going to do my
base and my eyebrows off camera B we did
want this to be an eye focus tutorial
we'll leave a link to my arrow routine
and also my flawless foundation routine
down below as well because they are kind
of just like my everyday things I like
to do for a full coverage foundation and
also my eyebrows as well and I'm just
going to very quickly finish off the
bottom lash line
very very simple I just want to go in
with some black eyeliner to my waterline
and also pop it underneath as well to
create a smoky look and just smudge it
out with some of that brown eye shadow
and then finally for my lips I'm going
to be taking cheat lipliner from
colour-pop and just lining all around my
lips with this and then on top of that
I'm going to be taking some of these
soft matte lip cream in the shade
abu-dhabi so guys this is the finished
