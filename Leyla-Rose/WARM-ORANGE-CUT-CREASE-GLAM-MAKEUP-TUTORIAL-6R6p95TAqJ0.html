so today I have a makeup tutorial for
you guys and I'm actually gonna be
showing you how to achieve this look and
I am gonna be doing a cut crease with
two lip options I'm actually gonna be
using the new incredible listen hard
girl lip pain and this is basically the
world's first UV neon that lip pain it's
insane this is the lip color without the
UV and then this is what it looks like
with a UV light on it it's just insane
and so perfect for festival season so
this is actually available in two shades
but I'm gonna be using the orange shade
and then showing you how to turn it into
this as well if you want to go for
something more natural and something
just really cute and peachy so if you do
want to see this whole makeup tutorial
including how to achieve the two lip
colors as well then just keep on
watching so to begin with we're going to
be using the naked heat pallet on our
eyes and I'm starting off with this
light brown shade as you can see my acne
scars have come out to play and you know
what I always get so scared with showing
these on camera because I'm so scared
I'm gonna get teased but you know what
they are what they are and they are
normal and my skin is healing so that is
why you can see them and I'm not gonna
bother cropping them out because they're
there so yeah anyway so I'm starting off
with this in the crease and I'm gonna
use this as my first transition shade
it's super important to use the lightest
shade fast and to gradually go into
darker colors especially when you're
doing a look that is so intricate I
guess and it you want it to look the
most blended out and blown out so I'm
starting off first with those two colors
mixed together I really like mixing
together colors especially at the
beginning but you want to make sure that
you're starting off light so I'm just
using this color and just starting in
the crease and starting to blow it
upwards
I had already primed my eyes and that's
something super important for a look
like this as well you really want to
make sure your eyes are primed so that
the eyeshadow has something to stick to
next I'm gonna be taking this darker
warmer Brown and we're gonna be using
this in the crease and again we're
starting off right where my crease
begins and we're slowly blowing this
outwards to blend into that previous
shade we don't want to just take it all
the way up so that it touches our
eyebrows and we lose that blend we
really want it to look gradual and we
really just want this to look seamless
like it's almost blending out into your
skin tone
and then what I do like to do is go back
into the first brush that we started off
with with nothing on it and just use
that to blend the edges then I'm going
in with this darker brown and using this
on the outer V area of my eyelid and
keeping this quite low because we don't
want to take this all the way up again
if this goes up too high it's gonna look
quite messy so we want to keep this
positioned quite you know specifically
in that outer V and then blend out the
edges and I do like to do that by going
back into my previous brush and I'm also
going into a little bit of an orangey
shade just cuz I really wanted to pick
up on that burnt orange color and I use
this eyeshadow from makeup geek to do
that and this just really helps to again
blend everything all together but then
also to add that pop of color back in
and now I'm gonna be cutting the crease
I'm doing a half cut crease today and
I'm using some concealer on a concealer
brush to just carve out what I want my
cut crease to look like basically as you
can see I start off low I don't go all
the way up as high as I would like it to
be I very gradually go up to the shape
that I want it to be because obviously
once you've carved it you kind of can't
go back I mean you can end up blending
it but it's best to try and get it done
on the first time because it does look a
lot neater so I'm very gradual with this
and just very slowly creating that
almost half cut crease effect and then I
took some pigments and use this to set
the concealer into place and of course
to add that sparkle the first pigment
that I used is from Barry M and then the
next one that I'm adding on now is from
makeup geek and this is just a slightly
more golda version than the first one
just to add a little bit more dimension
when you first kind of look at the eyes
and then I will want to add a little bit
more orange using a blending brush onto
that very last portion to set for the
cut crease and I really wanted to make
sure that I added this in because it
really just adds to the look although
we've got that orange kind of going on
in the crease it's really nice to add
that onto the lid as well I definitely
feel like it adds dimension and color to
this look
and then finally just to add back a
little bit of that smokiness I'm just
gonna be taking that dark brown that we
used into our crease previously and just
adding a little bit more just because we
kind of went over it with concealer and
just making sure that it blends into
that orangie shade that we just applied
next I'm gonna be taking some gold
glitter liner and adding that detail
onto the very just slightly above where
we cut the crease I wanted to add the
whole clip in for this because I wanted
you to see my hand slightly shaking I do
not have a steady hand whatsoever they
always say you need to have a steady
hand to be able to do eyeliner well or
do any of these things but I definitely
do not I get a lot of anxiety and that
causes me to shake quite a bit just for
no reason I just wanted to show you that
if you guys don't have the most steady
hands you can absolutely do this as you
can see I'm kind of leaning my pinky on
my cheek and that gives me balance so if
you do struggle with this then you can
definitely do it just practice and just
take your time with it
so I really wanted to leave that whole
clip in so you could see I'm human so
I'm now going in with some glam fi
lashes and I'm just using some mascara
this is the bad gal bang that mascara
from benefit and I'm just using that on
my natural lashes first just to make
sure they're nice and coated and that
way they blend in really seamlessly to
the fake ones we're going to apply on
top
okay guys so next I'm just gonna get my
base done and I'm not gonna show this on
camera because honestly I have some
based tutorials coming up very soon and
I show you guys so many base tutorials I
didn't want to bore you with this so I
just did my foundation concealer and
powder and now I'm going in with my
bronzer this one is from Stila and I'm
just applying this around the outer
perimeter of my face you guys know the
deal just applying it on the sides of my
forehead under my cheekbone just to give
myself that little pop of color and then
just using a more precise brush just to
just look like the slightest bit of
contour but I didn't want my face to be
too calm told today I generally don't
like my face to look too structured
anyway I'm applying some blush just
because there's so much color going on
the eyes and then we're gonna be using
color on the lips as well you just want
to kind of add that in and then of
course I wanted that glow so I used that
Finn tea Beauty highlights honestly my
favorite I'm in love with this and I
just used it on the tops of my
cheekbones on the tip of my nose and now
we're just finishing off with the eyes
so I'm actually using a lip liner on my
waterline now this probably isn't
recommended I'm not gonna recommend it
to you guys and tell you guys to put lip
liners on your eyes but I really wanted
to try it so I don't know if this is
like safe but I did it and I'm not
telling you guys to do it but I was fine
so yeah proceed with caution obviously
this is intended for your lips not your
eyes but it really added a nice amount
of color to my eyes and I just used that
same orange shade we put in the crease
and just I used it to blend it out and I
really liked it I finished off with some
mascara and then just some of the
highlight that I used on my nose and my
cheekbones on the inner corner and then
of course finally for the lips I'm
taking that same lip why not I didn't
have a lip liner that matched the
incredible lip pain so hopefully this is
okay obviously this was just in the same
I was just like damn this is this is
bright obviously you guys know I don't
wear bright lip colors very often so
this is definitely on my confort zone I
really wanted to show you guys though
because it's so fun honestly for
festival season if you guys are going to
any festivals this would be insane so
this is in the shade I'm hot right now
and this is the orange shade there's
also a really bright pink shade I feel
like the orange suited my skin tone
perfectly so I wanted to go for inch one
and now and I just used some concealer
just to clean around the edge
just cuz I didn't have a lip line and
that matched this perfectly but look how
it looks with UV honestly I was so
shocked and I really liked the way that
this actually turned out it's a really
pretty color
although it's really intense and
definitely outside of my comfort zone I
love it
but I also wanted to show you guys
because it's me how to tone this down as
well so I kind of went overboard with
applying foundation all over my lips and
then I just went around the outside of
my lips using my normal lip liner which
is remote cappuccino and this just kind
of is like a shadow color almost just to
define my lips so instead of just
staying with Foundation lips I use a
little bit of this lip paint and just
patted it onto my lips with my finger
and it created the most gorgeous peachy
shade as well so you could also do this
and apply more if you want it to be a
little bit more intense this product is
definitely buildable and just build it
up slowly until you're at your desired
amount of neon so I hope you guys
enjoyed this makeup tutorial with the
two lip options I honestly love the way
this look turned out if you guys want to
