so today I have a really really exciting
video for you I'm so excited for you to
see this today I'm going to be testing
out a weird makeup method it is
relatively new I don't feel like I've
seen this on YouTube yet I did see this
on Instagram and I want to make sure I
give credit to the person that I did see
this on Instagram I actually saw this on
Bella beauty's video on Instagram and I
believe it's inspired by and pretty Ness
as well so she's also done it I'm pretty
sure these are the only two people that
have done it so all credit goes to them
I didn't come up with this idea I'm just
going to be testing it out pretty much
what we're going to be doing today is
testing out to see if we can make our
base as flawless as possible by
submerging our face totally in water I
know we're going to see if it works or
not I'm not gonna give anything away or
don't you guys to know if it works at
all you guys to know my opinions of it
we're just going to get straight into
the videos before we get into the video
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already for more videos
like this and please thumbs up if you
want me to do more testing out makeup
products testing out with beauty tools
testing out with methods just let me
know but for now let's just see if this
works
everything you apply on your base pretty
much seems like you do it as normal
apart from the powder so what I'm going
to be doing is just doing my normal
foundation routine
I'm not going to too much detail because
I did a video not too long ago on how I
achieve my flawless base so I'll leave a
link to that just here because I do show
you guys lots of tips and tricks also
products that I like and also how I
cover up acne scars as well so don't
forget to watch that video I'll leave
the link there and also down in the
description box I'm just going to be
priming my face as I always do and I'm
just taking me to faced hangover primer
just to make sure my face and doesn't
feel dry especially because we're using
so much powder today but then we're
going to be dunking our face into water
so I don't really know how that's gonna
fit my dry skin feel and then stay care
of my pores I'm going to be taking some
of the one heck of a block primer from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and just apply this onto my
nose and my cheeks so now that my face
is primed I'm going to be taking my
foundation I'm taking me to Phase two
Born This Way band-aid
today and I'm just going to be applying
this all over and I'm going to be
blending this in with my Beauty Blender
I said then I will be taking some
concealer I'm taking the Maybelline fit
me concealer and I'm just going to be
applying this under my eyes on my
forehead and also on my chin and then
just to the under eyes I'm going to be
taking some of the Naked skin concealer
this is in the color fair I'm just
popping a little bit just because I want
to brighten up this area and then of
course to blend this all in I'm going to
use my Beauty Blender
so pretty much everything is looking at
relatively flawless as it is so I'm
going to be taking my laura mercier
translucent setting powder now and now
is when it gets a little bit more
interesting so as i've seen in the
videos it seems like they apply a lot
more powder than it seems like normal
people do when they bake so I'm going to
go a little bit crazy with the
translucent powder just to see how much
the water actually takes away of the
powder let's see if we're left with any
residue let's just see if this actually
ends up being flawless because I don't
know I'm very skeptical about this I'm
very like not sure if this is going to
work or not
it seems like it worked really well with
people on Instagram I'm going to be
applying my powder on a clean Real
Techniques Beauty sponge and I'm just
gonna be breaking up the powder and just
putting it over my face so really I mean
I guess you want to put it everywhere
because your whole face is going to be
in the water
so pretty much there's a layer of powder
all over my face and I think this is
about what they did on Instagram I mean
the Laura Mercier powder always looks a
lot thicker than what it is right now
it's for the final moment of testing I
have a little tray of water downstairs
and it's just sitting there right now
I'm going to fill it all the way to the
top and we are basically going to dunk
our face in I basically used a Pyrex
clear dish that you basically like cook
a lasagna in or something like that bars
I know I'm pretty sure you're meant to
leave it in for about 30 seconds really
interested to see what's gonna happen
I'm hoping it works I am a little bit
skeptical I'm not really sure how this
is going to work like the science behind
it
but let's try it
hey guys I just run up hopes to traffic
that was a very weird sensation I am so
cold cuz that water was freezing so this
is obviously initially what it looks
like everything is wet my eyelashes my
eyebrows everything is wet so that's why
it's important not to do your eyebrows
or your eye makeup before you do this if
you are going to do this
um I mean actually the way that it looks
is quite fullest surprisingly it looks
extremely full coverage but I don't
really know what to think of it's still
quite wet let's just see how it dries I
mean I'm gonna be honest with you guys
the more it's dry it just looks really
cakey to me I don't know if I just like
applied too much powder maybe horse
drying I can see there's some powder
this getting revealed that has it come
off - try dusting it off is it dry it
was like it's kind of stuck like that on
the monitor from why I can see on camera
it looks super flawless but the closer
that I kelp I just feel like it's
bunched up in a lot of my pores so the
final test is to see what it looks like
with a full face of makeup so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my full face and I will
be right back tada
guys this is what it looks like with a
full face of makeup on and I must admit
I do prefer it now that I did before I
applied a full face of makeup on I do
feel like it went really smoothly it
looks kind of more normal than it did
beforehand
I just think because I just had
foundation on it just looked a bit
strange but now that I have other things
on different features to balance out I
do feel like I like it a lot more till
it's a little bit too heavy personally
for my preference it's not really
something that I tend to go for and I'm
not sure if I would do this again just
because it was a lot of hassle there's
still a lot of water downstairs I'm
gonna have to clean up but definitely
it's worth a try if you have problematic
skin like mine then you'll definitely
notice that that powder kind of clings
on to certain areas rather than others
and also if you love a full coverage I
just feel like it's worth a try even if
you're not too sure just give it a try
one day and see what you think
to be pleasantly surprised on how
flawless it looks especially now that my
full face is on when I do this again I
don't think I would just because I feel
like personally this is still a little
bit too heavy for me I thought it was
going to be a train wreck I thought it's
gonna be like you know when you cry when
you have makeup on and then you kind of
get them tears streaming down your face
and there's just loads of lines
everywhere that's almost what I imagined
there's none of that it just looks sort
of a little bit cakey on certain areas
of my skin just because my skin is
relatively problematic but apart from
that definitely feel like this was worth
a try and I really hope you guys enjoyed
