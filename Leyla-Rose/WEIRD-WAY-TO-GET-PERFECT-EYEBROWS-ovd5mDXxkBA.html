channel as you can see I'm really
excited today because we are going to be
trying something kind of different today
I definitely want to start testing more
weird methods because I just think it's
really fun so the last wave method that
I done was a word method on how to get
flawless face makeup and today is going
to be on how to get flawless eye brow
basically what we're going to be doing
today is taking white makeup using it as
a stencil for our eyebrows plucking
trimming and tinting and just seeing if
we can do it basically all in one step I
did find this on Instagram I will just
post the picture right here this is
pretty much what we're going to be doing
today and the actual artists that I
found it on on Instagram all of the
instructions were pretty much in another
language I believe it was Russian so I
totally didn't understand it I pretty
much just saw the picture and was like
you know what hey I'm gonna try my own
version of this thank you so much for
the inspiration I'll link her Instagram
it down below also before we get into
the video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already as
well as follow all of my social media
which is pretty much makeup I Laila on
everything and also follow my blog
channel too because I've been posting a
lot more blogs on there so definitely
don't forget to subscribe to that
channel as well as this one without
further ado let's just get straight into
the video and see if this weird method
actually works first of all I'm just
taking some Bioderma onto a cotton pad
and I'm just going to be cleansing the
eyebrow area because you want to make
sure that your eyebrow area is clear of
any oils and I've also brought you in a
teeny little bit closer so that you guys
can see what I'm doing so basically what
we're going to be doing is drawing a
halo of white around our eyebrows we're
going to be plucking in the white area
and leaving anything in the normal area
to be and then later on we're going to
be basically tinting that as well so
I've never done this before we're going
to be seeing how easy this actually is
this could be a natural disaster to be
honest so as you can see this eyebrow is
a little bit patchy right now I'm just
rushing my eyebrows upward so that we
can draw all of our pain underneath this
area and then we can brush the heads
downwards a little bit and then do the
upper area sometimes you use this method
anyway when it comes to concealer but I
never go as crazy as to use a bright
white basically tin can't stick to oil
so oils in makeup like this to have as a
barrier around the eyebrow will
basically help us out a lot like I said
I've never done this before so let's
it works out otherwise I'm going to be
walking out with really messy
caterpillar eyebrows so I'm just taking
some of this white and we are basically
going to start to draw out what we want
to I browse to look like taking this on
a flat definer brush so we can really
carve out the shape that we won
I'm just patting this in with my finger
a little bit just so we can take off any
excess don't usually take a lot from the
top like I usually leave a lot of the
hair at the top but this is quite
worrying
I'm just going to do the other one make
sure everything looks as even as
possible before I start fixing anything
together
the things I try for you guys honestly
but now we have a guy pretty much of
what has we can remove and what has we
don't want to remove so anything that's
in the area with no white products we
want to totally leave alone and he has a
sitting on the white area that means we
are good to go and we can pretty much
remove it look at this white paint just
seeing on my eyelids so it's time to
start packing
okay so also I'm going to be doing is
just pushing all the brow hairs upwards
and because the way my brow shape is I
like to trim the very tops of my hairs
because they get curly and long so I'm
going to trim them and what's good about
this technique is that again there's
like a little bit of a border to see
where the hair should stop so pretty
much all of my hairs and our plucked on
the white areas I've trimmed my hairs
down a little bit so that it fits within
the little border that I've drawn and
pretty much now we're going to go in and
tint and I'm using the Eilert die brow
eye kit in black now my hair is actually
not black I don't know it probably looks
black but it's actually a very very dark
brown so I don't know if this is going
to be too much so I'm going to try and
I'll keep all of it too long but I'm
pretty much just going to follow the
instructions and do exactly what it says
so let's look at the instructions I've
mixed together my little bit of brow dye
and we are going to go for at leas if
you're gonna do this please do a patch
test these are basically says to leave
it on for two minutes only so this is a
quick one
okay you guys so I'm going to leave this
for two minutes approximately and we'll
wipe it off together so what I might do
is just wipe away the inner corners
because I really don't want that bit to
be too dark look gosh this looks like
wood all right guys moment of truth
go so pretty much this is how it looks
I'm honestly shocked considering I'm not
wearing any makeup whatsoever I'm really
impressed with the results when I look
super super closely I can see I've
missed like a few tiny little hairs pink
the white paint technique is amazing it
definitely stopped the dye from seeping
any further below which is great because
that way it just kind of stuck to my
shape as well as possible and
considering I'm not wearing any brow
makeup whatsoever like this is crazy if
I'm going to be
plucking trimming and tinting my
eyebrows I will definitely do this again
like I'm so pleasantly surprised and I
actually really like the way that tinted
eyebrows look so I'm very very pleased
and I think it was a very easy method to
do everything in one so I think 100% I
try this again is for reference you guys
can see what this looks like with actual
makeup on the skin I'm going to very
quickly do my makeup so that I can show
you what it looks like and I'll be right
back tada
so guys as you can see I've done a very
very light makeup literally took me like
five ten minutes just to apply something
very very natural still there's
absolutely nothing on my brows and I
literally couldn't be happier this whole
process made it so easy to do all into
one step and I'd very very highly
recommend it um what I'm going to do is
just apply a teeny bit of this benefit
brow conditioner just to like put
everything into play because Mike this
brow conditioner just like it's totally
clear but it keeps it all in place and I
just think this would just top it all
off perfectly a brow gel just to hold
everything into place and it is the most
perfect natural everyday brow and I
can't believe that there's no pencil
there's no powder I'm obsessed with it
the shape is exactly what I wanted of
course because I sketched it out with
the white paint um I am so on
we'll be impressed I didn't think I'd
like this technique as much as I did but
I am so so happy I tried it so for me
the pros of this is of course it's all
very quick and easy I felt like
everything was mashed into one step you
kind of pluck you do your trimming you
put the ten WIPO and it's kind of done
so I definitely say that it makes it a
lot easier why we're saying was the
hardest part about this was just the
fact that you really have to look very
closely because it's very easy to miss
the hairs because it's covered in white
very very fine hairs where a little bit
harder to see so you might need to go
over and plot a few little fine hairs
afterwards but apart from that I'd say
it was pretty easy
also the product was kind of moving
around a little bit so you might want to
set it into place I don't know if that
will help for me I just kind of took my
brush and just smoothed it over every
now and again if you guys did enjoy this
