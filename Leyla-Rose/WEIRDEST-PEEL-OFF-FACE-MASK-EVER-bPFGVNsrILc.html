so I have a really really exciting video
for you today first of all I just want
to say I'm sorry my background is very
different my ring light just broke like
I'm talking to just an hour before I
started filming and I had to do like a
makeshift setup so this is just a
temporary self I don't usually do this
usually I phone in front of my vanity
and I much prefer it if my voice sounds
a bit weird that's because my voice has
been going as well so now that we've got
all of that out of the way don't forget
to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already for more videos like
this I'm so excited for this so today
we're going to be trying a very very
strange face mask probably the strangest
face mask I've ever seen this is the has
Mara Beauty plan face mask makes this
face most particularly strange compared
to other face masks I've seen is that
you basically put this over your eyes
the lips everywhere obviously leave
little spaces for your nose nostrils so
that you can breathe but you leave on
your face for 15 to 20 minutes and then
you peel it off and it literally peels
off like a mold of your face it's the
weirdest thing ever and I can say I've
tried it because basically I tried it
last night for the first time on my vlog
Channel because I decided that if I was
going to do it on my main channel
because it's so weird I needed to know
exactly how to do it so I tried out this
one this is the purifying algae peel-off
mask so I tried this one on my blog
Channel I'm going to leave a link up on
the I to go to my blog channel don't
forget to subscribe as well I've been
doing vlogmas so this is just a part of
my blog post and I basically show you
guys a little bit more first impression
because I'm doing it for the first time
I didn't actually get to cover my eyes
because I let it dry for too long just
wanted to let you know I do have an
extra one this is the rejuvenating algae
peel-off mask and this is a revitalizing
and firming mask this actually has 24
karat gold in it so if you guys want me
to do another video based on this very
soon comment down below and smash a big
thumbs up so I know so I can film it
either tomorrow or the day after falling
into the application if you guys care
about actually knowing about what this
face mask is about and also a little bit
about the brand I don't really know much
about it but all I know is that it's
extremely hard to get ahold of and this
face mask is for professional use
only I will leave a link down below to
where I purchased them but I just want
to add a little disclaimer this does say
that it's from professional use only I'm
not professional I am trained to do
facials but I haven't done them in ages
so I wouldn't quite call myself a
professional because I haven't put that
training into use but I do have a little
bit more knowledge compared to just an
average face mask user I suppose but
I've never my life seen anything like
this
so a lot of natural ingredients and
algae is one of the main ones they have
loads of masks but these are the only
three I could get my hands on they have
a black purifying one and I really want
to try it and one of the most satisfying
things is peeling this off so I can't
wait to try this on camera with you guys
I put myself in a little bit closer so
you guys can see what I'm doing the
first thing I'm going to be doing is
moisturizing because basically the brand
actually has a little tutorial on
YouTube there's no one that's actually
really tried this out so I I'm the
fuzz I felt confident enough to try it
because like I said an untrained and I
have a little bit of knowledge as far as
it goes into facials like I said I
wouldn't quite call myself a
professional because I don't put that
knowledge into practice by actually
doing facials on other people but like I
said I am trained a talented trained in
beauty for a year by a professional when
you want to purchase it for pro use then
you do that as well so what it said to
do is to moisturize your skin and allow
the moisturizer to truly sit in I did
actually cleanse my face beforehand
because they said that that's what you
should do kind of like what you do a spa
cleanse
before you put the mask on and they did
actually say to moisturize beforehand
too so I used my favorite moisturizer
which is the bodyshop one and just
letting you guys know it does come in
these little pots it does come with sort
of everything you need it has a little
pot to mix everything with it has the
spatula we're going to be using it has
the two parts of the mask you basically
have to mix it together to activate it
and then it does come with instructions
and a little serum as well that you can
apply before and after but I decided to
skip that because my skin is so
sensitive
just aim you know this specific mask is
safe to apply it on to the eyes and over
the lips so basically what I'm going to
be doing is I'm going to be taking this
a little pot and I'm going to be mixing
together part 1 and part 2 today
- then one but it's totally up to you if
you actually end up doing this part one
is a powder and part two is a gel and
I'm going to be doing the gel first and
then pouring in the powder and mixing it
together with a spatula and applying it
straight away onto the face once it's
fully mixed together it does dry so if
you wait too long it's going to be quite
hard to maneuver it around
good going
that was so much waiting you to cover
your eyes that was with my face feels
freezing oh this is what it looks like
it's just the weirdest thing like it
feels hot but my face is my facebook
cold yes basically this mask actually
drops your skin's temperature by 5 to 6
degrees less and what it actually is and
I'm not kidding it's not like a cooling
sensation it's like when you've been out
in the cold
literally like my little nun it's just
the weirdest thing but of course I know
it's fine the same thing I can Jess
today so look what it does on the box
but I was trying to say he looks like a
Nickelodeon slime boat there we go put a
frozen it again
I mean I thought so I want to it's just
such a weird like kind of what's it
remind you of wet still like on the
inside like it feels like this still
product kind of coming off but it's so
solid that as you can see like it just
came off all in one it does feel so good
obviously if I'm gonna be carry-on
repurchasing these because they are so
weird for now they make your skin feel
cold when I did it yesterday this
morning my skin felt amazing so I'm
really excited to try the gold one so
like I said please comment down below
and thumbs up this video if you do want
to see me try that one out that was this
video guys I will definitely update you
guys on my vlog channel too to let you
know how my skin is going so make sure
you subscribe pretty much I mean we've
looked at it from this side doesn't look
as good but from way put on the off side
your face you can see where I've gotta
be good can you see that my lips on my
nose it's just the weirdest thing like I
said it still feels like it's kind of
product coming off there's got little
bits in it it's just really really
strange it kind of reminds me of you
know prosthetics like face prosthetics
how the kind of a gloopy and they kind
of sit to the skin if you go for them
before it kind of reminds me of that a
little bit um I pretty much use the
whole pot there's a little bit left
I'm a bit annoyed there was a little bit
of a gap bar it's all good guys so I'm
thinking we all want to see is
trying to rip this so let's do that you
can see our Hard Day's in series please
like it's very fun that my skin feels
amazing I don't know why they don't open
these up to the public more I feel like
it's a bit sad and it's just for
professional use I don't see any reason
as to why it should be the ingredients
seem to be all pretty much like natural
when I look at the ingredients I think
there are some of course that helps it
bond yeah I hope you enjoyed this video
let me know if you want me to try it the
next one
like I said I'll be updating you guys on
my vlog channel of how my skin feels go
