today's makeup tutorial is based around
this bold orange lip and I wanted to
pair it with a nice pair of warm orange
II turned eyes
to get started I'm going to be applying
summit primer onto my skin this is the
makeup forever step 1 smoothing primer
and I want to smooth all my skin because
unfortunately I've come out with this
really unnecessary breakout on my face I
don't know why it happened my skin has
been going really well recently but for
some reason I had a bit of a breakout
but don't worry it's all under control I
just applied some primer to smooth it
and then I'm going to be applying some
foundation on top and this foundation is
the Laura Mercier silk cream foundation
and I also wanted to apologize today for
the lighting unfortunately it was a lot
of artificial lighting in this tutorial
usually I have artificial lighting and
also natural lighting as well but it was
a really dark day and it was cloudy and
raining and it just didn't really
complement this look so I'm sorry for
that usually I do like to have more
light coming through my tutorial so I am
a bit annoyed about that but the next
step is going to be applying my eye
primer this is the soft ochre Paint Pot
from Mac and always I like to apply this
from my lid all the way to my brow bone
to make sure that all the colors of my
natural lid are completely cancelled and
it's ready to apply a nice amount of
eyeshadow onto our lid and I'm also
going to be taking this Kiko cream
eyeshadow and be applying this all over
just on the lid you want to keep this on
the lid because this is a shimmery
product and this is just going to make
the gold we apply look a lot more
shimmery and the golden will be applied
today is this rose gold shade from
Inglot and I'm just going to be applying
this all over the lid with a flat brush
just packing it on top of that base that
we just applied next I'm going to be
taking this muted orange shade and this
is also from Inglot and I'm going to be
applying this into the crease as our
transition shade because we're going for
a really bold warm lip you kind of want
to go for the eyes to be quite warm also
just because it really nicely
complements one another so I'm going to
be applying this into the crease and
making sure to blend it as well as I
possibly can because you want to make
sure your first transition color is the
most blended out of the rest of the
colors just so that everything else
looks like it's blending really well
also
and you want to make sure you pack on
that color so that it looks nice and
vibrant
and the next I'm going to be taking this
orangey brown shade which again is also
from Inglot and I'm going to be applying
this into the deeper part of my crease
and this is just going to give us a
little bit more definition and make the
look look slightly smoky although we're
not going to be applying any black or
anything like that it is just gonna
deepen the look a little bit and I'm
just gonna make sure to blend that
thoroughly with the first brush we used
then we'll be taking this off yellow
shimmery color and be applying this onto
the inner corners of my eye and I'm also
going to be just touching up that lid
color we just applied to make it look a
little bit neat again then I'm just
going to be coating my lashes in some
mascara and applying some false lashes
the false lashes I'm using are some
lashes I customized myself I will pop a
link into the description box of how I
like to customize my lashes
and then I'm also just going to be
applying some liner on to the inner
corner of my eye to kind of cover the
lash band a little bit to make the lash
band look a little bit more natural then
I'm just going to be applying some
concealer underneath my eyes and also on
the areas I want to highlight and I'm
going to be blending that in with my
Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge as always and this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer
I'm also going to be using my Sigma 3d
HD precision brush to get into all the
areas that my sponge cannot reach I love
this brush because it really does help
to get into all the areas that are just
really hard to reach and it's just such
a handy little brush and I love it so I
love using this whenever I apply my
concealer
and then to set my concealer I'm using
my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder
this is one of my favorite powders at
the moment because it just smooths
everything over so much and I just feel
like especially if you have blemishes
and stuff like that it really smooth
things over and I just really like this
powder so I really really do like it and
it's completely translucent too and then
for my eyebrows I'm going to be filling
them in with spiked eyebrow pencil you
guys have requested an eyebrow tutorial
and I promise that it's coming very very
soon I promise
it's pretty much the same as my last one
the shape and everything is the same but
I just do it in a slightly different way
so I promise I will do a updated eyebrow
tutorial very soon then I'm just going
to be taking that flat brush we use to
apply the color onto our lid and just
use that to apply that dark orange brown
color onto the bottom lash line and then
I'm also going to be applying some
mascara to my bottom lash line again to
make things look nice and balanced
I'm then going to be applying a little
bit of gold glitter liner on to my inner
corner this is just to add a little bit
of sparkle but this is of course
optional and then to bronze my skin I'm
using the mineralized skinfinish in dark
just to give myself a little bit more
color I am extremely pale at the moment
because I haven't applied any fake tan
in a really long time so this is just
completely naturally Leila color like
this is just why I am at the moment so I
just applied that all over and then I'm
highlighting my cheekbones with a
revolution baked highlighter and then
for the lips I'm using a lady danger
lipstick from Mac I'm not using a lip
liner because I don't have a lip liner
that matches this color
I'm just applying this all over just
from the lipstick itself but you can use
a brush if you find it easier and then
I'm also applying some translucent
powder on top of it just to make it look
super super matte like a liquid lipstick
because I love my lipsticks to be
extremely matte
so guys as the end of this look I hope
that you enjoyed this is such a simple
tutorial I feel like there wasn't a lot
to explain but a lot of you guys wanted
to see how I would wear a orange
lipstick and this is pretty much how it
would wear it the majority of the time
I'm not a huge orange fan but I really
wanted to make this video for you guys
please don't forget to check the
description box for all of the products
that I use today please like this video
