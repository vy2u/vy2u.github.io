today's makeup tutorial is going to be
on this wall full I look paired with
this warm nude lip
Oh
so I started off with my eyebrows done
and one eye complete also I wanted to
let you guys know that my eyebrow
tutorial will be down in the description
box and now we are going to get started
on the other eye first I'm just applying
some concealer as my eye primer this one
is the Maybelline age rewind concealer
and I'm going to be applying this all
over my lid from my brow bone all the
way down to my eyelid and I'm just gonna
make sure to set this with a powder also
just to make sure that it doesn't budge
because it's not actually an eye primer
you want to make sure that you set any
concealers you apply on to the lid and
as an eyeshadow palette today I'm gonna
be taking the Jaclyn hill favorites
palette from morphe I don't think this
is available anymore but you can get all
of these eyeshadows individually and
also there is a palette that is fairly
similar using the colors I've used today
called the 35o palette so if you wanted
to use these kind of colors then there
will be that palette on the website at
the moment so at the moment I'm just
taking this warm orange shade I'm gonna
be using this as our first transition
shade I've just taken this on a big
fluffy brush and just blending this very
thoroughly into the crease going back
and forth and just making sure that this
color is very well blended just because
all the other colors are going to be
blending into this one and that way
everything will just look super blended
and really really nice and seamless
next I'm going to be taking this warm
brown shade and I'm going to be taking
this on a separate blending brush and
we're going to be applying this into the
deeper part of the crease we are going
to be taking another dark brown so we
just want to kind of prepare for that
and just make sure that that dark brown
has something to blend into so just
blend this as well as you can also and
then I'm taking this warm purple Brown
and I'm gonna apply this into the crease
also and this will just really create a
nice amount of smokiness this is still
quite a soft smokey eye so you can go
for a black if you really want to
intensify it but I really wanted to
focus on the orange in the crease so I
didn't want to go for too much black or
anything too dark so I'm just making
sure to blend that as thoroughly as I
can also then I'm taking this color
tattoo from Maybelline is this cranberry
shade and I'm just taking my finger and
just applying this all over the lid and
I'm gonna be patting a pigment on top of
this but this just gives it a little bit
of warmth from underneath because the
pigment I'm applying is a little bit
cooler and I really wanted the eyes to
be as warm as possible and the pigment
I'm applying is this makeup geek pigment
it's kind of like this shimmery neutral
Brown and I did want it to be quite warm
so that is why I did apply that kind of
base underneath it and also it does have
something to stick on as well so I'm
just patting that on top this gives a
really nice shimmery effect as well and
I just really love it and you want to
make sure to go back into that crease
brush and just make sure there are no
harsh lines between the lid color and
the crease color next I'm just going to
be cleaning up these sides of my eye
this is optional if you don't like a
really sharp edge then you can skip this
step but I personally feel like a sharp
edge really lifts my eyes which I love
and then I'm just taking this shimmery
gold orange color and we're going to be
applying this onto the inner corner we
are gonna be applying glitter on top of
this but I just wanted to have something
for the glitter to kind of sit on that
way if there are any gaps between the
glitter it will still look nice and
opaque then I'm taking some false lashes
these are the ILA 1 to 6 lashes these
are such beautiful intense full lashes
but they're not too long which I love
and I'm just gonna be applying this with
some glue and some tweezers and then
taking some mascara to blend in my
natural ashes to the false ones because
we didn't apply any eyeliner today I'm
gonna be taking just a little bit of
liquid liner and just applying it on the
inner corner and also just on the top of
the lash band on the outer corner just
to make the lashes blend into my eye a
little bit better then I'm taking this
certified glitter and this shop violet
Voss adhesive and I'm just taking this
on a really tiny morphe brush and just
applying this onto the inner corner I
wanted it to be more of an accent on the
inner corner which is why I didn't apply
it all over the lid as well this just
gives it a touch of glitter without it
being too over-the-top and I just really
like the effect of this it really draws
attention to the eyes while still being
not too over-the-top which I love next
I'm just gonna be priming my skin with
my natural radiance primer from Mac you
guys know I love this primer especially
for the fall and winter months because
it just really hydrates the skin whilst
also prepping it at the same time and I
remembered I forgot to apply my black
pencil to my waterline so I'm just
quickly doing that now too
next I'm just applying my foundation
this one is the ex1 foundation you guys
know I've just been absolutely loving
this foundation recently it's the same
combination as I've been doing for a
really long time because I just feel
like it gives me the most flawless
finish without it looking too cakey or
heavy so I just absolutely love this
foundation and I'm blending it in with
my Real Techniques sculpting brush and
you guys know I love this brush as well
I don't need to explain that to you
because you guys have definitely heard
it by now
but I just love the way that this brush
gives me a nice flawless finish and it's
really quick and easy and it just means
there's no extra product sitting on your
face it just makes everything blend in
really seamlessly so I just love this
combination
next I'm just gonna apply my Maybelline
fit me concealer underneath the eyes you
guys know as well this is my favorite
concealer I'm applying this on all the
areas that I would like to bring forward
on my forehead the bridge of my nose
down the sides of my nose just to narrow
them down a little bit and also on my
chin and I'm using a different brush to
blend in today i'm using this morphe
pointed kabuki brush this is actually a
really nice brush to blend in your
concealer I kind of use patting motions
to blend this in then I'm going in with
my Sigma 3d HD precision brush of course
this had to be done you guys know that I
use this almost every single day when I
do my base and whenever I use another
brush I just miss this one so much so
this is definitely one of my favorite
brushes for blending concealer and just
making sure that every where near the
eye area is nice and precise to set my
concealer I'm going to be using the same
powder as I have been using for the past
few months this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
instant retouch powder you guys know how
much I love this again my foundation
routine has kind of been the same
recently so there's nothing really new
here I just love to use this to set my
face because it just gives such a
flawless finish and it's such an
affordable powder as well which I love
next I'm just gonna be taking some more
of that black pencil and just gonna be
running it in between the lashes and on
the bottom lash line I really want the
bottom lash line to be quite smoky and I
really want that orange to be seeping
through the black as well so I'm gonna
be taking that orange color on a smudger
brush and I'm gonna start to smudge out
that black and just make sure that I
create a really nice transition between
the black and the orange so it almost
seems like a really nice transition
between the two and then I'm taking a
little bit more of that certified
glitter and I'm just gonna be applying
it onto the inner corner and just
underneath the bottom lash line on the
inner corner also and then to finish off
I'm just taking some mascara and just
applying a decent coat of this because I
do want to create a really nice full
bottom lash line because again I want to
create a really nice smoky effect and
when you apply a really thick coat of
mascara on the bottom lashes it really
goes hand in hand with it and it just
looks really nice especially when you're
wearing false lashes to bronze I'm gonna
be taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and this color called Havana
and I'm just taking this on a big fluffy
brush and just bronzing the outer
perimeter of my face I'm not doing
anything too special with my skin today
just bronzing everywhere and just taking
a smaller brush and I'm gonna be using
that same color to contour also and just
kind of chiseling out the cheeks as much
as I can I would have my face to be warm
and I didn't want to use a blusher so
I'm just using that same bronzer shade
to go all over my face and also to
contour my nose also and then I'm just
taking a little bit of a highlighter
this one is the revolution baked
highlighter I believe I will have the
names down below and then I'm just gonna
be lining my lips with strip-down
lip pencil sorry for my hair just like
randomly being out I was gonna star my
hair then I was like I haven't even done
my lip yet so that's why my hair is
taken out of the ponytail I'm just
taking at this stripped-down pencil and
I'm literally lining my lips with their
and filling my lips completely with it
as well I just work this is sarchie
perfect nude color for the full time
it's nice and warm it really goes well
with an eye look like this so this is
the end of this makeup tutorial guys I
hope you enjoyed I wanted to do another
makeup tutorial with a little bit more
of a peachy nude lipstick that's
suitable for fall I absolutely love
different eye looks and I will be doing
a lots more with dark vampy lips but I
want to kind of spread it out over the
course of fall so that's why I didn't do
another vampy lip today so I hope you
