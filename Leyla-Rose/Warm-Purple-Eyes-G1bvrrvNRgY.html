go there I'm gonna be Prime in the whole
of our top and bottom lid and I feel
like this primer just makes everything
stick really well
and then you can blend that out either
using your finger but I am going to be
using it brush and this is the hair
addiction of the Queen brush and this is
my favorite like concealer / primer
brush I love so guys the next step is
going to be putting a white space ones
who are lit and I'm going to be using
the NYX jumbo pencil in milk and i'm
just going to be drawing this all over
the lid and just underneath as well i'm
going to need a mirror to look closely
just do this all over the lid
and on the bottom as well the next step
is going to be just blending this out
very very lightly with a flat brush and
I'm going to be using a sigma e60 brush
I'm just going to very very lightly just
bring this out so there are no creases
next we are going to be applying our lid
color and I'm going to be applying this
matte purple right here and it's quite a
vibrant purple and we're going to be
applying this all over our lid
just patting this color on
it's important to try and pack the color
on so that we get a nice vibrancy don't
even know if I bryn see the word i
really hope there is oh well just a nice
vibrant color apply that all over and
just take that down like that
so once the whole lid has been covered
I'm just going to go on top of that with
this slightly darker purple here and I'm
just going to go over that color very
very lightly just to make the column
more intense
so guys at this point it should look a
little bit something like this just
rimmed the whole area of our eye and the
lid with this pub color and it should be
quite vibrant if possible and it should
be quite opaque so the next step is
going to be taking our pencil brush and
this is just an e30 by Sigma and I'm
going to be taking a matte black and I'm
going to be taking black out from the
Naked 2 palette and I'm just going to be
creating a V on the outside of our eye
and this is just going to give the look
a nice intensity taking this up into our
crease and extending it
so once you've kind of created the shape
that you want we're going to be blending
this color upwards with our hair
addiction the blender brush and I'm
going to be taking this matte red right
here now
as you can see is slowly starting to
blend and the look is starting to look a
lot warmer and this is really going to
make your eyes pop out because of how
warm it is
keep applying that read as much as you
need to to get a nice consistency above
the crease as much as you need to and as
much as you'd like
we're going to darken our crease one
last time with the same black from the
other decay naked2 palette and you can
darken it as much as you like really you
can leave it how it was before but I
kind of want mine to be more intense and
this is how I had it the oven I'm just
going to blend it one last time not
putting any more product on it on the
224 brush just making sure that black is
all blended up so yeah that's pretty
much what we're going to do on the top
is I'm going to be taking my gel
eyeliner in black and this is the
Maybelline eye studio lasting drama and
I'm just going to put this all along my
waterline
and I'm also going to be just like
putting it in between like the ashes it
doesn't matter of this bits you know
relatively Missy because you're going to
be able to blend this out in a minute
like so let it be beautiful Let It Be
Beautiful let it be
I'm the bottom I'm just going to be
taking a mac to to AIDS brush and I'm
going to be going into that red again
the same read that we used before this
one just here i'm going to be using this
just to smudge out that purple that we
did on the bottom
and then afterwards I'm just going to be
taking that same brush and going into
black out and just running it along my
lash line just to make this look a lot
more smoky and next I'm going to be
doing my mascara and my lashes
if you let it be
just let the best just be the pears and
focused on things better cuddle me cuz
there are blush bronzer and lips and
I've done my eyebrows already because i
already have an eyebrow tutorial i will
leave a link to it down in the
description bar if you want to see it
and yeah so let's just get started on
the bronze are so for bronzer i am
actually not going to be doing it too
much bronzing today i'm going to be
using the bobby brown bronzer and golden
light and a mac 129 brush 9 fully where
this is a powder brush but i don't want
there to be too much contouring today
because I want to for focus to be on our
eyes because they are very very dramatic
so I'm just going to take some of the
bronze out onto my brush and I'm just
going to dust it into the hollows of my
cheeks
and just create a very very soft line
and do the same with the other side
and just we're going to be taking this
comment just very very lightly onto the
apples of the cheeks not too much and
yeah as you can see it's nothing too
dramatic just a little bit of bronzer
just going to take this to the size of
our forehead onto my draw
and just onto my neck to like that till
then after that I'm going to be doing
some blush and just with the same brush
I think same brush it's going to be
taking at some warm side now and just
dusting that on the apples of my cheeks
and take this up to my temple and if you
want you could put a highlight but I'm
already feeling a highlight today this
is a lot of shimmer in it so this can
work as your highlight to actually you
should I put highlight and hourly pilot
today and just take this up and keep it
on to the apples of the cheeks so as you
can see it's very very focused on our
eyes nothing too much on the cheeks and
that means that we're going to keep us
often quite neutral for the lips to UM
viva glam gaga to and this is a very
very nudists almost like the same color
as my foundation so I'm not putting a
liner today just that first and on top
of it I'm going to be putting a pink
fade by Mac lip gloss off i can open it
and it should it just fit some of that
my lips too
are we my finger because I brush is long
and yeah this is the final look guys I
