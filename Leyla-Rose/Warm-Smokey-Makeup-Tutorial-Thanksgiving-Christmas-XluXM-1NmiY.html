channel so today I'm back with a full
face makeup tutorial and I'm gonna be
showing you how to achieve this really
nice warm smoky eye pet with a flawless
face and this really nice warm lip as
well this is gonna be perfect for the
Christmas period Thanksgiving anything
that you guys would like to wear it for
I love it cuz it's got lots of warm
colors in it but it is dramatic also so
if you do wanna see how to achieve this
then it's just keep on watching okay so
I'm starting off with my eyes first of
all because we are gonna be needing to
wipe away and making the line a lot
cleaner because we're working with lots
of dark shadows I'm first of all just
taking a makeup geek creme brulée
eyeshadow and just applying this into
the crease and just making sure that I'm
really blending this out and packing it
on so I have a nice foundation for the
rest of the dark colors we're gonna be
applying and what I want to do is kind
of gradually build up to get darker and
darker and darker as we proceed
downwards to my lid next I'm taking this
shade which is also a makeup geek
eyeshadow as well and I'm just gonna be
putting this into the crease to add lots
and lots of warmth this is almost like a
bunt yellow shade and because I'm gonna
be applying some oranges I really wanted
that to blend and really smoothly with
the brown I just applied just applying
lots and lots of crease colors really
make sure that it blends seamlessly so
I'm just building this up in the crease
a little bit before I go in with a bunch
orange shade then I'm taking Morocco
from makeup geek also which it's our
burnt orange and I'm just taking this on
another blending brush I'm just starting
to apply this into the crease it's
really good we applied those colors
beforehand that way this one has
something to blend into next I'm taking
Americano eyeshadow which is a makeup
geek eyeshadow also I believe all the
eyeshadows are used in this video are
makeup geek I'm just taking that with a
smaller pencil brush and just starting
to apply that in the crease to prepare
for the black shade just making sure
that it's deep within the crease and
also on my outer corner and then for my
lid I'm taking this elf cream eyeliner
and I'm just gonna be using it as a base
for my black when I apply black
eyeshadow on its own and I always feel
like it's not dark enough so I'm just
applying this as my base but I'm gonna
make sure to work as quickly as I can
because of course gel and cream eyeliner
does dry so I'm just patting this on
with a flat brush and then taking a
larger like dense eyeshadow brush and
just really pushing
into the crease to blend out the edges
and then we can go on top with our black
eyeshadow this is black out from makeup
geek and I'm just taking this on another
flat eyeshadow brush and then we can
start to really build on this black
shade making it look nice and intense
and making sure that the edges look nice
and smooth by going back into our
previous colors so for me I have to
clean up the edges of any dark eyeshadow
look because I just feel like having a
nice straight edge just looks a lot
cleaner and it doesn't look messy so go
ahead and do this if you feel like it's
something you want to do but if you want
to keep as more of a rough edge you can
totally do that as well I'm going in
with my certified maestro maestro I
never know how to say that maestro
questions I just applied them onto my
top lash line for some volume and
definition and now we're going to be
moving on to the skin to add a little
bit of a glow and also some moisture I
am taking the glam glow moisturizer and
this is just amazing adds such a
gorgeous glow onto my skin by the way
guys if you are in the UK I just wanted
to let you know that glam glow actually
has their own freestanding store now in
central London so if you were in the
market to go and get some masks and
stuff from them you can go and visit
them at their actual free sounding store
it's amazing in there so definitely go
check out if you are from the UK so
because I had a few mischievious
breakouts I decided to apply some of my
green concealer from soap &amp;amp; Glory and
just applying that with a kabuki brush
onto any red areas this just really
helps me to be able to cover up any
spots and as you can see the redness is
really cut down so once I've applied
that and blended it in I am taking my
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation which
is definitely one of my favorites this
is glowy but full coverage and also with
the glow from the moisturizer from glam
glow this is gonna make a look super
super glowy which I really really like
especially for the winter time because
my skin has been so dry lately so I
don't want my skin to look drier than
what it actually is and then I'm just
applying my favorite concealer the
Maybelline fit me under my eyes and also
on my forehead and my chin just to add a
really nice amount of highlight and this
isn't too light I feel like it's just
right for my skin tone I'm just blending
that in with my Beauty Blender just
making sure that everything looks nice
and smooth before I set it into place to
set my skin I'm taking the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder I'm not gonna
be baking today I'm just applying some
powder on the areas that I need to
pretty much everywhere even though that
I'm making sure it's nice and
now but glow will peek through
throughout the day so just want to make
sure that it's set into place and it
doesn't just fall off as far as bronzers
go I'm going for this bronzer shade from
the Anastasio contour kit and I'm just
applying that on the outer perimeter of
my face to really make sure that
everything looks nice and warm going
with the whole warm look I am also going
to be contouring a little bit as well
and I'm just gonna be taking this born
shade from the UH Nastasia contour kit
and just popping that onto the hollows
of my cheeks and I usually like to
contour too often and I don't really
want to contour too harshly just a point
a little bit this would just make my
cheekbones stand out a little bit more I
am also applying a little bit of blush
as well which is again rare for me I'm
taking this one from soap &amp;amp; Glory and
just popping it onto the apples of my
cheeks this one is matte so it does look
quite flat it doesn't add too much
highlight but the highlight I am
applying is this one from radical
skincare and I'm just applying this onto
the tops of my cheekbones because it
just adds a really nice subtle glow I
didn't want anything too intense and
this was perfect I am gonna go ahead and
do my eyebrows off camera because I just
recently done this tutorial on how I
achieve them so to watch that just click
the eye and I'm gonna go and do my brows
off-camera next moving on to the rest of
my eyes I am taking this Kohl pencil
from makeup geek this one is in the
shade obsidian and I'm just applying
that onto my waterline and on the bottom
lashline to really create some smokiness
and to balance that top and bottom
lashline because obviously the top is so
heavy I'm taking some more of that burnt
orange shade used in the crease and just
using that to smudge out this line so
that it doesn't look too harshly
straight and it just adds a little bit
more warmth to that bottom lash line
also and of course to finish off this
look I am taking some mascara and just
applying a generous coat of this to my
bottom lashes to make everything look a
nice and balanced and I just love the
way that this looks and this is optional
but to add a little bit of sparkle I'm
just taking this pigment from makeup
geek and just applying it from the inner
corner just to add a little bit of
sparkle and it just makes everything
look a little bit more glitzy and
perfect for the festive season
and finally you can't forget about the
lip color I wanted to go for something
that matched the rest of the face and
you can totally use like reds or deep
plums you can actually use a lot of
different colors with this anything
that's warm to be honest would go really
well but I decided to go for a warm nude
because I really wanted to have almost
like it was matching with my crease
color so I applied some cork lip liner
and some of the UH Nastasia Beverly
Hills
Ashtyn liquid lipstick and I really do
like Ashton it was a little bit too
orange so I applied a tad of
bow-and-arrow from Kat Von D on top of
it just to turn it down a teeny bit so

makeup tutorial I really hope you
