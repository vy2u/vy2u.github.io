today I'm going to be showing you how to
achieve this full face makeup look I
used a lot of warm tones to create this
really nice soft smokey eye and I also
created a nice neutral face and a nice
neutral lip so if you want to see how I
achieve this look then just keep on
watching so to get started I'm going to
be priming my skin and to do that I am
taking the Make Up For Ever step 1
nourishing primer I really like this
primer it's really moisturizing and for
my foundation I'm taking an old favorite
of mine this is the ex1 invisi wear
foundation I'm just buffing this all
over my skin using a morphe buffing
brush and I love this foundation and
I've all right wear this again I'm
always like why haven't I been using
this every single day because I love it
that much the eyeshadow palette I'm
going to be using today is the morphe
35o original palette this palette is
insanely gorgeous and it's extremely
popular so I decided I needed to use
this palette in a tutorial I'm just
starting out with this peachy orange
shade and I'm just going to be blending
this into the crease I'm looking to have
a really nice warm crease so I do want
to make sure this is very pigmented so I
am gonna continuously build this up and
blend simultaneously just keep blending
and building blending and building so
that it looks nice and soft but also
quite pigmented at the same time then
I'm taking this orange shade and we're
going to also be applying that into the
crease
like I said I do on the crease to be
very very warm so adding a little bit of
this would just add a little bit of
extra warmth next I'm going to taking
this warm brown shade and I'm going to
start to apply this into the deeper part
of my crease this way it will start to
deepen it and this is going to start to
build some of that smokiness I'm also
just dragging it out slightly towards
the outer part of my eye to really start
to extend my eyes and then finally to
really add the depth and the smokiness
and to make it look a little bit
different to what a normal smokey eye
would look like I'm just applying some
of this really dark brown
and applying it first of all to the
outer corner into the crease and I am
also going to be applying it on to the
inner corner as well it's a kind of
create a spotlight effect this makes
things look a little bit different to a
regular smokey eye it kind of changes
the shape a little bit like doing the
sometimes because I definitely feel like
it changes things up for the lid shade
I'm going to be mixing together this
gold color and also this light shimmery
pink shade I'm applying this to the
center of my eye and keeping it just
mainly in the center I don't take it too
close to the inner corner or the outer
corner because we did apply a darker
shadow in those areas and then I am
going back in with that blending brush
to make sure everything is nice and
blended together you don't see any harsh
lines and you just want it to look nice
and seamless I'm applying the House of
lashes
siren lashes the lashes actually get
longer towards the center of the lash
and I think that's really nice and it
goes well with the spotlight eye they
are quite natural compared to what I
thought they were going to look like but
I think it's really nice because when I
smoke out the bottom lash line it's kind
of like a little play on what a normal
smoky eye looks like I just think it
looks different so yeah I did really
like the way this looked I applied some
mascara to my natural lashes and also on
the false ones as well just to add a
little bit of thickness next I'm going
to be moving on to concealer just to
clean up any of the eye shadow that may
have fallen and also just to brighten as
well I'm applying that onto my under
eyes onto the sides of my nose my
forehead and also a little bit onto my
chin and I'm blending that out with my
Beauty Blender the concealer I use by
the way was my Maybelline fit me which
again I haven't used this in ages kind
of revisiting old favorites today and I
loved it
I just love the Maybelline fit me
concealer especially on top of the ex1
foundation as well these are definitely
some of my favorites I'm just blending
that out with my Beauty Blender and just
making sure it looks nice and seamless
before setting it I'm setting it with of
course you know what powder it's going
to be is the soap &amp;amp; Glory instant
retouch powder I love this powder so
much and I can't live without it a
bronze I am taking the Too Faced
chocolate bronzer and I'm just applying
it all over the outer perimeter of my
face this shade is quite a natural color
so I definitely feel like it's a little
bit more natural but at the same time I
kind of wanted to go for something that
drawn the skin because I wanted it to be
all about the eyes and for all the focus
to be on the eyes so I just applied that
on the corn
areas as well and for my highlight I'm
taking one of my favorites this is the
Laura gala gilded honey illuminator and
just applying this onto all the high
points again just to give me that glow
I'm going to go ahead and do my brows
off-camera but I will link a tutorial
down below moving on to the rest of my
eyes I'm just going to be filling my
waterline using a black kohl pencil and
then I am gonna be running that on the
bottom lashline as well just to give us
a really nice amount of smokiness like I
said I did want all of the attention to
kind of be on the bottom lashline and
for the smokiness to be in this region
for it to really be nice and smoky I'm
smudging out that black using the orange
shades from the morphe 35o palette and
I'm not really doing anything too crazy
just blending it out as seamlessly as
possible and I'm also just applying some
mascara onto the bottom lashes to finish
off the eye look
and then for my lips I am lining them
using the iconic nude lip pencil from
Charlotte Tilbury this is one of my
favorite lip pencils I'm I don't think
I've ever gone down this short on a lip
pencil to be honest and I only bought it
not too long ago so you can tell I
really like it and then I'm going around
the outer parts of the lips using a
cappuccino from Rimmel you guys have
watched many other of my tutorials you
would know that I always go around the
outer part of my lips with a darker lip
pencil because I personally find that
it's easier to over line that way and
it's just easier to conceal it and I
really like the way it looks the liquid
lipsticks that I'm gonna be applying is
one of my new favorites as well I think
it might be my favorite nude liquid
lipstick this is the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick in the color bellisima
and I love it it's just the most perfect
pinky nude and I just think it's perfect
so I wanted to go for something quite
soft and nothing too over-the-top for
the lips but I wanted it to be quite
defined at the same time and yeah this
is the end of this makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoy this is a really
nice soft but smoky at the same time
makeup look and I really really like it
