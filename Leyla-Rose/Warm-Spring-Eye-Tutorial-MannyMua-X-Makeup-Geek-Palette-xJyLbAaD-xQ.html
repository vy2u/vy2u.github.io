gonna be showing you how to achieve this
glamorous eye look using lots of warm
colors this is an eye focus video so I'm
just gonna be showing you guys how to do
the eyes so I'm gonna be using the new
makeup geek Mann EMU a collaboration
palette and this is of course the star
of the show because the colors are so
unique I'm just applying a little bit of
concealer onto my lid before we start
just to cancel out any of the eyes and
natural colors so I'm gonna get slide
off by applying beaches and cream into
the crease and I'm just taking that on a
fluffy blending brush this is one of
makeup geeks normal original eyeshadows
I believe I think I have a single pan of
this and it's just a really nice cream
shade that's dark enough to use as your
transition color to make everything a
blend then taking Sora which is one of
my favorite colors in the palette it's a
really pretty matte warm brown and it's
just so stunning I love this color I'm
just gonna be applying that with the
same brush but more towards the deeper
part of our crease just start to build
up some of that depth and you just want
to make sure that this is blending
really well into that previous color and
making sure to really drag it out
towards the tail of my brow to extend
our eye and just prepare it for the
other colors we're gonna be applying and
then of course I think this is probably
the most unique color of the palette
this is called Mars and it's a really
pretty ready pink shade it looks
different on everybody on me it comes up
super super pink if you do want to make
it appear more red I would probably say
to apply a ready base underneath it but
because I'm not using any base
underneath it's probably just coming out
a lot more pink on me but I've looked at
loads of other people using this and it
looks red on some people and it looks
pink on some people so I guess it
depends on your natural undertones I
suppose I'm just applying it into the
crease and just making sure to blend it
really well I really want this color to
be nice and pigmented and definitely the
most strong color out of the whole look
you really want to build this up so it's
nice and opaque
next we're gonna be taking the color
insomnia and that's this color right
here this kind of reminds me of sketch
from Mac but without the shimmer so it's
kind of like a purpley dark brown donor
if that makes sense but it kind of has
that mobile undertone I'm just applying
that on a pencil brush a blending pencil
brush and just applying it onto the
outer V and really pushing it into the
crease to just give the eyes some depth
and just giving it a tad of smokiness
just because I'd dump on the eyes just
to be totally pink I wanted it to look
kind of smoky at the same time and then
this is a beautiful color as well I am
taking Artemis and this is a foiled
eyeshadow and it's just a really pretty
pink color I'm just applying it onto the
lid with a flat synthetic brush and just
almost creating a cut crease on the
inner part of my eye and then just
allowing this to blend into the rest of
the shadow on the rest of the lid and
then taking Luna which is a really
pretty color as well I'm just gonna be
applying that onto the inner corners
only just to highlight this area then to
do my eyeliner I'm taking the Tarte
artiest clay aligner and just applying
this with a Mac 210 brush I think I
think it's a 210 brush I'm first of all
just drawing a line onto my lid nothing
too crazily they're going to be winging
out the edge of my liner and creating
that part to be quite thick so I'm just
creating the wing and just angling it
towards the tail of my eyebrows almost
pointing it in that direction and then
I'm just gonna be creating the wing and
that part of the wing is gonna be
thicker than the actual line of my eye I
don't know if that makes sense but
basically on the inner corner of my eye
it tends to be quite thin and then as it
gets to the outer corner it gets thicker
just to give my eyes that nice cat eye
effect and then I'm just gonna be taking
some concealer and just cleaning up the
eye shadow that was left over I would
use a makeup wipe I already had my
foundation on and now I'm just gonna be
applying my lashes I'm applying the
iconic lashes from House of lashes these
are definitely one of my favorites
styles of lashes and I've used these
about a billion times already like so
many times and this the
going so strong I love this lash style
it's just so perfect and then I'm just
gonna be applying some mascara onto my
natural lashes just to make them blend
in a little bit better to the false ones
for the waterline I'm just gonna be
taking a black kohl pencil if you really
wanted it to be it colorful you could go
for a colorful waterline but I just
decided I wanted to make it look a
little bit more on the smoky side and
I'm just applying it onto the waterline
and then applying some on the bottom
lashline - I'm just gonna be smudging it
using Mars from the power that's that
red shade just to give it a really nice
round halo effect of this red color all
along the eyes again you could go for
the brown shade if you didn't want it to
be as colorful but I decided to go for
the red and then I'm just gonna be
taking a little bit more of that
insomnia shade and just taking a tiny
pencil brush just making sure to really
blend out that black eyeliner next I'm
just gonna be applying some mascara to
finish everything off this is the
l'oreal full / sculpt mascara and i
absolutely love this for my bottom
lashes just because it gets in between
all of their lashes so guys that is li
finished a look i really hope you guys
