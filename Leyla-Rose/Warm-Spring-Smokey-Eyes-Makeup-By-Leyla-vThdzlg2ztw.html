today I'm gonna be showing you this i
lurk using lots of warm colors for
spring going to be applying our soft
ochre Paint Pot from Mac and just
applying this all over the lid with our
finger from the brow bone all the way to
our lash line you want to make sure that
you coat this really well because we are
going to be using quite bright colors
you want them to show up as much as
possible so using a good base is gonna
make sure that definitely happens next
I'm gonna be applying these two bright
colors one is an orange and one is more
of a coral color I'm going to be mixing
them together and applying them into our
crease with a big fluffy blending brush
and you want to make sure that you're
using lots of blending motions just to
make sure this color is really well
blended next I'm going to be taking this
purple color and applying this into our
outer corner and our inner corner and
we're going to be using a pencil brush
for this and what this is going to do is
create a slight halo effect like a ring
around our eye and this will just open
up the eyes we want to connect them to
with a line in the crease and just make
sure that that color is nice and vibrant
by the way both these colors are from
the Jaclyn hill palette and morphe also
does these colors individually as well
and they do have a lot on their
Instagram page definitely check them out
if you want to get these colors
individually I'm just gonna be blending
that out as well with a different
blending brush just to make sure that
color is nice and blended into our coral
color then I'm just gonna go back into
that pencil brush and apply more of that
magenta color just to make it look more
vibrant
just going back in to blend it just to
polish it off just to make sure it looks
nice and blended then I just done a wing
of eyeliner most of the footage got cut
off so I'm just showing you roughly what
I did and then I applied some of the
shop pilot frost glitter and this is
such a gorgeous color and I'm just
patting this on with a brush and I also
put a glitter adhesive underneath it
just to make it stick then I'm taking a
berry M pigment with a small brush and
applying this onto our inner tear-duct
just to make our eyes look nice and
bright then I'm taking a thick pair of
false lashes and applying them to our
top lashline just to give us a nice
amount of drama
then I'm gonna start with my face by
applying a Mac strobe cream onto our
skin just to give us a nice spring blow
and just to make sure that our skin
looks nice under a full coverage just
gives our face more dimension then I'm
applying the L'Oreal True Match and just
applying this all over the face and then
I'm gonna buffing that in with a sigma
f84 brush and this has just been my
favorite brush recently and just to
apply onto the skin it just buffs
everything in so beautifully and I just
love it and you can kind of just push it
in any direction and it just blends
evenly no matter what direction you kind
of put it in and it's just really easy
to get in whatever part of the face that
you want so it's really good I really
love this brush and just applying that
all over the skin
next I'm gonna be applying a concealer
under my eyes and I am using NARS creamy
concealer in custard and I'm just going
to be using this to brighten my under
eyes and then I'm also gonna be applying
it onto my forehead my Cupid's bow and
my chin and that is just gonna highlight
them areas as well I'm just gonna be
blending that in with the same at Sigma
brush just to make sure that blends in
really evenly with our foundation and
then I'm gonna be taking a smaller brush
in the areas that are a little bit
harder to reach and I'm gonna be taking
a smaller brush to blend it into that
and I'm just using the Sigma brush just
to blend the other parts as well using a
small brush like this just makes it look
a lot more precise and crisp and it's
just easier to get into places like
under the eyes and on the inner corner
and yeah it's just a lot easier
next I'm just filling in my brows I am
going to record a full brow tutorial
which will be up very soon the way I do
my brows have changed so I just wanted
to show you guys in a dedicated video so
I can explain properly so I just filled
that in with the brow bar to go from
whitening lightening and I'm just using
a concealer just to highlight under my
eyebrow just to make it look more lifted
and also to clean up any extra bits that
I wanted clean it up then I'm just
taking a black pencil and applying that
into my waterline just to create a nice
smoky effect and I'm also gonna take
this under the lash line on the outer
half of my eye underneath the lash line
and this is just gonna extend the eyes
outwards and ya don't want to put any of
this on the inner corner and I'm just
gonna start blending that in with the
same magenta color that we apply it into
our crease and I'm just using a flat
brush to just blend that black to make
it look more soft then I'm gonna be
applying a thick coat of mascara onto
our bottom lashes because we have very
thick top lashes we want to make sure
they look balanced and yeah it just
looks a lot more put together if the top
and bottom lashes match so I'm just
using a volumizing mascara to add a lot
of drama onto the bottom lashes then I'm
going to be bronzing my skin using my
Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light and
I just love this bronzer so much it is
literally one of the best bronzers I
have ever owned it's completely matte so
I do like to contour with this as well
so what I'm doing is just taking a big
fluffy brush and just applying it to the
perimeter out of my face and then I'm
gonna go in with a smaller brush and
apply it into the hollows of my cheeks
just to give me a really soft contour of
course it's not a cool tone so it's not
gonna give you a really strong contoured
look but it just gives your face that
little bit of extra shape that you need
then I'm just using a blush I'm using a
Milani baked blush in Luminoso just to
add a little bit of color to my cheeks
and I'm just sweeping that backwards and
then I'm taking Becca cosmetics opal
highlight in the pressed form and just
using a fan brush to apply that onto the
cheekbones of my face
then I'm going to be lining my lips with
cream Oh spice lipliner from Mac as you
guys know this is one of my favorite lip
liners in the whole world so I'm just
using this to apply onto my lip line and
then I'm also going to be filling in my
lips with a pretty baby pink lipstick
from Gerard cosmetics and I wanted to go
for quite a soft baby pink lip but of
course you guys can go for any lip you
can pick an orange lip a coral lip
anything along them warm tones it would
look gorgeous or you could just go for a
really simple nude as well but mainly I
just wanted to keep it nice and soft for
the springtime so it's completely
optional well if color you want to go
for and I'm just gonna be applying the
lipstick all over the lips and I used
buttercup lipstick from Gerard cosmetics
