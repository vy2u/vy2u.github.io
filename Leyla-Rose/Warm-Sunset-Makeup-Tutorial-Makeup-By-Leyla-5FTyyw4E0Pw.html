today I'm gonna be showing you how to
achieve these warm sunset eyes and a
full face makeup look
so to get started we're gonna be priming
our eyelids with soft ochre Paint Pot as
always you guys know that I love to do
this just to prep our eyes for any
eyeshadow that we're gonna be applying
then I'm going to taking chrome yellow
from Mac and I'm just gonna be taking
this into the crease with a sigma e40
brush and I'm just gonna be blending
this and I know this yellow can be quite
intimidating we want to make sure this
is nice and blended out because it's
gonna create this really gorgeous sunset
effect so this is our first transition
shade then I'm going to be going into
orange which is also a Mac shadow and
I'm going to be applying this with a
smaller brush and just be applying this
into the crease and making sure that it
blends into that yellow and that's
what's gonna give this look at that
sunset effect it's gonna look literally
like the sunrise so it's really gonna
give it that gorgeous warm effect then
I'm gonna be taking red break which is
just a slightly more reddish orange and
I'm gonna be applying this into the
deeper part of my crease just to deepen
this look a little bit more and just
make sure that it blends into that
orange we just applies just keep
blending until they all blend seamlessly
then I'm gonna be taking a purple jumbo
pencil from NYX and just be using this
all over my lid
to create a really gorgeous almost night
effect I wanted it to be like the sunset
so I use this purple shade from Mac as
well this is sketch I'm just using it
above it and just patting it on top of
that jumbo pencil we applied and this
will almost create the effect of the
night turning into the day I don't know
what I was thinking when I was going
into this local bar I just really wanted
something that reminded me of the sunset
so yeah I'm just applying this all over
the lid and just gonna make sure that
we're blending this into the crease as
well you want to make sure that although
these are two very different colors you
want to make sure they're blending
really good as well so I'm just taking a
fluffy morphe brush and just blending
that orange into the crease to make sure
that that purple blends really well into
the orange purple and orange are really
hard to blend together so don't worry if
you're finding it hard take your time
and just use lots of stroking motions
and just make sure that the color looks
as soft as possible then I'm just
cleaning up the edge to make it look
nice and neat
then we can go on to our eyeliner so
next I'm just gonna be applying a thick
line of eyeliner but I'm not going to be
winging it out I wanted to create more
of a rounded shape for my eye rather
than a really extended one you can
totally win out your eyeliner if you
want to but I just want it to be a
little bit different because I always do
a winged liner so I kind of just like to
switch it up sometimes so it's
completely up to you I wanted to get for
a thick line because I wanted it to be
quite dramatic at the same time
and then I'm just gonna be applying my
lashes these are the red cherry one or
twos these are like the longest lashes I
own so of course you can go for any
lashes you like but these are just quite
long and dramatic next I'm just gonna be
priming my skin and I'm gonna be using
the Mac and natural radiance primer and
just be applying this all over my skin
just to make sure my face is nice and
hydrated before we apply any foundation
and today I'm gonna be using the mac
matchmaster foundation I didn't realize
how many Mac products I was actually
using today but oh well I don't usually
do it so why not so I'm just gonna be
applying the mac matchmaster in number
four all over my skin I'm so pale at the
moment it's ridiculous I haven't turned
in a couple of days so it really makes a
difference when I don't fake tan so I'm
just gonna be applying this all over my
skin with my Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge and just do the usual
thing and just make sure all my face is
covered and then I'm taking the
maybelline fitme concealer and I'm gonna
be using this to highlight my under eyes
and just make sure that my eyes look
nice and bright because we're using lots
of bright and dark colors you want to
make sure that there are no dark circles
under your eyes so make sure they are
under eyes look nice and bright so your
eyes stand out and I'm just gonna be
using the same sponge to blend that into
the rest of my complexion
then I'm just gonna be taking my Sigma
3d HD precision brush and just use this
to get right up to the details of my eye
just so that the concealer touches and
makes it all look really nice and neat
and then I'm just gonna be going over
that and blending it with the sponge
again just so that everything is really
nice and packed into the skin then I'm
just gonna be taking my soap and glory
I've forgotten the name of this kick-ass
powder oh my god I hate saying that name
that yeah I'm just gonna be using this
under my eyes just to set them and I've
also done my eyebrows off camera but the
tutorial will be in the description box
then I'm just taking a black pen so this
is also from Mac completely
unintentional and I'm just using this on
my waterline and then I'm gonna be
taking that same yellow color and
applying it onto my bottom lash line and
we're kind of gonna be doing this in the
same order that we applied it onto our
top lid so then we're gonna apply the
orange and I'm kind of concentrating
this more towards the outer corner and
leaving a little bit on the inner corner
free and then I'm going to be going into
that dark purple color and just be
applying that closer to the lash line
then the other colors and then I'm just
gonna be applying some mascara to make
sure that the top and bottom lashes look
nice and balanced and then I'm gonna be
taking this NYX ultra mania pigment and
just be applying this onto our inner
corner this is like a very shiny yellow
gold I'm just gonna be using this as our
inner corner highlight just to make the
whole eyes pop and come together
next I'm gonna start bronzing my skin
I'm using the Mac mineralize skinfinish
in dark I'm just gonna be using this to
very lightly bronze my skin I am very
very light so I don't know I mean I'm
not very light but for myself for how
dark I'm meant to be
this is like the palest I get in the
year so I'm just making sure that I add
myself a little bit of color and then I
am taking the balm Bahama Mama bruns I
just do contour very lightly I didn't
want to go too crazy with the bronzing
and then I'm also taking a Mac style
blush I can't believe how a Mac products
I use that was so unintentional next I'm
gonna be taking a Becca opal highlights
I'll just be applying this onto the high
points of my face and also on to the tip
of my nose and then to finish off for
the lips I'm taking a Kiko lip pencil
this is kind of like a peachy color and
I'm just gonna be lining my lips and
kind of be filling in the outer parts of
my lips as well with this
picking a nude Kiko lipstick and this is
one of their long wearing lipsticks and
I'm just going to be applying this all
over and just making sure that it's
blended into the lip liner so guys as
the end of this look I hope that you
