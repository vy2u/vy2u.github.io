is we're going to be putting on our prep
and prime skin as our primer and this is
just going to act as a base before our
foundation and it's gonna make it look a
lot more flawless so here I am just
putting it all around the face rubbing
it in to the skin I like to sort of
concentrate it on the center of the face
because that's where I have most my
problems and then I will continue to
blend it outwards where I don't really
need as much primer but in general its
everywhere Here I am putting on my
foundation all around the face just
dotting it all over the face the
foundation I'm using is the Laura
Mercier silk cream foundation and I'm
buffing it in with a brush from eBay I
believe this isn't like a set of seven
for like six pounds or something now I'm
just continuing to buff it in it's quite
a thick foundation so what I like to do
is just to make sure that it is fully
buffed in before I move on to anything
else I don't want to make it look too
thick so making sure that you're using a
lot of buffing motions it's gonna make
sure that it looks nice and natural and
flawless next I'm just putting on my
Paint Pot in painterly as our base for
the eye and this is just gonna give a
really nice blank canvas before we put
on any eyeshadow onto the eyes and I'm
going to be using my nas aboard June and
pallet please I could not pronounce
anything front but that is the new
seasonal palette and I'm just using that
warm brown that's gonna go all over the
lid that is in that palette it's a lot
like antique to be honest so if you
don't have this palette or you missed
out antique - my Mac is pretty similar
next I'm going to be using this orange
from this another a seasonal palette
from Mac I'm going to be putting this on
to a blending brush and just going to be
blending it into the crease and blending
it upwards this color as well is pretty
similar to roll from Mac which is in the
program the permanent collection just
blending that upwards in windshield
wiper motions just going to make sure
that that color is really really nice
and blended backwards now I'm just going
to take a matte black and I'm just going
to be adding a nice black V into the
outer corner that's gonna give a nice
smoky effect and it's going to make sure
that it looks nice and winged out
I'm just gonna keep going over it a
couple of times just to make sure that
that black is fully packed on making
sure that it's fully packed on is just
gonna make sure that that intensity of
the black is gonna stay nice and
dramatic and also I'm going to blend up
again with that same orange color from
the Mac palette and I'm going to keep
blending upwards until there's a nice
transition of colors next I'm going to
be doing just a line of liner on the top
of my eye I'm not going to be doing any
wings it's just going to line the top of
my eye just to give it a nice amount of
definition I'm sorry if you can hear
like rain in the background it's like
raining so bad right now by the way I'm
just going to be putting some gel
eyeliner on to the waterline and I'm
gonna I'm using a really really black
one which is gonna make sure that it has
a nice smoky look into this look and
once I've put it on the waterline I am
also going to take it underneath the eye
also and this is just going to intensify
the look even more
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
blend the eyeliner that we've just put
underneath it with the warm brown from
the NARS palette that we put onto the
lid and this is just going to make sure
that it looks nice and blended out and
nice and smoky again
now I'm applying some mascara to my top
lashes and I'm also going to be applying
mascara to the bottom lashes also this
is just going to prep the lashes for the
false lashes that I'm going to apply and
to give the bottom lashes some volume
Here I am applying my falsies these are
an allure goes a loud pair I'm not sure
which ones they are but they're these
spiky ones as far as I know just making
sure that they're fully attached to the
lid and that there are no seams and you
can't see where it starts here I'm just
applying start eyebrow pencil to the
brows from Mac and this is gonna define
my eyebrows a little bit more just give
them a little bit of shape I'm only
applying the eyebrow pencil to the
bottom of the brows and for the rest I'm
just going to be putting through and
brown eye shadow I don't believe it's
charcoal Brown for Mac just to make it a
more natural here I'm using the age
rewind concealer and I'm just putting
that underneath my eyes I believe this
is in light and that's just gonna give
myself a nice highlighted look and I'm
just buffing that in with a think it's a
hair addiction brush as far as I know
and again buffing that into the
foundation with that ebay brush that I
used to apply my foundation just
applying some stay matte powder from
Rimmel all over the face and just going
to make sure that it's nice and matte so
stay on a really long time
I'm gonna be using the Bobbi Brown
bronzer in golden lights and my Mac
contour brush and I'm going to be using
that to contour the cheeks and just to
bronze the outer perimeter of my face
that's gonna warm everything up really
really nicely and it's gonna give myself
a nice sculpted look
I'm gonna be applying NARS satellite of
love blush it's a really really nice
golden tone natural blush with little
gold specks in it really really nice I
love it for looks where you've got a lot
on the eyes or lips
it's just something really neutral if
you want to just add yourself a little
bit of a pop of color really love it and
I'm also applying a Bobby Brown shimmer
brick in pink quartz onto my cheekbones
and I'm gonna be applying it onto the
bridge of my nose and to my Cupid's bow
as well I am lining my lips with
chestnut lip pencil by Mac did have
realized that you couldn't really see it
as I was doing it so I kind of cry out
and I'm applying a Smashbox nude onto my
lips all the details will be down below
by the way guys all the names of all the
products used and I'm just blending it
in with my finger to create a really
really nice hot Brown effect so guys
that is the end of this tutorial I hope
that you enjoyed it I really really
really am sorry about the lighting
it has fluctuated up and down for some
reason it got really really like dark
because it's gonna rain but it got
really really dark and my currents are
my wide open but still there's no light
coming is I'd turn on all my lights and
they're all yellow lighting sara has
made it you know different sort of
colors that maybe what it would have
come out like but it was easy to see
anyway I'm really sorry about the
lighting I try fix it but apart from
that I really do hope that you enjoyed
