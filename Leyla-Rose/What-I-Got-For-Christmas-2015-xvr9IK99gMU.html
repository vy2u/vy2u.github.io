today I'm gonna be doing it chilled kind
of video I just really wanted to do a
video telling you guys what I got for
Christmas this year I've actually
already tried to film this video once
yesterday and I don't know what happened
but I just didn't like how the footage
came out this is my second time filming
there so until that you guys know that I
am NOT bragging in any way I know it's
sad I have to do a disclaimer feel like
sometimes if I don't say things like
this in the video then the comments
section just gets a little bit out of
hand so I just wanted to say I am NOT
bragging in any way shape or form I know
I'm unbelievably blessed and the last
thing I would want to do is just shove
it in people's faces so I love to watch
them and I know lots of other people
like to watch them the people that were
watching my vlogs running up to
Christmas did want to see this video so
this is why I'm doing it so if you guys
would like to see what I got for
Christmas this year then just keep on
watching just want to say that the Sun
is actually setting right now so the
background will most probably change
it's gonna go all the way from this to
dark most likely the first product that
I picked out is this ultra calming skin
kit from Dermalogica and I am so excited
to try this
I tried Dermalogica products way back
when I was a teen and I never had any
problems with them but since I've been
an adult and my skin has got a bit
haywire I haven't actually tried
Dermalogica products so these things
like these are better for a sensitive
skin Josh's mom actually bought these
for me and I'm just so excited to try it
so thank these are just really exciting
and I love skincare as mum also bought
for me these two little candle holders
and she knows how much I love candles I
totally forgot I left them downstairs
but they are so cute and Christmassy so
we started using them straight away but
I love those as well so much and so the
next thing I see here is a mug and this
is a mug that I have been using so much
and I don't think I've had a hot drink
that hasn't been in this mug yet as much
we often you would know that Game of
Thrones means a lot to me I'm obsessed
with you like every throne you know I
love it and so Josh bought me this mug
and I don't really have a mug that's for
me I feel like everyone else has a mug
in my household that I know it's like
personal to them is winter is coming and
then stop on the bottom with the sigil
for their house if you don't
you probably don't know what the heck
I'm talking about if you do you know
while I'm talking about it yes this is
basically my favorite house from Game of
Thrones so he knows me too well and I
love it so much and I just feel given
from thee when I have my drinks in this
speaking of Game of Thrones Josh also
brought to me a book I was written by
the same author that wrote the Game of
Thrones book series and this is a night
of the Seven Kingdoms by George Martin I
love the game of Thrones books The Game
of Thrones books are incredible I'm in
the middle of reading them right now
fairly slowly because I don't get a lot
of extra spare time this day and
Westeros but I don't believe it has
anything to do with the other series the
you know characters may be mentioned the
kingdom might be mentioned but it's a
totally different story so I'm so
excited because the whole world of Game
of Thrones is what really interests me
don't always moans at me that my Game of
Thrones obsession is too much but he's
just feeding my obsession by buying me
more Game of Thrones things so now I'm
gonna show you guys a few make up bit so
I didn't actually want too many make up
bits like I don't know I feel like I get
so much makeup sent to me and I'm also
buying makeup all the time but I didn't
want to ask for too much of it this
year's is the Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette you guys know if
you watch my videos I love the original
chocolate bar palette I saw this I just
knew I loved it automatically because I
just loved the first one so much I've
used it today I've actually used it a
few times since I got it and I am in
love with it smells like chocolate still
which is incredible and the color
selection is of course gorgeous as
always
also this came with the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette this is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and this
is like a mini version I've actually
used this once and I don't really know
how I feel about it yeah it gives a lot
of volume but I don't really feel like
it does much fun length which is what I
really need for my top lashes my brother
also bought me another Too Faced product
that I never wanted to try for the
longest time since I have seen so many
youtubers just rave about it for so long
this is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation and I got it in the color
stand now I've tried this once I work on
boxing day the day after Christmas and
it was a family day so I didn't have a
lot of time to like check my skin but
put it on in the morning or afternoon
time
and then when I checked in the evening
it was super creased of me it was just
creasing and all of my fine lines so I
feel like it needs to be set really well
but I feel like I haven't really fully
fully tried it yeah that's for makeup I
only have two other products and Josh
bought me these Make Up For Ever goodies
so I really wanted to try the Make Up
For Ever HD or the Ultra HD foundation I
actually never had the pleasure of
trying the original HD but yeah this is
a really nice foundation I feel like I'm
gonna really love this one Josh also got
me one of these Pro bronze fusion
bronzers in the color 30 M and the
reason why I put this on my Christmas
list was because of a man that n Singh
seriously influences lots and lots of my
makeup purchases like I am always buying
things because I see them on high
wearing it today and it just gives a
really nice natural bronze the feel of
this product is very strange like it's
not like any other bronzer I have it's
almost like a gel ish smoothie
consistency but it doesn't feel like
that it feels like a powder it's really
weird it's hard to explain
Russia's immediate family is quite a big
family so they started to do Secret
Santa which i think is really fun and so
that's will be done on his side for this
year instead of buying individual
presents and I obviously gave a present
and I got one in as well I don't know
who got me this present I absolutely
love it this is the Emporio Armani
diamonds of rose perfume it's very girly
but very fresh and floral it has that
really nice fresh spring scent so I
really really love this and it's
definitely a perfume that I would wear
almost every day so I'm really happy I
have that it was Secret Santa I'm not
too sure who bought it for me but thank
you so much to whoever of Joseph's
family bought this I absolutely loved it
that was kind of all of the beauty
products now the rest is clothing and
bags so I'm gonna show you guys my mum's
present to me I'm actually bought me
this love musky no crossbody bag and I
am in love with this I actually opened
this early and if you watch my vlogs you
would have known that I opened this one
about a week and a half earlier to
Christmas we really used it so many
times it's definitely one of those bags
I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of use
out of my mum also got me a coat as well
which she totally didn't need to because
that bag was more than enough but she
won
to have something to open up from her on
Christmas Day because she is just too
adorable and thoughtfulness is a
beautiful code I'm just in love with but
almost the waist section is faux fur and
then the arms are faux leather and I
absolutely love this it's just so nice
and I'm definitely gonna be taking this
away to LA with me and then also I have
two pairs of shoes that Josh bought me
as well I am a huge trainer slash
sneaker lover like I love that shoes
I'm obsessed first pair of trainers I
don't know how to pronounce these I
don't know why Mike picks the most
annoying names but I think they called
bro she's rachets Roche I don't even
know
I call them Hershey's and he's honestly
the most comfortable shoes I've ever had
the pleasure of putting on my foot like
literally they are so comfortable as
black mesh fabric with a white sole and
then the Nike swoosh is a silver
material and he also brought me another
pair of trainers
he bought me these adidas Originals
which I have wanted for four ever so the
color I actually asked for of this was
the pure white with the black stripes
and then the gold detail on the tongue
and I love these like these a gorgeous
and these of course aren't for training
they're not really for walking they're
more just to look nice that rounds up
everything that I got for Christmas from
other people and I also got one present
for myself now it's not often I'll
usually buy something for myself I've
never done that before
all of the hard work I've put into my
youtube channel and just all that I've
achieved this year I'm just really proud
of myself so I decided to splurge and
just take a bit plunge and buy myself
something I really wanted for a long
time is my new Louis Vuitton never for
medium back I think it's the MM one I
took the plunge and purchased a Louie
Vuitton never feel bad because of all
the designer bags I've ever wanted I
wanted one of these and I was just gonna
settle for a Michael Kors one because
I've never even owned anything even
Michael Kors level never purchased a
designer bag before in my life nor a
designer piece of anything and so
really nice to actually buy myself
something for once and to open on
Christmas Day was really nice too so
it's kind of just a way of rewarding my
own hard work and I don't know it felt
really good if I like a gift from me to
me it was good I'm not gonna go too much
into the bag because I'm gonna be doing
a what's in my bag video that has been
requested on my channel for quite some
time so now that I have a new bag I
thought why not just do one so I'm gonna
be filming that very soon so let me know
down below if you would like to see that
if you'd like to see just a normal
what's in my bag or a travel edition if
I do a travel edition I can basically
show you guys all of the stuff that I'm
gonna be taking away with me on the
plane let me know I'm so thankful thank
you to all of my friends and family as
they gave me such amazing gifts I also
got a few gift cards and stuff like that
from friends and family to which again I
am extremely thankful for and yeah I
don't want to show that on camera
because I don't know just showing a gift
card you guys so much watching this
video please like it if you enjoyed and
let me know if you guys want to see more
hauls I will see you guys in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
