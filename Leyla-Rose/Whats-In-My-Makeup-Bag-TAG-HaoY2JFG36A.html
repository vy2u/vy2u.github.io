a what's in my makeup bag video I'm
really really excited to do this because
it's my first talking video so I'm
really excited I'm sorry about the
lighting if it's not the best guys I am
experimenting with trying to record in
the evening I'll just go back from what
hence the all-black attire but I really
really do want to start getting more
videos up for you and I really don't
know how else to do it
apart from recording it in the evening
so I thought I'd experiment first with a
talking video just to see how lighting
is and then I can sort of evaluate if I
need to get some artificial lighting in
my room which I think I do but anyway
let's get on to that so firstly I'll
just let you know where my makeup bag is
from this is a makeup bag from
Victoria's Secret it's kind of big to be
honest so this isn't like a small
compact makeup bag this is more sort of
like you know just having actual makeup
in your bag I usually have quite a big
bag so it's not really a problem you
having to store this makeup bag it's not
really usually a problem because I
usually have like a big bag but this is
a really really nice plastic makeup bag
I guess it's plastic it looks like lace
but generally it's really really easy to
clean which I love because makeup is
makeup it's gonna get everywhere so
having a fabric makeup bag isn't very
practical so I really really love having
one that's nice and easy to wipe down
and it's so cute and pink it's lovely
it's a really nice size as well so if
you're going away it's a really nice
size so it has a nice plastic zipper as
well so it's not a metal metal tends to
break pretty easily so it just feels
really well-made to be honest and I
think it was about 20 pounds so the
first thing that I'm going to pull out
of my makeup bag is my face and body
foundation from Mac and the color is c5
the reason why I like carrying this in
my makeup bag is because sometimes after
I put my makeup on I'll forget to I
would take it down to my neck because
sometimes my foundation is a little bit
darker than the rest of my face or in
general this is a really nice foundation
to put all over the body so this is a
really nice foundation that's darker
than my skin and once you put it on it
just gives you the most beautiful glow
so let's put it on my neck area and it
just looks really nice and glowy so
that's why I have that in my makeup
next I have my Studio Fix compact powder
in NC 40 this is generally a powder that
I like to use when I am topping up
throughout the day I don't use this
initially after my foundation I just
sort of like to use it just a top up
here and there when I'm at work or
wherever just because I do get quite
oily in places I've got really annoying
combination skin so that's what I use to
top up and keep the oil away next I have
this highlight which is just a general
highlight this is an MUA one I would
generally just have one highlighter or
another in my bag this isn't like an
essential one it just depends whatever I
would have put on that morning or this
is quite nice one because it's quite
cheap I don't really worry about is
showering everywhere just in case I
don't like putting the most expensive
stuff in my makeup bag just in case but
it is nice to have just a highlighter in
there just in case oh did you chop up my
powder and I need to add myself a little
bit of a glow again I also have a
concealer in here as well just because
under my eyes sometimes then I just get
this really annoying line underneath
when my mascara rubs against my
concealer so if it has been a long day
and I need to top that up I have the
Maybelline fit me concealer in number 20
next I have another Studio Fix powder in
c8 so I know this isn't my color guys
don't laugh at me I've been using this
as a bronze is actually really nice warm
tone for a bronzer I don't know just the
contour and it should be just use it to
give myself a really really nice warm
and stop shading on the outside of my
skin this is really really nice and I'm
really liking this for the summer as
well it just adds a nice sort of and
Colour to the outside of my face next I
have my liners I always need to top up
my liner if I'm going from afterwards or
whatever because my liner just never
seems to stay on so I have my Mac boot
black so this isn't really a
long-lasting liner anyway but I just had
to keep this in my bag just to top up on
top of it I'm not a fan of waterproof
liners so that's why I sort of keep
something like this in there as well and
I also have my defiantly black from Mac
this is my favorite Kohl liner for the
inside of my eye it's beautiful it lasts
a really long time and it's really nice
for sensitive eyes because it doesn't
it'll make your eyes water so it's one
of my favorites and this extra extra
black I'm not having this in my makeup
bag just because you always need to top
up the waterline I mean it never really
will stay on the whole day so that's why
I keep that in there I also have a
little mini mascara in there I don't
really know why this is in here I don't
really tend to top up my mascara but
it's in there so next they're just some
brushes and some lip products so the
brushes that I have in there are these
two ebay brush is the reason why I don't
like putting like expensive brushes into
my makeup bag is because they do get
ruined in there and I wouldn't want to
ruin any of my expensive brushes but
these are really really good brushes
anyway these are some of my favorites
anyway and this is what I sort of use
just to put on bronze are what I need to
top up and this is what I use just to
put on a little bit of my powder
underneath my eyes and this is a really
really nice setting brush as well to put
on maybe like a highlight or something
like that
and lastly lip products I have one matte
lipstick and it's honey lamb they'll
always be a Mac nude lipstick in my
makeup bag no matter what I'm obsessed
with nudes if you know me you know I'm
obsessed of nudes so they'll always be a
Mac nude lipstick in there and I also
have my wire cell number ones as my new
favorites this goes everywhere with me I
really do like it because I just like
pulling this out and applying this one
on I do like pulling this hour it's a
really really nice classy lipstick and
it's nice just to chop up on top of any
normal lipstick cuz it nice gives a
really nice glossy finish last I just
have a lip liner and it's chestnut by
Mac I usually war have some sort of lip
liner in my makeup bag so that is the
end of this video I hope that you
enjoyed it just a nice little quick
talking video just to let you know what
is inside my makeup bag
the be honest I don't use half the stuff
of this when I'm topping up my makeup
don't worry it's just in there generally
if I'm gonna go out after work or if I'm
going out somewhere
it's nice to just have it in there just
in case like you get called the brain or
something but generally keeping makeup
in my bag is something that I've always
tended to do just in case I do want to
invest in a small
make up back then because I just thought
about that size is too big for me to be
honest so yeah but anyway guys I hope
