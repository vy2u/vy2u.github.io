today I'm so excited to be sitting down
and talking to you guys cuz I feel like
it's been a little while since you know
we've gotten to chat so basically I'm
gonna be giving you guys a sneak peek to
see what's in my iPhone guys would like
to see what I have on my iPhone then
just keep on watching I have an iPhone
at 5s so I still have this small one I
know everyone is already onto the six I
have the Lummi selfie phone case which
is so good for taking selfies to begin
with I have a picture of my love yes I
have a picture of Josh I have a picture
of him that I took whilst he was
training in the gym and the light hit
him perfectly and he is just so
unbelievably photogenic I'm just jealous
of how photogenic he is so on my phone
on the top row I have my photos whatsapp
mail and my calendar if you go into my
photos you'd most likely see about two
billion selfies because I'm one of those
people that can't just take one selfie
and be done with it
I take 300 selfies and have to pick the
best one or I look at the best is anyone
else like that they also have whatsapp
which is basically an instant messaging
thing it's pretty much where I talk to
everyone on that it was so have my
emails which I have too many emails
right now and of course I have my
calendar the second row is all of my
social media that I use on a regular
basis so of course YouTube you guys are
watching me now on youtubes I also have
my Instagram which I am in love with I'm
loving like trying new themes and stuff
at the moment I'm trying a white theme
and I'm just loving Instagram so don't
forget to follow me on that as well I am
makeup by Laila on all social media I
also have Twitter and snapchat on
Twitter I use a lot as well just to talk
to you guys do positive quotes and I
make up by Layla on that as well and
snapchat make up by Layla on that as
well so don't forget to follow me on all
social media so on the third row the
first app that I have is a game this is
best fiends and this game is so
addictive like when I say addictive it's
like one of those games that you won't
be able to stop playing
I have got my mum absolutely hooked on
it and it's so funny because she's
trying to catch up to what level I'm on
at the moment I am one at level 46 and I
think she's on level 30 something it is
it's kind of tense I'm gonna weigh the
competition is real in our house and so
I'm a level 40
I'm kind of stuck I've been stuck on
here for about a day or so and I just
can't get past this level it's a really
fun game I'll show you guys some
gameplay aim is to kill the slugs by
doing lots of different combinations
with the little colored icons below so
summer fruit so it leaves some water
drops and you basically want to connect
as many of each color as possible so the
more you connect if you get six or seven
you get way more points if you only do
three or four you don't get as many
points and on some levels you're doing
ones where you can connect like ten and
it's just so pleasing to the eye it's
really fun so I've been loving this game
lately it is a super super fun game and
I feel like anyone can get really into
it so if my mom can get addicted to it I
think anyone can and as you can tell I'm
on level 46 I think I mean I don't think
I've ever been level 46 on any phone
game in my life so I'm really addicted
and so is my mom so I am loving best
fiends it's a really good game and it's
just really addictive so I will leave a
link down below in the description box
where you can download best fiends
directly and it's free to download on
the App Store which is amazing next on
my phone I have Pinterest now I am quite
a new Pinterest person like I know
Pinterest has been out for absolutely
ages I personally just go on there to
get inspiration for things on port I'm
gonna be decorating my new office very
soon so I just go on there and look for
office ideas also just go on there to
look at cute lore animals as well so my
Game of Thrones stuff on here anything
just to gain inspiration or just to look
at cute cool pictures that's why I go on
Pinterest for and then I also have
tumblr and again I have used tumblr or
post on there I just go on there just to
look at stuff just because I like to
look at things I'm a very visual person
so I like to look at just nice looking
pictures and I mainly go on tumblr to
look at pictures of places to travel
like it gives me inspiration for the
next place I'm gonna go traveling too
because traveling is definitely
something that's on my list and I want
to just go as many places as possible so
I go on tumblr to look at really nice
places also have Spotify I only really
use Spotify on my phone when I'm at the
gym apart from that I mainly use Spotify
from my computer I like to listen to
music in the gym because I feel like it
really helps me to focus and I just feel
like nothing else really matters around
me
think about anyone else so on the fourth
row I have time hop notes clock and
calculator so notes clock and calculator
don't have to go through them because
every iPhone has one but time hop is a
really cool app I really like this
because I feel like I can look through
all of my past history and it will find
all of your past so for me and I started
Facebook about seven years ago so it
finds all of those embarrassing statuses
and you can just review it on the fourth
row again just a lot of normal things
Maps which I use quite a bit just to
figure out where things are of course
weather app store and of course settings
at the bottom row where it's you know
everything's permanently there those are
just my most used things I suppose so my
phone my messages Safari and camera just
because those are always there the next
page I have little folders but the first
folder I have here is photography and
that is all my photo editing apps now
today I decided not to share those with
you because I thought I would be cheeky
and show you guys in a separate video
but all for good reason because I want
to talk through with you guys and show
you in depth how I edit my photos
because I'd like to see that please like
this video and comment down below
because I will do a video on that very
soon I can folder is photo sharing this
has my Google Drive
onedrive and Dropbox I also have
PlayMemories which is the app I used to
get all of my photos off of my sony
camera which i used to take all of my
selfies and it just goes straight into
my phone through Wi-Fi so that's the app
I use and then I also have free prints
which is an amazing app all of you guys
need it basically like a photo printing
app and you can print off as many photos
as you like they give you I think forty
five free photos a month and then I also
have a little shopping folder it's kind
of a lonely folder all I have in here is
eBay and Amazon of eBay which I don't
really use a lot to be honest about
Amazon which I use all the time others
in Prime is my life whenever I need
anything I go straight onto here this is
where I get all of my Adele and red
cherry lashes from I also get quite a
lot of drugstore makeup of Amazon as
well just because they do deliver next
day so if you need something really
quickly they do Next Day Delivery and
it's that as soon as you pretty much
wake up the last fold on the top row is
a health folder
one is pink pad now this might be a
little bit TMI but this is basically
what I use to track my lady time of the
month also have the Virgin active app
and because I go to Virgin active Jim
basically book classes on hair and stuff
like that so that's why I have the
Virgin active app Asli I have my fitness
power which I haven't really got into
using yeah I used to use it a long time
ago but it's really good to track your
calories so if you have a specific
amount of calories fats carbs protein
that you need to stick to within a day
this is really good because you can
track everything I have in this little
travel folder Addison Lee and uber those
are both cab services and then I have
air B&amp;amp;B which is one of my favorite apps
to look at if you are gonna go on an
adventurous holiday and you just want to
stay in an apartment air B&amp;amp;B is really
good but they also do like amazing
places all over the world as well and I
also have dream days in here as well
which is a countdown
I have no holidays or vacations to count
down to at the moment by the moment I
have Game of Thrones season 6 -
countdown - there are 68 days to go at
the moment and chill game with runs
which is pretty exciting for me and also
I have my 21st on here and Christmas Day
is automatically on here and so I wrote
down my 21st which is five months and
two days away that is when I turned 21
that's kind of just a countdown app I
really like that because I don't know
how to prepare for things also have a
boring old finance folder this has my
banking and PayPal on there just because
I don't know it's easy and in the last
water I have entertainment and that has
crowdfire which is basically how to
check if people have unfollowed you also
have a world of ice and fire and this is
basically just a whole Game of Thrones
app and then of course in the last
folder is a bunch of extras that I do
not use and I just never touch because
you can't delete them because Apple is
annoying that way because at the end of
this video I hope you enjoyed seeing
what was on my iPhone guys are excited
as well to see my editing process of
editing photos if you would like to see
how I edit my selfies on Instagram or my
thumbnails then comment down below I
hope you guys enjoyed I will see you all
in my next video and I will talk to you
later
bye guys
