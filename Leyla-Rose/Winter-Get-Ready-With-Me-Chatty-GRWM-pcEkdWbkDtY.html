today I'm going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this makeup look right
here my hair is not done yeah but that's
because I'm literally going out right
now which is why I wanted to film a chit
chat get ready with me I decided to go
for this kind of look that has lots of
golds and browns and I'm even wearing a
brown lip - which isn't something I tend
to wear on a regular basis but I didn't
want to change up a little bit I was
doing to see how I achieved this makeup
look and chitchat with me a whilst I get
ready then just keep on watching so guys
I'm gonna get started off by priming my
skin I'm gonna be taking the oil control
lotion from Mac I used to really love
this when I used to work for Mac so yeah
giving it another try okay for my
Bourjois healthy mix foundation and
because I am fairly town right now this
shade well either match or be a little
bit too dark for me so I'm gonna be
taking this in the shade bronze and I
also have this new thing I'm obsessed
with this is the body shops shade
adjusting drops this is amazing like if
you're like me and you have loads of
foundations to match different colors
like the majority of my foundations are
darker then lightening one so it's
almost like a pure white almost and you
drop as many drops as you need to into
your foundation until it matches your
skin and I just absolutely love this
just gonna drop two drops of this to
there to blend that and I'm taking this
elf buffing brush and I'm just gonna be
buffing this into my skin and I
absolutely love the bourgeois foundation
really hydrates the skin and it's just
really nice and moisturizing it's
probably not the best thing for oily
oily skin this looks nice and healthy I
guess that's why it's called the healthy
mix foundation make sense I can't
believe we are so close to Christmas
like I can't keep track of it especially
because I work from home I feel like I
don't really look at dates that much I
feel like I just do days of the week so
when I actually realize that Christmas
is that chilly next week I don't feel
very prepared that's also I still have
more Christmas presents to buy so I
still need to do that day I'm just going
to straight you up for some concealer
I'm gonna be taking neat nas a radiant
creamy concealer I haven't used this in
ages I'm just
be putting a little bit under the eyes
or something someone to my forehead and
down the bridge of my nose and then also
just on how my chin - they'll be
blending the end with my morphe g2a
brush
now I'm going to be taking of course my
favorite setting powder this is the soap
&amp;amp; Glory instant retouch powder I felt
like I don't even need to introduce this
anymore so I'm just gonna take this and
set all of the areas we applied our
concealer so is everyone like prepared
for Christmas like let me know down
below if you guys have all your presents
yet because I don't like I seriously you
need to get myself together really have
that long to get ready so this is really
like one of those quick get ready with
me that I really know if I have much
time I don't know what I'm doing on the
eyes all I know is I really want to use
this palette because I haven't used it
yet Disney Revolution salted caramel
palette and I will show you guys what it
looks like inside this palette is meant
to be an exact dupe for the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette start
off with the pur blending crease brush
from the crown and I'm not kidding this
is like my favorite transition shade
brush in the world now this is literally
all I will use I am so in love the best
it's amazing first of all I'm gonna be
taking is this peachy brown shade right
here I'm just gonna be taking that
peachy Brown and applying that into the
crease oh this colors oh just just can't
seem to accept that I am going away to
LA in like three weeks I do not feel
prepared in this slightest like journeys
like I like car rides but I don't like
airplane ride I am NOT a good flyer in
the slightest so going on an 11 hour
flight it's definitely scary for me I've
been on long haul flights before it's so
busy because of vlogmas I just haven't
had any time to pre record videos for
when I go to LA yeah so as soon as
Christmas is over and I've stopped
looking I'm gonna start to perfect core
videos but I probably only will be
uploading twice a week whilst I'm out
there just because I do feel that it
will just be a lot easier for me to
manage three videos a week wash them
away it is a little bit hard with a max
two on seven brush I'm just gonna be
taking some of this matte Brown just
here and just applying it into the outer
V area these colors really are pigmented
like you really don't need to apply that
much of it has anyone planned the makeup
they're wearing for Christmas Day yeah
cuz I honestly have no idea I really
like this simple holiday makeup look I
done the one with the glossy nude lip
I'll link it down below
it might be nice to go for something
more natural this year and then I might
change it to a red let like a deep
breath lip as the night goes on
I don't know I'm being extra all I'm
really gonna be is just being with my
family but I just feel like every more
my makeup to look good on Christmas Day
I'm super excited for Christmas this
year like more than usual um I don't
know why I think it's just because I'm
really excited to just spend time with
my family and just playing games I think
this is gonna be so fun and also I'm
excited to the food I can't wait to just
literally stuff myself are we taking
this gold shade next and just applying
it onto the lid to highlight the inner
corners of my eye I'm gonna be taking
this shade right here this just seems
like a shimmery champagne color so I'm
just gonna be taking that on the makeup
geek pencil brush but I had no idea I
was going for like Gold's but clearly I
have I'm gonna be taking some lashes I'm
gonna go for the eyelid 1 to 6 because
I've just been loving them at the moment
whenever I seem to buy a new pack of
these I just become really obsessed with
them you guys have also asked me quite a
lot what lash glue I like to use and the
lash glue that I just absolutely love is
the house of lashes clear lash glue then
gonna go ahead and take some of the scar
and just use it to make the natural
lashes blend into the false ones we're
just gonna take some of this black kohl
eyeliner from a Rimmel and I'm gonna run
it along my waterline notice I really
need to sharpen this look bottom lashes
I'm just gonna apply some mascara and
that's the I don't put any eyeshadow on
the bottom lashes gonna place up a scar
only annoying no cleanup sure you guys
have seen this tip every web if you get
mascara on your nose or anywhere you
want to wait until it's totally dry
before you move it and then all you need
to do is just take a dry q-tip and then
just push it and it's gone eyes are done
I'm gonna move on to my brows clear brow
gel
fust instead of off duh and this is more
what I want to go for more of a natural
look so what we'll do is just kind of
flick the brows through like everything
upwards more upwards diagonally I just
need something up that has slightly
bombed my bra Joe is drawing because I
don't like to fill the minute so that's
really dry I can bronze my skin is this
the mac mineralize skinfinish in dark
golden taking it on the sides at my head
and just under my cheekbone nothing to
me I actually don't want to look neat
today I just want to look nice and
bronzed
sticking the Kiko single eyeshadow in
208 to give me that nice gorgeous gold
highlights gonna be taking my brow
pencil and just flicking it through the
brows in the direction that we basically
put the brow gel through so in the
direction that the hairs are going that
is the direction that I'm going to be
drawing that the little hairs for my
lips I'm just gonna be lining and
filling in my lips totally with cork lip
liner and I'm really excited because I
don't usually tend to go with these kind
of colors all over the lips I take these
soft matte lip cream from NYX in the
color Abu Dhabi and I'm just gonna be
applying this to the center at the lip
so guys this is the finished look
definitely not all that color I usually
tend to go for but I do really like it I
think it complements all the skin I'm
really nicely I think of a compliment a
lot of skin tones so hope you guys
enjoyed this get ready with me I am
gonna do my hair off camera because I'm
gonna go like get changed and do my hair
