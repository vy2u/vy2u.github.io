channel today I'm going to be showing
you all how to achieve this wood elf
makeup look
so signing off I already actually have
one of my ELF is on and I already have
part of my brow covered too
I also use some of the make up forevers
step on smoothing primer to prep my skin
I'm going to be taking some latex elf
ears and I'm going to be applying them
to my ear using spirit gum I'm going to
first make sure that it fits onto my ear
really well and just see where I'm going
to place it before I apply any glue I'm
using spirit gum to adhere this to my
ear but you can use any adhesive you
like spirit gum is really good because
it really does stay on and it doesn't
remove unless you use spirit gum remover
so make sure you do have the correct
remover before you apply these to your
ear I first of all just adhered the
tiniest little bit before adhering the
rest of the ear I like to personally
apply the spirit gum in small pots just
so that I can make sure that each part
is adhered to the ear at a time because
all of it at once it's hard to hold it
down and make sure it hears I definitely
do like to make sure that I'm holding it
as it's sticking together so yeah do it
bit by bit because I just feel like this
is definitely the best rate to do it for
my eyebrows I'm gonna be basically
covering half of my brow so we can go
for a lot more of a straighter brow as
you can see the tail of my brow comes
downwards so for this look I really did
want to cover it I'm just using some
prick stick and pushing my brows
downwards and applying a translucent
powder in between each layer I do this
about three to four times just to create
a really nice layer of glue and that way
it will be nice and matte and we can
apply some foundation over it to
completely cover that part of the brow
if you already have straight brows you
can skip this step if you're like me and
your tail comes downwards I definitely
recommend doing it just because it
really does change the shape of the eyes
and it really makes you look really elf
like I'm first just applying some
concealer and patting it on top and then
I'm taking a full coverage concealer the
same color as my skin and applying it on
top of this gradually applying the
concealers and foundations on top of
this just means that it's gonna cover up
a lot better I really want to make sure
that that eyebrow color because I've got
dark brows I really
make sure we can't see the underneath so
I'm just applying that around that area
just to really hide the color of the
brow and again I'm just making sure that
once I'm done covering with cream
products to set it because we're going
for a lot of eye makeup I am going to be
priming my eyes so I'm using the
Maybelline age rewind concealer to do
this I'm just patting in with my finger
and just ensuring it to set that also
just so that it doesn't move I'm using a
translucent powder to set it next taking
this sleek matte neutral palette I'm
taking this matte peach shade and I'm
going to use it as my first transition
color I'm just taking this on a blending
brush and blending this into my real
crease and I'm going to create a little
bit of a fake crease we're going to go
for a cut crease today so I am extending
it extremely upwards and outwards to
really change the shape of the eye so as
you can see I'm kind of going up towards
where the tail of my brow would
naturally be if they weren't covered and
then I'm also taking this dark warm
brown and applying it into the crease to
further deepen the crease and also to
warm it up a little bit I wanted to go
for warm earthy colors because we are a
wood elf so I just kind of imagined
there to be nice earthy colors all
around the face so I didn't want to go
for anything cool I wanted to stick with
greens and browns and golds and just
earthy colors I'm just making sure to
blend it and to keep that same shape
that really turns upwards again I'm just
going in with some darker Browns and
just making sure to apply that into the
deeper part of the crease just gradually
making sure that they crease like stark
are because the eyes are kind of intense
for this look so I'm just applying it
into the crease and then I'm going to
apply some black again this doesn't have
to be neat because we are going to be
cleaning up the cut crease ourselves so
you can be as messy as you want
again I'm just following that black and
turning it upwards and outwards to Wars
where my tail of my brow would have been
then taking the NYX jumbo pencil in milk
I'm just going to be applying this all
over the lid and then taking a small
brush and we're going to start to carve
out our cut crease for this look again
we are going to follow the same kind of
shape as we did with the crease colors
we want it to be on our lid and then we
want to extend it outwards towards where
the tail of our brow would have been so
as you can see I'm just gradually
carving out the shape slowly to create
the shape that I want and then taking
magic act from makeup geek I'm just
going to be patting this on top to act
as a base for our glitter we're going to
be applying I'm just taking this small
blending brush and applying this into
the crease or fake crease that we've
just created and I'm just going to be
applying a little bit more black just to
further deepen it and to make it look
like a real crease and to really give it
some definition I'm going to be applying
a very small wing of liner to lift the
eyes and I don't want this line to
connect to the other crease line we've
created I want it to sit on its own
because this is going to be kind of
turning our eyes upwards for this I'm
using a pen liner and I'm just going on
top of it with a liquid to darken it
more I'm also just cleaning up these
sides with a makeup wipe just to really
keep that sharp outer corner
next I'm just going to apply a liquid
Blitzen liner to my lid to act as a base
for the loose glitter we're going to be
applying this one is from NYX the
glitter I'm going to be applying is from
shop violet Voss and this is an e color
golden fairy and I'm just patting it on
top while that liquid glycerin liner is
still wet and that will just basically
adhere to it and this just gives it a
really nice pretty fairy look because
glitter is the most mystical thing ever
right then I'm taking some Eldora force
lashes and applying them to my lid and
this is just going to give us a little
bit more of that dramatic look and it's
also going to lift our eyes upwards
because I did pick a style of lash that
lifts our eyes and gets longer towards
the outer corner I also applied some
mascara and now I'm just applying my
foundation this is the ex1 invisi wear
foundation and I'm just applying it to
my face to get a nice even coverage all
over and I'm also going to be applying
this to my ears as well because I do
want to make sure that my ears
match my face because at the moment the
fake is are a little bit darker than my
actual skin color so I do want to kind
of make sure that they match a little
bit too
next I'm just going to be highlighting
my undereyes using the Maybelline age
rewind concealer again and I'm just
doing any triangle shape under the eyes
to really lift our eyes and to give us a
really structured cheekbone I'm also
going to be using this on my forehead
the bridge of my nose and also on my
chin and my upper lip to bring these
areas forward I'm blending the end with
the same brush I used to apply my
foundation and just making sure this is
all really well blended to achieve that
super highlighted look I'm using the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer in NC 15 and just
applying it under the eyes on the chin
and also the bridge of the nose to
really bring these areas forward
blending it in with my finger and also
the same brush we used to apply the
foundation before we want to make sure
that this color stays in that specific
position as well to just make sure that
you Pat it instead of Rob
to set these areas I applied the
concealer and taking Mac emphasized
powder and I'm just taking that on a
tapered highlighter brush and just
applying this under the eyes onto the
nose the forehead any areas we basically
highlighted and this will just set these
areas and also make sure that they stay
bright as well for my brows I'm going to
be taking a gel brow cream this one is
from Mac and I'm just going to be
drawing a straight line on the bottom
part of my brow and literally creating a
straight brow I didn't want to go for a
total like Spock brow so I'm gonna be
applying a little bit more of an arch as
well but I did want it to be a super
straight shape I wanted it to be full
but I did want the inner corner of the
brow to be quite bushy and untamed so as
you can see I'm applying only this cream
to the outer corner of my brow and then
on the inner corner of the brow I'm
taking the anastacio brow duo powder and
just applying it and really pushing it
upwards and then taking my brow gel the
same one I always use I'm just turning
all my brow hairs upwards again to
create a really nice untamed look and
then I'm just taking a little bit of
that brow cream again I brush and just
using it to kind of flick hairs and give
the appearance a really brushy in a
corner of the brow next I'm just going
to be contouring the upper part of my
nose I didn't want to touch the bottom
of the nose this is just something that
I've seen in a lot of reference pictures
that I was looking at and so I'm just
kind of using dark Browns and light
Browns to define this area and as you
can see I stopped Midway of the nose so
I'm not touching the bottom of the nose
at all
next to contour my face I'm going to
take the color sculpt from Mac and just
apply this into the cheekbones on the
sides of my forehead and just to really
slim down the face I really wanted to
create the appearance of a very gaunt
and skinny face so I'm just as you can
see doing it on either sides of the
forehead and also underneath the
cheekbone and then I go in with a
smaller brush and just use this to
further concentrate this color right
there in cheek bone
and then to intensify even more I'm just
going in with a slightly darker color
and just applying it in the deeper part
of the contour as well then I am taking
a gel liner this one is from Maybelline
starting in the middle of my eye I'm
just lining the bottom of my eyelid and
then as it gets to the inner corner
we're kind of going to create a new
inner corner to make our eyes look a lot
brighter and a lot bigger you can kind
of see what I'm doing it's kind of hard
to explain but I'm just kind of dragging
this line downwards and then connecting
my real inner corner to it to create a
fake inner corner if that makes sense
I'm just thickening that line a little
bit to what I like and then also
extending the outer corner and I'm still
not joining the two lines I just wanted
to create a little bit more of a flick
on the outer corner and fill in my
waterline in with the NYX jumbo pencil
in milk and also the new inner corner as
well next taking this forest green shade
I am going to be applying this with a
pencil brush onto the bottom lash line I
wanted to just include a little bit of
green just to give it that nice woodsy
effect and then to highlight all the
areas of my face and taking a Nastasia
Beverly Hills so Hollywood highlighter
and just applying it onto all the high
points on the tops of my cheekbones and
also onto the tip of my nose too
so as you can see I've kind of dressed
into my costume before I did my lips I
have some jewelry on a fake nose ring
and also I have done my hair too I will
have all the details of where everything
is from listed down below for my lips I
wanted to keep it super simple just
because I don't really think that I
wanted to go for a deep lip color or
anything I was looking up myself while I
had nothing on it and I kind of liked
the look of having kind of foundation
lips a little bit so there was already
foundation on my lips so I kind of left
it that way and just to find my lips a
little bit more with stone lip liner
just so my lips didn't fade and I took
the jumbo pencil in milk and just
applied it a little dot on the center of
my bottom lip down my chin and also on
my Cupid's bow to act as kind of tribal
markings you can totally leave the look
like this but I did want to show you
guys an alternative if you wanted to
make it look even more tribal like play
a little bit more of that jumbo pencil
in milk underneath the eyes in a messy
triangle shape and also above my brows
as well for me it would kind of be a
little bit more primal in the sense that
they have kind of tribal markings
depending where they're from I don't
know it's totally mystical so it's up to
you I think it looks good both ways but
I totally love it with the markings as
well I love both of them so guys that is
the end of this look this is totally my
