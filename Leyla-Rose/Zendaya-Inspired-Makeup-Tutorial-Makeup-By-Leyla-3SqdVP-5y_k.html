today's makeup tutorial is going to be
another celebrity inspired makeup look
this one is inspired by the beautiful
and the amazing zendaya
so before we begin I just wanted to let
you guys know I had already applied my
foundation and primer I use the ex1
invisi wear foundation and the prep and
prime natural radiance from Mac for my
eyes I'm gonna be taking the Mac soft
ochre painful and applying it all over
my lid all the way up to my brow this
will just make everything blend a lot
easier and it's also just gonna make all
of the colors stand out a lot more as
well for today's look we're going to be
using these Smashbox full exposure
palette and I'm taking this soft brown
color first I'm gonna be using this with
a blending brush and just blending it as
well as I can into the crease because
this is our first transition shade you
want to make sure that it's the most
blended you can make it that way
all the other colors will blend really
effortlessly into the rest of the eye I
wanted to apply this as well because
Zendaya's look is very neutral and does
involve quite a few cool tones
so this will just kind of warm up the
look before we begin with the cool toned
colors then I'm taking this cool gray
toned brown and I'm gonna be applying
this with a smaller blending brush into
the crease and I'm just gonna kind of
focus it deeper into that crease area
this will just add a little bit of
definition and this is just gonna start
to smoke out the look you also want to
make sure you're going back into that
previous brush just to make sure that it
blends really effortlessly and that it
doesn't have a really harsh line between
colors so go back and forth in between
brushes as many times as you need to to
make sure this gray color blends into
that Brown
next I'm going to be taking this light
matte gray shade and we're gonna be
applying this with a big shader brush
all over the lid we're just gonna kind
of sweep this all over to create a
really nice soft lid effect then we're
gonna take this matte black shade and
we're gonna keep this solely in the
outer V area we don't want to take this
up to the crease at all because then
days.look was really focused on the
smokiness on the outer corner of our
eyes and this kind of pulls our eyes
upwards and outwards and this just kind
of gives us that cat eye effect without
taking it into the crease so I'm just
keeping this in the outer corner and I'm
gonna make sure that I take a separate
blending brush the brush that we used
before hand just to make sure that all
the edges of that black are really
really well blended out next I'm going
to take a thin line of eyeliner and just
run it across my lash line it looked
like zendaya didn't really have a lot of
eyeliner but you could definitely tell
that there was some there so I'm just
gonna apply it onto the eye and then on
the outer corner I am just gonna wing it
out the tiniest little bit just because
this is more flattering for my
particular eyes shape so just do
whatever you feel will suit your eye
shape the best for me if I don't win the
owl it looks a little bit weird so I
just winged out the tiniest little bit
next I just went into the black a little
bit more just to smoke out that eyeliner
and just to make it look like it blends
in a little bit although this is a
liquid it won't blend but it will just
make it look a little bit more seamless
then I'm applying some false lashes and
my mascara
the name of these lashes will be down in
the description box I'm just applying
some mascara to make sure that my
natural lashes blend really well with
the false ones next I'm just gonna apply
some concealer this will not only
brighten my eyes but because I already
had my foundation on this will also kind
of clean up the edges of that eye makeup
also so I'm just applying them in all
the areas I would like to highlight
Zendaya's face always looks amazingly
structured she doesn't look to over
contour but she is highlighted really
really nicely so making sure to apply
this in all the areas I want to bring
forward under my eyes on my forehead on
the bridge of my nose and also my chin
and I'm gonna blend that into the rest
of my compaction with a damp Beauty
Blender
and then as always to get right up to
the lashline and to really clean up the
corners of my eye makeup I'm gonna be
taking my Sigma 3d HD precision brush
this will just get into all those areas
and make sure that my base is looking
flawless
next I'm going to be setting all the
areas I applied my concealer and I'm
using my soap &amp;amp; Glory instant retouch
powder I'm using this on a sigma f-35
brush and I just absolutely love the
combination of these two together it
just sets my face so beautifully and it
just makes everything look so smooth so
I love this powder with this brush just
an amazing combination and I love it for
my skin it just makes my skin look so
flawless which I love and it also just
works really well on top of the
foundation I used to next I'm gonna be
showing you guys roughly how I'm doing
my eyebrows I usually cut this part out
but I wanted to show you guys why
roughly did because it's not exactly the
same how I usually fill in my brows I'm
using the same products but I did kind
of change the shape a little bit because
then day--is brows are different to mine
but I can't completely change the shape
of my brows so I'm just kind of applying
it in all the usual areas but what I did
a little bit differently was extend my
brow outwards at the tail a little bit
more but I also filled them in a little
bit darker than I usually would -
because then day--is brows are just
always always always on point I'm
running it through with a brow gel just
because I need a brow gel cuz my brows
is so curly they just really need to
stay in place so I'm flicking the inner
part of my brow upwards and then the
rest towards their natural direction
that they grow and this just makes them
look a million times neater and I just
absolutely love the way that this works
next I'm just gonna apply some Kohl
pencil to my waterline this will just
completely smoke out the look we are
also gonna be applying this on the
bottom lash line too and this will just
kind of create that really nice smoky
effect that zendaya had I loved her eye
makeup
obviously her eye makeup was the whole
focus of this look and I just loved how
smoky the bottom lash line was so I'm
just applying it and running it in
between my lashes
and then once that's on I'm gonna smudge
it with a smudger brush I did apply a
little bit of that brown eyeshadow we
apply it in the crease just to help
blend out that black a little bit more
and then I did just apply a tiny little
bit more black just to make sure that it
looks super super smoky and then I just
went ahead and applied my mascara to my
bottom lash line just so that the eyes
look complete and also it just balances
the top lash line from the bottom
because we are wearing false lashes
so obviously zendaya is a darker skin
tone than me but she did look
particularly bronzed in this particular
look so I did wanna bronze a little bit
more than I usually would so I'm just
taking my normal bronzing powder but
just applying a little bit more than I
actually would and I love how bronzed
she look she was bronzed on her
cheekbones she was bronzed on her
forehead
and she was also contoured so I am
taking the Bahama Mama bronzer and just
kind of contouring a little bit this
powder is amazing because it's warm
enough to be a bronzer but it does have
a coolness to it where it does structure
your face too which I love I'm just
applying that in all the areas that I
want to appear more sunken in
I'm also using this to contour my nose a
little bit just to give it a little bit
extra shape
and then I'm just running my beauty
blender underneath the contour just to
make it look a little bit sharper and
this just kind of gives the face a
little bit more shape as well so you can
just kind of see I'm just running it
along the bottom of the contour and this
just cleans up a little bit I'm then
highlighting with my Becca opal
highlighter just to give us a little bit
of that glow
zendaya always looks glowing so I just
knew I had to add a highlighter know I
could live with that one anyway and for
the lips I went in with two Mac lip
pencils at the moment I'm running
stripped down lip pencil all along my
lips completely filling in my lips with
it as well and then I'm gonna go in with
cork lip pencil which is also from Mac
and it's a darker version of stripped
down it's quite deep and I'm just gonna
use this to kind of run it along the
outside of my lip line
so this is me applying Cork at the
moment cork will just kind of give it a
little bit more definition and also just
darkens the lip because her lip did look
quite brown but this really does help
define the lips and it does make our
lips look fuller also and then I'm
taking a NYX soft matte lip cream in
London and just adding that on top so
that the lips feel more comfortable so
