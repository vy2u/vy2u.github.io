weird to be putting this on my main
channel because I very very rarely do
I've got like one or two videos like
this in my whole time of being on
YouTube but I just like how something I
just like really just need to explain
but I should have done this ages ago I
have a second channel where I talk about
this kind of stuff more and I will get
into that a bit later I'm gonna keep
looking down on my phone because I made
it like no just because I don't want
this video to be too long they want it
to be dragged out and I'm a talker you
guys know that I'm a talker if you're
not a subscriber of mine I really don't
know how much you're gonna care about
this but whatever happens whether you
like me or you don't I pray that you can
just like take some kind of light from
this as possible if possible so the
reason why I have decided to make this
now is because I pop Halloween tutorial
a couple of days ago and when I uploaded
it I honestly like didn't expect the
comments to be the way that they were I
got accused of like copying someone else
and honestly like genuinely I'm gonna
hold my hands up and say I genuinely did
not copy anyone it was honestly a
coincidence and I just decided to remove
the video because like that it's not
like stuff like that usually bothers me
because hate doesn't not bother me trust
me like I've had it all honestly hate
really doesn't get to me but I think
because of just like the way I've been
feeling lately it was like the cherry on
top of the cake and then once I did
leave it that video I was like right I
just need to make this video now because
emotionally like it kind of just pushed
me like that was what push me but it
wasn't the cause of all of this if that
makes sense so if you're wondering
without video when not many of you saw
it because I don't think it got sent out
to subscription boxes per usual but um
yeah a lot of you guys have been like
messaging me on social media and my DMS
and stuff being like where's the where's
the skull and I deleted it so yeah I'm
gonna keep it deleted just because that
was just like loads of drama I'm really
sorry I keep touching my hand just
because it's a little baby that you need
to you need to go that's what kind of
like pushed me to this but it wasn't the
cause if that makes sense
generally like this year has honestly
been
the hardest year I've ever faced
honestly I've just I've like I've had
challenges that I never thought I'd have
come my way
I've just had situations I just never
thought were gonna happen and my life
just looks totally different to me than
how it looked at the beginning of this
year like in January I could have never
expected that I would have been in the
emotional and like just the place that
I'm in in my life right now
and not all of its negative honestly
like I've you know me you know that I
try and like take the positive out of
everything as much as possible and like
run with that instead of like focusing
on all of the negative things and
everything I do believe is like happened
in my life for a reason and I could I'd
be lying if I said they hadn't affected
me because it definitely has in content
whilst feeling like I'm not myself and
feeling like I'm in an unstable
emotional place and just like my mental
state might not be at its best it's
honestly harder than what you think is
like putting up a front and pretending
everything's okay for social media to
stick to your uploading schedule and to
keep pushing out content for you guys
it's harder than you think it is and I
am NOT saying this in any way shape or
form that I want pity or anything from
you guys I just genuinely am just
telling you how I feel because I did
stop uploading as much as I did a lot of
you guys may not even notice that much
like I used to upload two times a week
and now I've been uploading once a week
big difference for me but like to you
guys maybe you ever noticed maybe you
have YouTube is just weird anyway like a
lot of you guys don't get my
subscription so if you haven't already
clicked the bell I don't live to be like
a shameless self-promoter
initially if I click the bow if you guys
want to see my videos because that way
you guys will be notified when I upload
so you don't miss anything as much as I
wanted to continue making content which
I have I couldn't be like the best that
I have been and I can be because I
honestly just treasure my mental health
too much and I didn't want to exhaust
myself because if any of you guys have
ever suffered
anything mental health-related you will
know what I mean when I say that you
just feel exhausted all the time and I
it's not about being physically tired
but I want to disappoint you guys by
uploading less I know I did but you
don't understand like how stressed I get
about it I'll literally be like feeling
guilty for not uploading as often as I
did and if I missed a video like one
video a week for example I will feel so
bad and I really beat myself down about
it because I'm such a perfectionist and
I worked so hard at my channel to like
build it to be what it is and to like
create such a nice community that we
have here like it's it was a real like
passion that I turned into my career and
that's why it means so much to me and I
would never want to let go of it and
that's also why I really didn't want to
just stopped uploading by the same time
I didn't want to just like upload
rubbish content so that's why I haven't
been uploading much all of the videos
pretty much I've been putting out I'm
not unhappy with it's just if I had been
uploading more often I know that the
content wouldn't have been as good and
even so still I would rather put out
quality or quantity if that makes sense
that's why I like I didn't take an
actual break you know even though
probably why did need you know it
probably did need a break from social
media I don't know if anyone's on is he
gonna care about this but this isn't a
cry for help it's not me wanting pity
from you guys I honestly just warned you
guys to know that this is kind of like
the reason and I want you guys to know
my mindset behind it like it's not about
any content like it's not about the type
of content I'm creating it's more about
the mindset that I have when I'm
uploading it I hope that makes sense I
just feel like I've just needed to
explain this for ages and I kind of have
explained this on my second channel but
obviously I know not all of you guys
followed me on that totally recommend
you do just because if I ever talk about
anything based on like non-beauty really
it's stuff then it will be on there and
I just I don't know I feel like anyone
that follows me on my whole channel
knows that they know me better than they
do from here if I make
Just Cause a lot of you guys probably
don't even know the kind of person I am
and that's not your fault whatsoever
it's just you know like I'm not able to
really like portray like my true self on
this channel but on my second channel I
like to think that I can a lot more you
know there are so many other things in
this world that deserves our attention
there's so much going on and helping
other people is going to forever be the
greatest goal in my life being a
blessing to other people in whatever way
that I can whether that be by blessing
people with the things I create or
whether that be you know just being a
light in any way in any way in real life
um social media life in any way I do
feel like we all need to take a moment
to think about our mental health
sometimes you know mental health has
thrown around on YouTube like it's
nothing and I don't want to just like
it's a sensitive subject to a lot of
people and honestly I have suffered with
I don't occur I really don't it to be
able to them to rank videos I've
suffered with a lie since I was eight
before I even knew what YouTube was and
I know a lot of people say every
youtuber has anxiety but I know it's
throwing around don't you buckets
nothing but it's real and it's important
and I want you guys to know that if you
suffer with any of that it's okay to put
your mental health first and that's
exactly kind of what I'm doing now and I
just want you to know that it's okay to
just breathe because my mind never stops
you know okay my mind is continuously
thinking of things that I want to do and
I want to work and that I'm continuously
just like dreaming of things and it's a
good thing but every now and again you
kind of need a moment just to switch off
and to breathe and that's exactly why I
feel like this little period of my life
is I'll never stopped uploading because
creating is my life I genuinely believe
that I was created to create stuff like
whatever that may be
I've got explanations of what's been
going on a while
on my second channel I'm gonna link them
down below so please watch them if you
want an explanation of what's been going
on like with the breakup and everything
they're there I put them on the second
channel because I don't like making
videos like this on my main channel
because I don't really feel like it's
the place but because this is an
explanation as to why I'm in uploading
this frequently and because I just want
to put this out there so I can stop
stressing about how often I upload so I
can just focus on making the best stuff
that I can make honestly like that's
what I want to do I do want to focus on
just making the best off that I can and
honestly I do think that YouTube has
become a really toxic place social media
in general can be very toxic used to be
like the most you know like incredible
personal platform has become really
impersonal when it's become about how
loud you can shout and I've spoken about
this before and a lot of people have a
lot of other creators have but it's all
about the crazy fake titles and just
like the most shocking stuff and all of
the real like hard work of more creators
like it gets lost in the sea of it and
see like I won you guys I do want you
guys to know that to the right creators
you as an individual genuinely means the
world to them because I can say that for
myself a lot of craters look at you as a
number and then watch you just
multiplier subscribers and views and
likes and that's what they focus on they
focus on the numbers instead of you you
this individual watching this video but
there are also a lot of creators as well
that do look at you as an individual and
they see you as what you are and that is
like a person or soul and that you
matter and it's not about the mass
majority it's about that one person that
connects with the video they will focus
on blessing you in whatever way that
they can just being a light making you
laugh teaching you something you know
their intent is to connect with you
rather than manipulate you into clicking
a bunch of videos and it's a shame the
way that YouTube has gone but I honestly
believe that there's enough good people
on YouTube that still believe the same
way I do and I do
I am one of them creators because that's
the way that I think and I do think that
a lot of people they kind of just give
up and they're like well do YouTube's a
toxic place now so let's just give up
no like I do believe there's enough of
us as viewers and creators as well they
genuinely want to receive and actually
create amazing stuff and that's exactly
what I wanted you regardless of what's
going on in my life regardless what
other people were doing I just want to
focus on my own lane be the best person
that I can be and just make stuff and
not be pressured into the whole
fast-paced schedules and clickbait
titles and crazy thumbnail I was like I
don't want to be pressured into that I
honestly just want to make the best
stuff that I can make and stuff that
will make you smile and stuff that will
teach you something and stuff that will
keep you inspired and fashion and beauty
and allow you to express yourself
because at the end of the day I was a
viewer once upon a time as one I know
how much YouTube means to me and how
much it meant to me when I was younger
too so I was one of those creators I
don't want to sell a lie to you
that I'm doing perfectly I want to let
you guys know that I haven't been in the
greatest place
I have some explanations that you guys
can watch I'll link them down below and
that is why I haven't been uploading as
often as I have and didn't want this to
be a really dramatic video I just wanted
to update you guys and be like this is
what's going on and this is why this is
why and I am so grateful for you as an
individual you this individual watching
this I love you I'm grateful for you and
I don't view you as just a number cuz
yeah it's cool like hitting milestones
and stuff and like you know like hitting
certain milestones when you hit
subscribe it's like it's amazing and
it's an incredible thing to be grateful
for but it's not everything I genuinely
care about the people behind each screen
watching and I just want to encourage
any of you if any of you suffer with
anything within mental health if you
have any issues or you're just not
feeling like yourself it's okay to take
a break it's okay to kind of put
yourself first sometimes especially if
you've been through a lot that's what's
happening to me and I just wanted to
update you guys and I just want to say
one more thing before I go
if you guys love any creators work
whether that be YouTube an artist a
musician author support them because
just like how there are true you know
creators who really really appreciate
you I know that there's a bunch of you
guys that are really really true and
that you really want to appreciate the
people that create stuff that you
appreciate it's just so good to throw
love around so third log around be a
light receive light and try and just Eli
in every situation and I'm just gonna
leave on that because I want from here
on out everything to be super positive I
really just needed to get off my chest
and to explain that to you and I hope
this made sense and yeah I honestly love
you guys so much it's gone really dark
all of a sudden my battery is about to
go so we're doing a video like this on
my main channel but like I said please
subscribe to my second channel because
as well as me focusing on making the
best content on here as I can I'm gonna
be focusing on making the best content
on the second channel as well so I
really hope that you guys subscribe to
that and watch the videos I did link
because they do explain a lot as far as
the life updates guide you guys so much
for watching I honestly love you so much
and just throw them around in the
comments and let's just let's just be
positive and I'm just really really
grateful for everything and I'm really
happy that I finally said this because
I'm just needed to explain for a while
why I haven't maybe been myself and I
needed to put on this channel so that we
can kind of just move on you know but I
hope that whoever you are whether you
are a subscriber of mine or not or you
like me or you don't
you can just take some light from this
and yeah I love you guys I'll see you in
my next video hopefully and yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
