upload on a Friday morning but this week
I have an old bonus video because I'm
doing a collab with my friend Amelia and
I've never done one of these collapse
before where they're not actually here
with you it's kind of strange but I like
the concept because you're basically
gonna be able to watch my video and
Amelia's videos so we're going to be
doing our 10 most underrated products
and I'm gonna link Amelia's video right
here so when you're finished watching
mine go over and watch her video and I
don't know what products she's paint for
her so I'm also really excited to watch
it and we're both just gonna give the 10
products that we think are most
underrated and it's quite hard to decide
what makes the product underrated but
I'm going by whether a lot of other
bloggers and youtubers that I watch and
read talk about it and also my kind of
friends in real life whether they're
aware of the products whether they use
it I'm not counting Anna though because
we love the same products so I'm sure
she loves all of these as well
the first product I'm going to talk
about it's from the brand Askia and I
talked about oski renascence cleansing
gel all the time and loads of other
bloggers do as well it's a great
cleanser but no one really ever seems to
talk about the Renaissance hand cream so
this is from the same Renaissance range
but it's the hand cream and I absolutely
love this I know that not everyone kind
of uses hand cream all the time but I
actually met the founder of Askia and
she said that you can use this as a
faithful Meister Iser as well because
the ingredients are so natural and clean
that you can easily put on your face
I've tried doing that when I'm sitting
on my desk and it feels great it's
really hydrating it's so nice to hand
cream and it smells amazing it has this
kind of gel moisture texture to it it's
bright orange so you can kind of see in
the lid I'm gonna put on a little bit
now it's just so fresh and I get really
dry hands especially in the winter so I
always keep this on my desk I really
want to get another one to keep in my
handbag the scent is so relaxing I
absolutely love it so I'm surprising not
more people talked about the hand cream
but I would really recommend trying it
if you have them
the next product you might be surprised
because I guess it's not that underrated
in the YouTube world it depends which
channels you watch I guess it's the
Clarins
liquid bronze self-tanning but I felt
like in real life none of my friends
have ever heard of this and they
definitely don't use it
probably would be quite intimidated by
it this is a tanning lotion and I like
to apply this on a cotton pad at night
and it's just amazing it just provides a
really nice it's not like a scary
self-tanner at all it just provides a
slight tint to your skin that just makes
it easier to wear makeup it just takes
the edge off when you're when I'm really
really pale in the winter this stuff is
great because it doesn't make me look
like I've been on holiday or two times
and not natural it's just just gives a
nice slight tint and glow to your skin
and I kind of wish more people knew
about this or weren't scared of it my
friends would love it I do you think
quite a few bloggers love this but it's
one of those product that we all use so
much we kind of forget to talk about and
I pretty much use this all year round
this is like the third bottle that I've
been through the most products has been
around for a really long time but from
the channels that I watch I feel like
not that many youtubers really use it as
like a daily product and I could not be
without it it's the makeup forever full
cover concealer are you shade 5 and this
stuff is amazing it's a fully waterproof
concealer that's really kind of full
coverage but not cakey or drawing at all
it's gone through the other side of the
room now I use it every day after I've
applied my normal concealer I just dab a
bit under my eyes just because I always
have that bit of dark circles left no
matter what I do and I also use it when
I have spots around my face because it
is waterproof but it's also hydrating so
I won't kind of dry out your spots or if
you have like dry areas on your face
you can just kind of dab it on wherever
and it just adds such amazing coverage
and I'm really surprised that people
don't talk about it more it's it has
been around for a long time and I feel
like when it first came out people loved
it but I seriously use that stuff every
day I'm like looking down on the floor
because over there I think it's an
amazing concealer this palette always
comes up when I do videos about
eyeshadow palettes because it's such a
bargain and I don't think I've seen
anyone else talk about it again just
from the channels that I watch it's the
NYC best of Broadway palette and I think
this is about 399 or something
absolutely crazy but what I liked about
it is there isn't one shade that I
wouldn't use it's a quad so there are
four shades
there's a light all over the lid shade
there isn't too light I hate it
it's like too much of a bone color then
there's a really nice light brown that's
a bit like Mac Pitino it's like a cool
tone brown and there's a really nice
warm chocolatey brown that's so nice to
blend into the outer corners of the eye
and a really dark brown I like to use as
an eyeliner so this is a sort of palette
that I know I can do a full eye look
just with this it's great for traveling
the quality of the eye shadows I think
are really good for the price and it's
just so affordable and I love that it's
just four great shades it's really well
picked and I know it's kind of looks a
bit cheap and it's not something to
really get that excited about but if you
like a nice neutral brown eye and you
don't want to spend that much this is
such a good palette okay next I'm going
to talk about rmk and makeup brushes I
have one two three four five six seven
of them I'm completely obsessed there's
such good quality they're the same
quality as suku brushes but not at all
as expensive I think they're in the same
kind of price categories and Mac brushes
I hardly ever buy brushes for Mac
anymore not even the two one seven
because I think the rnk version is so
much better
I love that the handles are so short
makes it so much easier when you're
traveling and it's just the quality they
are so ridiculously soft it's like it's
ridiculous I swear you need to go and
try them they do them in Selfridges I
guess they're not as easy to get hold of
that's why not as many people talk about
them but you can get them a Selfridges
that's why I get them and I think you
can get them online as well I love the
eyeshadow blending brush I also love the
blush of brushes I use that for bronzer
and blush and highlighter got a huge
powder brush that I really like so it is
so dirty and I have a couple of their
cheek brushes as well which are really
nice they're so soft they wash
ridiculously well the packaging is so
chic I love them everyone goes on about
Bioderma and I did as well for years but
I haven't used Bioderma in ages and I
like to kind of try different mice in a
water each time just to see and I think
the one that I've gotten the best with
has been the one from super facialist by
Tina Brennan this is a brand that you
can get in Boots and this has lasted me
a really long time I basically use this
in the mornings and sometimes at night
to remove my eye makeup but it's really
gentle while still actually removing
your makeup I really like the simple
plain packaging and this is the balance
between being able to actually remove
makeup but also not stinging the eyes or
feeling too
see on the skin and this has been the
one I like the most I don't really ever
see anyone talk about this but I'd say
this is a great alternative to Bioderma
which can be quite hard to find also if
you're just bored of using biodome or
want to try something new I think I
prefer the packaging of this one because
you can take off the lid which is quite
handy so you can like decant it when you
go traveling and yeah I think this is a
really good nice little water ok the
next product isn't so much about the
product specifically but more about the
range in general and it's keels haircare
I feel like keels is really well known
for their skincare I love their skincare
but it's not really somewhere that I
would go for haircare and I don't think
many other people necessarily think of
them for hair but this product which is
the cream with silk room I swear every
Harrison's hairdresser I've ever been in
uses this and probably loads of other
hairdressers as well as one of those
cult hairdresser products and it's a
styling cream I've always had it used on
me when I go to the hairdresser but I
only recently got one for myself and I
really really love it says it's a
non-greasy grooming aid it's become
world renowned for its silky smoothness
and superior efficiency I basically like
to use this after I've straightened my
hair in the morning or after I've
straightened it after washing you know
when you just straighten your hair it
feels a little bit fluffy and doesn't
really have much kind of shape or style
going on
I put tiny tiny amount of this cream rub
it in between my hands and just put it
throughout my hair from like the
Midlands to the end and I find that it
just kind of like binds it all together
gives it a little bit of hold a little
bit of texture it makes it really kind
of shiny and silky and I absolutely love
it this is going to last me such a long
time because it's such a huge bottle and
you only need a tiny amount and just the
fact that I think industry hairdressers
love it but consumers I don't know if
people would necessarily go to Kiehl's
for a styling cream but this is
definitely the best one I've tried Kiko
just as a brand in general is so
underrated I don't think people realize
the quality of their products because
the price point is so low you may assume
that maybe it's not as good at anything
in the shops kind of layer out that well
the quality is insane seriously insane
and one of the products I really like is
the universal fit foundation I feel like
everyone talks about the cream
eyeshadows sticks they're great and
lipsticks the nail polishes but I
haven't really seen many people talk
about this foundation and I really like
it I would say it's up there with one of
my top foundations I'm wearing it today
it's just like a really nice everyday
light liquid foundation really there's
nothing that fancy about it it doesn't
give like massive amount of glow it's
not really full coverage or matte it's
just a nice everyday foundation and I
like to just kind of dust it around my
face and blend it in with a buffing
brush it's so easy the packaging is
great really small and easy to pack and
I think if I remember when I bought this
they come in quite a few shades as well
so maybe Kiko isn't necessary somewhere
you'd go for foundation but I think this
one's really good okay a couple more
products and I definitely understand why
this one is so underrated because it's
really hard to get hold of
it's the kauffman kinder cream which i
always talk about I picked this up in
Germany it's just basically I it's not
like Vaseline but it's so common there I
feel like if they're equivalent it's
just like a really basic lip balm but
this stuff is the only thing that will
cure my lips when they're going to like
a really dry patch or if I test out a
lipstick and I've reacted badly to it
it's like a white thick cream so it
looks a bit silly on the lips but it's
so good it really really like there's no
other lip balm that works on me like
this one does and obviously no one else
in the UK really talks about it because
you can't get it here but I feel like
this is the sort of product that should
be available on cult Beauty or in John
bel and Croydon where they have the
section with like products from around
the world where they're where they sell
like them Selfridges DHC and all of
those products like there's quite hard
to get hold of this should become one of
those because it's such a great little
lip balm I don't really like the big pot
as much which is more just like their
general I think it's like their version
of pseudo creme but the lip balm version
I really like and it smells slightly
lemony I love it I've got so many when I
came to Germany and met all you guys
there so many people gave me one so I've
got loads now thank you okay the final
product is a blusher and I was raving
about this a few months back when it
first came out it's from Stila and it's
the shimmering Lotus watercolour blush I
think these are genius but I feel like
they didn't kind of take off as much as
I thought they were going to and I
watched a few people mention it in
videos and I saw that they were applying
it with everything
and I think that might be the reason why
couldn't love as much because I wouldn't
apply this with my fingers it's
basically a water blush it has this
whole thing about there being like a
cushion in there that releases the
perfect amount of products but I think
that's completely wrong far too much
product you really need the tiniest
amount so what I do is I just take from
the lid and I use something like the
Real Techniques contour brush or
actually I've just use my Bobbi Brown
blusher brush today to apply it and I
just take the tiniest like I'm not even
exaggerating the tiniest amount and then
just blend it onto my cheeks and because
it's like a watercolor blush I feel like
it just sinks into your skin and you
know sometimes blush can just sit on top
of your skin and look really false
because I feel like a lot of the sort of
blusher colors that we wear aren't
really a natural blush so this one
really goes into the skin and just looks
so natural and this one has a slight
gold shimmer to it it's so so perceived
my favorite shade from the range and
yeah I just feel like not many people
talked about this but I love it it's
definitely one of my favorite blushes
I'm wearing it today if you can kind of
see I think it's so pretty and there's I
think about five shades in the range so
those are my top 10 most underrated
products don't forget to head over to
Amelia's channel to check out what her
top ten products are and don't forget to
subscribe to her channel she makes
really good videos and I love watching
them so I'm sure you guys will too let
me know if you enjoyed this and I'll see
you on Sunday for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
