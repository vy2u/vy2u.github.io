with my friend Amelia if you guys don't
already know Amelia we've been friends
for quite a few years now I think you
first appeared on my channel in my
what's in her makeup bag video which I
think was to celebrate my 100th video oh
good times ruined that little Neal's
Yard I really remember filming that so
evening friends for years if you guys
don't already watch Amelia's videos you
really have to her look books are
beautiful and I love your product
reviews and when you vlog with your
sister I literally want to be the other
sister like I want to be their crew
that's so funny does the JLo together so
go and check out a media's videos
they're so fun I will link her channel
down below in the description box so
press show more and it will be linked
there and go say hi
we've also filmed a video on a media
channel we talked through 10 new Beauty
launches and they were there were some
really good stuff in there so go check
out that video as well I will also link
it below today on my channel we are
doing 10 YouTube secrets so I've just
come up with some random questions like
yeah that's got a good video actually
just like random questions about YouTube
that I feel like I haven't seen a video
that talks about these things before and
it's quite fun and different so if you
guys also want to do this video feel
free to I know Anna was like I wanna do
that sounds good I'm excited like show
people that like behind the scenes
there's so much stuff that I just like
don't say that exactly right you ready
yeah okay I've got the questions on my
phone question number one what was the
first video you uploaded to YouTube and
is it still live I know you are I don't
know if you do like the first one I ever
uploaded to YouTube maybe go get ears
okay mine was a how to contour and
highlight like Kim Kardashian and just
such a prize because I went to this now
I remember we had this conversation you
were like you gonna do what's in my bag
my first video but now I can do
something a bit different and I went to
this makeup master class with her makeup
artist and I wanted to like let everyone
know all the secrets he shared so that's
what I did
Wow is this to life debatable I don't
want to see don't even know I think I
was so embarrassed I was trying to be
look away presenters like and then you
apply the cream any mistake
so cringe watching old videos the first
video I ever physically uploaded to
YouTube was actually a competition entry
for a Look magazine competition which
was about favorite places to shop in
London and it was this really awkward
like montage a music video type thing
where I was like walking on Camden
picking things up and like shopping so
cringe that's definitely not live
anymore that got deleted pretty quickly
along with this really awkward lookbook
so the first video that's actually live
on my channel is a what's in my handbag
which is a pretty standard first video
to have and I'm so awkward I'm just
talking so monotone iam script no
personality like this is my phone it's
in my bag cuz even if you're not this is
what I try and explain to you but even
if you're not like shy or whatever and
person it's just a weird thing filming
yeah just you and a camera in a room
it's just a weird experiment I get my
camera I'm finally like friends
sometimes they just like yeah question
two what's your favorite video on your
channel my one is a video called then
and now which is a video I did with some
of my girlfriends and we talked about
like teenage days and like awkward
things but I feel like I don't know I
really like I rewatched it all the time
I feel like we covered some interesting
things without even meaning to I just
kind of filmed them and it was nice I
love that video so much and your
Mother's Day one yeah there's always
take so much longer to plan and film and
edit yeah they're kind of worth it
because I enjoy watching them yeah
they're so good I'm trying to think one
of my favorite videos is my what I ate
eat ate in a day oh yeah that's one of
my favorites just because I love
watching it and I got such a good
response from people like making the
recipes and sending me pictures and
stuff that was one of my favorites and I
think the other one was probably my
recent spring lookbook
I was just like this is so I don't know
you know something comes together and it
just is how you wanted it to be like
exactly that's exactly all of these
videos below as well if you want to go
and have a little rewatch the next
question is most embarrassing thing
you've said in a video I've got the most
amazing thing that's happened know you
that yeah okay so in vlogmas
for those of you that don't do both my
see you end up in
like zone of like film edit film edit
film edit and then upload as well okay
so you like in the zone end of the day
it's time to edit and then time to
upload overnight ready to schedule the
next day so I was like filling a hole or
whatever that day I just like as part of
my day got this Topshop order and I was
like I'm gonna show you guys what I
picked up from Topshop and in my
bathroom there was a mirror in front of
you and a mirror behind you and I was
trying on this top and it's like the
yellow dress girl from eBay oh my god
she was like to the photo for yellow
just hanging in wardrobe in the
reflection the mirror she's naked I'm
vlogging and you can basically see my
ass like I was just wearing a thong and
like this top I need to see my whole ass
and I never really check comments like
assuming my video goes up and vlog list
cuz you're having a video go up every
day and that day after like two hours I
wonder what's going on in my video and
everyone's like three wake up mode
pretend like nothing ever happened oh oh
oh my god my video just went up with my
a spiny yeah like oh that is one of my
fears like whenever I do anything like
sometimes I like look at snapchat while
I'm on the toilet as you do know like
imagine is any snapchatted myself right
now like the moon I'm really scared of
like accidental nakedness and videos
yeah it was done it now so did you know
you survived
oh my god your dad okay next question is
oh I didn't answer it
so back in like 2012 I'm pretty sure I
remember exactly where I was sitting in
front of this like black bookcase
remember this video is worse than for a
black case I was doing a whole video and
I was talking about this soap and glory
you know they have they're like huge
body washes so I was like it's so big I
love it love the scent and I was like
it's also got a pump applicator it was
so good and then I went I love a good
pump in the shower
yeah I definitely said that I love I'll
have a good pump in the shower I do when
you have to scoop stuff out yeah big and
then the water get through exactly I
didn't have ever mentioned to saving
flora like big pump in a whole video
again okay which YouTube channel do you
stalk for new uploads I think mine would
be what's up mums they're just such good
quality videos l just uploaded her labor
and delivery video and it was amazing
and I love them everything goes
seriously yeah I'm trying to think i
watch most I want to say all but
honestly not all of Casey nice that's
videos yeah but I don't stop them cuz I
know he uploads every day yeah I go
through phases sometimes I watch these
videos religiously every day and then I
watch them in like over a month now yeah
you have to really keep up with times
I'm trying to think I always watch to
Lisa Eldridge video yes always yes yes
that is the one I just I just don't skip
them if it's like blue to green smokey
eye that I would never wear I'd still
watch yeah say yeah I think I think
she's my one and she's been with me
throughout the whole like since I first
discovered her channel I've always
talked her up loads yeah yeah I agree
I've never I've never not consistent
love yeah I agree
okay question 5 do you prefer filming or
editing filming and you're gonna say
that because when I feel I like I feel
like now I'm really comfortable in front
of the camera and I like that I could
just talk but after I film it's like
okay take solo on setup I get so hot and
it's such a fluster and I say things
then I forget to say things and it's
save a stressful and I feel like editing
I can just sit down calmly like take my
time there's no pressure you're filming
I feel like you're really on like a time
yeah thing I feel more comfortable
editing I think the worst is when you
film something and then it doesn't come
out the way you thought it would or like
yeah you forget to say something and
then it was a comment for night yeah and
you're like it's so done but then scene
can always be changed but every scene is
quite frustrating yeah I find editing
like oh I should just feel like there's
always more to do you can always improve
a video in terms of the edits and that's
the bit that I find frustrating is that
can't mean it's time to stop now
yeah you've watched this video 25 times
take a step
okay question six my most loved tech
item is mine is I'm gonna insert a
cutaway now it's the lacy external hard
drive and I recently bought this the
Thunderbolt one and it's quite a boring
thing but I just couldn't live without
it I keep all my video files on an
external hard drive allows my computer
would just die and it comes everywhere
with me my most loved item has probably
got to be the lens I'm filming on right
now because this is the 30 millimeter f1
point 2 that's it happy minute 50 I'll
send it in clearly so you can put it
down below Bonnie I really want it it's
so nice it's so nice it is except right
now the sun's coming in and out so it's
not being that cooperative with life but
it is so nice and blurry and it makes it
everything looks so pretty in pictures
yeah question 7 what you don't see when
watching my videos is that I'm literally
always wearing either pajama bottoms
leggings or tracks it's on my bottom ha
like you think you guys I was like - I
was like an immediate like frilly dress
which comes of videos no sometimes in
the summer when it's really hot I just
won't talk seriously I wear either if
the temperatures normal I wear my
Topshop tri-c buttons without fail
because I have to be comfortable yeah or
went hot I wear like these weird Adi -
gym shorts like all of them the other
day to a video I was so hot so
everything from here look good but down
there and like unshaved legs yeah dry
also what you don't see around my camera
is like the murse
yeah kitchen like I I mean like the
small is real got like kitchen stuff
everywhere product all the way around me
like yeah kind of craziness right now
there's like products on the floor
there's like light flights and then
there's like equipment yeah yeah it's
not as nice no question ain't my
favorite time to watch YouTube videos is
when I'm getting ready I think yeah same
although I'm normally a bit more of a
rush and I'm getting ready and I feel
guilty for watching videos because I
know it's making me late so my favorite
time is probably when I'm doing my
evening skincare
team which is hard because then you like
you've got to like quickly take your eye
makeup remover and you're like oh god
see the video by literally prop it up I
have my little eye ring like a little
stand for my phone pop-up and I I just
take my time like which comes in the
bottom I'm like no this is my time yeah
I mean he's own here yeah yeah I love it
I love watching videos in the evening I
find it really hard to like stop and
actually go to bed yes number 9 learning
this about my camera changed my filming
process I think for me I know you won't
use the setting and Anna hates this
setting but when I do tutorials and I
know I'm gonna be kind of moving back
and forth and I'm not like staying in
one place there's a little setting
called like live which means that the
focus kind of moves with you and it's
not just like a set focus and I love
using that when I do tutorials because
then I know that it's not so like your
eye has to be in focus it just kind of
like moves it's the slightly less
slightly less sharp than normal focus
would be but I know that I'm not gonna
if I lean forward I won't go out of
focus do you go to like menu or display
and then it's there's like three
different types of focus and it's the
once it's live Wow okay this is
something from like back in the day and
I remember I think I'd done like five
videos on my youtube channel ever
and we me Lily were like walking down I
think it was like Regent Street or
something and she just like turned to me
and was like you know you can meet your
cutaways right Encarta ways are the
clips that go over like the product
close-ups and I didn't know that you
could mute them so I was like making
everything be quiet and if the doorbell
rang I had to refill the card away and I
didn't know that they could go on me and
I was I and this because I'd watched
your video and that you had like a
product and you're like talking about it
and then as age like here like
background noise like you told me you
had me up so amazing that you had me
unscrew the product yeah oh yeah blew my
mind forever glad I could help in some
way
Christian 10 straight after filming a
video I just sit yeah I literally like
it's like this huge buildup of my
setting up filming you get hot and if
you ever talking to it and then it ends
and then you're just like and then
sometimes I do my cutaways song as I
turn the camera
turn the lights off and I go straight to
the sofa and I let you go like moodiest
mood no smiling no talking like just no
talking
it's like a real instant calm down for
me it's weird because you were talking
especially if you're if you film 2 or
whatever videos in a row you're really
talking for like 20 minutes yeah and
then after added a second yeah seriously
if anyone like walked in at that point
I'd be like get out and then you've got
a like I'm like Packer getting down yeah
it's my least favorite part of the
filming for something they don't and
rich comes home and walks through the
kitchen it's literally like a studio
it's like I can't get to the kit to the
fridge I'm like sorry I have no energy
so yeah there's all the 10 questions if
