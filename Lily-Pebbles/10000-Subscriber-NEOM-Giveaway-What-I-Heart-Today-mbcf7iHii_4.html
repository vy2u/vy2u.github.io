giveaway because I reached 10,000
subscribers on my channel I'm so so
happy thank you so much to everyone who
subscribes I really can't believe that
there's 10,000 people out there watching
my videos to me it's an absolutely
massive number so I'm really excited
the giveaway today is gonna be with neon
which is one of my favorite brands I've
got quite a few of the candles and I
write about them quite a lot on my blog
I've actually got a candle burning just
there behind me my candles are really
really amazing
so the lovely people at neon said they
would donate the prize for this giveaway
and it's actually gonna be their new
harmonised candle which looks like this
and this is the new one for August this
candle it has pine sader wood and
eucalyptus in it and it's really really
nice I'll just quickly show you it's in
this nice box and it's like this and
then the candles just in there and it's
gorgeous it's a really nice homely smell
and because of the pine it's quite
Christmasy as well but it's really
warming and comforting and it might be a
bit of Thailand as well it's just lovely
and it's a three wick candle and these
are worth 40 pounds or 39 50 so it's a
proper proper luxury candle so if you'd
like to win one of these I'll tell you
how you basically just have to either be
a subscriber to my youtube channel or if
you're not already then subscribe to it
just by clicking the button above all
might be that side but then comment on
the video and let me know you have
because I don't want this to be open to
just all 10,000 because not everyone
might want the candles so comment below

that you'd like the candle and that
you've subscribed if you want an extra
point for entering and please like this
video just below with the little thumbs
up and then you're going to entries the

August so that's three weeks and then
I'll make a lot of video and asking the
winner but I'll also send a message on
YouTube to the winner so that's all you
have to do to get this lovely 3 week
calendar which is lovely it's just one
of my most favorite candle brands ever
