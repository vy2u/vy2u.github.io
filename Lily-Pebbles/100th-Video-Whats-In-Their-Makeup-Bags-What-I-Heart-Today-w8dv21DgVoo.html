technically this isn't my 100th video
but I'm not counting my YouTube trailer
so I want to do something a bit
different a bit special I've been
planning this for a few weeks now so I'm
really excited to put it live and show
you guys I personally love looking in
people's makeup bags
I love being nosey and seeing what
people's favorite products are so I
thought you guys with too and I've
picked for people who I think are really
interesting to bloggers and one blogger
who works a really well-known magazine
and one of the owners from a shopping
Beauty website that I love to shop at
and I think you guys do too so I want to
tell you who they are but you'll have to
keep watching to find out
I'm off to meet Amelia the editor of the
owners of love and also the PT editor of
secrets - if she have infected the place
to make up she is one of my true
enablers
so I'm going to go her to rummage
through the makeup bag
if it lipsticks I mean you're not ready
in your bag okay I have this Tom :
you're really quite heartless if you
don't like your lipstick
this is my secret actually using on the
bat okay because they didn't like their
whatever in the TF it's just so pretty
I just
Shanta KY is my favorite to budget by
the authorial impossible i father
so nice and the stone so pigmented and
creamy which I have about 16 of these
I've like picked up from all the
different countries or they have
different shades of 3sat but they are
pretty amazing you haven't tried those
deputies I have my nail polish then I
used to have the Chanel highlighter and
I mean if you go buy it but then it
broke besides I'm using the shadow by
one more pinky in the Chanel and then my
brow this is my favorite anastasiya brow
complete its like pencil is like so fine
you can really like things get a little
fake hair
and the color is really nice too I swear
Milani effort pretty big for us it was
like a couple of dollars that's pretty
nice like seeing this is my powder this
is the damn a meteorite
if you already get the blue light you'd
be benefitting and then lastly I have
the primer it'll be from L'Oreal Paris
with miracle blur now this be released
in the u.s. before and I don't think
they're doing much in UK about it but
the Garnier one is actually a lot better
but this one has SPF 30 and then that's
a bit and then they have my match lining
pixie grows in grubby so I'm going to go
meet gem or Gemma who is a blogger at
James face house and she's also now
features right sir for company magazines
amazing I'm gonna go meet her she's
lovely and she's going to show us inside
her makeup bag
hi i'm jim i blog at gem for tau w k and
i work for company magazine and i'm
going to talk you through some of my
beauty must haves for my makeup bag so
my makeup bag was like a freebie from
estée lauder
I used to use like clear makeup bags I
love them you can see everything but
this is animal print so it's way better
so at the minute I'm wearing the new
matte lipstick which is the hailey
comparable one which is called true
hailey and it's like uber Orange it's
quite matte so I think I get like it
doesn't quit dry sometimes but as long
as I reapply a few times it looks really
cool and it's just kind of quite
different to most raids out there
another one of my favorite lipsticks is
Topshop all about me and I wear this one
so much I wear it all the time it's just
most gorgeous like fluorescent hot pink
and I really don't feel like me without
it it's like truly like my favorite
lipstick ever and it smells really
fruity which is quite nice my favorite
mascara ever and I've tried a lot now
since working a company it's number
seven exceptional definition it's just
really really good it just kind of gets
all the lashes and makes them really big
and it's not like too big I don't you
describe it very well but um yeah so
that's definitely my favorite one I
turned to it everyday
no let's see yeah this is my number one
foundation ever ever ever and I tried
everything
I'm over pale I used to like the Estee
Lauder she'll one but then even that I
found was a bit yellowy on me and then I
found this Max Factor face affinity and
I use it in light ivory number forty and
it just it's just amazing it makes me
see how about that much on today because
I put my makeup on on the bus in a big
rush so glad but yes this generally just
makes me look over flawless not greasy
or anything and loss ages I only have to
put on like once day so love it
recommend it so another one of my things
I use every day is a brow pencil by new
CI D or new kid currently what I have to
say it but I don't like my brows are
quite big quite like there
but my hair is darker than my natural
color so I like to just use a pencil
just to darken them a little bit rather
than to create thicker lashes at thicker
brows because I've already got really
big brows so this is just making darker
and this one's great it's got like a
grooming brush on the end and then sort
of a pencil bit on the other end so kind
of got everything you need my other
makeup bag must-have is my elf brush
which I've is the elf powder brush which
I use for foundation I use it so much
it's basically like warm the paint off
I absolutely love this it just kind of
creates such a flawless foundation
finish and it's so cheap it's like
two-pound fifties so mega recommending
this and those my favorite bits of my
makeup bag okay so I'm getting ready to
go and meet Anna from the Deanna does
makeup how could I not include her in
this and we have identical Beauty case
so I completely trust anything that she
recommends to you guys and I'm gonna go
and take a rummage through her makeup
bag now
hi I'm Anna from bananas makeup and my
makeup bag is from whistles I really
like the shade they don't anymore that
they have got some really nice other
colors in there and the first thing I
always stick on most mornings if there's
an answer
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer this is
the oil-free one and they have the shade
bisque and I just find it gives mice
like Jimmy complexion nothing too over
tops like a nice coverage for everyday
and also the Real Techniques buffing
brush is the only foundation brush that
I use I just think it also actually got
two of them I keep one in my handbag and
then one on my dressing-table and then
the Bobbi Brown feeling concealer I know
that I have the shade found in it I
think I've gone through about three of
these maybe even four I just find it's
the best thing for under-eye circles I
stick it on any blemishes but I've got
as well and then I go for bronzer and I
love this japonesque brush it's a 9:33
powder brush it's so soft it's like the
only real one my use powder and I go for
the NARS Laguna on that and I've got a
brand new one it was a very good day
when I got this they tend to break down
and go like horrible in the bottom of
the pan towards the ends I'm pleased to
get a new one and it's got like it's
hard tiny bit assuring but nothing to
your over top so just can't fit up all
over but mainly just on the cheek and
then a new thing I hope cheeks recently
is this and it's the RMS litsa cheek and
smile I can get it home and it's like
lovely peachy pink it works equally is
nice on the lips as it does on the
cheeks but I like it for a bit of both
I've got it on my end cheeks today so I
just put that on with my finger and then
another thing but sheetal riding
hairband in there is the RMS BC living
Luminizer this is basically like the
Becca shimmering skin perfector in power
but in cream form I just pop this on the
kind of tops of my cheeks and inner
corner of my eye anywhere else I want a
bit of highlight but always I've got one
thing one thing I don't really wear
eyeshadow unlike a daily basis so the
sheer eyelash curlers got gold wings now
and then the L'Oreal telescopic
waterproof mascara which have gone about
all the time but I love it
and then the lips I've got the bite a
pond arose and this is something I've
gone through loads or as well I think
all my second one that it's a nice kind
of like slightly tinted baby pink lip
balm it's like a lip treatment
everything in one and that is morning
Wow I look tired today so I'm off now to
meet Alexia and she is one of the owners
from Colts Beauty which is one of my
favorite websites to shop on an app so
you love it they hand take all the best
products they're like true beauty
junkies only they'll actually sell only
the good stuff so I'm gonna go to the
cult PT offices and meet Alexia and go
through her makeup bag so I'm really
excited to get
hello I'm Alexia from cult BC and yes
take you through my slightly grubby
makeup bag probably stop with base
there's you a luminizing most attempt if
the one that I just used every single
day it's super easy with a little blue
easy blender to put it on not too much
coverage but it just evens out your skin
tone really beautifully and catches the
lice in it in a way that's very
flattering for your features rather than
kind of shiny or sweaty looking much
which some of the luminizing ones can do
there's also a matte one that works
really nicely for oily skin this is
quite an unusual color but I use this
also on a daily basis it's the cheek
tint from three custom color which is
the New York brand really lovely and it
doesn't it looks quite crazy color but
actually it's a really beautiful plush
this one or if I'm going for that sort
of little girl kind of cheek look with
the flat as well as really love you
doing then for the eyebrows it took me
ages to find a blonde eyebrow gel and
this one is really beautiful it's got a
slight a slight luminosity to it as well
you kind of see it on the other
to the bottle but that's a really lovely
one for bulking up the brows a bit
without making it look fake obviously
they can knock on I asked a little super
super dude
and then we have the brand of the moment
of Sunday Riley which is just going
absolutely nuts oh what a an eyeshadow
stays put there's some really colors and
then this amidst it which is lovely
which is manages to compromise
wonderfully between stay ability and
moisturizing your lips so you don't from
five seconds this is the hangover friend
for if you look in the pocket when you
wake up in the morning it's really
really easy as always have one of those
around mascara wise the trusty vjp this
is DJ vbeaute eliezer
morning lash it effectively lovely and
really bought something lashes ah
so when i doing any kind of lipstick
with any anything things in it I always
make sure I use the doo-wop reverse lip
liner and just do it on the outside of
your lips like this so it's Lots the
pigment from escaping and kind of up
those lines that started to appear steel
a prime pot I mean there are a few
different versions of this with
different brands but I would really
really like this one because it it just
makes I put it on on my eyelids I can
sometimes work on its own without
anything else it just conceals any kind
of pain a bit for blueness and it makes
a shadow spray it is really brilliant
that's why we're talking about their
ability this eyeliner from anastasia
beverly hills is called the cupboard
waterproof eyeliner and it is absolutely
brilliant you can even put it in your
they which is lovely
one other eyeliner here this is probably
the cheapest item on the sides actually
it was recommended by Mary green well
and it's a liquid eyeliner it's
water-based it's very easy to get off if
it rains really heavily Europe you're
kind of in trouble but it goes on so
beautifully and it makes the most lovely
matte line and there's a blue one as
well which was actually quite a wide
range of colors but this kind of catches
the light in a really lovely wearing
wonderful blue eyes this is a very
unusual product is sold as a as a cream
eyeshadow is from a brand called Belle
mask which is actually a jewelry brand
and she has a capsule collection which
is made up of things like the lip
glosses there's two of these one is
silver one and gold and it actually has
pure 24-karat gold leaf in it which is
absolutely gorgeous I'm not sure if you
can kind of see what this does on your
skin I know I'm getting quite a lot on
so you can kind of see it but it is
stunning
so you can actually see the green for
the garnet obviously if you're putting
it on your skin you would use a little
bit less but highlighting along your
clavicle or you can actually use it as
an eyeshadow you can kind of see that if
you can make it slightly denser what I
quite like is put something like this on
and then accentuates it in the inside
rim of the eye it really catches the
light very very this is my festival
friend basically I hope that was useful
this is my floor makeup bag so thank you
so much for watching that guys I really
hope you liked it it was really fun to
film and I found some products that I
really need to buy off to see in their
makeup bag so maybe you did too and I've
just a quick update I know up until now
I've been uploading two videos a week
but it's kind of just getting too hard
videos take a long time to film they
think about a day so I think I'm gonna
cut down to one video a week but it
means I'll be able to put more time and
effort into that one
we can make it even better than they
have been so hopefully that's a good
thing I just don't have time to do two a
week but if I do sometimes I might do
two a week if I can let me know what day
you like to see my videos being uploaded
because at the moment I was going to
just stick to like some day but I know a
lot of people upload on some days so
maybe there's another day you guys
prefer me to upload just let me know and
I'm flexible to changing days but thank
you so much for watching I really
excited that I've uploaded 100 videos
now and just thank you for watching them
and even comments all the time it really
means a lot to me so I'll see you in my
next video and have a good week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
