video today I should be on my honeymoon
Rick and I are going to South Africa I
am so excited
I actually think whilst you're watching
this and probably nearly home but I
wanted to do some kind of travel related
video and list back on my channel and I
don't think I've done a video before on
how to survive a long-haul flight the
flight from London to South Africa is 11
hours I think around that time and as
you might know if you've seen my video I
am NOT a great flier I have a bit of a
fear of flying it's maybe not the most
stereotypical type of fear of flying but
I'm going to link the video at the top
if you want to go watch that and find
out more about what I'm scared about and
why I don't like flying but I said in
that video that I would never ever let
my fears stop me from traveling the
world it's something I love doing I've
been very lucky to be able to visit so
many countries around the world and I've
been on long-haul flight my whole life
even when I was a little kid so I'm used
to them I still don't like them but I
feel like now that when you're a kid
your mom just kind of does it all but
now as an adult I've really come up with
a routine and a way to get through these
long flight if you've never been on a
long-haul flight before this video might
be helpful for you or if you go on
long-haul flights but you feel like you
just kind of rock up and figure it out
as you go maybe this might be
interesting to hear my routine I have
tried both ways I've tried to kind of
rockin up and going with the flow but I
find that having the sort of routine and
the prep really makes me feel calmer it
makes it feel happier I know I'm making
it's not like a big deal but sitting
down in an environment like it is in a
plane for 11 hours is a big deal it's a
big deal on your mental state also in
your physical state it's just not a
normal thing to do I find it really hard
to wrap my head around it but I think
I've kind of come up with a way to deal
with it they're always still moments on
the flight that I don't enjoy but for me
it's all about the prep and having these
steps to just get me through the 11
hours so I put it into sections and I'm
going to start with pre-flight so the
main kind of theme running through this
whole video is to just be organized I
like to pick out my outfit you know a
few days before I fly just so I know
exactly what I need to wear it I don't
wake up on the day in a panic
and confused with what I've packed what
I haven't packed I have a flying outfit
and I normally wear the same thing on
the flight home I like to wear really
comfy clothes if you're the sort of
person that doesn't want to wear
chapstick bottoms or leggings in an
airport and take a change of clothes and
change on the plane but I personally
don't mind walking up an airport with no
makeup on and tracksuit bottoms I like
to be comfy you're going to be sitting
down for 11 hours so be comfortable no
one cares what you look like not a
fashion show wear what you feel most
comfortable in I like to write a hand
luggage packing list I'm not going to
tell you guys what packing your hand
luggage because I think it's different
for everyone but I really recommend
writing a list because then it's not
like a mad panic of what packing your
backpack on your handbag and it means
you're less likely to forget something
like the worst thing that could happen
is you sit on the plane and you
forgotten your favorite headphones or
your phone or your keys or something
your passport so write a list any way
you like digitally or unlike the
reminders app or just write on a pad of
paper and pick things off as you pack
them in I start packing my hand I guess
ahead of time there's always things you
have to put in last-minute on the day I
always like to download the app for the
airline I'm flying with for me it's
usually British Airways or virgin I
download the app and I check in using
the app it makes it so easy means or
less can explain something to know about
you you've checked in already online
you've got your seat you know we also
seen I would like to have a window seat
and also means you get your boarding
pass on your phone I don't know about
you guys I always have my phone in my
hands that's so easy just to scan it and
not to worry about papers and boarding
passes and printing things off you've
just got it there on your phone and it
makes me feel so at ease and organized
finally for pre-flight prep download any
films TV shows or podcasts that you
think you'll want to listen to or the
journey to the airport or on the flight
itself I think this is really important
I often check online with the airline
and flying to see what films are showing
on the in-flight entertainment and then
make sure those download the same ones
but I think I would like to have some on
my iPad or phone or whatever just in
case like once my in-flight
entertainment was broken or they don't
always let you watch it on takeoff and
landing and I think now you can watch
iPads and stuff on takeoff and landing
so it's a nice distraction just good to
have extra stuff really podcasts are
great if you're trying to fall asleep
and I also like to have a few films and
TV shows for when
actually away in case we stay in one
night or I don't know you have a lot of
time to wait at the airport when I get
to the airport the first thing I do is
check in and go through security
I like check-in straight away so I know
it's done you never know how long the
queue will be there's no point faffing
about and I always like to get straight
through security all the best shops and
restaurants are always through security
and this thing you know you've done the
hard bit and you've got past the queues
and your letter likely to be delayed so
that is the first thing I do I just go
straight through then I like to stock up
on supplies and it's the first thing I
do so I know I can just get it out the
way and then I can relax start kind of
getting into the zone of flying so on my
list of things to get is a magazine
chewing gum sweet snack and a big bottle
of water I like to have a magazine not
so much because I read magazines all the
time this one is Sunday girls but for me
it's a distraction on takeoff or maybe
landing I know now you can watch films
isn't music but I can't really do
anything that needs me to concentrate
because I won't be concentrating I'll be
freaking out about the fact that I'm
taking off so I like to just kind of
have something to look at I have music
on I normally since James Taylor because
it calms me and I just need a magazine
to stare at to look at pictures nothing
I need to concentrate on just something
as a distraction from taking off so that
is what the magazine is for this one is
a really good like handbag size chewing
gum is an important one for me just a
good way of staying fresh you do
sometimes get a toothbrush on the flight
but saves you having to go and brush
your teeth all the time this is just
something you can have whenever you need
it and also it helps me with my ears if
they're popping on landing sweet pretty
self-explanatory sometimes I need a bit
of sugar to get me through you never
know what food you're going to get on
the plane and I did like having some
like home comforts with me and it's a
treat you know it eats sweet all the
time but it's something for me like
having snacks with me stop the panic
feeling
I hate plain food so the fear of being
hungry or I just like knowing I've got
something if I need it these little
packs of almonds from M&amp;amp;S are great
something a bit healthier a bit more
filling so I'll throw those in as well
and then I usually get either salt
popcorn or like some vinegar crisps
again not something I eat all the time
but I find it when I'm in the air my
taste buds become really they kind of
just like this
I need really strong flavors so
something really vinegary or salty I
find really helpful exercise salty and
vinegary and drink sweet as well gives
you a good flavor and then water is
really important you could also take
water bottle and then they should just
fill it up for you
I love Evian so I normally get as you
normally get the bigger bottle than this
and just take a huge one on no I have to
worry about asking for all the time and
I know I've just got like my favourite
water with me so after I've stocked up
on all of my supplies I tend to not
really shop much in the airport I'm
going away anyway so I don't really want
to like take any shopping with me I'll
normally find somewhere nice to sit and
relax get in the zone get prepped I
don't like to get the airport too early
but I also don't want to be rushed
so I normally time it quite well that
they don't have too long to wait I've
got enough time to get everything I need
if you can it's really great to eat a
good meal before a flight I think it's
huge row where there's a worker mama
and I want to work a mom before a flight
and I felt so great because I've had
like a pop of good solid meals as I said
I don't really like clean food or try
and eat it but it's never gonna be as
satisfying as a meal from a restaurant
you love so if you can have a meal
before the flight and I feel like
everything I do at the airport I'll go
to the gates and as it's called and yell
about it so once you've gone through to
the gate and got onto the plane and
found your seat I like to use this like
pre takeoff time to get settled and make
it my own little home you're going to be
on this flight for 11 hours so it's okay
to kind of settle in and get used to
your surroundings and make it homey I
always get to like strange look some
people when I'm clearly like have my own
little routine but I don't care I just
want to make this flight enjoyable for
me I separate the stuff that I need
access to
I don't need access to and if I don't
need it I just put it in the overhead
Locker things like my shoes I'll just
put up there and anything I do need I'll
put in the kind of section in front of
me or it depends on like which class
you're on with the stuff and how much
space you have I always wear white socks
I always have my mom has always told me
- I'm on the pill that's pretty
important but I think even if you're not
for a really long flight like 11 hours
it's quite a good idea to prevent any
blood clots or anything like that these
are just black ones I got them from
boots so I put those on don't ever try
to put these on when you're wearing
jeans it's very hard because they go all
the helps your knee but I put those on
they still really tight you get used to
them and then on top of those I let's
put some
because slight drops are pretty thin so
they don't feel cozy or comfy and I want
to feel cozy and comfy on this flight so
I put on my like white company cashmere
socks or just like slipper socks any
sort of thick socks you have to go on
top I tend to just have my shoes off for
the whole flight so I'll put them in
that overhead Locker
yes going to the toilet is a bit hard
and I have done it in the past in my
socks that's been a bit gross but
honestly I don't tend to go to the
toilet that much on a flight because I
hate the toilet on a plane if I do go I
can always get my shoes down from the
overhead Locker if I put a hoody with me
I'll put that on and just generally just
get comfy
I make sure my iPad and my headphones
everything is easy to access my magazine
and then the next thing I do which I
think is so important for jet lag if
you're going somewhere that has a
different time zone change the time on
your watch immediately if you start
getting in the mindset of this new time
zone it will really help with the jet
lag if it's 1 p.m. in the UK and you're
thinking with lunchtime but it's
actually 8 p.m. where you're going is
dinner time treat your next meal like
it's dinner just start getting into that
time zone mind and I think it makes such
a difference just before takeoff for me
like when the engine starts I start
getting a little bit anxious but just
find your happy place
for some people for my mum it's asleep
she'll just fall asleep immediately
before takeoff and that is her happy
place for some people it might be
reading a book or magazine or listening
to music or watching TV show but don't
be afraid to kind of get sorted before
takeoff you don't want to be like trying
to get your iPod and headphones in
whilst they're taking off so just get
settles get into your happy place and
like be prepared I've always used noise
cancelling headphones on a slide because
for obvious reasons they get rid of that
horrible plane sound that I just find
makes me nervous it's loud and
irritating and it completely cuts that
out I recently invested in some bose
noise-canceling headphones it was a
Christmas present to myself and I ask
that you love them they are quite large
they come in this case but they are
incredible these are the Bluetooth ones
so you don't need to connect them to any
sort of wife just plug them in but you
can if you want to if you one out of
charge they are so amazing at cancelling
out any background always fill it like
this in the case they're comfortable on
the ears and you literally just can't
hear anything it's so clever I don't
even know how it works but it does work
and you can just get into a
little zone and that's what I find works
best on a flight for me just getting
into my own zone if I'm traveling with
someone else then every now and again I
like to kind of chat with them and it
breaks up the flight a bit but for most
of the time most of the flight I'm just
in my own zone and these really help
with that because they're over the air
it's a bit annoying when you're sleeping
actually I just bought a neck pillow I
haven't I didn't add this in the video
chamilitary bought it yesterday flo
recommended one and it's a really good
neck pillow don't normally use them
because I find that yes or net anyway
but this is the memory foam one that's
so big you literally can't move your
head so I'm going to put that in but I'm
going to link that down below because I
think that will really help with the
headphone situation and with the neck
sleeping situation so you've taken off
you survive it's never as bad as you
think it's going to be you're up in the
air and I like to use this time to plan
out my flight a little bit but a long
way to go so now watch all your favorite
films in the first hours they like keep
flicking I like to kind of think in my
head like what eleven hours like how
many films is that I can watch like
three or four films a few episodes of
this TV show I like to look at what's on
the influenced Taemin and kind of work
out from there make sure I get enough
sleep time in like I'm quite strict I
should go to sleep this time and sleep
till then maybe I should take a sleeping
pill to help with that what time are we
going to get served food do I want to be
awake for that if not maybe I should
tell them not to disturb me
do I need an extra pillow it's okay to
ask the NSS for an extra pillow think is
going to make me more comfortable or
another blanket if you're cold I like to
just kind of plan out like planning your
day what am I going to do over the next
11 hours like the worst thing on a
long-haul flights and you're listening
or watching you're like oh my god I
think two hours I have so much longer to
go like try not going to your watch and
watching films is a massive help because
they're normally quite long anyway I
know everyone says it but it's really
important to drink more water than usual
I mean I'm a bit rubbish to drinking
water at the best of times but I really
try and force myself to drink more on a
flight that aircon the fact that you're
up so high you do get more dehydrated
than you would normally so try and
remember that because the dehydration
won't help with the jetlag won't help
your skin you won't feel good it's just
generally bad for you so drink lots of
water if you didn't bring your own water
onto the flight then just ask for the
excess to bring you also ask as many
times do you like that is
they don't mind get up and walk around I
think it's easy to forget and I do it as
well but it's not normal to sit down for
11 hours imagine sitting on your sofa
for 11 hours without standing up it's
just not normal so get up and walk
around and I know it's a bit like
embarrassing so we want to look you I
sometimes get up and do some like
stretches and I get the weirdest looks
ever but sometimes other people stand up
and do it to do a bit of walking around
if you can just move your legs around
like put your arms in the air and
stretch and like do some neck exercises
it does feel good I do like to take
computer put on with me on the flight
I'd only like a whole routine I normally
just don't wear makeup in the first
place if I do wear makeup then I'll take
off using my face wipes or something or
bit by derma and custom world but it's
nothing to look forward to I do its two
reasons one because I think my skin
needs it because the dehydration but two
it's something to look forward to
something to do it's something to pass
the time
I've definitely inherited this from my
mom she's always done it people always
give her weird looks but I don't care at
work something I think is an essential
is a hand cream this one is from this
work I picked this on because it smells
like a spa anything that smells nice I'm
sorry to the people around me hopefully
though it hate it because it's nice
smell but just to get rid of that I hate
the smell of claims and the smell of
plain foods so this is really lovely
like spa fresh smelling hand cream and
I'll put that on like every couple of
hours just to keep my hands hydrated you
can put it on anywhere really it's a
firm wished ERISA I had this travel size
on Rebecca queen of Hungary mist which I
kind of just paste because I've got it
and it's kind of running out so I should
use it up anyway
just a nice mist if you want to use that
every now and again but the best product
I find for my skin is the Farrah Chapman
overnight facial and this is a really
cute mini I got Ana travel set and I
think oils are great I used to do face
masks but I actually think oils work
better there's so hydrating I just put a
couple of kind of squirts on my hand and
just rub it into my skin and I'll
reapply that on an 11 hour flight
probably three or four times and then
the final product is the this works
stress check breathe in
this is replaced for stress less
rollerball that I used to always talk
about and this is more just if I'm
feeling nervous or anxious it's a really
calming smell you can roll it onto your
wrist or behind your ear
on your temples again it just reminds me
to be in my own lulz ode monel sparse
eat it just smells like nice thing I
also have these little stress relief I'm
asked from estÃ©e lauder I don't always
use these but again it's a nice treat my
under-eye area gets really dry so it's
really good to decide rate that most of
this flight from London and South Africa
and back will probably be sleeping for
me because it's an overnight flight I'm
really scared of overnight flights just
because I find that everything's really
dark or the lights are off everyone's
really choir and I feel really like the
patch from everyone and quite lonely
honestly but sleeping does pass the time
so I will try and sleep as much as
possible some people like to freshen up
before landing I don't always do this
because I know that when I get there I'm
just going to head to my hotel and sleep
or shower or something but if you would
like to again it's something nice to
look forward to you can go and change
into a fresh pair of clothes you can
change your underwear you can get into
new pair of leggings whatever you want
quite nice to go and like brush your
teeth that's on the air she always do
I'll go and brush my teeth and the
toiler 11 hours without washing your
teeth is gross well I guess you do that
in the day I don't know it makes you
feel good
so she's you've been sleeping on a nice
light you wake up with like morning
breath go and brush your teeth freshen
up in the toilet I always like to do
this like maybe an hour before landing
and that kind of everything that's my 11
hour long-haul flight survival tips and
my little routine that I've kind of
figured out along the way I'm thirsty
this year so it's taken me a while I've
been traveling my whole life as I said
you don't really start thinking about
these things until you're about 1718 and
you start flying alone and it all comes
a bit crazy and I've had some not great
experiences on a long-haul flight and
I've had some that's been amazing so for
me this is just how I get through it and
if you haven't been on a long-haul
flight before don't be scared it's such
a privilege to be able to fly across the
world to visit a country you've never
been to you just have to get through the
flight and then you know you're going to
be in an amazing place and I can't wait
to tell you guys all about South Africa
I think it's going to be such an amazing
memorable trip so thank you guys so much
for watching I really hope this was
helpful please let me know if it was and
if you have any other tips that I didn't
mention in this video see you guys in my
next video please just get subscribed if
you haven't yet and are
so you see by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
