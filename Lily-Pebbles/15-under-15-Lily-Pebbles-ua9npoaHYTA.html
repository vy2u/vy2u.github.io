you're enjoying vlogmas so far I still
wanted to do my main Sunday videos
though whilst I'm vlogging every single
day if you aren't aware of local myths
and you haven't seen me spamming your
timeline I've got a playlist with all my
vlogs in one place I'm vlogging every
single day up to a Christmas uploading
every day at 630pm but for today's video
I'm going to be doing 15 under 15 so
that's 15 of my favorite products that
are all under 15 pounds I have got some
favorites that i haven't mentioned in
here because I wanted to put some new
stuff in and there are a few that I had
to mention because they're just cult
favorites but I've got quite a good
range and a good mix in here so
hopefully you'll find some good
recommendations I'm going to start with
the most expensive and work my way down
to the cheaper so starting with this one
is 1499 and it's new from L'Oreal it's
their lapel it nude and I spotted this
in my local boots there was one left and
I grabbed it because it looked so good
it looks like a drugstore version of The
Naked palette so here's what it looks
like inside it has two four six eight
ten shades that probably should have
taken me cricket account but I'm not
very good at counting ten' nude shades
of the mix of shimmer and matts the
shimmers are definitely better formula
than the mat and the mats worked really
well in a crease in the crease though
shimmers are beautiful all over the lid
I really like L'Oreal I shadows I have
their press pigments and they're great
this is such a good eye shadow palette
especially if you're new to eyeshadow
because they're not that pigmented which
I kind of like because it means that you
can kind of go to town and you won't
make any huge errors it's quite easy to
blend out any mistakes this is a good
one if you're new to eye shadows or if
you just really like having a natural
everyday look bargain next are there s
Ejiro kits and these are 1299 they
always have these in boots and superdrug
and they change them up every season but
it's two full-size se polishes this one
is a sprinkle in pink so it has se fiji
with a cut above which is like pink
glitter and i really like this set but
they have all different ones they've got
a blue and a pink which says like a boy
or girl which is great to give at a baby
shower and they have like sparkly
christmas wands they've always got
different ones in there grey it's a
really nice way to try to polishes
because it makes it much cheaper and
it's a cute little set to give us a gift
at 11 pounds is my all-time favorite
bronzer now this one is looking a little
bit worse for wear I was very near the
end and the last bit kind of fell out
when I was traveling but normally it has
half a matte side and a half a shimmer
side it's just the perfect shade it's
good for bronzing up your face it's also
good for contouring because one of the
sides is quite cool toned it's just a
beautiful bronzer I haven't had to
repurchase my NARS Laguna for ages
because I've been using this it's so so
great and definitely one of my all-time
favorite drugstore products this is a
new mascara from Max Factor it's their
masterpiece transformed and this is 999
I wanted to include this because I've
been loving this recently I used it in a
recent tutorial it's great it's got a
really good comb wand so you can comb
through your lashes I'm wearing it now
it's just I've just really been enjoying
it I feel like it might not last that
long it starting to dry out a little bit
but it's really affordable so easy to
repurchase and just thought is a good
one to add to the list I have one
foundation in here is 999 and it's the
l'oreal true match foundation this comes
in loads of different shades so you're
bound to find one that suits you and
it's a really good formula there's no
SPF so it's great for the party season
you won't get any flashback in photos it
applies really nicely it's not too heavy
but it's decent coverage so it covers
any blemishes just sits really nicely on
the skin it doesn't really feel like a
drugstore foundation compared to others
I've tried feels like really good
quality L'Oreal do really good products
because they look after a lot of the big
brands and this is one foundation I
would definitely recommend I had to
include soap &amp;amp; Glory archery this is
their brow pencil it's only eight pounds
and it is the perfect deep for the
anastasia brow wiz you have a brush on
one end to comb through your brows and a
really slim pencil on the other just to
fill in any gaps if you're new to
filling in your eyebrows this is a great
one to start with because it's quite
hard to make any mistakes just do it
really lightly this is so cheap and
affordable it only comes in two shades
which is a shame um but you can mix them
to get the right shade if you need to
this is a really great product and a
good dupe for a high-end one to another
new love that I can't stop talking about
the Max Factor excess shimmer in bronze
I've spoken about this already a great
creamy eyeshadow you can apply it
with a brush blender out and once it
sets it won't budge all day it's a great
dupe for my favorite estee lauder
chained i shadow and the tom ford cream
shadow in spice this is only 799 what
I think for the quality is amazing
because this really does live up to my
hand cream eyeshadows and I just love it
you only need a tiny amount so this will
last you forever for lips I have the
bourgeois Rouge edition Velvets these
are seven ninety-nine I have two shades
here hot pepper and pink pong and I
really like these they're kind of like I
think they are mad but when you apply
then they feel a bit like jelly on the
lips they're kind of bouncy they're
really comfortable and lightweight and I
always wear pink pong in videos because
it looks really great on camera and its
really nice bright pink this is a great
bright red with slight orange undertones
both I just really love them they're
really easy to apply and get like really
precise around the lips and for 799 I
think that's a pretty good deal they
really do live up to my high-end
lipsticks but I'm going to throw in a
body product here and this is from the
sanctuary spa which you can get in Boots
this is there two day moisture shower
oil it's seven pounds which i think is
really good because this really reminds
me of the L'Occitane almond body oil
which is really good for shaving your
legs and it kind of washes you but
leaves you moisturize at the same time
which is exactly what this does it's
like an oil that when you mix it with
water it lathers up your skin feels so
soft and amazing afterwards it's great
for shaving your legs and I've been
using this for ages and I've only used
that much so I feel like it's going to
last a long time it's just really
affordable and I really like this
randomly from superdrug I'd really
recommend the tiny burn lip glosses
these are only 6 99 she has loads of
different shades and I really love the
formula of these they really do live up
to some way high-end lip glosses even
like Chanel they're so creamy and
comfortable on the lips and there's some
really nice wearable shades as well I
have afternoon tea chic and picnic in
the park which is a really pretty pink I
like to always keep one in my handbag
it's nice putting on top of lipsticks
and you can wear them by themselves I
think in the summer especially i wear
these lip glosses a lot Kiko is a really
good food will brand they have so many
products that you just wouldn't think of
the prices that they are this is only
six pounds 90 and it's their
long-lasting stick eyeshadow this is
very similar to the by Terry cream
eyeshadow stick just winds up like that
you can apply it and blend out with your
finger this is a really pretty blonde
shade great for everyday great for
school if your makeup to school or if
you just don't like to spend that much
time in the morning doing your makeup
the
really handy I definitely recommend
going to Kiko if you like affordable
products their prices are just insane
have another bath product now and this
is from Zoe's range zoella beauty and
this is the fizz bar I think this is my
favorite thing from her range that she
recently bought out in superdrug it's
only five pounds and I think it's a
really nice take on kind of the bubble
bars bath bomb kind of things so it
looks like the chocolate bar it's all
white and you can just break off as many
squares as you want put them into the
bath and it leaves this really nice kind
of fresh scent I really like the sense
of these actually and it looks really
cute it's nice to give as a gift as well
and I love all the like branding and I
just really like this so what under five
pounds now and I've still got some more
amazing makeup to talk about I can't
believe how affordable this is this is
the Rimmel scandaleyes shadow paint and
this is an old favorite of mine but I
still love it is in the shade rich
russet and it's like a liquid eyeshadow
that you apply it looks like a lip gloss
you apply it onto your lid blend it out
and it's set in place and literally
doesn't budge for the whole day you can
really build it up and make it metallic
or you can wear it quite share and it's
just a really pretty buttons this is
only 499 it's such a good deal for such
a great product if you're looking for a
good dry shampoo and it is a struggle
because there are so many bad ones out
there my friend Ruth clearly has a new
range out called colab and it's so good
that prices are so affordable I really
couldn't believe it only three pound
fifty for a dry shampoo this is the
centre london there's a few different
sense based on the different countries
and this one says it's a classic
fragrance it's definitely my favorite
out of all of them not just because it's
called London smells really good and
this is just a really great dry shampoo
it doesn't have that you know in the
used dry shampoo and it makes your hair
feel a bit gross the next day it doesn't
have that so you can use this even as a
texturizing spray when your hair is
clean but if you are using it on greasy
hair it really does work you can get it
right into the root finally there's a
good dry shampoo on the market finally
right at the bottom of the list is one
of my favorite products for only two
pound fifty and it's the hand sanitizer
from the body shop this is in the scent
pink grapefruit I love this stuff
whenever I get out and use it there's
always someone who says oh can I have
some because the smell is so strong
everyone always smells it is like mmmm
that's so yummy it smells so like zingy
and refresh
gene and I ran out of this recently I
had to run out to buy another one for
this video and I was so happy to have a
fresh bottle I always keep this in my
little bag in my handbag and it's great
if I go on the tube a lot so I like to
keep my hands clean and this just smells
good because sometimes they smell like
really strong alcohol and I hate that so
I would recommend the ones from the body
shop especially the pink grapefruit one
so those are all my 15 products under 15
pounds and I hope you found some good
recommendations there when I actually
started putting this list together I
couldn't believe how many of my
favorites were under 15 pounds is so
good that you can get such good products
at such an affordable price now so those
are my 15 products under 15 pounds and I
hope you found some good recommendations
there I'll be back next Sunday with
another main channel video but until
then I hope you continue to enjoy it
