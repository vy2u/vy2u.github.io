thought it would be a great idea but I'm
quickly regretting that because it's
freezing but I'm going to do this really
quickly
I saw a s-stay from SE button do a video
like this I think she did fifty facts
though and I thought it was a really fun
idea so I'm gonna do 20 random facts
about me and they're completely random
they're the first 20 that came to my
head so I'm gonna go I used to play
girls football when I was about 10 years
old July about 15 I think I was always
on the girls football team and I was a
striker but really I used to stand by
the goal and wait for the ball to come
to me and then kick it in but I loved it
I love love football my whole family
also splitters and I still AM and I kind
of miss painfully I kept staring from
age 10 to 16 so maybe I was always
destined to be a blogger I'd be really
embarrassed if anyone ever read them
here they are three massive Diaries for
the full my embarrassing childhood
things I love cheesy things like Glee
and hairspray it's my guilty pleasure I
absolutely lovely and hairspray I'm sort
of film and I saw it in theatre and I
absolutely loved it and I love singing
things like that I took a gap year
before uni I went I worked a bit I
worked in gap and I worked in a
production company and I also went
travelling for three months I could only
go for three because my sister was
getting married and I had to come back
at her wedding I went to Thailand for a
month Australia for a month Fiji for two
weeks and then LA
it was the best thing I ever did I'm
very program peers I grew up a lot and
then I was ready for you and I'm really
happy I did it I have four tattoos I'll
link my tattoo video below you can see
all my tattoos but yeah a lot of people
don't really know about me I don't like
a tattoo person but I actually have four
I really hate dance music I think
because I did music Tech from a levels I
kind of realize how easy it is to make a
good beat and then just loop it so it
goes to the whole track obviously some
tons some really good but most of them I
really hate they're so repetitive I
really hate that music I'm a warrior and
I get that from my dad I worry about
everything like when I'm growing a
holiday I'm thinking oh what am I going
to do is my bag when I'm swimming that
it's on the beach like when it's
irrelevant and it happened to is time I
worry about everything I don't know why
I think it's because I'm trying to
prevent myself from getting stressed
when actually comes to it and I moan a
lot so I try and like worry beforehand
so that when it comes through I don't
moan and I don't know I worry about
stupid things a lot I'm a list maker I
love making lists I'm addicted making
making lists as I'm doing this video I'm
reading off a list I have an app for
lists I write lists in books I write
lists all the time I'm completely
obsessed in writing this I studied for
three years
and then worked full-time for two and a
half years before leaving my jobs do my
blog in YouTube full time with some
freelance projects here and there I'm
loving it at the moment
I worked mainly PR and then I worked in
beauty for a year and a half before and
yeah I'm loving life at the moment it's
really fun but I worked hard to get here
I am a massive family person and people
always talk about wanting to live in
other countries and move aboard for a
year but even though I love like I'd
love New York I'd love to live there I
don't never move away for my family I'm
always with them like I'll spend
Saturday night my parents easily we got
on really well I have nieces and nephews
who I love and I hate missing out and
stuff if my family will go out for a
meal together and I don't go I get
really upset I'm a real kind of homebody
I was in the jazz fire at school we had
a jazz choir and practiced every week
and then we had concerts like once a
year and I loved it some like Motown
songs and I loved doing things I liked
that was kind of the only really extra
curriculum stuff that I did it's cool
but I really really love to be in the
jazz choir I don't work out I don't go
to the gym I don't go running I don't do
any exercise apart from just like
generally
I'm trying to keep fit but yeah it's
really bad I've always been like that
I hate working out I think it's because
I suffer from really bad back it feels
so much harder then I think it's for
everyone else but there's no excuse I'm
really lazy and I never work out and
there's no excuse I was the voice of a
cartoon character in a what's it's bad
boat when I was eight or nine yeah I've
got paid 10 pounds and I thought it was
about a thousand pounds at the time but
my uncle works in advertising and they
needed a voice and they actually we're
gonna get the voice of Lisa Simpson but
she dropped out last minute and so they
got me to do it and I basically just had
to say eat a eats it and then giggle but
I remember being on TV for quite a while
and I was very proud and excited about
it I think I could have been really
driven tennis my dad might disagree but
I love playing tennis and I think have I
really gotten into a young age and
really kind of done it properly that was
kind of the sport I would have wanted to
be really good at I'm all right now I
think like an average person but I could
have been really good I loved him I
think one of my favorite films of all
time is life is beautiful it does have
subtitles which I don't really like in a
film it's amazing film about Second
World War and a dad who's trying to
protect the Sun and pretends that the
whole kings of games that the sun's not
scared and it's amazing you have to
watch it it's in Italian I think
I had my first kiss when I was 13 I
think I was 13 and he was holding a
skateboard Falasca kissed and it was a
proper skater boy and it's all full of
all four first kisses are really bad I
was in the audience on Nickelodeon quite
a few times
I don't know how maybe it's just the
growing up in London thing but we used
to go and Nickelodeon quite a lot and
I've got a funny clip with me and my
friends so I try and add it in here but
yeah I loved watching Nickelodeon I
remember going to be in the audience and
it'd just be the best thing ever
how about your other favorite band yeah
baby
yeah it's really cool and good I think
why ethnic origin is British
I'm literally British both my parents
all my grandparents I get asked that
question even outside of YouTube and
hugging all the time everyone always
asks me where are you from originally
and when I say I'm English they're like
not satisfied and just want to know
where my ancestors are from this
seriously this there's nothing
interesting in my blood I'm completely
English why it's English I don't know
why I look like I've got features and
stuff I just do
I'd rather die freezing cold and boiling
hot okay the final one is I used to be
obsessed with Nick after battery poison
my all-time favorite band and Nick
Arthur was like the love of my life his
blonde curtains I used to have posters
of him all over my wall and stickers and
I think my old bedroom it still says I
heart Nick Carter so I'll try and find a
video clip of that but yeah I usually
obsessed
so that's everything from my 20 random
facts about me I hope you found them
interesting and I hope you like the
snowy background

can't wait to go back inside so thank
you for watching and I'll see you guys
