very happy New Year to you all I hope
you had a really good New Year's Eve and
I'm excited to be in 2014 but before we
get started with this year I wanted to
do my 2013 beauty favorites and if you
haven't watched one of these videos
before it's basically all my beauty
favorites from the whole year so it's a
bit of a mammoth video so I'm actually
going to be splitting mine into two pie
this video is going to be body and
fragrance skincare and nails and my next
video will just give me on Sunday it's
gonna be haircare and makeup and extras
which is like tools and brushes I'm also
not do mind by category so I'm not doing
my favourite foundation my favor can see
that I've just listed everything I've
loved from this year and I'm just going
to throw it into a video if you've
watched my videos all year then you're
gonna recognize most of these products
so I'm not going to talk in too much
detail about them if you are new to this
channel then this is basically all my
favourite products from the whole year
and I hope you find some new products to
love - I still love so many of the
products I mentioned in my 2012 Beauty
favorites video so instead of repeating
those again I'm just gonna list them all
in the description bar so you can know
that I still love love those products
and if you think why didn't you mention
by derma that's why because it was in
last year's video and all the products
will be listed below so go down there
and check if you want to find out more
about any of them so if I stop with my
two favorite perfumes from this year
both think related Jo Malone wild fig
and cassis which is beautiful absolutely
love this fragrance I've already
finished the 30-mil and I'm one for the
big size and diptych Philosopher's
they're both very similar I think
Philosopher's is a bit more green but I
absolutely love fig scents in my
bathroom for my hands I've been loving
the rituals hand swab it is incredible
it gets rid of any dead skin and your
hands feels so soft and smooth so I use
that pretty much every night and my ESOP
resurrection had wash I've had this for
like pretty much the whole year and I
still haven't finished it's huge that
such a good seal looks pristine your
bathroom and it's just a really really
nice hand wash my favorite candle has
been the dip teak baked handle I love
this scent I have the room spray as well
it works
all year round it's just really fresh
and comforting and delicious it smells
like my other favorite dip chic perfume
as well which is just so beautiful and
really like this scent oh yeah I've had
these on my
a table and it's the this works deep
sleep pillow spray which is a nice
lavender scented pillow spray to help
you get to sleep and this works deep
sleep stress less and this is a
rollerball that's really nice to put on
your wrists or behind your ears I like
to take some planes with me if I'm
traveling it and it just keeps you calm
in any situation and smells really nice
and also helps you sleep in my shower
this year I have been loving the soap &amp;amp;
Glory the breakfast scrub and this
pretty much smells like the name smells
like maple syrup it's so delicious and
so thick and exfoliates really well it's
not too harsh and these are really
affordable so this is definitely my
favorite scrub of the year and the last
tea from body and fragrance for the bath
the first one come as no surprise and
it's the aroma therapy associates relax
deep oil and this one's actually
finished I've got another one upstairs
I love these bars you only need a capful
and it just fills the whole path and the
whole room with this amazing relaxing
scent and I always use this in my
evening baths it's just amazing I've
also loved the rocker nail terapy
Himalayan detox salts I love Michelle
rocker nail she is an amazing therapist
and these bath salts that she created
are just they're like magic they can
send anyone to sleep they smell kind of
funky but they literally make you just
go straight to sleep after your bath
they're amazing like to even know what's
in them but they work okay on some nails
and I have quite a few favorites from
this year first of all the wire sell
nail polishes and I discovered these
this year they are caused in beautiful
packaging like all wire sell makeup but
I really really love the formula and the
brush and everything about this I've got
three shades here cap just pulls off and
it's got a little brush and it's got a
really thick brush so you hardly need
any strokes before you cover the whole
nail and I think the shade range is
lovely and they definitely recommend why
I sell nail polishes I also loved the
Barry M jelly nail polishes that were
released this year they are super
affordable and the formula is like a gel
so it comes out really thick lasts a
really long time and looks really nice
and shiny on the nails they've also got
amazing shade range so if you are really
into nail polish but you want something
a bit more affordable
these would I really recommend these I
absolutely love Essie nail polishes and
my two favorite colors from the year
have been watermelon and after school
boy basil what
is like a nice wearable bright pink and
after school boy blazer is a beautiful
navy blue and these are the ones I've
worn most this year revlon vixen is one
of my all-time favorites it's a deep
berry maroon burgundy color and it's
really affordable from revlon and it's
just a beautiful color I think that's
what I'm wearing on my nails now with a
bit of glitter and I feel like I could
just always go back to this if I'm ever
not sure what to paint on my nails this
is the one I always go for you guys know
I love my mints so I had to throw one in
and the maybelline superstay 7 days in
mint for life has been at my favorite
this year still love SC mint candy apple
but this one is really affordable and
the brush is really wide it's a formula
it's great and I love that the mint is
slightly lighter looks a little bit
white even from afar it's just really
pretty I also went through a good few
months of loving the butter LONDON and
cotton socks I think it's good which is
the white nail polish I seem to have
misplaced it for this video but I love
wearing white on my nails and I think
that's been something I've really
enjoyed doing this year and then of
course how could I not mention my Seche
vite topcoat I wouldn't be able to paint
my nails with all these beautiful colors
without this it dries so quickly it
makes the color last for ages and just
give that sort of gel finish like thick
shiny gel finish and I love this I just
have got two bottles of this this year
okay so I'm just skin care I have quite
a few favorites but I think you guys are
gonna recognize all of them because I've
been talking about them all year on here
and on my blog so the first one is the
Emma Hardy merengue cleansing balm and
I've actually fallen in love with the
sara chapman cleanser recently but this
has been the one that i've used most of
this year it comes in this kind of
really impractical pot but it's a really
nice boy cleansing balm and it takes all
your makeup off at seconds i use this
with a muslin cloth it's just so
luxurious and amazing and it's
definitely one of my favorite cleansers
I love this I've got the thing this is
my second top now and they're quite big
taking off waterproof makeup or
waterproof mascara I have been loving my
Clarins instant eye makeup remover it
looks like this and then you just shake
it up and use on cotton wool and it gets
everything off seriously if your
waterproof mascara girl this stuff is
magic pixie glow tonic had its moment
the CFX the Caroline hyerin's and this
is an exfoliating toner a bit like the
Clarins one but this is much more
affordable it's just harder to get hold
of if you're not a Londoner but you just
use this or custom wall and exfoliate
your face
he's like a harsh squab which I don't
really like using because it makes my
skin quite red so I've been using this
all year I've still only like halfway
through it I'm not really sure how but
you don't need much you need like one or
two pumps so this is really good if you
can get your hands on it for serum I've
been using Hydra neuron from indeed Labs
which is one that you can get from boots
it's just a basic serum and it does the
job I've used loads of fantasy rooms
this year but I always go back to this
song because it feels really fresh and
clean on your skin it just works it's
like a sandwich filler to keep your
moisturiser and everything sinking into
your skin and it's got really good small
packaging for traveling I just love
everything about this
this year I've become obsessed with oils
that's really been helping my skin
especially with the dehydration and my
favorite one of all time is Sarah
Chapman overnight facial it's a little
bit expensive but seriously it's worth
it you get a space of K points and this
stuff my skin just like drinks it up I
put it on every night now I was going to
use it it's like a 2-week baby treatment
by uses every night it's amazing smells
good it just feels so good on the skin
whenever I've had little breakouts or
pesky spots I always go back to the
origins super spot remover now I don't
think this is great for your skin
because it does sometimes feel a bit
stinging but if I have like a slightly
raised spot I just dab a little bit of
this on it and seriously the next
morning I wake up in the spots of God
and I just feel like this is magic I
don't have like really bad breakouts so
I'm not sure if I'd recommend this if
you do if you just get the odd spot here
and there
this stuff has really been helping
another toner I've fallen in love with
it's that on ravit skirt I can never say
that queen of Hungary mist and I just
have the sample size for cult beauty but
this is so nice it is really expensive
but if you just spray a little bit onto
your hands and Pat it in it just really
kind of seals the skin after you do your
whole cleansing and skincare routine I
just I love a good toner and this is
definitely a beautiful one I'm always
going on about this mask so it won't be
a surprise to any of you but the origins
drink up intensive overnight mask it's
definitely made it into my 2013
favorites it smells like peaches and
apricot smells amazing and you can
either use this as a mask overnight or
just kind of it as a night moisturizer
and rubbing it in it just works well
both ways and it's really good for dry
and dehydrated skin eye mask I don't
have with me is the ESOP party teeth
mask I've actually finished my want and
need to repurchase another one
it's absolutely incredible it's like a
clay mask it's not too harsh to have to
scrub off your skin it really helps my
skin's feeling a bit spotty and I
actually love it I use about twice a
week and that's why I finished good I've
completely finished might even need to
get another one my day moisturizer has
been the origins ginseng for most of the
year and I have nearly finished this now
there's literally hardly any left in
there and I love it smells like it
smells like chocolate
orange it's really refreshing to use in
the morning I love the little pots that
orange and some moisturizers come in and
I just go through them all the time I
think I've used a few this year but this
one has been really nice and I would
definitely repurchase this the last
thing for skincare is my Kiehl's SPF 50
and I always talk about this I didn't
really do it as part of my skin carroty
and I put it on before I thought to make
my makeup on but it is kind of skincare
and you can use this as a day
moisturizer if you want to as well
because it is quite thick but it's just
a really high SPF I like to wear it
every day just to protect my skin I know
you don't have to but I quite like
anyway not just for kind of the UV rays
or anything there's a lot of pollution
in London it I just feel like it creates
a barrier on my skin which I really like
and it's just a really nice base makeup
as well so I really recommend this if
you do want a good daily SPF so that's
everything from Part 1 I kind of breezed
through that but I've spoken about this
products so much I didn't want to bore
you with the details so don't forget to
check back on Sunday for makeup haircare
and extras and there's quite a lot in
that video so come back on Sunday
subscribe so you don't miss it and thank
