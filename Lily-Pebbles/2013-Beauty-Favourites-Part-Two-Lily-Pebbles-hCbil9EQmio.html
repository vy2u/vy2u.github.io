2013 beauty favorites if you haven't
seen the last one I will link it here
for you and in that I had skincare body
and fragrance and nails so go and watch
that video if you want to see all of
those favorites but in this video I'm
gonna have makeup haircare and extras
and our makeup as you can imagine is a
huge category I've just been trying so
much makeup this year and I've
discovered so many favorites and when I
was writing the list I was thinking I
can't put that many lipsticks in but I
just couldn't get the list any shorter
because I really do love all these
products so I'm just gonna get started
and where's my way through them don't
forget all the products will be listed
below the description bar along with
links and everything you need to that so
three foundations stood out to me this
year the first one is the Chanel
vitalina acro which I'm actually wearing
today it's my full back foundation that
I always go back to you can use your
hands to apply it so it's really easy
it's small and compact for traveling and
it's just a really nice finish it's kind
of it's not glowing but it's not matte
it's some weight in between and I really
really love this foundation I feel like
it suits so many different skin types I
also discovered the Laura Mercier
oil-free tinted moisturizer after trying
the original tinted moisturizer and
being a bit like it's not great I tried
the oil-free one and it's got slightly
more coverage which is what I was
looking for it's a bit more like a
proper foundation and it's so nice I
wear the shade nude and I really like
this for the summer for the past few
months I've been wearing the wire seller
youth liberator foundation and this has
just been the best discovery for the
year for me I love this it's so glowy I
get so many compliments when I wear this
foundation the only problem is the shade
range now this is becoming a bit too
yellow for me this is B 30 and there
isn't a B 20 there's just B 10 which is
a little bit annoying but hopefully
they'll bring out more shades because I
think it has been really popular and I
definitely recommend trying this if you
can get a self who it's just like magic
foundation in a bottle I have like three
concealers this year and they all work
well together the first one is the Bobbi
Brown corrector which I've just loved
for years it works so good in dark
circles so I just use this right in the
inside of
I wear I have some darkness it's like a
peachy salmon color so it cancels out
any dark purples or blues so NARS
radiant creamy concealer has also been a
huge launch this year and I just fell in
love with it I use the shade of vanilla
which is always sold out it's so hard to
find I found mine in New York in the end
but it comes with a doe foot applicator
so it's so easy I use this under my eyes
it's really creamy and glowy and
brightening and never ever loads cakey
when I went to New York I also
discovered the Make Up For Ever full
cover concealer which I heard so much
about for years but thought it would be
really heavy and cakey and it's not too
tall you can apply this with your
fingers so I use this for my chin around
my nose anywhere on my face and it's so
easy to blend it just looks so natural
you can't see it at all and I really
like that it comes in a little cheese
there are two powders that I love this
year for setting my makeup and getting
rid of any shine so I use this one just
kind of in the middle of my forehead
sometimes down the sides of my nose and
it's the soap and Floria kick-ass can
powder and I really like this because
it's translucent and it looks a bit
yellow in the pan but it actually comes
out completely translucent so it doesn't
add any color or coverage which isn't
what I was looking for I just wanted to
set my makeup and this has been perfect
and really like this is definitely my
favorite drugstore powder also the
hourglass ambient lighting powders was a
huge launch this year everyone went
crazy for it I originally got dim light
and then I went to get diffused light
which I do prefer diffuse light it looks
a bit like this and these are very very
finely milled powders that add glow and
a sheen to your skin so it sets your
makeup and gives you a glow at the same
time and they're really beautiful there
is a palette but I don't love all the
shades in the palette so I just stuck to
getting the shades that I liked when I
discovered the Kevin O'Connell sculpting
powder I was a bit scared of it I'll
show what it looks like it's like a dark
brown color and you get to contour with
it so I found it really scary but once I
figured out how to use it with just a
small powder brush in the contours of my
cheek it looks so nice especially and
I'm filming or taking any photos it
really adds dimension to my face and
it's a really natural it's like too dark
brown it's not orange it's kind of ashy
Brown and it really suits my skin tones
so I was going to say that NARS the deep
threat has been my favorite blusher from
this year it's a really nice kind of
peachy pink with a bit of shimmer in it
actually the last few months I've
discovered another blusher that I really
like as well but I think it might be
better than deep throat and it's from
Becca and it's called a flower child
it's pretty much the same color as deep
throat but it's less shimmery so I find
it a lot easier to wear and it's really
natural and just a pretty pink it goes
well with a smoky eye or a bold lip
because it's kind of a there but not
there blusher so I think I'm gonna cram
this one my favorite from this year the
Max Factor miracle touch creamy blush
and soft pink was an amazing discovery
for me this year it's so affordable and
cheap it comes in this tiny little
packaging but this is the best cream
blush I've ever used
seriously it's so good so I wore this
throughout the summer it just lasts all
day if you need a long lasting that
cream blusher this one is your friend
it's so good and it's a really nice
natural pink for most of this year I was
just using a clear mascara on my
eyebrows and the one I've liked the most
is from blink and it's really good it
doesn't leave your eyebrows too crispy
and it doesn't leave any whiteness in
them which I found with some of the
others so this is really good I've quite
a few products for eyes first of all the
Clinique chubby stick for eyes was a
really cool launch this year they had
their chubby sticks for lips and I
mentioned those in my last year's
favorites but these are for your eyes
and the colors I really like a full of
fudge and lots of latte and they're so
easy if you're suppressing these to your
makeup quickly you just swipe these on
and go and you can blend them out of
your finger and they last a really long
time so that's pretty cool of clinic I
really like this after I discovered the
Rimmel scandaleyes liquid eye shadow I
went on about these for months they're
amazing it looks like a lip gloss it
comes like a doe foot applicator and you
apply it onto your lid and it's really
wet but as soon as you blend it out with
a brush it just sets it stays in place
and doesn't budge so I always use this
when I'm going on nights out or if I'm
out all day all night and I didn't need
my makeup to last it works well as an
eyeshadow base or just by itself this is
the shade of rich russet which is the
only one I really like but it's just
amazing amazing product
well done Rimmel I absolutely love this
more great drugstore eye products the
L'Oreal infallible
eyeshadows are so nice I am amber rush
bons taupe which I think of both shades
from America but we have similar shades
here which is just as nice and these are
like pressed pigments they're a bit like
the Armani ones
just as good but so much more affordable
and if you like really intense shimmery
eyeshadows these are for you if you just
use a brush like pack them on they look
amazing on the lids and they come in
these like cute little pots as well so
you kind of want to start collecting
them the two Mac eyeshadows that I've
worn most this year have been caught and
texture cook is like a light brown and
textures and more orangie Brown and I
really like texture for the crease and
under the eye it really warms up any
eyeshadow look and I love so many Mac
eyeshadows but I had to narrow it down
to two and needs to be my favorite from
the year one more single eyeshadow and
it's a cream eyeshadow from Estee Lauder
and it's chained I love this shade it's
like an orange G Brown and I have used
so much of this seriously it's like
nearly gone it's so good it's a base or
just on its own it lasts for so long
because it's a cream formula and it's
kind of move see it's not hard so you
can really like play with it and blend
it where you want it to blend and it's
just a beautiful color I love this and I
will definitely get a little born it
better not be sold out or limited
edition or and if they gonna love this
okay to eyeshadow palettes and then
we're finished with eyes the first one
is the Bobbi Brown rich chocolate
eyeshadow palette and this is amazing
get your eyes ready seriously this is
like a nude eyeshadow lover's dream it's
got a mix of shimmer sparkles and satins
and mattes and I just feel like it has
everything you need in this so good for
traveling and I'm really really happy
with this palette I love it and use it
all the time even if it's just one shade
or all the shades I always get back to
this recent the Urban Decay launch the
Naked 3 palette and it just reminded me
how much I love the naked one I do like
naked too and I do like naked 3
but seriously naked one is my all-time
favorite
the bronzy topi shades are just
beautiful and perfect for my complexion
and there's everything you need in here
literally Gold's champagnes Browns
Purple's
I love it and the whole naked relaunch
just made me want to use naked one even
more I have one mascara favorite I've
had lots of mascara as I'd like this
year but the one that's really stood out
to me if the clinic high impact extreme
volume and this is amazing it's got a
plasticy warhead brush which is
something I didn't think I liked at all
but I really like this I just feel like
you hardly need any time
just take seconds and you girl at listen
your lashes and it's done and it gives
length and volume and I love this
mascara okay so now into lips I have
quite a few lip products but I try to
narrow it down I promise I have three
matte lipsticks that I've loved this
year and they are craving syrup and
planful all very similar shades craving
is a more pinky plum syrup is more of a
purpley and then plum for slightly
darker and I have absolutely loved all
three of these lipsticks this year they
already kind of suit my complexion
they're easy to wear during the day and
you do the evening and they kind of go
with every makeup look in every outfit
so I love these and these probably my
three favorites MAC lipsticks ever
Rimmel's Notting Hill nude it's one I
also spoke about a lot this year this is
just a really pretty easy to wear
everyday nude slightly pink toned but
it's not kind of baby pink so it works
for warmer skin tones as well I really
like this and the formula is really nice
and moisturizing Rimmel also launched
the apocalypse this year which have
really nice lip lacquers they're really
easy to apply with the special
applicator that has like a pool of
product in it and these are like the
drugstore alternatives to the hourglass
Rouge Opaques and I do prefer these
because I find they don't dry out as
quickly as the hourglass ones they come
in a really nice range of colors and
they've actually added some new shades
recently and I'll be talking about those
on my blog this month so go ahead and
check that out but yeah these are really
nice and once they set they last all day
I've also loved the NARS Velvet Matte
lip pencils these are great they're like
big chubby pencils they're really easy
to apply and they are so long-lasting
these are perfect for party I have
dragon girl and Red Square red Sakura's
like an orange you red and dragon girls
like a pinky red and these are so nice
they're really really mattes and they
just look beautiful on the lips a random
lipstick favorite because I've never
heard of this brand it's from Helen E
cosmetics but I got this in a glossy box
at the beginning of the year and it's
just a really nice classic red lipstick
and it lasts so well I've eaten and had
drinks he's wearing this and that's the
thing with red lipstick you don't really
want to wear one that's going to end up
all over
face so I really like this and I'm gonna
link below where you can get it it's
really random but really nice and then
the last thing for lips is the SIMEX lip
protector this is my favorite lip balm
from this year it's really basic it's
not very glamorous but it always works
whenever I get really dry lips I tried
by Terry Baume De Rose that try nooks
Rev de Mille all of those kind of famous
lip balms but none of them really work
as well as this one which is like a
cream and it's more like medical and
this just if you really have chapped
lips this one is amazing
okay so that was makeup done sorry it
was such a huge category I knew it would
be but now on to hair and the first
thing is from Fito and it's the
clarifying detox shampoo this is so good
if you have put up build-up if you feel
like your hair is getting greasy at
quicker and you're starting to have to
wash it more regularly then using the
detox trap who is great but most of them
are really drying on your hair so if you
have quite dry hair already like me this
one is really good it doesn't dry out
your hair and it you need a tiny bit
right in the root and it really does the
job my favorite shampoo and conditioner
from this year have been from Bumble and
Bumble and it is the straight range I
don't have any with me because I
finished mine it's really good if you
like to wear your hair straight it kind
of makes the whole straightening process
a bit easier and they're really nice and
nourishing on the hair to affordable
jocks or conditioners I've absolutely
loved have been the John Frieda full
repair deep conditioner which looks like
this and the L'Oreal ever reach
conditioner which is like sulfate free
etc so these are these are both really
good and you can get them from boots and
they just make a hair from really soft
and conditioned and really good the best
oil that I have used it's been from
L'Oreal professional and it's the mythic
oil I have the rich from because I've
got super dry hair but they have a few
different formulas you only need a tiny
bit it gets rid of any frizz and
fluffiness and just makes my hair feel
heavier and good-quality the combination
of these two products have been what
I've been using for the last kind of six
months and I love it the all babe dry
texturizing spray is so good to spray
Cal it into the roots into this part of
the hair to give a bit of volume and
texture and then the bumble and bumble
semi Siro which is kind of like a wax I
really like to rub this between my
fingers and then just use it the boss of
my hair to kind of separate it out a bit
get rid of any frizz and it just kind of
keeps everything in place and it smells
so good okay now onto extra
and I have to affordable makeup brush
ranges which I am loved first of all
from Kiko they're Pro makeup brush range
it's so good the quality is insane and
they really are quite affordable and the
zoeva brushes as well which you can get
online they've got like the 207 mac
brush all these standard shapes that are
so expensive from mac and they're really
affordable from zoeva so if y'all go
invested some brushes there are
affordable ones out there I also love my
Real Techniques buffing brush I'm on my
second one now I wish they sold these on
their own but I'm happy to pay like 22
pounds with the core kit because that is
still a really good price for such an
amazing brush I use this for my
foundation every day and it's just the
perfect kind of dome shape it's really
good for my buffing in your foundation
that love this and then I also
discovered the Charlotte's Hillberry
powder and sculpt brush this year and
this is a really nice tapered brush the
brushes mate it doesn't roll off the
table all these little details really
make it so nice to use I like to use
this under my eye and for any kind of
powder to set my foundation around my
nose forehead chin it's just so soft
it's small enough you can use it to
contour as well it's a great
multi-purpose brush now this is a bit of
a wild card because I only discovered it
in the past month or so but I loved it
so much that I had to include it and
it's cool of the wet brush this is a bit
like the tangle teaser and mikkel
Mercier one it's meant to kind of be a
detangler brush but you can use it on
wet hair because when your hair's wet it
loses all its elasticity so you have to
be careful how you brush it but this one
is amazing I didn't get on with the
tangle teezer it didn't get rid of any
tangles for me literally got stuck in my
hair the Michiel Murcia one I did quite
liked but it was quite cheaply made mine
broke like after using it a few times
and this is like a proper hair brush but
seriously when I come out the shower and
let you two go like that and it goes
through my hair like all in one gets rid
of any knots it's magic it's like one of
my favorite discoveries from this year
ever and I've only been using it for a
month it's amazing if I don't think from
this category is the dr. Bronner
magic soap and I have the baby mild
version you can use any scent I use this
to wash my brushes I just put a small
amount on my hand
swallow my brush in it with water and it
just keeps them so clean you can use
baby shampoo but this is so cheap and it
works really well and
you can use it for anything really it
really is magic so you can use it to
brush your teeth apparently but I think
that's a bit closer but it's so good for
washing your makeup brushes so that's
the end of my 2013 beauty favorites I
