I do these every year and I wasn't sure
this year if you guys were interested
but I tweeted and you all definitely
wanted a 2015 favorites I did warn you
in my vlog though that most of the
things are high-end and a lot hasn't
really changed since last year so what
I'm gonna do which I think I also did
last year is list below all the products
that I still love from last year's video
because there's lots of favorites that
aren't gonna pop up in here and that's
because I'm still loving them and not
much has actually changed since last
year but there are some new products
they don't feel new anymore because some
of them came out at beginning of the
year but products that I have been
loving and using all year and although I
know everyone does these videos and they
get a bit boring I guess it's quite
helpful to see in one video what my kind
of all-time favorites from 2015 are so
I've got a giant bag of stuff here that
I'm just going to like dig in in no
particular order and just pick some
stuff to talk about this is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder and I
had the individual powders for a while
but it took me it's a while to get the
palette and I really love this palette I
often just kind of swish the brush and
use all three together their
highlighting luminous powders that I
tend to put on my cheekbones or just all
over my face really and they add a
beautiful soft gentle glow the lorac Pro
palette I finally picked up when I was
in America kind of halfway through the
year and it's a really great eyeshadow
palette there's a reason why everyone
raves about it it's got beautiful warm
tones in it the gold and the light
bronze are my two favorites they're
really really pretty and there's some
nice kind of deeper Browns and plums as
well it's a great palette I love the
packaging I'm really happy I picked that
up another eyeshadow palette that I've
been using a lot this year is the busy
art map 2 palette and I didn't use it
that much when I first bought it but
this year I've been using it a lot it's
all matte eyeshadows so it's really easy
to use you can use it with other eye
shadow palettes just a really good
selection of kind of warm browsers a
couple of cool tones but most of it is
warm and really pretty I love the ones
in the middle there the concealers I've
been using in all my tutorials and most
of the years are the Charlotte Tilbury
retouch this is a really really nice
hydrating concealer it's one of those
twists up pens I'm either shade 2 if I
want something lighter or 3 if I want
something a bit darker the only problem
with this is you don't know when you're
going to run out but I always just read
straight away because I really like this
and then the other concealer is that
Urban Decay Naked skin which is such
good coverage you only need to dip it in
once to do entire face I wish there were
more colors because the color range
doesn't really suit me but it's a really
good concealer and I think this is
definitely better than the not as one I
also fell in love with H&amp;amp;M Beauty this
year I was so impressed with their
makeup range
I've been raving about it since it came
out I have really fallen in love with
their eyeshadows the cream eyeshadows
are such good formulas very similar to
the Estee Lauder ones that I really like
they last really well easy to apply so
I've really enjoyed the cream eyeshadows
but also the single eyeshadows are
definitely worth picking up this is the
golden one in a batch EDA dama
I think it is and it's a beautiful goal
that I've been using so much since I
bought it the quality of these are so
much better than I had expected I've
been using this lip combo all year I
love it you guys know what it is it's
Max or lip pencil and Mac mer lipstick
it's like a slightly berry nude it's
kind of hard to explain it's different
to any other lipsticks that I have
really got in my collection but it just
seems to go with everything which is why
I wear it so often it goes with any
outfit it goes with the day look with a
night look it's a matte formula so it
lasts really really well and it makes
your lips look really plump so I've been
loving that convert this year in the
summer I really enjoyed using the cream
bronzer from YSL these are called this
sahar en and they're really interesting
very different it's a cream bronzer so I
used the Real Techniques contour brush
and I applied that and you kind of like
work it and buff it into the skin and I
found that it was the most natural way
to bronze up in the summer because I
hate layering on power to products in
the summer I think it looks so powdery
looks like you own so much makeup so
this way was really natural and I really
loved using it as a huge dent and I
never thought I would like something
like this so I would definitely be using
that again in the warmer months the
foundation that I've probably been using
the most this year part and ones that
I've already mentioned in last year's
video is the NARS sheer glow it has a by
terry lid on it at the moment because
nas don't really do lids this is just
such an easy foundation to wear I feel
like it gives me the purpose amount of
coverage for a day or night looks really
natural on the skin but covers any
imperfections and it's the one I always
go back to I use the shade Deauville
is such a great foundation Becker
collaborated with Jaclyn hill who's an
American youtuber this year to release a
champagne pop which is a highlighter and
literally it like nearly broke the
internet they did so well with it I
don't know if it was the collaboration
with Jaclyn hill or if the product was
just great but either way the
highlighter is amazing I love it I have
to because I'm so scared of one breaking
it's like a beautiful golden peach
highlighter it's definitely my favorite
highlighter for my entire collection I
use it like every day even though it's
quite intense it's probably more
suitable just for the evenings I use it
all the time because I'm just addicted
to it it's so beautiful it's the sort of
highlighter that actually shows up on
your skin this is my second bottle of
the Estee Lauder CC cream and I've been
using this most of the year as well I
tend to mix it with my foundation in the
summer I sometimes were alone but most
the time I mixed it to make my
foundation more kind of hydrating and
juhi and it's also slightly tinted so it
does make my skin look slightly more
bronzed I just became addicted to this
and I don't really know what it is but
it does something great to my skin and I
just love using it with my foundation
just to make it a bit more movable and
blendable I don't think I put these in
previous year lis favorite videos so
though I haven't worn them that much
towards the end of this year I had to
include them because they are both
really great the Sephora lip cream and
the Kat Von D lip creams these are both
from Sephora in America and they're so
so good I haven't worn them a lot
recently but they're still definitely my
favorites they're like a lip lacquer so
you apply it and it just stays put so
well without drying out your lips and
for a red lip I will always go for these
or my Charlotte Tilbury matte lipstick
but these are really great I find the
Kat Von D one slightly more drawing but
I think they've got a better choice of
colors I've got some more lipsticks here
to talk about as well
Clinique release these lipsticks this
year and there are so many different
colors some really nice shades one I
wore a lot in the summit is poppy pop
it's kind of like I don't even know it's
like somewhere between a red in a pink
and a coral but it's very flattering
I really enjoyed wearing it very
hydrating and moisturizing easy to wear
and I was a lot in the summer I also
absolutely loved shark tobey's matte
revolution lipsticks and love Liberty is
such a gorgeous plummy
deep shades quite different again I can
wear it for the day or for the evening
and I wear this one a lot I mean I've
kind of got heart gone over half and I
hardly ever finish lipsticks and then
she now also released loads of lipsticks
there's so many amazing shades these are
like hydrating lipsticks they're the
Rouge Coco's and Adrienne is a really
beautiful nude I find it quite hard to
find the perfect nude that doesn't wash
me out but this one is the perfect nude
and I've gone through one of these
already which is mad I had no interest
in trying the Too Faced better than sex
mascara probably because of the name I
think it's a ridiculous name and it kind
of put me off but I don't remember why I
eventually tried it and I really fell in
love with it I like how the packaging is
kind of weighted it makes it easier to
apply the brush is ridiculously huge and
I really wouldn't think that I like this
but it just makes my lashes look fat it
really makes them look full of volume
it's great for a night out it's probably
a bit too intense for the day but this
is definitely my night out mascara and
I've enjoyed using it a lot so I'm kind
of leaving it just as makeup but I just
thought I'd add in one of perfume
favorites this is the fresh fake apricot
scent and I absolutely love this and you
know someone know it's so fresh and
light and delicious and reminds me of my
mom I really really like this perfume
and that's it I kind of wish through
those but as I said there's so many
favorites um last year that I'm still
loving so I'm gonna leave a list of all
the favorites that I still like from
last year's video and I'll leave the
link to last year's video and the years
before as well in the description box so
maybe there are some products in there
that you haven't yet tried that you want
to give a go in the new year let me know
if we have any of the same favorite
products and thank you so much for
watching I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
