doing a video that I wasn't expecting to
do this year it's gonna be my 2017
beauty favorites and I'm gonna be doing
makeup and skincare now I don't think I
did a video like this last year I kind
of stopped doing them because I felt
like I was just repeating myself I'm
never really sure with these videos if
you're meant to talk about products you
discovered that yield just the products
that you loved that year anyway I got
into a rut of using the same things time
and time again I definitely condensed
down the products that I try in the last
couple of years so I wasn't gonna do
this video but then I just found myself
obsessively watching everyone else's and
I'd get so excited when I see one coming
to my subscription box so I thought you
know I always preach film videos that
you enjoy watching yourself so in the
end I thought I would do one and these
aren't necessarily products I discovered
in 2017 but they're products I loved
using and I know that I could get rid of
every other makeup and skincare product
that I own and these be good enough kind
of so I'm gonna start talking through
the product because they're quite a few
I'm gonna start with skincare the first
one is a very obvious one and I couldn't
not put in the Askia Renaissance
cleansing gel there are other cleansers
that I really enjoyed last year caroline
hyerin's along with pixie the glossier
cleanser but this still stand out to me
as the best it comes in a pump it's a
gel that turns it to an oil it takes off
all my makeup it makes my skin feel
really hydrated and moisturized and I've
used it for definitely three or more
years now and it's still my absolute
number one the next product I did
actually discover last year and it's the
beauty pie fruit enzyme five-minute
facial the beauty pipe concepts quite
confusing to explain but you either pay
full price for the product or you sign
up and pay a monthly fee and then all
the products are really cheap anyway
this is a really great exfoliator but
it's not like really gritty you just rub
it over the skin and it literally made
my skin so glowy and smooth and it's in
a really great little tube for traveling
I was just very impressed by this this
product I've also loved for years but I
continue to love it in 2017 this is
probably my third or fourth tube maybe
and it's the ESOP a parsley seed mask I
always recommend this this is the mask I
use when I'm feeling like my skin is a
bit congested or a little bit spotty
it's one of those kind of clay child
Koli masks I paint it on with a brush
leave on for like 15-20 minutes until
it's dry wash it off and my skin
feels really like cleansed and clean and
it continues to be one of my all-time
favorites when it comes to moisturizers
actually have to because they're quite
different and these are the two I
definitely loved all year the glossy a
priming moisturizer rich I don't love
the original moisturize the one comes in
a tube but the rich one in the pot is
really nice it's just a thick
moisturizer and I've used absolutely
loads of it I would definitely
repurchase it sits really nicely under
makeup it really smooths your skin and
hydrates it and this is my just favorite
everyday moisturizer I use this one
every morning and I would travel with
this one it's the dr. jart Cera midden
this comes in a few different formulas I
like the cream one in the cheap it's a
very easy moisturizer if anyone ever
asks me for moisturizing recommendation
this is always the one that I say to get
I mean get in Sephora in America but in
the UK I think Selfridges stocks it this
is a brand new one was a completely
finished mine final skincare item is an
SPF because last year I discovered my
favorite SPF to date and it's the
glossier invisible shield I love this
because it's in like a gel formula so
some SPF so your face are in a cream
which I find makes your skin go quite
white some are like really silicone E
and greasy this is just an invisible as
it says an invisible kind of gel formula
that just disappears into the skin
it's SPF 35 which I think is perfectly
enough especially when I'm in the UK and
yeah this is kind of second the third
one I've been doing
oh one more skincare product that I
can't show you because I finished it is
the ordinary hyaluronic acid I've used
quite a few different serums like the
glossy a bounce serum the baked aljalja
Ronix here and they will do similar
things but I think the best one in terms
of how much product you get versus how
much it costs is the one from the
ordinary it's a really nice hydrating
serum that I use pretty much all year I
just ran out and kind of went on to
other things but I think that would be
my top recommendation for my favorite
serum for 2017 okay now let's go on to
makeup I really hope I haven't forgotten
anything but if I've looked your makeup
collection and I just immediately
grabbed the thing that I know I've been
using the most throughout the year and
this doesn't mean that these are like my
only favourites there's so many other
things I've been loving and I worked so
many different brands last year and
discovered some great products as well
so just because they're not in this
video doesn't mean I don't like the
anymore let's can't do it in order of
how I would put the makeup on the first
one is a primer and I've just completely
finished this it's the Beca first like
primary filter so originally I tried the
backlight priming filter which is more
of a glowy one but this I've just never
tried anything like it's in this kind of
lavender color
I find it feels really calming and
refreshing on my skin and it just I had
this like lavender kind of lit from
within look that I just think is so
great i I never go through like bottles
of primers like this and I use this one
pretty much every day I thought it was
great I couldn't not mention it
cosmetics CC cream I use this every day
without fail it's such a great product
don't be put off by the name CC I
wouldn't say this is anything like it
into boys toys though it's basically a
foundation but you can thin it out you
can put on a tiny bit and rub it in with
your hands or you can really build up to
like a medium coverage foundation I use
the shade light I do wish there were
some more shades even I'm in between
shades so if you have a lighter or
darker skin tone it's gonna be really
difficult to find your shade which is a
shame so hopefully they will extend that
but its SPF 50 it meshes into the skin
so beautifully and leaves your skin like
glowing with the perfect amount of
coverage for me I seem to be the only
person in the world that doesn't love
the glossiest skin tint this for me is
just the best base but when it comes to
a slightly more full coverage foundation
the only other one that I really used
all year is the hourglass vanish
foundation I had this in a couple of
shades so it's a stick foundation I've
got I've used so much of this one you
just swipe onto the skin and I use a
damp Beauty Blender to kind of work it
in and it's so easy to blend out around
your skin and it leaves such a gorgeous
finish to it whenever I wear this
foundation I get so many compliments on
my skin it's a really nice amount of
coverage I wore this on my wedding day
mixed with Mac face and body it's very
long wearing so I tend to put it in the
places where my foundation kind of
disappears first yeah this was a really
great discovery because I wouldn't
normally tried a kind of stick
foundation like this and I really like
it
concealers everyone has put this in
their 2017 favourites and it's for good
reason it's I remember going to the
launch of this concealer and I was
really excited because I love NARS
products they brought out the soft matte
complete concealer in a little pop if I
said
love that it's in a pot because I find
that now I've used loads of mine I
really have to dig my finger in and it
goes under my nails which is a bit
annoying I wear the shade I wear the
shade custard which is maybe a slightly
too warm for me but I think that vanilla
which might be the one under it's
probably too light it's just a really
great concealer I find that it's perfect
for the chin and nose area because I
just go like this and it blends in
beautifully and I do wear under my eyes
a camera under my eyes but when my eyes
are a bit dry it's maybe a bit too heavy
coverage and I tend to mix it with
something like the glossy a concealer
it's not completely matte it's just
matte enough though concealer needs to
be and then the other concealer which I
discovered last year and completely fell
in love with is the by Terry steelo
expert CLIC stic I wear the shade three
again maybe a little bit too warm for me
I need to find the shade below this is
so great because it's so easy to use you
just click the bottom swipe it under
your eyes wherever you want to pick your
concealer again I blend it out using the
Beauty Blender or the Real Techniques
setting brush and it's so creamy it's
creamy enough that it blends around your
skin nicely but then it's not so creamy
that it slips off your skin this is a
really amazing concealer if you haven't
yet tried it definitely try it I would
say it's kind of like a slightly
creamier version of the NARS one but in
a stick form which is just so so much
easier to use I don't think any of you
would be surprised by my bronzer pick
because this is my second one now and
it's the only bronzer I really use it's
the Too Faced milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer like I've almost finished this
one as well I go through these so
quickly I really like it because it's
like a mid-tone brown it's not too warm
and orange and it's not too like that it
doesn't do anything the formula is well
it just picks up so well on my brush and
I use it as a bit of a contour but if a
bronzer every day without fail it smells
like chocolate this one definitely needs
replacing absolute favorite bronzer when
it comes to the blusher it was hard to
pick because there is a bite every one
that I have been absolutely loving but I
think in terms of what I was most
impressed by I had to put in these
glossy a cloud paints when I first
discovered blush I actually wasn't
really that interested in these because
the colors seemed really off to me I
first picked up this one which is dusk
and I liked it Razzak maybe it's a
little bit too Brown for me and then I
met Emily the founder of glossier and
she said that she mixes the colors like
their paints obviously there's the whole
point of them being in this little like
paint tubes so then I started mixing
dusk with beam which is like the orange
one and it really just makes the perfect
shade it's a really lovely formula it's
quite a liquid blush it's not even cream
it's pretty much liquid I dab a little
bit on the back of my hand and then I
dab it on my cheeks I either use my
fingers or the Real Techniques contour
brush just to blend out they make your
cheeks look juicy and fresh and that
it's a really lovely blush I love the
packaging as well there are quite a few
highlighters that I've been loving I've
really been enjoying kind of liquid
creamy highlighters for the past year
but the one that I've used so many times
is Mac hush it looks like this it's one
of their cream color base look I've
almost finished mine I discovered this
through Nick Chapman from Pixie woo she
I went to an event with her she had the
most incredible highlight and she said
it was this and I'm pretty sure I wore
this on my wedding day so I already had
it and I just became obsessed
it looks quite pink in the packaging but
it's really not when you put it on I
tend to just swish my finger around and
then just dab it on the tops tops of my
cheekbones and it's so easy to use again
I always get compliments when I wear
this one really nifty little packaging
it's just so great another Mac product
when it comes to eyeshadows I have a
palette that I want to talk about but
really if I honestly tell you the
eyeshadows that I've been using almost
every day all year it's just my Mac quad
it's so easy I keep it in my little like
Muji draw on my vanity desk and it's got
the only four eyeshadows I really ever
need this one is all the glitters which
is just a really nice kind of light pink
shimmer that's quite an easy everyday
eyeshadow this one you know I sure don't
think that's Mac I think that is
Anastasia caramel eyeshadow but Mac do
one similar called texture which I think
has a bit of shimmer in it a nice like
matte orange orangie Brown that's Mac
cork
which is really good for under my eye or
defining the crease and then this is
wood wings which is a gorgeous eye
shadow for the evening like a shimmery
bronze and there's the only four
eyeshadows I will ever need but I had to
mention this palette because it came out
last year I think and it's by far the
best palette ever it's the naked
heat palette
the best Urban Decay Naked palette so
far it's got these gorgeous bronzy warm
Browns home shadows I use chaser this
one a lot these three I use a lot I kind
of like them already I never really tend
to go that dark with my shadows anymore
but I would and they're so easy to blend
out even if you feel like you put too
much on if you get a fluffy brush
sowings needs to blend it out I find
them really easy to use I never use the
brush that comes with it but packaging
is also better than the original Naked
palette I just thought that was a great
launch from last year I try brown
eyeliners a lot because I wear them
everyday just like on the top of my lash
line I find that some are too creamy
that they move around too much and some
are far too dark some are a little bit
too shimmery this one from Mac is the
best I've gone through like four of
these so far if they ever discontinued
this I will be gutted it's the modern
twist Kajal liner so it just twists up
you don't need sharpen it in
groundbreaker
it's not a completely matte Brown it has
got like a slight shimmer to it which i
think makes it look more subtle when
it's on but it's the perfect like medium
brown shade again I always recommend
this to people especially if they're
getting married and for my eyebrows the
pencil that I've been using the most is
the benefit precisely my brow pencil I
think in the shade 4 it's got a spoolie
brush on one end and then quite a waxy
pencil on the other and I just think
this is great I was also using my blink
clear brow gel for most of the year but
it gets dirty so quickly I started
buying the Max Factor one towards the
end and now I haven't got one of me to
get a new one it was actually really
hard to pick a mascara because I tend to
I get sent a lot of mascaras and I tend
to try it and if I like it I use it up
and then I rarely repurchase a mascara
because there's always one that I can
try and I have quite easy eyelashes so I
do get on with most mascaras but if I
have to think back to the ones that
really stood out to me
they're probably 3-1 I don't have on me
it was the Dior show pump and pump and
last it pumped and what else to do I
keep thinking pump and glow your
eyelashes definitely wouldn't glow pump
and show maybe I don't remember what
that one was called really loved it
hated the packaging it got really dirty
quickly that one was great though I
always
really love the Loreal paradise ecstatic
this is a great mascara and I wonder if
the brushes I think they are all quite
similar they're just like fluffy brushes
so that was a really good kind of
drugstore buy and then Charlotte Tilbury
legendary lashes I always tell people
about this one I hate her original
mascara it just kind of ran all over my
face but this one I really like
again oh this brush is a bit smaller
than the L'Oreal one but it's still
quite fluffy gives you really really
thick lashes and yeah this is probably
the best one I've tried for the past
year okay finally onto lip products and
you guys know I've been suffering from
sore lips for the past two years so I
definitely don't wear lipstick as much
as I used to I used to be so into my
like red liquid lipsticks and I just
haven't been up to wear them especially
in 2017 I had so many problems with my
lips so when I was wearing a lipstick on
like the good days if I could or if I
really had to for something I was
wearing Charlotte Tilbury pillow-talk
which is the lipstick that was launched
to go along with her very famous lip
liner I love this a lot of people say
that it's too gray toned I think is the
perfect nudey pink like like almost
finished lipstick I use this all the
time it's by far my absolute favorite
nude lipstick and I love the packaging
these are one of her matte revolution
lipsticks so they have a really nice
matte finish but they're not drying
they're comfortable on the lips I'm
wearing a different one today on my lips
the English Beauty one thing I also love
the glossy a bomb coms and this is the
original one and this is the coconut one
which is so good and again when I first
discovered glossy I wasn't into these at
all I was like just the lip balm I don't
really get it and then Anna described it
in one of her videos as a matte lip balm
so she was like it's great when you just
need some moisture but you don't want
like shiny Vaseline greasy lips or
anything like that and once I kind of
thought about it like that I was like
yes this is a matte lip balm I love it
and I just became obsessed and now I
always need one of these in my hair bag
the final lip product is a Revlon at
lipstick you guys know I worked with
them a lot last year so I got to
discover a lot of their products this is
one of their Ultra HD
lip colors and it's in the sand it comes
in this really easy to use like windup
stick and it's just a moisturizing nude
lipstick so if I don't want to wear a
matte
lipstick like the Charlotte Tilbury one
this was the nude that I went for a lot
and I really liked it and I don't have
any red lipstick favorites or in sort of
color because I couldn't really wear
them but the Charlotte Tilbury red
carpet red is still probably my favorite
red lipstick okay it says on my camera
20 minutes and I could probably edit
that down a bit so I think you did well
I know that I said from now on I'm gonna
do more kind of casual vloggy videos but
this one and then probably next week as
well I think I'm gonna do a beauty haul
these are like more sit-down II ones and
then I'll get back to the vlogs but I
really wanted to do my 2017 makeup and
skincare favorites because as I said
I've been loving watching these let me
know if you'd also like me to do like a
2017 favorite style items or like my
best fashion purchases anything like
that because I think that would be a
cool video as well and as always if you
have any other video requests please do
let me know just comment below on this
video so thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
