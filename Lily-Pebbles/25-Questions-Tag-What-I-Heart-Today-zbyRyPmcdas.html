questions tag I'm having a really like
relaxed day at home today packing for my
holiday tomorrow so please excuse what I
look like my hair is dirty but whatever
I just thought I wanted to do this video
because it's kind of more of a chatty
one where you can get to know me a bit
more I've been looking for tags to do
and a lot of them are a bit strange and
have weird questions and this one has a
couple of weird questions but most of
them I quite like so I thought I would
just do this one so I've got all the
questions written on my phone so excuse
me if I'm looking down a lot but yeah
I'm gonna get started so the first
question is do you have any pets yes we
have two pets a dog
she's a Tibetan Terrier and her name is
Dixie and a cat who is an American
Shorthair black cat and his name's Louie
and that's because my mom's allergic to
cats so got on with the short hair so he
doesn't mole to anything and neither
does my dog they're both kind of allergy
free animals and yeah and some people
think it's weird we have a cat and a dog
but they get on really well they sort of
wound each other up but they love each
other
number two name three things that
physically close to you this is a weird
one my handbag is right here my camera
boy is here this is a new one I've just
got it slope road bike for when I go
away and wash bag packing and that's a
class of John Lewis bag I just go number
three what's the weather like right now
it's raining
for a change it's always raining in
England but I'm going away tomorrow and
it's gonna be sunny so I'm going
tomorrow by the way I haven't really
said on here I'm going on a press trip
to write four grams of code at UK about
the trip so I'm going over three days
and I'm gonna talk about on my blog so
you can hear what about it then but yeah
I'm happy to go to the Sun because it's
horrible grain rainy here number four do
you drive if so have you crashed yes I
do drive I passed my test when I was
17 as you may have been 18 I definitely
started learning and I was 17 but I
passed first time I think I took a bit
longer with the lessons but then I
passed first time so that's kind of
better for me because then I have to
keep paying for a driving test and I
Drive a little Toyota Yaris which is a
little bit crap but it's twelve years
old and it's never had a problem so it's
lasted really well and so I like it
because it's just easy and I never have
to pay to get anything prepared
I haven't crashed touchwood I've never
had a crash I've had like some maybe
like I think I rolled into the back of
someone when I first passed when I was
driving my sister's car but literally it
was like a tap and they weren't crazy
I've heard moments where I've been
blocking a policeman car and they've
been getting hysterical but I've never
crashed so that's good
what time did you wake up this morning
um half seven actually and for a day off
I think that's quite impressive but I've
got so much to do today
so yeah it's only like 9 o'clock now and
I've been up for a couple of hours when
was the last time you showered
I showered this morning and I used my
locks to turn shower oil which is lovely
it's my favorite what was the last movie
you saw I went to the cinema on Sunday
night which was two nights ago with my
mum and saw friends with kids which was
quite funny it's the same makers as
bridesmaids in school like the same
people in there and it was really funny
actually it's kind of just an easy film
to watch I like this kind of films to me
my mum always go together
number eight what does your last text
message say well I'm all my friends so
I'm gonna check so remember some Zoe
London lip gloss telling me I'll be okay
on the plane because I told her I'm
nervous of flying so that's nice what's
your ringtone I have my friend on silent
all the time on vibrate
I hate ringtones they make me cringe so
much if I hear like the phone going off
or the fire if it gets put my phone in
silent and it rings I just like died
inside I don't know why I really have no
idea but I just hate and everyone looks
if it's quiet the worst thing is if
you're in a quiet room with people and
your phone rings I don't know why I hate
it so my friends is always on vibrating
I can
feel it in my bag or pocket or whatever
and nothing so urgent if I missed a call
they'll leave a message so I'm not
really a ringtone kind of person number
ten have you ever been to a different
country yes I've been to lots of
different countries and I'm really lucky
when I was younger we used to go over a
lot of holidays as a family a lot of
them are such too young to remember
which didn't mean but went to like the
Caribbean America France Australia and
now I were traveling in my getview it's
Thailand for a month Australia for a
month Fiji for a couple of weeks and
went to LA on the way back I've been
sort of Spain and holidays in the summer
I just kind of had been to loads of
places some of them I can't even really
remember but I think the best place I've
been to Australia Thailand Antigua I
remember now but quite a few places
right well travels I think oh I've been
to Hong Kong yeah um
do you like sushi i love sushi sushi is
like my favourite food with italian i'd
like being brought up on the italian
food so that's also my favourite but I
absolutely love sushi we have a really
nice place near my house that's proper
authentic sushi but it's cheap because
sushi can be really expensive but if you
found a good place so we get it all the
time I love it I love salmon avocado
rolls I love spicy tuna rolls I just
love everything it's delicious
and it doesn't feel like it's bad whew
doesn't it's not too filling that's why
I like you now we're 12 where do you buy
your groceries you can tell this is an
American tag um well so I'd still live
at home for those of you that don't know
so I don't do the shopping whoops but my
favourite supermarkets are my expenses
and which shows which makes me sound
like a really silly spoilt brat but
they're not necessarily the ones I was
shopping like I guess Tesco's as well
but if I had to pick the ones that I did
enjoy shopping it'll be most offensive
waitress they're just laid out nice
earnest much more of a pleasure to shop
there and I think obviously sometimes
it's too expensive there
so I think when I move out I'll probably
shop online because shopping in cases I
test kids just I just don't enjoy it so
yeah my suspense is my favorite number
13 have you ever taken medication to
help you fall asleep faster no maybe
only on a plane I think my mom gave me
half a sleeping pill once because I was
freaking out on the plane and it was a
night flight so just to get me sleep but
now that taking photos I just stay up
all night not sleeping now 14 how many
siblings do you have
I have two older sisters one is 31 I
think first two I always forget 31 or 32
and the other one is 34 so they're quite
a lot older than me 7 there's 7 years
between me and my middle sister and then
10 years to me and my older sister yes I
was a mistake my mom always says a nice
mistake but it's quite nice actually
when we were really little it was a bit
annoying because they sort of stuff to
go back clubbing together going out and
I was felt bit left out but then when I
got bit older it's actually really nice
to be able to hang out with them and
their friends and we get on really well
because there is such a big age gap
between us so yeah I quite like him and
I think it made me more of a mature
person it's all being around them and
their friends number 15 do you have a
desktop computer or a laptop IRA laptop
um seriously I have a MacBook Pro that I
got last year I had a Mac but before
that I had a MacBook before then and
then I got my pro and I love it
definitely an apple person I hate PCs
next question is how do you be turning
on your next birthday I'm gonna be 25 in
December which is quite exciting and
I've actually been talking recently with
my friend about what to do for my
birthday and I think I'm gonna like go
out for the whole day on the Saturday
before and have like a nice dinner with
all my friends and then I think we're
gonna go to the Spice Girls musical
because it's our in December and it's
something fun to do a little my
girlfriends cuz Spice Girls was
definitely my generation um so yeah I
probably just do something either I hate
making everyone come on spend loads of
money for my birthday
and I always get drunk too early and end
up leaving at 11 so I'm gonna do
something a bit more chilled this year
number 17 do you wear contacts or
glasses yes I wear glasses why don't
actually wear them but I should I
basically can't see out of my left eye I
mean I can but it's really blurry and
I've always had really bad eyes and I've
just never been able to wear my glasses
properly um let me get them out for you
I just hate glasses I feel like you can
see that the boxes and I feel like I'm
living my life through little boxes I
just hate it I don't want to get
contacts because then I'm gonna get used
to being able to see like that so I take
them out and go feel blind and it was at
the moment if I don't my glasses I can't
see I'm just not using my eyes properly
it's really annoying
I know these are my glasses these give
them a little clean they're tomforde
glasses so they are quite expensive and
they are nice but they still look weird
on me I just think glass is it really
weird on me so don't laugh but these are
my glasses
um so yeah I wear them I wear them what
I really have to do so driving at night
sometimes I feel like all I can see is
bright lights and that's a bit dangerous
so I put them on and if I've been
staring at your pizza for ages and I
feel like my eyes are getting a bit weak
I put them on but I never remember to
carry them around with me they're just a
bit of pain so in this big case so I was
quite heavy but when I remember I wear
my glasses
number 18 do you color your hair and I
didn't for ages when I was younger
mommy's always like she'd say I wasn't
allowed but I had really dry curly hair
so you guys didn't talk about it cuz I
don't think she really wants me to do it
but I think the last year I why had it
colored before then but only properly
but like last year and I got the ends
down a bit blonder and I'm probably
gonna get it redone soon as well so yeah
kind of colour are not my whole hair
just a bit 19 tell me something you're
planning to do today today I'm going to
pack I'm going to do washing I'm going
see my nephews and my cousins here from
Canada is coming over for lunch
and I'm going to pick up Rich's watch
from the watch shop because it's getting
fixed under strict instructions to do
that and must not forget when was the
last time you cried two nights ago
I was watching the film about the 7/7
bombings and I was crying a lot
I'm quite a crier with films and it's
not even actually when something sad
even people's like X Factor when I see
someone cry I cry but if they're not
crying I I think I'm okay but soon as I
see someone cry even if it's someone
someone I don't know I always cry so
yeah I was watching this film about 7/7
bombings in London and it was really sad
it actually made me feel really like sad
for like the whole day afterwards I felt
really anxious the next day and it was
all full but I like to like watch them
so I can learn about it I don't want to
just pretend it never happened and I
want to be able to tell my children
about it so it was really interesting
but very sad number 21 what is your
perfect pizza topping I always order
mushroom and pepperoni I don't know why
I'm not even a big mushroom fan but I
just like it on pizzas some guys
artichoke if they have it it's really
nice as well on a pizza
number 22 which do you prefer hamburgers
or cheeseburgers hamburgers because you
never know what sorts of cheese they're
using if it's like the plastic heat type
cheese I kind of like it
but if they use real cheese it goes a
bit curdled and lumpy sometimes like the
cheddar or I just hate that I'm not it's
weird I don't like melted cheese but
then sometimes I do like I can have a
toasted cheese sandwich but I think is
when it's melted cheese like with
something else I don't like it sometimes
tasted be like sick so I just stick to
the no cheese in my hamburgers 23 have
you ever had an all-nighter
oh I feel that if I said have you ever
had a one-nighter I was like that's a
very rude and have I ever had a
one-nighter probably probably think of
one right now if I have it was probably
either a uni
or unlike one of those wild teenage
holidays in Magaluf if I can't think of
one right now but I'm pretty sure I have
probably number 24
what is your eye color brown boring
Brown I wish my eyes were blue or green
I've always have but LeBron and in the
last question 25 can you taste the
difference between Pepsi and Coke yes I
don't drink either
I never really had fizzy drinks when I
was growing up so I'm not like obsessed
with them but I could definitely his
difference I do like Coke but I hate
Pepsi
I'm like it's so so much sweeter Pepsi
than coke I just can't stand it it
leaves this horrible feeling on your
teeth of like sugar and oh it's horrible
I said yes I could definitely taste the
difference soon Pepsi and Coke and
that's all the questions so I hope you
enjoyed that sort of getting to know me
a bit more sorry if it was a bit boring
and rambly but let me know if you like
these kind of tag videos and I'll try
and find some more to do thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
