on Friday the 9th of December and last
year for my birthday I did a video
called 28 where I chatted through 28
great things that happen throughout the
year
so I thought it would be nice to do the
same video again this year but 29 things
I can't believe I'm in my last year of
my twenties it's just crazy
growing up I was always younger than
everyone I had friends that were older
than me older siblings and I feel like
suddenly everyone's younger than me
whenever I ask someone their age they're
like 24 and it's kind of freaking me out
but apart from that I don't really mind
being 29 I'm excited for my 30th but
yeah last year in my twenties as I said
last year there's lots of not great
things that have happened to you but I
want to just focus on the good things
and a lot of these all work-related
mainly because the only way I can
remember anything that's happened in the
last year is by going through my diary
but also because it's more relevant to
you guys but I've written down in my
notebook 29 really great things and yeah
let's go through them for New Year's Eve
last year my friends and I got together
and we decided the fancy dress should be
famous couple's past present dead or
alive and rich and I decided to go as
Katy Perry and Russell Brown but rich
dressed as Katy Perry and I dressed as
Russell Brand and it was so funny we did
a video getting ready together I just
think we looked great and our friends
had no idea we were gonna kind of swap
and I'll be the man and Richard be the
woman and they loved it and it was so
good and we had such a fun Year's Eve in
January I went away with Richards family
it was actually the first family holiday
with his side of the family so it was
really nice we went skiing and I haven't
been skiing since I was really really
young and they're all really good at
skiing so I was very nervous but I did
enjoy it I mean there were times where I
definitely got stuck at the top of a
mountain and I hadn't absolute meltdown
apparently it happens to the best of us
it was very cozy for number three I
forgot to include my blogosphere
a magazine cover shoot it was such a fun
day shoot seen these photos I loved how
they came out and I also loved the
article I think it was such an
interesting read and I had a really fun
day so it's definitely a highlight from
the past year mine and Anna's beets chat
live tour
came back and we did it with Clarence
this time and it was so so great they
had like pop-up stores in London
Birmingham and Edinburgh and we hosted a
meet-up there and it was such a nice
vibe because we sat on a lot of stage
but it was really like informal Q&amp;amp;A and
you guys got to have like afternoon tea
and then look around the Clarins pop-up
and it felt so relaxed and it really
confirmed that I love meeting new guys
in that sort of way and it's always
really fun doing these things with Anna
so that was a really fun memory for me
and I loved working with Clarence on it
I took part in the Jessup's level one
photography course and since then I've
also done level two and I really enjoy
it it takes the whole day out of my
working day which is hard it's like a 10
til 4 course but so so worth it I just
feel really passionate about always
improving my skills I love photography I
get to like practice it enough because
like with what we do the camera is just
sitting there on a tripod now and it's
not really a creative kind of process
but I love just on the weekends like
taking my camera and taking photos I do
get really frustrated when I feel like I
don't know what I'm doing which is why I
wanted to do the level 1 and 2 course
and I do feel more confident now but
it's all about practice I have to keep
practicing so I don't forget it's so
fiddly but I would definitely recommend
the Jessup's photography course if you
want to improve your photography skills
there were people there with all
different cameras at all different
levels and it was such a nice little
black class as well we really got on
with everyone I went to Disneyland Paris
with my family and it was so nice
because we never really all go away
together because there's so many of us
and there's so many kids and everyone
wants to do different things but
everyone wants to go to Disneyland Paris
and it was it was so nice apart from
when we lost Bailey that was terrifying
but we found him and we had so much fun
on all the rides and atmosphere the kids
loved it and it's definitely a trip I'll
always remember I held my first ever
face book line and I'd never seen anyone
do a face book live but I'd seen that
this kind of setting had come up on my
page and it sounded really cool so I
managed to convince Anna to do it with
me she came over one night and we did
pizza party
so we ordered Domino's and then we set
up Facebook live and kind of sat there a
our pizza and chatted to you guys live
and we could see all your questions
coming in it was like a massive
adrenaline rush it was kind of crazy we
didn't know what we were
but it was really fun I think it lasted
like an hour and a half and afterwards
we were like whoa that was crazy so we
really loved doing that like I actually
haven't done one since I don't know why
like I just keep forgetting that it
exists but let me know if you want me to
do another Facebook live and yeah I
definitely will it was really fun and
then off the back of that I was sitting
at home one night and I got a tweet from
someone saying
Mark Zuckerberg has just mentioned you
in his annual keynote speech and I was
like what I don't understand and I
searched the internet and I finally
found an image of Mark Zuckerberg the
creator of Facebook on this huge stage
he does this annual keynote every year
and he's talking about Facebook live and
whilst he's talking a picture of me and
Ana doing our Facebook live pizza party
comes up on the screen with my username
Lilly Pebbles
I don't know because I never got video
footage whether he actually talked about
us or just came up on the screen but oh
my god that is like a career moment for
me just to even be acknowledged the fact
that he would have looked his
presentation and seen that image I must
have either been one of the first in my
community to do it or maybe it was just
good timing I have no idea why he chose
me or why whoever did the presentation
chose me but it was really exciting and
I felt really proud I went to New York
with Urban Decay and it was such a fun
trip I'm always really nervous to go to
things without Ana obviously now we live
apart it's happening more and more and I
need to get used to just kind of like
doing things by myself but it was so
nice because Emilia was on that trip
whoo I get on with really well and Lydia
who I think I met her for the first time
on this trip and we've become really
good friends so it was just a really
nice trip I loved going to New York I
got to spend some time with Keyshia
stayed out for a couple of extra days at
the end and we did a really fun like
photo shoot for the lipsticks just felt
like a really special like Urban Decay
event and I was really honored to be
invited on the trip and then pretty much
straight away I went on another press
trip and this was definitely one of the
best trips I had ever been on I went to
the South of France with chanel south of
France is somewhere I know really well
because I've been going my whole life we
were with such nice people Anna was
there Ruth was there and there's a
really nice journalist as well that we
really got on with we've got to see how
they make Chanel number five perfume and
we went to the Rose Fields where they
pick the rose petals we got to pick some
ourselves we saw how the whole process
was made
I just found it so interesting it was
like a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll
always remember and I made a really
special video of the trip so I can look
back on it if we haven't seen it our
Lincoln above but it was definitely one
of my favorite videos and it was such a
special trip Adam and I became digital
ambassadors for look good feel better
this year which is a charity that helps
women and teenagers deal with the side
effects of cancer they hold these
amazing workshops where they teach them
how to look after their skin and do
their makeup drawing their brows and
it's just really light hearted and the
women come away feeling so happy and
it's so enjoyable and one of the first
activities we did with look good feel
better was their swauk so it was a
charity sponsored walk it was meant to
be this like sunny walk along the fields
in the countryside it was pouring with
rain it was very muddy and slippery but
we did it and we raised lots of money
raised lots of awareness and since then
we've done so much with the charity soon
we're gonna be announcing how much money
we've actually raised for them this year
I've heard a sneak peak and I just can't
believe it I'm so happy and I'm honored
that I could be a part of it I went to
innocent festival with rich and his best
man his best friend Evo and then my like
best woman my best friend Hannah and it
was so nice for the four of us to be
together because you didn't get to do
that often and it's quite a new small
festival so it felt really like intimate
and we ate really good food we listened
to really good music I think mom has
gone and played there and it was just so
fun it was nice for the four of us to be
together like me and rich and our best
friends I went to the glamour Woman of
the Year awards and it was so exciting
to be invited because it's a pretty epic
event I went with manoeuvre doctor and a
few other bloggers and we sat on the
same table as Kourtney Kardashian but I
was just the reason that evening sticks
out of my memories just because it's an
it's a whole event a whole awards to
celebrate women who have done great
things who have been successful in their
career and that's definitely something
I'm really passionate about there's been
loads of great things this year and it
was hard to get the list down but some
reason that night sticks that was just a
really cool event that was really
excited to be a part and I really hope I
can go again next year
Anna and I went to LA again and we know
that our audience isn't necessarily at
VidCon it's definitely a younger
audience I think we go more for the
industry panels and to meet other
creators so we took it a bit less
seriously this year and thought yet
we'll do VidCon but let's make it more
of a la trip and we stayed out for a bit
longer beforehand and it was so fun we
were just both in like really good moods
and we did such like fun stuff we went
to the Late Late Show
James Corden chat show we did loads of
shopping loads of eating and then we
rented like a Jeep and drove down to
Anaheim for VidCon and that was so fun
that like a road trip but it was the
first time I driven an automatic car and
in America it was such a fun trip we
laughed so much and I'm so glad I vlogs
because there's such funny vlogs to look
back on in August I had my hen which is
my bachelorette party for those of you
on English I'd said to my friends like I
really don't need a big fast I feel like
hens get really out of hand I was like
I'm so happy with just a Saturday night
out but they're so lovely and they
really wanted to celebrate the fact that
I was getting married and it wasn't
crazy expensive but we did like a Friday
night dinner my sister's house they had
a good butler in the bath and them we
had these activities during the day on
Saturday we did like a silent disco and
The Shard I mean I can't even run
through everything we did so much it was
amazing better than I ever could have
imagined
they my friends know me so well and it
was quite a small group of people as
well as everyone knew each other and
gotten really well and I absolutely
loved it I will always remember my
henrique and then we had the gleam
summer party and it's so nice for me to
have the summer party and Christmas
party with gleam who are my management
agent because I don't have colleagues
that I have an office so any of these
get-togethers is like a time for us to
see like colleagues and people we work
with and it's so nice just to get
together and come to celebrate the
summer party was at this amazing house
we had like beautiful rooms
me and Hannah shared and it was a really
fun party I always said that I was gonna
do my own makeup on my wedding just
because I'm terrified of other people
doing my makeup but I didn't have ever
met anyone that's done it how I like it
but when the opportunity came up for Sam
Chapman to do my makeup for my wedding I
was like yes 100% not even gonna think
about it so I went to Sam's studio in
Norwich and we filmed some videos
together which was just a dream come
true
I've watched pic series channels since
launched at the beginning I've always
been such a huge fan obviously I didn't
got to get to know the girls in real
life and they're lovely
so to film together was just such a
dream and it was so enjoyable and then
Sam did my makeup my wedding makeup
trial and it was perfect I just left
being like yep that's perfect didn't
want to change anything about it she is
so great we celebrated being in our flat
for one whole year but we didn't really
celebrate because we kind of forgot but
August came around and it been a year
since we'd got off flat and moved in and
decorated and so much has changed in a
year I absolutely love our flat I love
where it is I love the feel of it and
love the decor it is very small though
and because I work from home I do feel
like I'm outgrowing it faster than I
would if I didn't work from home so I
don't know how long we'll be here for
but it's been so nice like making our
little home this is our first home this
is where we got engaged this is where we
got married and we'll probably be here
for another year and yeah I'm really
proud of like what we've created here I
went into Lamplighter London to meet
Chiara the owner and she told me a
little bit of calligraphy wasn't like a
full-on course we just had like an hour
together and she taught me the basics
and gave me some tips for my wedding and
that was kind of the beginning of my
love for calligraphy and after that I
went on to do some other courses I've
got an iPad pro and I practiced kind of
with the pen and it's just yeah it's
been one of those kind of hobbies I've
really enjoyed this year I don't kind of
sit down with a pen and paper and do
calligraphy all the time but it's
something I can apply to other things
and I definitely recommend trying a
calligraphy course if you haven't yet
it's really fun it's really relaxing and
yeah I really enjoyed getting into that
this year me enriched did an engagement
shoot now I've always made fun of people
who do engagement shoots I just think
they're so cringe and so cheesy but
actually once I thought about what the
point of them are it kind of made sense
like I think the whole point is that you
get to meet your photographer and you
get to practice and it's mainly for rich
because he's not used to taking photos
so I'm really glad we did it because
well we've got some really nice photos
out of it and also when the wedding came
around we only wanted to spend 20
minutes taking photos so Richard already
met a photographer he already knew like
how the whole posing thing worked we had
like four poses that we
he wanted to do and we smashed him we
got it done in like half an hour I did a
photo shoot for the InStyle project 13
Awards I was so excited to be nominated
for those awards and I actually won best
beauty blogger which was so exciting I
don't often win awards and and it's just
nice to know that someone's voting
someone thinks I'm good at what I'm
doing and the shoot itself was just
really fun it was quite different there
was like really interesting
photographers and I really liked how the
photos came out we've got married it
feels so weird to put this in like a
list because it's pretty epic compared
to everything else on this list but we
got married and it was such a dream day
I've never dreamt about my wedding I had
no idea what we wanted I was a sort of
person who said I can't believe how much
people spend on a wedding just for one
day we tried really hard to like
constantly remind ourselves that we
don't have to do what everyone else does
we could just do what we want and it
will be fine and we kept pushing back on
like wedding traditions and we really
did create the perfect day for us and we
were both so happy I would 100 Center
again I wouldn't change anything all the
money all the stress all the time all
the planning was definitely worth it it
was incredible and I had the best best
day after the wedding moon which went to
Soho farmhouse for a little mini moon at
that point we hadn't any thought about
what we were gonna do about a honeymoon
so he just wanted to get away for a few
days and it was really really nice I'd
been there before but rich hadn't and we
had like happen and we just did so much
relaxing and reminiscing about the
wedding and like looking at photos and
it was great we don't even go away that
often together so it was really nice
we're actually now booked to go on our
honeymoon to South Africa at the end of
Feb which I'm so so excited about
straight after the mini moon I actually
had to come back a day early but it was
so worth it because I had a video shoot
with bobbi brown herself I'd been
speaking to Bobby Brown cosmetics for a
while on how we could work together it's
a brand I really like and usually with
these things when they offer up kind of
an ambassador or someone to film with
I'm always a bit worried because I think
it can come across a bit awkward and
forced but I really wanted a film with
Bobby because it's Bobby Brown and
thankfully she was so great on camera we
both felt so relaxed it's just like
chatting to a friend you guys gave such
good feedback on the video so I was so
happy and it was definitely worth coming
back from my mini moon early it was such
a fun video to film it October
to Dorset with my friends it's funny
because the year before we went away
from my friend Rob's birthday and this
year this trip happened to fall on his
birthday again it's turn into some kind
of tradition but we went to Dorset and
we got this huge house right by the sea
and it was so nice I had like a cinema
room in it I had a hot tub and we were
all just like full-on let's have fun and
mode and we did it all we did the
jacuzzi did cinema we went for walks we
went to a place called the pig for lunch
it was such a nice trip and I love it
when our six go away because it's always
so fun one of the other events that Ana
and I put on with look good feel better
was an afternoon tea at Liberty and it's
something we've been talking about for
at least a year we said how nice would
it be if we could have an afternoon tea
with our viewers and look good feel
better have a really good relationship
with Liberty so we've been chatting
about it for so long and finally we made
it happen the room was beautiful the tea
was great we did like a little quick Q&amp;amp;A
and then walked around the room and
chatted to everyone loads of you came
with friends or with mums and then
there's like an epic goodie bag at the
end it was such a fun event probably one
of my favorite like meetup events ana
and I went on a press trip with Olympus
and I really liked it because it was
very different like a beauty trip
because it was with a camera brand and
you guys know I love geeking out about
cameras actually did a review video when
I came back I loved learning about
cameras and the whole trip like
encouraged us to go and take photos so
it was really nice but also we met
Carrie and Reem on that trip I'd met
Carrie a few times but we really got to
know her and Reem and they're both so
nice and we get on really well as like a
little foursome we're all very similar
and it was it was like a really nice
bonding trip and we've stayed really
close ever since one of the most recent
things we've done was look good feel
better is launched the Lilly and Anna
jumpers and this is seriously something
we've been working on for a year I can't
believe how long things can take
sometimes but we created some jumpers we
put on one of them hashtag no makeup day
and the other one Landru for life we've
never sold anything before so we had no
idea how they would do this time round
we were giving 100% of the profits to
look good feel better so it's all for
charity we didn't make anything out of
them and they sold out in two hours well
all the mediums and large sold out in
two hours there was like a bit of a mix
with the sizing so we have added more
stock it's really not something we had
planned to do at all we did we thought
this would be a one-off so we've added
more stock we've added two extra sizes
so like an extra large and an extra
extra-large and to be honest they might
be out when this video goes up best
thing to do is follow me on Twitter or
snapchat or Instagram because we're
gonna be announcing it on our social
media as soon as the news comes but it
was just so fun thank you guys so much
for your support and the jumpers I have
like a little app every time someone
bought one I was like oh my god this is
crazy so we've come up to 29 at the
final great thing that happened this
year and last year the 28th thing was
that my older sister Carly was pregnant
I can't believe Sora and my nephew
wasn't even here then he is so cute I
literally love him to pieces so it seems
only right to tell you for the 29th
great thing don't get excited
I'm not pregnant my sister Jojo is
having another baby I can't believe I'm
gonna have another niece or nephew
Carly's got two kids JoJo's got two and
now another one on the way so I'm gonna
be an auntie for the fifth time I can't
wait I love babies
also I feel like the more there are the
more likely one of them is gonna think
I'm the best auntie I'm pretty sure I'm
in there with honey so yeah really
exciting Jodi is pregnant and a really
nice happy way to end this video so I
hope you guys have enjoyed hearing my 29
