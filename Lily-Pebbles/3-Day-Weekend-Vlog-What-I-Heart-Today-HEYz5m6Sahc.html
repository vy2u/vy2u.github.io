weekend so I thought I'd try and do some
vlogging and I sort of see how it comes
out and if it's alright then I'll put it
up as like a weekend vlog I quite like
watching vlogs so I thought those of you
who are quite noisy like me might want
to see what I'm up to see you this
weekend however actually got that much
planned I'm up quite early now on
Saturday morning because the one thing
we do have planned is that rich and
which is my boyfriend by the way rich in
his friend are going zorbing I actually
bought it for him as a present and if
you don't know his all beans where you
go and like one of those massive sort of
clear hamster wheel things and roll down
a big hill it's really crazy Beni where
we're going there just like in Surrey so
it's maybe like an hour away so I'm up
quite early and yeah we're just waiting
for Rich's friend nivo to turn up and
then we're gonna go so I'll do some
filming along the way and show you them
zorbing as well just happy having a cup
of tea and panna shockula before we go

pouring with rain

gonna stop eyes it might be
and I feel ready carsick now this is
neither looking forward to solving
my way rich driving a film when there's
orbit we're here we're in like this
massive woods place that's pretty random
you nervous
you're gonna be in a hamster wheel house
shits really muddy

how was it I heard you guys screaming
like hey why are you gonna do the water
one do you see how wet the girls are
after they were literally drenched does
it make you feel sick if you heard that
but they do again we're gonna do the one
where they fill the pod with water and
they didn't bring any swimming stuff so
they're going to do it in their
underwear taking place today let me jump
into the pod in their little boxes
Isabella huh the worst I bet they all
laughed
so I'm now designated driver home with
these two in the back trying to dry off
so going home now and I'll film when I'm

the woods I'm in a fairy tale no it's a
flare apparently get this dog food
sniffing a bad high hilarious biggest
dog ever this is my lunch

dark with newly which is like this green
stuff and like plum sauce and oyster
sauce on a flatbread
cannelloni

home now absolutely shattered I actually
don't know why I'm so tired I think it's
just cuz I woke up but like eight so I'm
quite tired and don't know what we're
doing actually what just gotta shower
cuz it's all kind of grubby from zorbing
and then you might go there's like a
fair near my house we might go to that
my sister and she's got two kids so I
might see them and yeah so I've just
spent the last five hours at home on the
sofa watching We Need to Talk About
Kevin the weather it's all feels like a
massive storm so I just watched that
film and I'm really tired and I'm
actually in a really bad gunky mood
which is a bit annoying especially when
you're like vlogging so I'm going around
my sisters now and I'm gonna see my
nephew and my niece so hopefully they'll
show me cheer me up and then I go to out
for dinner we're going to what's it
called again
Red Dog saloon Red Dog saloon which is
one of the restaurants where they film
with man versus food so I need to build
up an appetite for that
- but it's like massive burgers at VIPs
