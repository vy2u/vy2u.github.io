to be showing you for makeup looks now
these are intended for university or
college but you can obviously apply them
and wear them even if you don't go to
uni so there's four looks the club the
hangover fancy dress and the lecture so
let's start with the first look which is
this one and I'm going to rewind to
wearing no makeup ok look number one is
the club and this is probably the most
full-on heavy look out of all of the
four so this is quite a nice look for a
club night and it's also a look that I
wore in a passive log and all of you
seriously like most of you requested
makeup tutorial of that look I'm going
to start by using the georgia marnie
luminous silk foundation I couldn't find
a drugstore toner for this at the moment
it's basically a foundation that has no
SPF in it when I look back all my uni
photos I literally had a flash back
white ghost face in all of their like
clubbing photos so if I'd known men I
would have used something like this I'm
just taking a small pump and putting
that all over my face and then blending
it out using a buffing brush then for
concealer I'm using the Revlon Colorstay
foundation and I might use a bit of the
Make Up For Ever full cover concealer
just on any blemishes because this is
waterproof so it will last well
throughout the evening now the base is
done I'm going to bronze highlight and
blush I'm going to bronze with the soap
&amp;amp; Glory solar powder bronzer and I'm
going to highlight with the Mac soft and
gentle which is really nice and shimmery
and I'm going to use the gosh flower
power blusher which is really nice and
very affordable just before I do the
eyes I'm just going to start on my brows
using the Anastasia brow Wiz and a blink
clear brow gel I talked about this eye
pencil more in one of the later looks so
keep watching to hear about that ok so
now onto the eyes and I think the reason
you guys like my look in that vlog is
because of this eye shadow and it's by
NARS it's relatively new it's one of
their dual intensity eyeshadows and it's
Indian it's really really pretty it
looks like this and you can apply it dry
or wet I'm going to apply it wet because
it looks really amazing and how I'm
going to do that is I'm going to take a
brush take my Urban Decay setting spray
and just spray the brush very lightly
then just taking a bit on my brush
you'll see how amazing this is when it
applies there's no need to use primer
you don't need to these eyeshadows do
not go anywhere this shade is a really
pretty kind of silvery taupe I'm then
going to take my NYC best of Broadway
palette and take this brown shade here
and just use that to blend into
outer corner and take some of that brown
underneath the eye just to intensify the
look a little bit more I'm going to take
this black eyeliner from Mac and this is
their black brilliance it's a fluid line
eye pencil and this is new it's like
they're gel eyeliner but in pencil form
which is much easier to use I'm just
going to put it right into the lashes
just on the outer corners I mainly use
Maybelline the falsies mascara just to
give really full lashes to add even a
bigger look for the eyes I'm going to
use a lower lash mascara this is the
Clinique one okay so finally the lips
and because there's quite a lot going on
in the eyes I'm just going to have a
nude lip and I'm going to use the Rimmel
Notting Hill nude lipstick and the
Charlotte Tilbury Bardot beige lip gloss
on top okay so that's look one the club
so look to is the hangover and I think
it's applies to you whether you drink or
you don't drink because if you've been
out the night before and you're just
really tired then you feel hungover
either way I know when I'm hungover and
I've had a late night the last thing I
want to do is spend ages on my makeup so
this is a very simple routine and I
think most products I'm using are
drugstore the first thing I like to do
is use a facial mist and this one is
from chordally but you can use any one
you like and it's nice and just kind of
wakes you up then it's very important to
moisturize your skin use whatever
moisturizer you like but keep your skin
hydrated because it's likely it will be
very dehydrated I'd recommend using a BB
cream or tinted moisturizer as it will
keep the skin hydrated it's really light
and easy to use you can just use your
fingers and it feels light and nice on
the skin as well it doesn't feel too
heavy I would recommend the doctor yard
BB cream it's really affordable really
nice this isn't the right shade for me
at the moment because I have a bit of a
tan so I'm going to use my Laura Mercier
oil-free tinted moisturizer so I'm just
going to use my fingers to work this
into the skin it doesn't take too long
and it just gives a nice light coverage
if you do want a slightly more full
coverage and I'd recommend using a
buffing brush just to buff it into the
skin once you've done the base you can
just use a small amount of concealer
where you need the extra coverage and
I'm going to use the Revlon Colorstay
which is really again hydrating and
moisturizing all these products are very
hydrating I think that's what you need
after a big night out I'm just going to
place it under the eyes around the nose
and on the chin and then just blend it
out I find if you wanted a little bit
extra coverage then instead of blending
just tap it and it kind of doesn't
disperse the product as much I'm then
going to use just a bit of funder
because I always like to work with
bronzer and this is the
open glory solo powder which is my
favorite as you know I'm just going to
put that all over I'm not doing any sort
of contouring or anything and then for
blusher something really natural this is
the Max Factor miracle touch creamy
blush in soft pink and you can just use
your finger for this and it makes your
cheeks that really plump and moisturized
just taking a bit on my finger like this
and then just tapping it onto the apples
of my cheeks I'm not going to fill in my
brows because I haven't really got time
I'm just going to use a clear brow gel
to run through them to make sure they
stay in place for my eyes I'm just going
to use a one product does all and this
is from Kiko it's their long-lasting
stick eyeshadow so it's just a cream
eyeshadow in a stick form you just put
it on and blend it out and it's done
it's so easy and it's really nice bronze
shade so I just put that all over the
lid and then just use my finger to blend
out the edges I'm also going to take
that slightly underneath the eyes
there's nothing too intense but it just
adds a little something there to kind of
smooth out the eyelid it looks kind of
pretty but nothing drastic I'm also
going to use a nude eyeliner and the
inner part of my eye and this is really
good just to wake up your eyes and get
rid of that tired look you can sometimes
get quite red eyes when you're tired so
this is a good way to neutralize the red
I'm only going to put on lightly because
I think if you put this on too hard it
can look a little bit strange before I
do my mascara I'm actually going to curl
my lashes and this is another way to
waken up your eyes and get rid of that
tired look and from my lashes I'm going
to use my favorite drugstore mascara
which is Maybelline the rocket finally
on my lips when you're hungover I think
you just want to wear nothing or a lip
balm but this is a nice kind of
in-between it's the Revlon lip butters
and they're kind of like tinted lip
balms so I'm just going to put a little
bit of that onto my finger and then just
Pat it onto my lips this one is in very
smoothy which is my favorite kind of
everyday shade so that's look to the
hangover look very kind of hydrating
moisturizing but very simple no fancy
eyeliner or crazy blush contouring this
was pretty much my go-to look everyday
uni
okay look three is the fancy dress and
you will without a doubt have so many
fancy dress parties by the end of first
year you're going to be sick of it I
think at first you want to kind of go
all out and have a wacky crazy like
really thought through outfit but by the
end of it you're like what is the
cheapest and quickest way for me to do
fantasy dress so although this isn't the
most crazy idea it's the easiest
quickest and definitely the cheapest I
bought these glasses from Camden
I'll cook for about two pounds I vaulted
it down from five I did quite well and
I'm gonna be doing a Where's Wally
obviously I would be wearing a red and
white stripe top if I had one I wore one
at uni I did where's wally a lot so I'll
put a photo here of when me and rich
dressed up as Where's Wally so I've
already done my base and for that I used
the l'oreal true match foundation and
the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer I also put on a little bit of
blush and I used a really long lasting
one so it will last throughout the
evening and I use the Clinique cheek pop
in peach pop okay so first let's start
with the eyes and I'm just going to
create a really kind of nice neutral
base with the Mac Paint Pot and bear
study this is really easy to apply and
it just adds something on the lid I
don't really like to keep my lids bare
Mac Paint Pots do crease on some people
but my tip would be to put a tiny little
bit on I think if you overdo it that's
when it creases okay now I'm going to do
black liquid liner and for this I'm
going to use the DHC one just because
this is new to me and I just bought it I
want to kind of give it a go but you can
use any black liner that you like Revlon
do a good one or if you want a really
high-end luxury one I love the Tom Ford
one this has got quite a short little
nib to it so I reckon this is for
experienced eyeliner users but I'm going
to give it a go I'm going to create
slightly thicker line than I normally do
just because I think for a Where's Wally
look I want thick black eyeliner red
lips freckles I kind of want to go all
out you don't want to be too subtle for
fancy-dress because then no one will
really get who you are okay I'm kind of
happy with that shape it's quite
different to how I normally do my black
liner but it was kind of a mistake that
I quite liked it goes kind of like that
and then up and thicker out at the edge
so I'm going to try and do that on the
other side my black eyeliner tip is just
to keep looking forward to compare how
the two are okay after a bit of
adjusting here and there I think I've
got them kind of equal so I'm going to
leave it there definitely know when to
stop if you keep going then it will just
end up all over your face I'm going to
add a lot of mascara as well and for
this I'm going to use Clinique
high-impact extreme volume because I
know for me is the most kind of impact
mascara that I have ok mascara done and
now the most important part the freckles
and I think Topshop have a freckle
pencil specifically for drawing on
freckles but I couldn't find it anywhere
I'm not sure if it's kind of been and
gone or hasn't come out yeah I've seen
it somewhere online so instead I'm just
going to use a L'Oreal Brown eyeliner
you can use any brand eyeliner you have
to make the freckles I'm just going to
press twist and take off and I'm going
to
quite like because you can always add
but you can't really take away now I'm
not trying to be subtle this is fancy
dress so you want people to think you've
drawn them on you don't want them to
look like natural freckles okay I have a
lot of freckles there I'm going to stop
I here then looks quite good
finally a red lip I don't know why
Where's Wally doesn't my red lips but
whenever we dressed up as worth Wally we
always wore red lips I think because it
went with the red stripes it goes with
the black eyeliner and the freckles it
just looks really cool I'm going to use
the Sephora lip cream that you guys
always compliment me on when I wear it
in videos so now you'll see it in action
and I'll show you how I apply these
because they are very intense so I think
there is quite a specific way to apply
it first thing I do is take off the
excess that's on the brush you don't
want too much on there and then I start
with the bottom lip once I've done the
bottom lip I don't press my lips
together and that really helps guide the
top lip and anymore the bottom lip that
you need to do and those are the lips
done then all you need are your Where's
Wally glasses and there you have it
Where's Wally or mrs. Where's Wally
okay look number four and this is the
lecture now if you have an early-morning
lecture referred to look to the hangover
because that's something you'll probably
be able to do in a rush but I'm going to
pretend this lecture is in the afternoon
and I remember I kind of wanted to look
nice the lectures had a bit of time to
get ready if it was an afternoon one so
this is kind of going to be an everyday
makeup look but a little bit more
experimental I've already done my
foundation concealer I used the Revlon
nearly naked foundation and I use the
NARS creamy radiant concealer which is
just one of my favorites it's really
moisturizing and easy to use to bronze
and sculpt the skin slightly I'm going
to be using the sculpting bronzer
palette from Kiko it has a nice light
bronze darker bronze and a highlighting
shade as well I'm going to start by
using quite a large brush and then just
use it like a normal bronzer and then
I'll go in and do a bit of contouring
this just adds a bit more definition and
gives a nice shape to the face then with
another small brush I'm going to take
the highlight shade and just pop it on
the tops of my cheekbones this is a
really pretty highlight shade for
blusher I'm going to be using this one
from NYX or NYX I'm never sure what it's
called and this is in peach it's just a
really kind of you can hardly see it
it's very subtle but pretty before I
start on my eyes I'm just gonna tidy up
my eyebrows a little bit and for this
I'm going to use the Anastasia brow Wiz
this is really nice because it has a
really small spoolie on one end and then
a very fine pencil on the other so it's
really easy just to fill in the few
hairs you're missing I don't need to do
much to my brows but when I do want to
do something this one's really easy to
use so I'm just going to brush the brows
upwards because that's where my natural
hairs go and then fill in the bits that
I need filling in once I put them in I'm
just going to use a clear brow gel to
set them in place okay now onto the eyes
and I'm going to go for a pinky purple
theme and for that I'm going to use the
L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow in amber
rush this is a really nice pinky shade
is a bit like Mac all the glitters I'm
just taking that all over the lid it's
really pretty and reflective I'm also
going to take a small eyeshadow brush
and use the bronzer shade from the Kiko
palette just underneath the eye to add a
little bit of definition instead of
using a normal Brown eyeliner that I
would normally use I'm going to use a
slightly purple one instead this one is
from Charlotte Tilbury and it's
Elizabeth violet it's a really soft
pencil so I'm just going to line the
upper lash line and then smudge it out
slightly and it should give a really
nice kind of purpley smokey effect so as
you can see I've done quite a thick line
but then I blended it out and I think
it's kind of nice and smoky for my
mascara I'm going to use this
Seeler mile-high lashes I can never say
this mascara is really nice and
lengthening and volumizing and I really
like it very little effort is required
with this mascara okay and then finally
for lips I wanted something soft and
pink I'm going to be mixing two of the
Tanya burr lip glosses picnic in the
park is slightly too pink for this look
and afternoon tea is slightly too beige
so I'm going to mix them together I
think it will make a really nice combo
these lip glosses are really pigmented
so if you want something a little bit
softer I'd recommend dabbing it in with
your finger and that's the finished look
so I hope you enjoyed this video please
give it a thumbs up if you did I hope
you've got some good makeup ideas for
your first week at uni and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
