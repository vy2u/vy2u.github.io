a little bit techie and you guys know I
love my tech things I've always been
obsessed with buying cameras and
computers since I was like a teenager
and now that I do it as a job I'm even
more obsessed and I like to keep you
guys up to date with tech accessories
that I'm liking cameras that I'm using
things like that so for today's video
I'm going to talk through five
accessories I'm currently loving they're
not necessarily all-time favorites
they're just things I'm using at the
moment and would like to try to you guys
about I'm gonna start with the thing I
have bought most recently and I am
obsessed with it my friend SJ
recommended this to me which is
hilarious because she's probably my
least techie friend but she was like you
need this and I bought it straight away
I didn't need much convincing it's the
iPhone smart battery case my iPhone
battery is always dying and it's
ridiculous they shouldn't need to sell
these things they should just make
phones that battery lasts but they don't
last and especially if you're using
snapchat the battery dies so quickly so
I'm always carrying around an external
charger but they can be quite bulky I
feel like I'm always recharging them and
I forget to recharge them and then I'm
just carrying around a dead battery they
drive me mad the wire I've got to use my
wire from my main lead so the idea of
this is that it's a case that goes into
the back of your phone you can all this
for now I'll talk to you about this in a
minute
it's the case it goes on to back of your
phone and it is quite ugly the guy in
the Apple store was like this is the
ugliest thing Apple had ever made him
I'm ashamed
he was actually quite hilarious but it's
not that bad it's basically got this
little like growth on the back there it
comes in white or grey not the best
selection ever it definitely makes your
phone a little bit bulkier and a little
bit heavier but this is genius the
reason I love this battery pack you
leave on your phone all the time and
when you charge your phone it charges
the case as well so you don't need to
charge the case separately it basically
gives the case 100% battery charge so
when you scroll down on your phone let
me show you it tells you how much the
case has battery and how much the phone
so it's now midday and my case has
reached 50 percent so it uses all the
batteries in the case first and then
goes to your phone so it doesn't really
start using my phone battery until the
afternoon and that is life-changing
because normally why now I would have to
charge my phones it would have run out
of battery it was expensive it was 79
pounds but I really feel like this is
worth it because it's changed my life in
terms of use
my phone and not feeling I'm gonna run
out battery or from when I go out in the
evening I'm always worried that my
phone's gonna die and I'm not gonna have
to call rich or call a cab or get home
or whatever so it just makes me feel
more secure it says that it gives 18
hours of internet extra than you
wouldn't normally have it is amazing I'm
so impressed I'm really glad I got it
and although it's bulkier the fact that
I don't have to carry on another charger
means that there'll be freed up space in
my handbag anyway so now I'm holding my
phone I'm also talk to you about this
which is on the back of my phone so many
people asking about this whenever I go
anywhere people always say what is that
on your phone and I think I've mentioned
it in a video before it's an I ring and
my sister bought it for me five
birthdays she bought it back from Hong
Kong where apparently it's all the Krays
there and when she first gave it to me I
was really not like or don't know if I'm
gonna put that on my phone she sold it
to me as like oh you can like you know
hold your phone like this you don't drop
it and like use it as a ring like this
and I was like what is the point of that
that it's just seems so weird but if you
use it correctly this thing again is
life-changing I love it I use it every
single day it sticks onto the back of
your phone and you can re stick it you
can't do it that many times it's very
very tough though it has never fallen
off but I've changed my case around
three times and it's been fine - Rhys
sticky just have to keep it clean so it
lips on the back of my phone wouldn't
say it was particularly pretty you can
get different colours I've just got
white I'd recommend getting the same
colour as your case and it's a metal
ring that pulls out and turns 360
degrees I use this for so many different
things I use it as a stand when I'm
watching videos because I'm always
watching videos and I can just pop my
phone up when I'm doing my skincare
routine or anything I don't have to lean
it and worry about it falling it just
sits there you can do it either way
however you want I also use it when I'm
lying in bed or on the side and I don't
want my phone to drop and you can
literally just put it around your finger
and you can hold it anyway without
dropping the phone you know in your line
and bed looking at your phone and you
drop up in your face I mean that never
happens coz I just have it round my
finger I also find that really useful
when I'm taking photos and selfies
because phone could be quite hard to get
your hand around in like funny angles so
I just put my finger in there and I
don't have to worry about holding on to
the phone so saying when I'm doing
things when walking around and getting
my keys at my back I can just hold on to
the ring
don't have to feel like I've got grip on
the whole phone I really do find myself
using it all the time and I know
probably looks strange but you just get
used to it and it just makes things so
much easier phones are getting bigger
and bigger and I feel like think things
like accessories like this just make
hold your phone and using your phone
typing on my phone I can't imagine
having to put my hand around the whole
phone and type anymore because I just
put my finger in there and type like
that and it's so secure and easy I
absolutely love it I think you can get
these on Amazon so I'm going to put
loads of links for all the products I'm
talking about below the next things I'm
going to talk about headphones and this
is from a brand called
studio I'm pretty sure it is Swedish it
comes in this really cool case and
they're basically wireless headphones
first off they look very sleek the ones
I have a white rose gold they come in
this little case and they also come with
the charger so you charge the headphone
and it gives you eight hours of
listening time and I think the distance
is about 10 meters from your phone or
computer whatever you're using so they
look like this and I just love that you
don't have to connect them so you can
put them around your head and then put
them in your ears that one's wrong way
around they're very comfortable to wear
I mean that looks a bit ridiculous right
now but for me like having to have my
headphones plugged into my phone and
then in my handbag wires everywhere is
so annoying so this is so easy I do feel
like you could use them quite easily but
they're so thin and stylish and really
good sound quality as well you can give
it a quick 10 minute charge just to get
a bit of battery but for a full charge
it takes about 120 minutes and these
aren't cheap they're 69 pounds but they
actually gave me a discount code to give
you guys this isn't sponsored I swear
but they said if you do mention it
here's a discount code I obviously want
you guys to be able to benefit from
discounts so if you use the code Lily
pebbles you can get 15% off but I'll put
all the information below so yeah it was
really cool there's a little volume
thing on there as well I also really
liked pouch that they come in because
headphones always get so tangled so I
just keep them in this little pouch on
my handbag and it makes sure keeps them
untangled you may have already seen this
if you watch my New York vlogs the next
one it's a camera bag and I've been
searching for years for the perfect
camera bag and a company called owner
bags actually got in touch with me and
it was exactly what I was looking for
they do amazing leather bags but what I
wanted is something that kind of could
be a handbag as well that looked like a
handbag because the bag I have from
before from Amazon is just so ugly it's
such a camera bag that I never took my
big
right out because I didn't want to use
that bag so this is the Palmer this is
one of the owner bags and I've got the
black so it's black with gold hardware
and it just looks like a hand bag
I mean it's so pretty it unlocks like
this but then it's not a hand bag
because it's completely setup for a
camera so as you can see it has two
sections in there this divider can be
moved either side if you want to make
one side bigger than the other I put my
camera in one side and then I can either
put a lens in the other or you can put
accessories or you can use this as your
handbag and use your camera on one side
and then your purse your phone your
money or keys everything on the other
side and that's what I've been doing a
lot also rich has been using this bag so
he like will take my camera and techie
bit and I'll have my handbag and he
really likes wearing this as well it's
not particularly girly but there are so
many different styles on the owner
website so definitely check that out I
think there's a European website and an
American one and they they're not cheap
they're proper leather bags and really
well-made really good quality I think
was about $300 mm how much is it $329
349 euros so that kind of gives you an
idea there's loads of useful pockets one
at the back and then another one at the
front here I just love it it's
completely changed things for me because
now I can take my camera out about I can
make cooler videos and take photos and I
don't feel restricted and I'm not
worried about if it rains my camera's
going to get wet it's completely
protected in here it's all padded
comfortable to wear I absolutely love it
I'm so happy
okay finally this is probably the only
thing in this video that's kind of aimed
at bloggers and youtubers but it's an
external hard drive although I do think
that people should just have one but
maybe not this one because it's quite
expensive this is the LaCie hard drive I
think it's called the LaCie rugged and I
used to have the one that connected with
USB but now I've got a thunderbolt one
because the wire is already attached
which is genius I used to always lose
the wire it would always come out so
this is a attached and it goes into a
computer and then it wraps around its
really easy but the point of a hard
drive for me is where I store all my
videos and photos because computer these
days are getting smaller and smaller and
there's just not much space to store
things and it really slows down your
computer also it's not really safe you
never know what's going to happen to
your computer so I even think if you
don't do internet kind of computer stuff
as your job I think it's quite important
to have a hard drive I know
my mom and sisters have so many photos
and if you just keep them on a hard
drive and folders then they're safe and
although DVDs and CDs are all kind of
dying I feel like a hard drive they'll
always be ruined by hard drives so you'd
have to worry about them getting
scratched or anything like that and
these ones are really durable you can
drop them they're really tough and the
speed is really fast that's why they're
so expensive I've got a 2 terabyte which
is huge you can get one terabyte or 2
terabyte and I'm pretty sure it's about
180 pounds but for me it's worth it for
work but even if you get in a different
brand hard drives are amazing I feel
like more people need to understand how
to use them it's just a folder on your
desktop you just drag things into it
eject it properly and you can keep
everything safe so those are my five
current tech favorites and I hope you
guys found this interesting I know it's
a little bit different but I'm really
passionate about techy things so please
let me know if you have any
recommendations for any of these kind of
things my new case is making me so happy
I just love having battery all the time
so this is definitely my favorite from
everything thank you so much for
watching this video guys and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
