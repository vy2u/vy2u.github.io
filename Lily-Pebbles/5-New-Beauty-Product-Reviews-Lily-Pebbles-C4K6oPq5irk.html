realized that we had the same with video
coming up because we just have the same
brain but to make things better for you
guys I made sure that in my video
there's going to be completely different
products than Anna spoke about in hers
some of you tweeted me asking for a
review of the wire sell foundation so if
you do want to see that i'll link anna's
video down below because she reviewed
that foundation and we pretty much have
the same thoughts on it for this video
i'm gonna be doing five reviews of five
new beauty launches and at this time of
year there's so much exciting stuff
coming out and i thought would be
helpful for you guys if I gave you sort
of the rundown and my thoughts on them
let's start with the new foundation and
this is from bareMinerals it's their
first liquid foundation and it's called
bare skin look at this fancy box it has
the foundation and a brush this is out
now and it's 26 pounds it also comes in
20 shades was quite a good range from
dark to light it's meant to be a mineral
foundation and serum mixed it's got
non-chemical SPF in it and it's meant to
be hypoallergenic instead of having a
water base this is actually a coconut
base and it's also got bitumen C in it
so they're quite hot on their
ingredients let me show you what it
looks like it looks like this and it
says you have to shake it up first and
when they say shake it up they really
mean it it's not like the vital Lumia
aqua from Chanel you really have to like
to properly shake it really vigorously
alloys it's just kind of really weird
watery oily formula they've also created
a new brush to go with this foundation
and it looks like this and it has a
little hole in the middle
it's very strange so let me tell you
what I thought with the foundation I
personally don't love it
it's a very strange kind of texture I
found it to be little too oily and
greasy for my skin I am wearing it today
as you can see it I haven't powdered and
it is quite kind of glowy which is nice
because I've got quite dry skin but for
anyone who doesn't have jollity hydrated
skin I think this is gonna be far too
greasy oily and shiny I didn't like the
brush at all I felt like the foundation
just disappeared into the bristles and I
couldn't actually get much on my skin
and when I used my hands instead I felt
like I could get a much better idea of
the coverage I wanted they say use a few
drops in this but really that kind of
gives you no coverage at all it's quite
a nice size the brush but I just found
it didn't work the tool definitely
wasn't as good as my Real Techniques
buffing brush when I use my hands I
preferred the foundation but I still had
that kind of greasy oily slippy feeling
and it does
feel that nice on the skin I'd say it
gives a light to medium coverage you can
build it up but again that adds to the
kind of grease eNOS so for me this is
not really a winner I won't be using
this but it might work for some people
with dry skin or maybe if you're just
really into mineral foundation and good
ingredients the next new launch is from
Real Techniques Real Techniques is a
brush brand that was started by pixie
row Sam and Nick and they have a limited
edition set coming out in October this
set includes five brushes three of which
are exclusive and new for this set they
will have silver handles which I think
it's really nice compared to the kind of
bright Pink's that I normally do in this
set is the duo fibre face brush which I
already have the cheek brush which is
new for this set the angled eyeshadow
brush which is also new the base shadow
brush which I don't have yet and the
eyeliner brush which is also new I think
this is such a good set because the
three exclusive brushes look amazing and
they I've already used them I've just
put them back in the box to show you
guys the powder brush is really nice for
like the hourglass powder or if you want
to powder your skin you don't want to
put too much on it's really nice light
application this blusher brush is so
nice let me get out to show you it's
nice and fluffy at the top as you can
see from the side it's kind of squished
which makes it really good for
contouring so I think you could use this
for a light bronze if you wanted a
contour it makes it really easy to place
your blush in the right place you can
either kind of dab it on with this side
or do it more angled like that and it's
just they're so soft their brushes are
all kind of cruelty free and hand cut
and they wash really well I just think
they're really good quality brushes I
reckon that set will sell out pretty
quickly so I would run and get it when
it comes out in the 1st of October it
should be available in Boots I don't
have the price on me right now but I
will find out and put it all in the info
bar below ok next product this is the
Clinique sonic system and this is
basically their version of the
Clarisonic if you don't know what the
Clarisonic is it's like an electric
toothbrush for your face it's meant to
be like a cleansing system and it's a
brush that vibrates a new clean your
face with it you might already know but
I was never a fan of the Kara sonic I
found it way too harsh for my skin I
didn't really get the height never had
ever got into it I thought I'd give this
one a go though just to see how it
compares it comes like this with the
charger and the brush here one thing I
noticed immediately is the brush doesn't
stand up it hasn't got a flat surface
you kind of have to put it like that or
I don't know mine ended up rolling
around in my muslin cloth basket I found
that a little bit annoying and quite
hard to store you take the cover off
like this and the brush is there you
press the button you can hear it
vibrates this is waterproof so you can
use it in the shower which i think is
really cool but I tried it out and I
felt the same as I did with the
Clarisonic I can't remember if the
Clarisonic head spins or just vibrates
that this one just vibrates and I used
it on my skin and it kind of like it
hurts I feel like if you're going to use
it to cleanse your skin and put like a
barmy cleanser on it then you really
have to go like this to get your makeup
off and I found it really agitated my
skin the whole idea that's meant to give
you a really deep cleanse which is good
if you're living somewhere like London
where there's a lot of kind of pollution
and congestion in your skin but I just
found it I was doing too much and I'm
much if I using my hands and then a
muslin cloth for a light exfoliation
this just felt bizarre and it didn't
feel good on my skin and because it just
vibrates and doesn't spin I just don't
really see the point and what this is
doing compared to my hands or muslin
cloth this is out now and it's 79 pounds
which is cheaper than the Clarisonic I
think the cheapest Clarisonic is 99
pounds and they go all the way up to 179
and if you do like this sort of cleanse
and I think this is quite a cute little
contraption but it's just not ready for
me I prefer the old-fashioned way
okay let's talk about Stila a brand I
really love and I think at the moment
they're celebrating 20 years of Stila
which is really cool first of all let's
talk about this palette which is
exclusive to M&amp;amp;S and this is called the
natural I think there are three
variations of this and in here let me
take it out there are six eyeshadows a
highlight and importance this palette is
1950 and it's in there kind of standard
like cardboard packaging I thought I
would love this one and as soon as I saw
it also wow neutral tones three mattes
three shimmers a nice highlight a
shimmery borns looks perfect but I found
these shimmery eyeshadows to be far too
shimmery they just kind of looked weird
I wore them on the weekend and I just
felt like it was way too over-the-top
far too shimmery for me and just didn't
really suit my eyes I can't really
explain I do wear shimmer eye shadows
and I do like them but these ones were
just too reflective and metallic looking
it just looked a bit silly and out of
the matte shades the only one that I can
really wear is innocent which is the
darker one the linen is slightly too
light and pure is just kind of like a
cream it doesn't really show up the
highlight and
nice but again just two shimmery for me
so I was actually a bit disappointed
with this palette but if you do like
shimmery shades then it is a cute little
palette with some nice colors in there
you can also use the shadows wet or dry
which is always a bonus the next thing
from Stila is this new palette which is
their eyes are the windows shadow
palettes and this one is in spirit now
this is part of their new look I think
it's because they are celebrating 20
years that they've kind of had a bit of
a makeover and I really like it this is
what the palette looks like it's rose
gold and covered in my fingerprints
sorry I think it's much more
sophisticated rather than they're like
cardboard look it's really nice and
luxurious so you open that up there's a
little cover that says where the spirit
does not work with the hand there is no
art Leonardo da Vinci that's cute
in here there are 12 shadows I think all
of thermus shimmer made me pop in to
Matt's and that's kind of highlight and
a matte light brown which isn't
essential in an eyeshadow palette I
think these are very shimmery as well
but I do much prefer this palette to the
other one I'm wearing them today on my
eyes and I think they're really good
quality easy to blend I do like steel
eyeshadows I think their variation of
colors are nice there are a lot of
neutrals there's some kind of pinky
shades and a couple of purpley and blues
as well which will be nice for kind of
the autumn winter months this will be
launching in September and October so
perfect timing for the sorts of shades
in here and yeah I think they're really
good quality and this is a really nice
little palette okay onto my final
products review and let's talk about the
wonderful world of Chanel now they have
some new lip gloss is launching on the
3rd of October and they are really cool
so I wanted to show you guys so the box
it comes in two looks like this kind of
standard Chanel packaging and then the
lip gloss itself looks just like their
rouge allure lipsticks because these are
the original lip glosses so they look
like this just plain black packaging
that says Chanel on the bottom it has
the color and then on the top it has the
little gold Chanel logo you press that
it pops up and then you there's the lip
gloss so I think that's really cool it's
a shame you can't really see how much
product you have left or what the color
is inside but it looks amazing
the applicator itself is really nice
it's kind of flat on both sides so you
can ply from either side and it has a
little pool of product and it applies
the perfect amount onto your lips I
think these are really nice because they
kind of like liquid lipsticks they don't
reply like a normal
Glaus kind of shear and shiny they have
really good pigmentation I'm wearing one
today and I do prefer the lighter shades
there are some darker ones but I don't
really like growing kind of dark pearly
red lip gloss as I much prefer it for
the lighter shades so there's like a
light peach a light pink
there was actually a dark brighter pink
which is really nice as well I think the
lighter shades are the best ones because
I really like wearing light pink and
peach lip glosses there are 26 pounds
but I think because they have so much
pigmentation and so much color and
they're really long wearing that they
are more worth it if you just want kind
of a cheap lip gloss the point of your
lipstick then definitely get one from
the drugstore but if you want a glossy
pigmented finish on your lips then these
are really really nice those are just so
luxury and amazing to have in your
handbag I can't get over this papi thing
it's so satisfying so these are launched
you're not on the 3rd of October and I
would definitely recommend trying them
save up your boots points that's what I
always do for Chanel products and I'll
be doing a proper review on my blog of
these so you can see all the shade
colors there so those are my 5 product
reviews I hope you found this useful
whether you found out about some new
products that launches soon or you
wanted a mini review of something that
was on your wish list thanks so much for
watching guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
