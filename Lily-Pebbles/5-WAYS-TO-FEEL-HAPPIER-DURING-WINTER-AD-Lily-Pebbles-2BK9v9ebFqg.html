5 ways to feel happier during winter I
don't know about you guys but my mood
definitely changes when the clocks
changed now all of a sudden it's lighter
in the mornings which is good if you're
a morning person but I'm normally still
asleep at that point but it gets dark at
like 4:30 which I find just so hard
especially because I work from home
having so much more of the day in
darkness I feel like you need to make
more of an effort during winter to kind
of lift your mood but there are so many
nice things that come with winter as
well so I thought I would just kind of
pinpoint 5 ways that you can make
yourself feel happier during winter the
first one is to plan to do Christmasy
wintery things when it starts to get to
November time I quite like to plan ahead
and like book in days to do nice
Christmassy winter things even if you
don't celebrate Christmas there's so
many nice things going on I know in
London there's so much going on I often
go ice skating with my friends Somerset
House has an amazing ice-skating rink
I think my favorite one is at the
Natural History Museum the south bank
has amazing Christmas markets there's
loads of Christmas markets everywhere
Leicester Square I think this year is
also doing I've never been but I really
want to go they kind of make me feel
Christmasy village I like to book in
times with my friends and family to go
to those kind of Christmasy things and
if you're feeling really fancy you can
book into go to the theater as well I
went to see the Nutcracker ballet one
year and that was so nice it just made
me feel so happy and Christmassy the
next thing I would suggest is not
letting go of your usual routine I know
that I'm guilty of sometimes not looking
after myself as much during the winter
and you know those kind of in between
days where you haven't done your hair
removal and you haven't kind of pampered
yourself and been looking after yourself
as much I feel like I never feel as good
so something I try to encourage myself
to do in the winter is to keep up my
routine especially with my body like the
colder skin just look after the skin on
your body to try and keep my legs and
arms nice and smooth you guys know I a
plate the epilator I used is the braun
silk-épil 9 i find that this is the
best one for removing hair quickly it's
got really wide head here so you can see
and it moves a lot as well so you can
get more hairs quicker the reason I love
epilating is because of those in-between
days it lasts longer so if you suddenly
have a Christmas party and you need to
get your legs out or in my case I have
plate my arms it doesn't grow back as
fast so you have more of those
in-between days where you don't have to
be doing your hair removal all the time
it lasts longer
it feels smoother and I find that it it
doesn't grow back like all at once so
you don't get stubble I remember when I
used to not use an epilator I'd have an
event or something where I had to get my
legs out and I'd look at my legs and be
like oh my god they desperately need
doing
whereas I find when I a plate those kind
of in-between days I can really get away
with it because the hair is really fine
when it grows back and you can hardly
see it so as long as I keep this up
maybe like every two to four weeks
I'll a plate my legs and arms I find
that that's a really good routine for me
this air place it actually comes with
brush heads as well which I really
really like to exfoliate so there's two
there's sensitive one and a deep
exfoliating one this one the deep one is
particularly good for preventing any
ingrown hairs I don't get them that
badly but some people might suffer from
ingrown hairs so this is really good for
that so I tend to put one of the brush
heads on the epilator and when I'm in
the shower because you can use it wet or
dry when I'm in the shower
I'll exfoliate using the brush and using
my shower gel this one is from Loxy tan
it's the vervain exfoliating fresh
shower gels like a nice singing it's
really refreshing and zingy so I'll do
that all over my body exfoliate you can
epilate in the shower this works
perfectly fine I prefer to do it on dry
skin I'm not sure why it's just my
personal preference so I come out the
shower dry myself off and then I'll
appelate my legs and arms using this and
then once I'm done I like to moisturize
the skin the moisturizer I really like
to use is the ameliorate skin smoothing
body lotion this is an alpha hydroxy
therapy so it has a a chain in it which
a lot of your skin care probably has in
it as well I find that it really really
smooths out the skin if you ever get
like bumpy bits in the back of your arms
or any rough patches on your skin this
really smooths it out so this is my
favorite body lotion it's not like
scented or anything I don't think so no
it does really smell of anything but it
just really really works well sometimes
for like body lotion feels like a bit of
a waste of time or is this one
doesn't so that is my exfoliating
epilating and moisturizing routine I
would definitely recommend the braun
silk-épil 9 this is their fastest and
most precise epilator that they do and i
can really feel the difference I've used
quite a few now as much as I love
staying in during the winter I also love
getting out I love getting wrapped up
putting loads of layers on I love the
unique low heat tech vest top and then I
lay on my clothes on I put on a coat
glove scarf hat and I like going up for
a fresh winter walk pretty much every
weekend Saturday Sunday morning I go for
a walk with rich and my family we take
the dog out it's nice to get a bit of
fresh air and I feel like during the
winter months you can feel a bit like
crushed phobic and a bit locked up being
in all the time so it's nice to get out
get some fresh air
hopefully it was not raining in London
you can get a really nice walk and it's
nice time to like think or if you're
going with friends so just chat if you
want to make it extra cozy you can stop
in a pub or a cafe and have a nice hot
chocolate I know this seems really
simple but just winter walks and cosy
times with a hot chocolate it's just
such a nice thing to do during winter I
think baking is also a great way to make
yourself feel happier during winter it's
a bit of kind of me time when you can
just spend time in the kitchen or you
can bake with someone else I like baking
with my mom or with my sisters this
weekend actually I'm going to try give
this recipe a go I haven't done it yet
so I'll insert some cutaways and you can
see how I got on this is the Livia's
kitchen book Livia's so so sweet I
really really like her and she's brought
out her own book it's very like healthy
if there's naturally sweet and indulgent
treats I'm gonna give this one a go
because I do if you guys remember when I
was obsessed with her crumbles she
doesn't do them anymore
they record Livia's crumbles they were
incredible and she's got her crumble
recipe in her book so I'm so excited to
try it's got all the different ones in
here I'm gonna try the berry crumble
squares so she's turned her crumble
recipe into a recipe that you can cut
them into squares and have them for like
breakfast or snacks as well so the
crumble layer goes underneath and then
the berries go in-between and then the
crumbles go on top of that as well and
once it's all dried you can cut them
into squares and I absolutely love her
crumble recipe the topping
so delicious it's like the best crumble
topping I've tried and I loved her berry
crumble so I'm really excited to try
this it's so so easy to use I am NOT a
great chef I'm not a great Baker I'm
actually better at cooking than I am
baking but this is a really really easy
recipe to follow you don't even need
that many ingredients so I think baking
and spending some time in the kitchen
and then having some nice treats to
enjoy afterwards is such a nice thing to
do during the winter my final way of
keeping happy during winter is to
embrace hygge now I'm sorry if I
pronounced that wrong huger is wait a
minute I really get it I do but I hope
that I can describe it and do it justice
and I'm really sorry if I described it
wrong but in my head and feel like I
pretty much understand it
huger is a concept that was created in
Scandinavia it's a Scandinavia part of
their culture I think the word hookah
officially is a Danish word and it's
something that I've heard us Brits do
really well and I get that because I
think that I have been embracing this my
whole life I just didn't realize it had
a name
so who Gaia is a way of being it
encourages you to create a nice warm
space where you can relax so for example
if you were to do hygge in your home
it's all about the lighting you create
so you'd come home after work and you'd
change into different clothes
comfortable clothes you'd be relaxed you
tie your hair up you light a candle
dim the lights I could eat my crumble
squares and have something indulgent to
like treat myself with and have comfy
throws and cushions on my sofa it's all
about that kind of setting the scene and
the mood and being a certain way and I
think us Brits are great at that you
have cinemas here where you can sit on
the sofa and drink wine and that's very
much I think in the huger spirit I love
the idea of it and it's very much what I
try to embrace especially in the winter
but yeah I think it's all about creating
your own little nice space and nest and
the word has become a bit trendy here
now but I think it's something you all
have kind of embraced a little bit and I
mean now I work from home that's pretty
much how I am all day but I just wanted
to mention it in this video because I
think it
a really nice word for like summing up
the whole idea really ok enough rambling
those are my five tips on how to be
happier during the winter please let me
know if you liked this video I enjoyed
kind of putting them all together and
deciding what they would all be please
