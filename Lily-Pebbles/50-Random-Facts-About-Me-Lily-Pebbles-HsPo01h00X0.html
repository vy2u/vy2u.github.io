and fun video i'm gonna be doing 50
random facts about me I've done the 20
random facts about me but I haven't
actually what rewatched it so I'm sorry
if I repeat any and I know this is quite
different to what I normally do it's
just kind of silly and fun but I fancy
just doing something easy today and I
thought maybe you guys might learn
something new about me I don't know it's
a bit of a self indulgent tag but I like
watching them so I thought you guys
might like watching it too I have my
paper here literally with scruffy
writing about the last kind of 24 hours
writing down every time I think of
something some are completely around and
some you may already know so I'm just
gonna get straight into it I don't
really like shopping online especially
for Beauty I shop on cult Beauty because
they have a lot of stuff you can't get
elsewhere but apart from that I like the
physical act of shopping that's like 50
percent of the fun my first dog was
called rug see she was a miniature
poodle although she wasn't that small
they had her for a year before I was
born and then she died when I was 16 so
she was 17 years old she had like curly
black hair and she like blended in with
the rug that's why we called her rug see
and she was really cute and friendly and
lovely I'm currently subscribed to 100
channels on YouTube and I pretty much
watch every video that comes into my
subscription box my family have weird
words for foods I never really knew
weird until I went to uni and like met
other people we call a jacket potato
potato in the jacket which is just so
weird you know the peas that you kind of
pop open and they have peas inside we
call those poppy peas we make a carrot
and Sue potato mash especially at
Christmastime and we call that SH mush
and then you know those hand blenders
you make secret we call that as usurer
we're just really weird I absolutely
love playing tennis and I'm actually
pretty good at it I've been learning
since I was very young and it's just one
of my favorite hobbies I'm definitely
not a dreamer I am a realist but that
doesn't mean I don't have dreams I get
major family FOMO FOMO is fear of
missing out so if they're all together
and I'm not there if I'm away or
otherwise engaged
I get so jealous we have like a family
whatsapp group and we send each other
photos and videos and I just feel like
I'm missing out you may wonder why I
have a tattoo here that says new kid in
town that has a song by the Eagles and
the song or the album was playing while
I was born I was kind of born in a bath
and my dad was in Hawaiian shorts and
they had Eagles playing I was the third
and I was a mistake so I had a bit of a
alternative birth but I've loved the
Eagles ever since
and every one of my family loves them so
that's why I have this tattooed there I
definitely want to have children but
having older sisters means that I I know
far too much and not gonna lie I am
petrified about getting pregnant and
having to give birth I'd like three kids
if I can because I've grown up in a
three but I think two would be nice as
well I would definitely consider myself
a feminist I like to go back to school
for a week I feel like I didn't take up
the opportunity of education and
learning and I'd like to see if I'd
actually learn anything new and just
kind of give it another go I like peanut
butter but I don't like peanut flavored
things like peanut butter flavored
chocolate things like that I worked in
gap kids for three months when I was 18
to pay for a flight around the world I'm
27 years old I'm always cold at night
when I go to bed and rich is always hot
and then in the morning I'm always
really hot and he's always really cold
it's so annoying
in February 2010 I volunteered for the
British Fashion Council working at
London Fashion Week so it was like four
days work we didn't get paid
it was long hard hours kind of taking
people's tickets and letting people
through but it was an amazing experience
and what a way to kind of see inside
Fashion Week when you're quite young and
it was just so exciting and I made
friends that I'm still friends with now
actually before I leave the house I
always think phone money keys it's
something my dad used to tell me when I
was younger and it's just ingrained in
my brain phone money keys it's always
more the merrier with me I like
everyone's just come together and
everyone to just kind of meet and make
friends and have fun
sometimes it's a bit annoying because
I'll invite people along for things when
I probably shouldn't and poor rich
hardly ever gets kind of just me and him
time because I'm always inviting all our
friends along but I just like to be
together and have fun
I was Game Boy obsessed as a kid I've
always been into technology and game
boys were just my thing I had the
original gray Gameboy I had the black
kind of slimline one and then when it
came out in colour I got that in pink
and then I got one of the wider ones a
comma but they were cooled but I kind of
went off them at that point I think they
should have stuck to the original style
Mario was obviously my favorite game
I was hungry before the word existed my
friends used to always call me hungry
like years ago it's like a really trendy
word now but I even as a kid I just get
so Moody and I feel sick and I'm
terrible to root be around if I have a
Nissen you know how some people say
they've got like resting bitchface I
don't have a resting bitch face but my
normal face just makes me look like
really upset or in pain people will
often say to me are you okay
and I literally don't know what they're
talking about and I think it's cuz my
face is just like this my natural face
is to frown so if you ever think like
all the leaves in a mood it's just it's
just my face I never liked talking on
the phone I never have done when I was
younger and my friends used to call me
as a teenager I used to pretend like oh
I've got to go for dinner when I didn't
just because I wanted to hang up because
I felt really awkward and even now like
I'll always prefer to email or text I'll
call someone if I have something to say
but I'll never call someone just for a
chat I don't know why I find it so
awkward the longest time difference I've
ever experienced is 11 hours when I was
in Fiji that's 11 hours ahead of the UK
and that was really weird I hate the
feeling of regret so I take every
decision really seriously and I
definitely worry too much we don't
really do grandparents in my family in
the way that we don't call our
grandparents Grandma and Grandpa I'm not
sure why I used to call my dad's parents
just by their first names and my grandma
on my mom's side she was really young
when she became a grandma so she didn't
really want to be called grandma so we
ended up just calling her mum because my
sister copied my mom who called her mom
and my grandpa pop so he had mom and pop
first names and now my parents who are
grandparents are called Gaga and Papa so
we don't have any grandma's or grandpa's
or Nan's or Gran's or anything like that
the emojis that I wish existed are
crossed fingers middle finger up avocado
cup of tea probably just like a glass or
a bottle of water I love apples but I
don't really like green apples I've seen
Oklahoma on stage five times and I think
I know all the songs and all the words I
love musical theater but I'm definitely
more of a fan of the old classics like
West Side Story my fair lady not so much
a fan of kind of the newer styles like
wicked I only learned how to dive into a
swimming pool when I was 15 I can bend
my thumb backwards like quite a lot I
think my mum washed my hair for me over
the bath until I was far too old I had
really mattered naughty curly hair I
just couldn't do it myself
my dad once had a phone conversation
with Stevie Wonder my big toes flick up
and they make holes in a lot of my shoes
Perrineau Micah Rand Paul had the same
thing and when I went to Margaret dabs
for a medical pedicure she said it's
something to do with the tight ligaments
in my toes which is why I may struggle
to wear high heels finally I thought I
was just being a bit of a tomboy
a little bit scared of the dark and when
I go to the countryside with rich and we
go to sleep in it's pitch black it kind
of freaks me out
whenever I get waxed I break into a cold
sweat it's so embarassing I'm literally
like a sweaty mess and the beautician
always finds it really funny
I drink skimmed milk and not for any
particular reason just because that's
the milk we've always had in my house so
now I'm used to it and drinking anything
else like semi skimmed or whole milk
just tastes like really creamy to me and
it's funny because everyone thinks
skimmed milk tastes really watery but I
love it I've had two operations on my
bladder I only learned how to ride a
bike when I was 12 something to do with
being the youngest child that they kept
forgetting to teach me things like
diving in a pool and riding a bike my
friends Hannah and Jack actually taught
me and they basically just pushed me
down a hill and said go I hate the taste
of aniseed and fennel and all those kind
of flavors I can literally taste it in
anything and it just makes me feel
really ill I'm always completely
paranoid about swallowing fish bones and
after I've eaten a fish I always feel
like I've got a bone in my throat and
then I have to eat bread and it's a huge
pallava
I grind my teeth in my sleep number nine
is my lucky number I think I inherited
it from my dad it's also his lucky
number me my dad and my mom were all
born on the 9th yes just my lucky number
I'll always be salty over sweet I don't
have much of a sweet tooth I refer
salami as a snack over chocolate and
salt popcorn every time I rarely cry but
when I do it's always really
inappropriate it's either at a TV show
when I see someone on TV cry or I'll
just let it all build up for months and
months and just have a complete
breakdown like in Rich's face I feel
anxious and nervous a lot these days I
never used to when I was younger but the
past couple years I think just as you
grow up and get more stress and make
more important decisions anxiousness and
nerves just come naturally but I haven't
really figured out a way to make myself
feel better when I'm feeling like that
the only thing that has ever worked is
when I bumped into a viewer last week I
was having a really bad day and I bumped
into a viewer in Liberty Beauty Hall and
she was so nice and as soon as I walked
away from talking to her I just felt
100% better and so far that's actually
been the only thing that's helped one of
my favorite games to play is me and my
friends often play the what animal would
I be game where you kind of say what
animal you think your friend would be if
they were an animal it's really weird
we've also done it for vegetables but I
just think it's hilarious I asked a lot
of questions at school my teachers used
to always get a bit annoyed that I used
to always do the one in my hand up
asking questions and now my agent and
that I work with also say that I am the
one who always has all the questions so
it's obviously just a trait that I
wasn't really aware of and finally I
love to show off my friends I feel like
I just boast about my friends all the
time but they all are just so amazing
and have such cool jobs and I'm so like
proud to have such a nice group of
friends so I do kind of show them off
and I would want to introduce them to
people and make everyone be friends and
I'm very proud of the people that I have
in my life so those are 50 random facts
about me I hope you learned something
new or found that just fun or
interesting let me know a random fact
about you because then I can learn
something about you guys too thank you
