actually it's not morning it's 1 o'clock
I had an epic lion this morning I slept
about half 10 and I really really needed
it I can you could probably hear it my
voice like I can feel the vlogmas flu
creeping in but I'm trying really hard
to fight it I haven't really got time to
be ill from honest tonight I have a
really special event every year Clarins
do a really nice Christmas event for the
bloggers that they work with throughout
the year and that's tonight I'm really
excited for it I'm gonna go meet Anna
and mark in town they stayed in London
last night and we're heading into the
gleam office this afternoon just to give
some Christmas presents so they're
lovely people that work so hard to kind
of help us out and I've just been
puttering around this morning getting
ready editing yesterday's vlog which I
hope you guys enjoyed as my birthday and
giveaway vlog so I'm just packing up now
I'm wearing my dolly a dress tonight
because I needed something that was kind
of suitable for wearing during the day
but also looks nice tonight and I'm just
gonna take some makeup with me coming to
top it up later I'm wearing Charlotte
Tilbury love at Liberty which is just
one of my favorite lipsticks I love it
and that's all I really have to update
you on at the moment oh I just got some
lovely birthday flowers these are so
nice and festive I'm gonna put them in a
farz now this is so pretty and festive
the pink ones are from the last bunch of
flowers I had I kept a few because they
weren't dead yeah and it's really nice I
like the spiky ones making a scary all
my birthday cards laid out on the table
and then tomorrow I guess I'll have to
throw them away I always think that's a
really sad part of the birthday when the
birthday cards need to be thrown away or
put away if you like to keep them
alright let's see what's in my Joe
Malone advent calendar today 10 mom be a
good one oh it's a perfume nectarine
blossom and honey
another really good one to mix a
fragrance more of a summery fresh scent
but it's really nice to mix all I like
that one
British or Topshop is letting off some
fake snow unless it's snowing very
confused there's definitely so I'm
pretty sure that's Topshop with a snow
machine and if ear that's very clever
marketing I'm just heading to you the
gleam officer I'm gonna head to a cafe
first and we Anna and Mark they're just
having lunch
so Anna's new Christmas jumper is rather
fetching it's like you've got saggy
boobs with Christmas tree nipple tassels
and it's brilliant
we're just discussing how where this
fruit bowl is but there's a pineapple in
an office and also really weird long
grapes
they're just freaky sorry that I haven't
plugged in a while I've been like
meetings and editing and boring stuff
and then I got all flustered and south
for with ray and I had a million bags
I've finally arrived in the Connaught
hotel which is a really beautiful hotel
in London and I'm here the Clarence
Christmas dinner which I kind of
explained earlier since me lots of
familiar blogger faces have also dressed
up I got really busy watching hair I did
look nice it's where at one point I'm
gonna be a me dinner like Victor is
looking lovely and not sweaty like I am
this way has lots of lovely blog young
girls here but I would like to catch up
with this whole with a freshly blue hair
a very electric I like it
you just sat down at the most
ridiculously beautiful table and Sydney
Sally no but grin like I'm ready I
thought that my lips is gonna load my
face
Alex Lifeson blogging at balancing that
this is how you get a good show of you
eating your risotto
I'm everyone's gone outside on the
horse-drawn carriages around Mayfair
which does sound lovely but as you can
hear my voice I'm so on the verge of
getting ill that I feel like it's a bad
idea to go outside on the pouring rain
so for you guys just so I could carry on
with vlogmas of thoughts they have their
little chats Jane you know hey we're
gonna have a nice drink and stay warm
I'm up for that
it's like a soldier man bring you
presents around that this is very
exciting music this man is coming for me
oh my gosh I'm gonna film Zoey opening
her gift I'm really like I'm forcing her
to open it I don't know if she actually
wants to
oh my god we got pajamas and it says LP
on it oh my days that just makes me so
happy we've come to the end of the
dinner and I just finished my cup of tea
so I think we're gonna head back now
mini a camp oh there's so many back
there today but I picked up some track
sequences Victoria Secrets which is very
on me so I'll show you guys I know I'll
show you I just I really wanted some
concrete rice in there
I'm home and my hair is up and I'm in my
hoodie already and I'm happy to be home
rich said it's cozy at all and he's
right it's so cozy at the moment
specially with the Christmas tree I had
a really nice night the ladies at
Clarence is so sweet and it was nice
that nice to Alex for my cop Utley and
we had a really good chat it was nice to
chat to her and I'm happy to be home I'm
gonna sit and watch x-factor with rich
God was wrong with me
I'm gonna watch Hollyoaks and wait
before we do that I could show you what
I got from Victoria Secrets because I
said that I would show you guys I
basically I really wanted some tracksuit
bottoms cuz I just waste so much land
right when I'm at home working from home
and I'm really not the sort of person
who is like into Victoria's Secret at
all or Abercrombie I used to be when I
was a teenager but I'm not really into
kind of slogans or things like that
and I do think it's quite overpriced as
well but tracksuit bottoms I find a
really good quality tracksuit bottoms
are really hard to find and I know that
they have good ones even though I don't
actually like the fact that it has pink
written all over it
but I wear them just at home anyway so I
got there I was gonna get the campus
pants but they're really really baggy I
still kind of want them but I've got the
gym pants instead and they have a fold
over elastic at the top it has pink
creasing on it let me lay them out I'll
show you so the top is like that and
then they're gray and then the down the
side it's got kind of white and neon
yellow and it says pink and then tight
at the bottom and I got them in a lodge
so that they're not like super tight I'm
not actually wearing them for the gym
I'm just wearing them at home and
they're really cozy and they're not too
thick happy with those my highlight of
the day was giving Christmas presents to
Lucy and Georgia from gleam because they
work so so hard and I loved them so it
was really nice to give them a present
and see there are happy faces when they
open them virtually got a thought today
yesterday you said he did have one these
forgotten it no you remember I'll just
turn on the camera
I don't know how to end the vlog thank
you for watching and thank you for
sticking with me so far I can't believe
it's only been ten days it feels like
I've seen daily vlogging my whole life
but I'm still enjoying it I'll see you
guys tomorrow
sorry for dragging on this outro bye
rich has a thought of the day while he
balances his water on his knee was when
you go to the toilet to only thought
what guys always thought about this but
it's never really fixed I'm never ready
do you ever get ultimate I need to go
sorry go when you sit on the toilet seat
like a public toilet seat not most
people don't like doing it anyway but
you put your bum on a seat how do you
not then you get up pee pants on then
wash your hands when you wash your bum
that's all be dazed for but that's just
still be dangers have water soap this is
like turned into like TMI talk with rich
oh my god okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
