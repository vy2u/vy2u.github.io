really well I am makeup free because I
thought I would do this month's
favorites video a little bit different
I'm actually gonna be doing a completely
non Beauty favorites
so nothing I'm talking about today is
makeup or skincare or anything Beauty
it's just gonna be all non Beauty but
whilst I talk you through the products
that I have been loving this month I'm
gonna be doing my makeup because I'm
getting ready today
it's a beautiful spring day I'm just so
happy that the Sun has come back out I
can't even tell you how much is affected
my mood so I'm gonna get ready sit here
at my dressing table and chat to you
about all the things I've been loving
this month if I remember I will tell you
what I'm using but seriously it's
nothing different than to normal
actually often this because I ran out of
my Smashbox primer I have to buy a new
one I've gone back to the better and
first like priming filter which I really
like but other than that nothing new is
going on my face today so I've got a
little list here to remind me what my
favorites have been I've been keeping a
note all month I've got a few TV shows
to talk about let me know if you like it
when I talk about TV shows by the way
because I feel like I watched quite a
lot and every month they've got a new
one to recommend but this month the
first one I want to talk about is smell
so it's like milf but the idea is single
mom the girl who plays the main role the
single mum her name is Frankie Shore and
she actually wrote and directed and
stars in the whole show so I think she
first made it as like a short film and
then it got made into a series and she's
brilliant it's so funny it's quite like
I wouldn't watch it with your mum it's
really really funny the little boy in it
I don't know if I want to ruin this for
you because it doesn't matter because
there's nothing to do with the actual
like what goes on in the show but she's
got a little son and he's the cutest
thing in the entire world he's called
Larry Bird he's like unbelievably cute
like I would steal him but after I watch
shows I always like Google the people in
and what other things they've been in
and their kind of story
Larry Bird is played by only a girl but
twin identical twin girls I like she
can't believe it I was so shocked if
you've watched her and he didn't know
that
like let me know because I was so
surprised although I'm just trying to do
like not much makeup today because I
don't really think I need it I've put
quite sheer layer of foundation on so
yeah it's really really funny I'm an
easy watch so I would definitely
recommend smille the next one is
something that rich and I started when
the first season came out and we just
thought it was really weird and we
stopped watching it it's Santa Clarita
Dyer and a lot of you guys recommend it
I can't open this a lot of you guys
recommended it in my last favorites
video and I was like yeah we tried that
before and I just thought it was really
weird like when I'd be started watching
it it's it's Drew Barrymore's show I'm
pretty sure she wrote and produced it
and she stars in it and it's about a mom
who I never know what will ruin it and
what will not but I think she she
basically dies but then becomes undead
so she's like a living dead person and
she has to eat other humans and it's
like quite a funny was very funny in
that comedy of like how she carries on
her life as normal but she's Undead and
we started watching it when it first
came out and we were like no this is so
weird I don't get it and then when you
guys all recommended it I thought maybe
we should try again because I know that
season two has just come out so he
finished season one and now we're
halfway through season two and we're
totally hooked again it's actually
really funny
once you get past like the weirdness of
it drew Barrymore is great in it it's so
nice to see her doing something that I
think she's like really passionate about
for people that are scared of sick just
be careful of like the first episode but
apart from that it's weird it's like a
it's a weird funny one
I would watch smell first but we kind of
ran out of things to watch so we did
Santa Clarita diet and it's funny okay
the third TV thing that I have watched
and really enjoyed is something called
kiri that was on channel 4 oh by the way
I'll tell you what all the shows run so
Smith was on Sky Santa Clarita dying
it's on Netflix and then kiri is on
channel 4 then we watched it on like
catch-up and it's a short drama series
about a young black girl who is in the
care system and she's about to be
adopted by a white family and she goes
missing and it's a real like mystery
type program which I love those kind of
things I find them really like gripping
and I
it was so good I really really enjoyed
what she did but I did if any of you
guys have seen it I was so disappointed
in the ending I feel like they were
trying to be cool by having a bit of
like her you know not just like a happy
ending nor something really satisfying
but to me it just really frustrated me I
really hated the ending so that was
annoying and kind of be warned for that
maybe when watching it because I was
just so disappointed but apart from the
ending I I really liked it so it's
called kiri which is like ki RI I'm
gonna link everything I'm talking about
down below so you guys can have a look
in the description box I find it really
difficult to talk and do my makeup at
the same time I feel like I've been
blending for about five hours okay
whilst I do my bronze let me see what
the next thing oh okay the next thing I
want to recommend is a clue quest clue
quest is one of those escape room places
and if you don't know what escape room
is because I didn't for ages it's
basically like a fun activity where you
go with a group of people and you're
you're technically like locked into a
room and you have to follow all of these
clues and like do problem-solving to try
and like escape the room in time you get
like a set about time and yes it's like
a challenge it's meant to be like a fun
activity which you would do on a hen or
a stag or just like with your friends so
I beat a clue quest now a couple of
times which is the one based in Kings
Cross and I just love it so the first
time I went with a couple of other
friends and then second time we took a
landmark for Mark's 30th birthday prison
and I knew that they would love it
because we're all quite similar
personalities we're very like
competitive and like you have to be the
sort of personality that like cares
enough to give it a go because I feel
like some people would just be like oh I
can't bothered and it won't be fine if
you're like that you have to like kind
of play into it and want to escape the
room it's really difficult to explain
but like the first run they did you
basically walk into a room and there was
nothing in the whole room and part my
picture on the wall and wellies on the
floor and I was like what I do
understand I came in to know what to do
my friend like picked up the Whirley and
like tipped over and there was like a
key in it and then you have to work out
where the key goes so I'm not gonna give
any more away than that but that's kind
of the idea you basically find things
and you have to work out what they mean
how they lead you on to the next clue
and it's so much more impressive than
you think it's gonna be like your perky
in and you think it's just gonna be like
a box but like a hole door opens or
something it's just so exciting and it's
so fun both times I've done it with four
people and I know you can do it in big
groups but I just think it would get so
confusing because people are constantly
like pulling things out of cupboards and
finding things if you don't like keep
track of everything it would get so
confusing so I think four is like a
really good number to do that with and
I've just had such a fun time both times
so I would really recommend it I haven't
been to any other escape rooms if you
guys have and you recommend some I don't
like the scary ones a lot of them really
scary but clue quest isn't scary at all
it's just like a normal room it's all
based around like I'm like a mouse I
think so um yeah I definitely wouldn't
want to do a scary one I feel like I'd
have like a panic attack but this one is
good if you don't want to do scary yeah
let me just fill in my brows because I
can't really talk about anything whilst
doing my brows I had them threaded
yesterday at blink brow bar I usually go
to the one in Liberty but they're always
busy and I suddenly remembered that
there's one in Topshop downstairs so I
went there we basically realized that
this eyebrow is way thicker than my left
eyebrow but they did them really well my
next favorite is a book you can probably
guess already what it is because I've
been talking about it so much online it
is this one which is mad about the house
which is by Kate Watson Smith and Kate
is someone
kate is someone who I've followed on
Instagram for a little while and I love
her interior post she's very much like
home decor based and this book is
beautiful but it's more than that it's
actually so helpful for someone like me
that's about to do my house up it's got
everything you need and it really splits
up into really good section so like the
whole the kitchen the dining room the
sitting room the bedroom the bathroom
the spare room and then we did nose it's
like lighting and a bathroom it's pretty
like simple inside but it's got these
really beautiful illustrations sorry
that you can't see this light is
terrible let me see if I can find and
then there's a few pictures as well I
just love it I really enjoyed reading
this I read it in the evening for its
bed I read it pretty quickly and it's
really helped me think about a lot of
things I was actually quite impressed
myself because I was already doing quite
a lot of things that she recommended
which it's not a reflection on the book
being too simple or anything it's just
I've been doing so much research so it
made me feel good in like I kind of know
what I'm doing like I'm thinking about
having more cozy lighting where the
dining table is so every time she like
said something like that I was like yes
I'm doing it right and but I definitely
learned some really interesting things
as well whoa oh my god sorry the biggest
ball will be ever just hit the wood
window she says that was huge
oh that's a were thing about spring
summer one of the main things I learned
is to do with colors in the bedroom she
was saying how if he struggled to wake
up in the morning you should make sure
that the walls that you kind of wake up
and look at are bright and airy and help
you wake up whereas it doesn't even
matter about the wall behind you and if
you struggle to go to sleep you know you
can have like a darker room that helps
you fall asleep easier so I think what
I'm gonna do is do a dark hall behind
our bed because when I wake up in the
morning I won't see that so it won't
affect me like waking up but it'll be
nice when you go to sleep to have that
kind of cozy wall behind the bed I think
that's what I'm gonna do anyway I would
highly recommend the book I will put a
link down below to where you can buy it
and if you're into home deck or home
renovations follow Kate on Instagram and
check out her book because it's fab ok
my next favorite of these mugs these are
from Soho at home I bought them when I
was at Soho farmhouse and I absolutely
love the color I love the kind of Ridge
ridges on them the
I just think they are so beautiful and
also the perfect size for a cup of tea
I'm gonna take both so we've only got
two I want to buy more but I'm gonna
take them both with us when we moved
back in with my parents because I hate
the monks that my mum has at her house
there's such awkward small weird shape
so I like to take my own mugs which has
seems a bit weird but when you have as
much tea as I do it's important I've had
so many questions being like why are you
moving out again what's happened I
thinking some like dramatic thing has
happened I get that people don't follow
me on every platform so it's quite
difficult to keep up with what's going
on we are just moving back in with my
parents for the summer because we are
doing a house up and so obviously you
can live in your house when you do a
renovation work but it means that they
have to tidy up every day you have to
like have a temporary kitchen upstairs
like no one would actually recommend it
is an absolute nightmare so obviously a
lot of people have to do because they've
got nowhere else they can go or they've
got kids or whatever but we have the
luxury of having my parents nearby to go
and live with them so we're moving back
with my parents I'm very nervous about
it like we got on really well my parents
but you just get used to having your own
space don't you and like chilling and
evening and just having each other to
talk to and watching what you like on TV
and just being a thirty year old really
with your own space so I'm a bit like
not nervous but you know I'm gonna miss
having my own place I think but it's
gonna be really exciting it's obviously
for such a good reason so I'm really
excited for that anyway the point of me
telling you that was because we're gonna
take I'm gonna take the mugs with us
rich doesn't even know or care probably
but um I just love these and I love
everything on so her home I've been
stalking that website like crazy there
are some wall lights that I want to get
from there there's like the bins I
really like that bins for the bathroom
there's so much stuff that I want to get
on that website it's so good so I will
link that down below as well I feel like
all the next things coming up I have to
hold so let me just quickly do my
mascara because then I'm done and I
could actually hold things up to the
camera maybe this wasn't the best idea
it's too tricky to do everything at the
same time this is the benefit um was it
good bad girl bang I like it I've dried
up a little bit
okay I'm just gonna put some lip balm on
because you guys don't mind me not
wearing lipstick I'm so pale at the
moment and I really want to thank Han
and I've been sent that I love paradise
tan which everyone has been raving about
so I'm desperate to try it but I kind of
want to wait till my tattoos healed
because I'm not sure I'm really supposed
to put like fake tan on my tattoo while
it's healing so I'm waiting for that to
heal I just feel so pale at the moment
like the most pale I've ever been I'm
going away at the end of May but I don't
really sit in the Sun much so I can't
really like rely on that and wait let me
get a couple of things and then I could
talk to you about those oh my god I
forgot to show you this this is the
little magnet photo that we got from
clue quest let me see if I can show you
the girl like you normally get a little
printed photo but she was like every now
and again we're allowed to give a magnet
to our like favorite people um
la so funny so my next favorites are
Topshop tops they are just killing it at
the moment there's often a time where I
go into Topshop and I just think nothing
suits me I feel not the right age for
Topshop not the right kind of body shape
for Topshop I don't know and I struggle
to find things but I have found so many
tops recently that I like I'm sitting in
a really often so you guys know I these
tops I've had these for a while so for
the white one and the pink one and
they're kind of like cropped but long
enough that you can wear them with
high-waisted jeans so those I was loving
and then this new style which I have in
white and in yellow which I've shown you
a lot as thing I showed you this one in
the hall loving the shape of these tops
and then this one as well which I have
in black and I really want in the white
polka-dot as well it's kinda like a
tuxedo cropped shut sorry if you could
see this but I'm going to link them all
down below along with any other kind of
Topshop tops I'm loving at the moment
because they've just got some really
good ones and in this of weather we you
can just wear jeans and a top I love it
so much this shirt I'm wearing it's like
a really oversized
really oversized shirt and this is from
and other stories so i linked this down
below as well because i really liked it
okay the next favorite is my portable or
not so portable charger i think i was
talking a little log about this and i
ordered this on amazon and it came and i
was like are you joking that it's not
portable this is like a huge brick and i
was like oh so annoying so i really
I thought haven't got time to get
another one should I send it back should
I not and so many of you messaged me
like I know it's baked but it's so good
keep it it's really funny cuz when you
go on Amazon they describe this as like
it's only the weight of a can of soup
I'm like only would you really carry a
can of soup around in your handbag so
apparently it's the weight of a can of
soup but it's quite heavy and it is
quite big comparing it to my hand but it
does fit in all of my handbags most of
my handbags I wear like on a daily basis
just put it at the bottom I just like
wrap this around it but what's so great
about this is it lasts for seven charges
on like an iPhone 7 or 8 which is
amazing because the reason I never use
portable chargers is I always forget to
charge them so this lasts seven times
which is a week's worth because when I'm
out I'll only ever need to charger like
once a day so let's say this lasts a
week and then it takes ten hours to
charge you plug it into a computer but I
just do it overnight so it doesn't
really make a difference to me I'll just
plug it in the night before I know I'm
going to town the next day and the next
morning it's fully charged like yeah at
the moment it's fully charged and I just
think it's great so I'm really glad I
kept it I will link it down below it's
from Amazon but it is big and heavy be
warned but it really doesn't bother me
and I think it's totally worth it my
next favorite is so random I actually
did a job with method but this is not
part of the job I just did an Instagram
with them I wanted to put it my
favorites because I I just love it
method is a cleaning product I know that
is random to put in a favourites but
it's just such a favorite of mine my mum
has used it for years I then went on to
use it so many people I know love it I
just think it's a really cool company so
I'm so happy I got to work with them
this is their multi-surface cleaner in
there like new fancy rose gold packaging
you can't really see in this light but
it's just really great they don't use
any like toxic chemicals in their
product so if you're using it like a
surface cleaner especially if you've got
like kids who are like licking the
surfaces without using their hands a lot
it's really nice to use these sort of
more gentle products and they look great
too they always bring out like
limited-edition packaging which is
really good especially if you're like
sink is on your island you need to have
your fairy liquid out it's nice to have
one that looks nice they're like two
pound fifty or something you can get
them from the supermarket and I just
love it it makes cleaning fun I can't
just said that but it's true I think
there's all my favorites I know they're
a bit random this month I just thought
it's a nice change to do non-beauty if
you're using a lot of the same products
recently and I feel like I'm just
constantly like pushing product at you
guys so it's nice to just do something a
little bit different as I said I will
link everything down below so that you
can check out everything that I
mentioned in this video if I'm going to
go out for a bit of a walk now because
it's such a nice day but thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
