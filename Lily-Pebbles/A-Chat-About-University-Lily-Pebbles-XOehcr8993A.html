have a little sit-down casual chat about
University it's that time of year where
people are either getting their a level
results and heading off to uni or maybe
all the year before and you're still
considering whether to go or not
or maybe you're a few years behind and
you're just trying to think about the
future this video is just about my
personal experience at the Uni and my
personal opinions obviously everyone
will be completely different every
University experience is so different
unique so I just thought I would share
with you my story and answer some
questions that you guys sends me on
Twitter so first of all let me start by
telling you where I went to uni and what
I studied I went to Birmingham City
University which is obviously in the UK
and I studied marketing advertising and
PR I took a gap year beforehand and I
did not ever intend to go to university
it wasn't my plan I'm not really sure
why my mum didn't go my dad did one of
my sisters did one did and it just
wasn't really something I thought was
for me I was ready to finish school at
18 after my a-levels I was encouraged by
my career's teacher to at least try out
for one uni so I found one uni that had
one course that I quite like the sound
of which was this one and I thought I
would just apply to be honest I didn't
really understand how the whole you
caste thing worked I didn't have any
extra points because up until that point
I didn't really think I needed to so I
just gave it a go anyway and my older
sister helped me with my personal
statement because she is very good
English the night before getting my
a-levels I checked the house website and
it said I had an unconditional offer to
my university choice which was amazing I
thought I'd done so one of my a-levels
but then the next day when I actually
went to get my a level results I
realised I didn't do as well as I
thought I had or wanted to I got a C and
two DS and I got 220 UK's points and I
actually needed 240 to get in so I don't
know why I got in it might be to do my
personal statement or how many people
had tried out for the course I don't
know why but I was lucky and I got in
and at that point I thought well if I've
got in and I might as well at least go
give it a try so that's my story on how
I got into uni I wanted to be somewhere
not too far away from home so Birmingham
was about two and a half hours away from
London and that was good for me at the
time because I wanted to be able to come
home and see my new nieces and nephews
that we
being born at the time I took a gap here
because I am very Pro gap here for me I
really wanted just a break
I'd been studying from the age of 4 to
18 and I wanted a break and I wanted a
chance to kind of go up and have some
experiences I worked in my gap here I
had a job in a shop in Gap I also worked
as a runner in an advertising company I
worked as a receptionist and then I
saved up money to go traveling for three
months before my sister got married I
travelled around Australia Thailand Fiji
LA and that was an amazing experience
for me to just kind of travel the world
and you learn a lot from traveling so
I'm really happy to the gap here I
learned a lot I went traveling and I got
some really good work experience on my
CV and then a year came around and it
was time to go to uni I remember my
parents took me up to uni and they
stayed for the day you went out for
lunch and then was when it was time for
them to go home I just burst into tears
I was so upset my flat was actually
really nice it was one of those you
needs where we had like a flat of six
people and a communal kitchen and the
people in my flat were really lovely and
welcoming I and the sort of person who
gets really homesick I still do now but
back then I was even worse so I remember
for the first week during freshers week
I found it really hard I just found the
whole concept of the first week being
like party week crazy because the first
week I felt so anxious and homesick the
last thing I wanted to do was go out and
get drunk with strangers I found it
really hard I remember that I didn't
really eat much during the first week
and I lost so much weight as terrible
when I feel anxious and homesick I just
lose my appetite
I remember just eating sweet corn out
the tin and my flatmates thinking I was
really weird
I actually made really good friends of
the girl in my flat who was also finding
the first week really hard and although
I thought that was good at first she
ended up wanting to drop out and she
tried to convince me to drop out too and
I was so homesick that like and you
could have easily convinced me so she
was kind of wanting to drop out and I
was thinking about it and in the end I
just said I'm gonna give it another week
and give it a go and she dropped out and
obviously I'm so happy that I didn't
drop out because I ended up loving uni
but that first week was really hard and
someone asked if I made any friends that
I didn't end up being friends with and
obviously this girl who dropped out we
didn't end up being friends but I felt
quite sorry of her she really struggled
in that first week - I actually met rich
on the first day when I had to sign
my course which you would know if you've
watched the videos of us stood together
and luckily I had the most amazing
friends on my course I think a lot of
people that you make friends are the
people they live with but for some
reason at my uni of course I think it's
because it was quite a specific kind of
creative course we all made really good
friends so it was great we work together
we all helped each other out and it was
really nice to go in every day to
lectures and like your friends would be
there so first year I lived in halls of
residence second year I lived in a house
with four people I think and then third
year I lived in a house just with two
guys which was really easy actually I
was really lucky I had help from my
parents to pay for my rent so my student
loan which is like a loan you get from
the government paid for my tuition fees
and for me to kind of live obviously a
lot of people do have to get jobs while
they're at uni for me I just know I
would have completely failed I'm that
sort of person I really struggled in
school with education that if I don't
really concentrate on it and have no
distractions I'm just gonna fail I know
that kind of sounds a bit ridiculous but
I'm really grateful for my parents to
help for helping me out and now I'm left
with a very big loan to pay off which
did have a job at uni though he had a
job during first year a second year he
worked at a bar third year he quit his
job in his parents helped him out
because he really wanted to focus on his
dissertation and gave him a good grade
my main reason for going to uni was to
gain life experience I felt pretty
confident that the sort of course I went
to do isn't essential for getting a job
it's different if you're becoming a
doctor something where you really need
like that qualification but for me do
something like marketing advertising PR
is handy but you can easily just kind of
get work experience and work your way up
for me going to uni was about living by
myself learning how to cook for myself
meeting new friends because after school
there isn't really another time where
you get to meet a lot of people and just
all the experiences that come with going
to uni I was very aware though that when
I finished the three years if you unique
it would be really hard to get jobs and
I knew from hearing about the people who
had left the year above me that they'd
finish the course and no one really
seemed to care at the time about what
degree you had so I made it my priority
in the summers in between uni to get
jobs I interned at PR companies I
basically intent anywhere I could and by
the time I finished uni I had two pages
worth of work experience for me I knew
that would be the thing to get me a job
not necessarily my uni course it's
obviously a lot easier if you're living
in London to intern because you have
somewhere to stay because a lot of the
internships aren't paid but a lot of my
friends living out of London would stay
with cousins or friends or some of them
even stayed with me rich stayed with me
while he interned because he's not from
London after a lot of hard work and very
amazing helpful friends I somehow ended
up getting a first at uni which is crazy
for me because I never even got an A at
school but that I did think that kind of
was helpful getting a job but for my
personal experience the people I
interviewed with the way more interested
in the work experience I had interning
in the summers the minute I left
University a lot of my friends went off
traveling but I went straight into a job
straight into interning I didn't want to
waste any time for some reason I put a
lot of pressure myself and I felt very
rushed to get into the working world I
had a gap year I had three years of
study and I just wanted to get earning
money and getting a job so I went
straight to interning but on my CV again
so I had more recent experiences to talk
about interviews I don't regret going to
uni I mean I met rich at uni so that
alone is kind of worth it because I'm
gonna be with him forever so that's
amazing I also made some amazing friends
and just learnt so much about living
away from home I also started my blog at
so none of this would be happening if I
didn't go to uni I probably wouldn't
have started my blog or YouTube channel
those two things alone make it worth
going to uni for me but when it comes to
the actual course I did gain a lot of
confidence from doing presentations and
things like that I do think I still
would have been able to somehow get the
jobs that I had if I hadn't have gone to
uni I would have just started a bit
earlier and maybe if I hadn't have gone
to uni I'd be further along with my life
because I guess it's kind of like taking
three years out from moving out getting
married all those things so I feel like
I've rambled on for a while but
hopefully covered a few different topics
and some of the questions you guys sent
me I hope I answered them if you do have
any kind of queries about uni feel free
to tweet to me absolutely Pebbles I'm
happy to answer some of your questions
as I said everyone has such a different
uni experience but I loved uni and I
hated school
so maybe that will help you if you're at
school and thinking I want to drop out I
never want to do education again uni is
very different it's so fun and it's
different to having a teacher in school
the lecturers are kind of on your level
you call them by their first name and
they trust you to just do the work if
you want to do the work no one's going
to make you and I found that approach
really helped I got my head down and I
worked harder than I've ever worked in
school good luck to anyone who's going
to uni this September if you like me
also get really homesick in the first
week just try and find a friend to get
through it with you and don't worry it
will get so much better by second year
freshers I was on the freshers crew like
helping all the new freshers come in so
good luck thank you so much for watching
this video and I'll see you guys soon
