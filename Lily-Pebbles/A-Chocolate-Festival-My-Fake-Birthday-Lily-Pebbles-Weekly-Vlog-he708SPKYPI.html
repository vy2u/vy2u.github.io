Gemma's fish okay ignore the cloudy

what's this one Meg I was trying to make
a fish noise and then realize okay I'm
home I have 15 minutes to get ready for
going out for my sister's birthday need
to make my face look half decent my hair
looks such a rush please get ready
quickly
okay I've changed really quickly into
this cause top I don't know what to wear
it's like the Food Festival it's in a
warehouse so I don't know where I'm
gonna wear flat boots
what wheat feast food feast I don't know
what it's called I'll tell you when I
get there but it's a huge like three
levels of food more food you know I love
food so we're going to food Buster that
we're going to a rum bar so it kind of
one looks smart but I also want to
become three so this is what I'm wearing
I've just gone through black jeans and
this top and he put some boots on and
I've changed my bag to this bag and we
need to go Jake and Kelly you're here
Carly I'm gonna insist that we tie it to
her at all times
just to embarrass them because that's
what younger sisters that would be
annoying I know especially at a really
busy Food Festival yeah you can right we
have a problem we are too late for the
food fest or a pint that's cute for 40
minutes
so we're gonna skip the food festival in
total in total of some I sense am I
gonna go find some food and then go
straight to the rum bar which is called
portside
did you kind of run on an empty stomach
case you didn't hear what happened I
have a great tip for you guys going out
of London get birthday for Louie because
we sat down just who's the birthday girl
I was like oh I can't lie I was like my
sister she's not here shouldn't pretend
you didn't tell me that and they gave us
a bottle of Prosecco and they brought so
happy birthday to me that's great great
foam now actually gonna go find my
sister who is the birthday girl and give
her the balloon I'm feeling like a bit
too much attention is on me right now
which is leading the way to the rum bar
what are you gonna drink I knew you knew
a rum okay we're done at portside
parlour and I would recommend it when I
first got in I was so so hot I think I
was having like a slight panic attack
because it was a very claustrophobic
table and I got so so hot so I was gonna
pass out but then I got better and they
do a really really good run cocktails we
go into all the street yeah must be
goodnight rum good old-fashioned
yeah good old-fashioned rich loves an
old-fashioned so we're gonna head home
now I'm gonna finish this vlog for today
propose the morning guys I'm not gonna
show you my face but my Sunday morning
routine it consists of watching videos
especially on this kind of Sunday way
it's monthly favorites time so I'm just
watching honors and then I'll continue
on to the rest
morning it was a struggle to wake up
this morning that hour the clocks went
forward an hour in UK which means that
you basically lose an hour so when I
woke up at like 9:00 it was actually
10:00 and it just made me feel so tired
and disorientated but I've got ready
pretty quickly and we're gonna head to
Covent Garden because we're going to try
a new restaurant called Mabel's I think
it's good
which I think officially opens tomorrow
but we're getting a little bit of a
preview and we're gonna have a little
mooch around Covent Garden and haven't
done a bit of shopping with rich for a
while we might head Selfridges it's
absolutely pouring with rain so it's
like the worst day for going to coffin
garden but I want to do it anyway
because it's a Sunday and I'm hungry so
I'm looking for some food
okay we're in Covent Garden which is
trying to find Mabel's I haven't
actually looked at the menu anything so
I've no idea what sort of food is we
were meant to be in for brunch but then
it got moved up to the one o'clock so we
do have a lunch menu as well I don't
really know I'm feeling I haven't had
anything to eat yet so I could probably
still do brunch just trying to find a
parking space because parking in London
is a bitch and driving around for 10
minutes the IP parking app is great cuz
it chose to house you where the parking
bays are but it doesn't tell you where
the free ones are so you like there's no
point because they're all taken so if
you make an app that shows where the
spaces actually are we have no idea if
he pops up my leave alone
well that was nice it's always nice to
try something new it's like in an old a
really old hospital from like 1898 to
the building itself was amazing they've
done it up to be like a restaurant and
there's loads of old kind of windows
that used to be in a hospital so that
was nice
it hasn't even really opened yet though
so there's obviously like teething
problems and those would be like food
like hot milk in my tea moments and like
weird little things but that's always
the case when something's new I had a
full English in which had like a chicken
things we wanted lunch and it was good
I'd go back I'd probably go let them
kind of have a few months to practice it
go back but it's in a good situation
it's right in the middle of China garden
so it's still kind of drizzly we haven't
decided if we're gonna stay out yeah
okay somewhere in like what's in those
but I think we were the only ones there
which is a little bit awkward and they
were like practicing making their drinks
they literally like just started so many
good practices that make
so much it's just like the best
define really is just in Kate Spade and
I found this bag which I really really
like that Karen eyes that is a destroyer
on a long strap as well and a pretty
inside
just gone off to buy underwear next I
can't face next myself just waiting to
the art supply store because actually
really good place to find makeup brushes
paint brushes are like the same thing
actually better quality and Harry mixup
gave me that tip so I went to look
throughout the Japanese ones I found one
but it wasn't quite right it's pretty
hard to find those women
right so I'm going to keep the people in
the perfect paintbrush to use as a
a shi'ite powder brush we are both
feeling very uninspired in Urban
Outfitters
and properly it's a rubbish we didn't
get parking ticket results that was a
rule like secret party spot because it
looks like so you're confusing a sign it
looks like it's just for electric cars
but it's not on a Sunday so I don't know
what we're doing now we haven't
discussed it yet but we are leaving
common garden and the crazy windy
weather have my pineapple with a hint of
lime juice from expenses which is my
favorite juice I love this ok apparently
were heading to Selfridges I do have a
little voucher so I am happy to browse
the shoe galleries if there's a product
and black flap to boots I don't they do
Steve Madden there but I'd like my brown
boots in black neither of us can read
both to see anyone and we all said I
want to get home because then it's like
Sunday night feeling for left so yeah so
for jazz it is like every other weekend
we didn't quite make it to Selfridges I
started feeling really carsick and we
had to come home
okay because we had breakfast at like
1:00 or brunch whatever it was for both
but hungry now so we're gonna get busy
liquor because domina is if it's so
expensive domination assist not even
good pizza actually it's always sick so
was it okay to deliver as well you're
watching Paddington because I haven't
seen it yet apparently it's really good
and like adults liked it too
so Oh pizzas just got here okay I know
it looks like what we do is eat food
there are big gaps in between this way
what do you think of Paddington okay
very sweet
oh my lips are so sore but it's
hilarious how London is in the film like
I wish we could all live in Portobello
and it snow fluffy snow all the time
it's deafening I like that it was really
nice film I think it's worth seeing well
I think I told you my bedroom it's such
a mess I have finished tidy in my room
but I put a bit distracted by YouTube
videos so I think I'm gonna end the vlog
here because I'm not doing anything else
for the rest of the day and I'm gonna
carry on working it's normal tomorrow
edit this vlog and start movie and I
don't know what I'm gonna vlog next week
Ashley I'm real it's my diary I don't
know what's planned but I will see you
guys on Thursday for my next video which
I have not yet to film maybe that's why
I should do tomorrow I'll see you then
