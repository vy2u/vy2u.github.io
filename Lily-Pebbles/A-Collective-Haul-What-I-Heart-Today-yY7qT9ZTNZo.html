haul video so all the things I've been
buying over the last few weeks I'm not
really the sort of person who goes out
and does a massive shop all in one
because then I feel bad i spent loads of
money so I by little things sort of
often so this sort of everything I've
bought in the last few weeks and i
thought i'd show you so um i'll start
with like fashion stuff clothes and i
got a few things from Topshop my
favorite thing and which I think of one
in a video already is this denim shirt
and I used to hate denim shirts that's
because I don't really know what to wear
them with I wear jeans a lot and I
really feel comfortable wearing a denim
shirt with jeans but now you have black
jeans and I've got disco pants and
leggings so I like wearing this with
those and there's a few different ones
in Topshop at the moment this is the one
with the poppers which I really like
them and it's quite thick and I rolled
up the sleeves and it comes just sort of
blow the bomb and i really like it's
really comfy and a constant wearing it
so i can't remember her map said it was
probably about 30 pounds and i really
like that also yesterday i got a couple
of things from Topshop this vest which
was 16 pounds it's sort of like a mesh
material and it's gray I just thought
it's really nice for like layering
wearing underneath sort of a leather
jacket and highlight the pattern it's
quite long so that's this vest which was
16 pounds and then I also got this which
not really sure how I'm going to wear it
but hopefully I can I'm not a massive
fan of sleeveless tops I always or wear
a cardigan or something on top but I
quite like this so this is like a really
really thin see through vest but then I
might stand up to share this then it
kind of goes shorter at the front with a
longer bit at the back so it's quite
long and I sort of have to wear a belt
to put it in at the waist and then I
think it could look quite cool with like
a leather jacket as well in like loads
of layers and
cool tights or leggings underneath so
it's really hard to show this but this
was also 16 pounds which is quite good
quite like this and oh so a few weeks
ago I went to forever 21 and I got this
blazer haven't actually worn it yet
because I haven't figured out what to
wear it with and it's also a bit too
cold still and but it's this sort of two
tone blazer it's sort of light dusty
pink and then has grey sleeves so it
sort of looks like that um I really like
it I just haven't really figured out how
to wear it yet and I don't think it's
really warm enough yet Blazers but when
someone comes I think it's a really nice
it's quite different as well I also got
a few things from zara I love Sarah at
the moment I got this really nice orange
of coral scarf it's really really long
so you just sort of put around it's
quite nice and thick and I really like
the color and its really soft as well so
I got that and I also got this t-shirt I
showed these two in a blog post which
are linked below I got this t-shirt
which is a really nice like Aztec print
and I'm about it in like a big size I
think I've caught off the label but I
think I got in a bigger size so it was
quite loose and baggy like wearing baggy
tops and so that's really nice as well
and then because the weather so cold at
the moment I'm I kind of need more
layers but I don't want to put jumpers
on top of everything so I've got nice
shirts and stuff they wear so I got a
couple of cardigans I don't love
cardigans but these ones are really
comfy and they're just easy to throw on
so I got one in grey they're just solve
longest cardigans with like buttons down
the hands and down the front and little
pockets I got one in grey and I got one
I'm black um these are like 25 pounds
which i think is quite expensive but
they're really soft and like you can
tell they're really good quality so I
don't mind really um and then I got a
few beauty things as well I made a
little feel unique order and I got
another called early boot elixir
us because I'm nearly running out my
other one and I also got the Jemma Kidd
cream blusher or cream cheek color it's
called in poor poor number three and
music penis it looks like this so it's
sort of like a peachy pink it's really
nice i saw kate from Ghostbusters
talking about this and I just wanted a
stray away i think i like the name poor
poor it's really cute um it's really
nice it's very very creamy and share so
I first tried to use my stippling brush
in the pan and then apply in it and
didn't really work it kind of ruined the
product and then nothing really came out
I then use my finger and applied it on
my cheek and then blend it in with my
Real Techniques stippling brush and that
works really well it's a really nice
color really like easy if you want to
sort of a natural looking day in a
really nice lot packaging as well so I'm
happy with that i also got my inglot
palette which I've made a whole video on
so I don't that's gone up yet if it has
i'll link it below if not there's a
whole video coming on it so i really
talk about it but this is my palette and
these are the colors that i made my put
together so I'm really really happy with
that fact excited to tell you all about
it I got a couple of mac lipsticks as
well again this is like over a few weeks
I have just gone out and bought all the
stuff in one go I got the fever gap glam
five lipstick which Tanya burr from
pixie to e talks about a lot so I really
wanted to try it and it looks like this
um it's kind of like a neutrally brown
pink but I do like it it's just a bit
gritty I think there's like glitter in
it and I find it a bit gritty when I
wear it but it is quite nice it's not my
favorite but be alarm lipsticks and when
he goes to charity anyway so I'll never
regret buying a Viva Glam lipstick the
other one I got with hot gossip which is
a chrome machine which I'm wearing now
which is a really nice sort of slightly
brighter pink I really like this
actually every wearing this a lot I've
kind of got halfway through already and
that's only probably French cream cheese
you do get through them quickly because
there's such a soft formula but it's
really nice and wearing it now and I
really like
yeah i also got from mac a tender tome I
one I got was in hush hush which is a
from the shop Mac cook mac wrote it's
called collection and which looks like
this it's really nice peachy Goldie
color and this smells amazing it really
reminds me of like the lip balms I used
to wear when I was little really sweet
sort of strawberry smelling really nice
um it's in a pot like lava the other mac
products which is a bit annoying for a
lip balm because I use lip balm a lot
like on the chief and there's been known
to have to use your finger but it's kind
of all right with these because they're
not sticky so what's you've used each
sort of rubber finger on the back of
your hand and it all goes away you're
not left like sticky fingers so I do
really like this it looks a lot more
gold and shimmery in the pot than it
does in your lips which witness on your
lips is just a really nice sort of lip
gloss and I really like that another
couple of things I got from Mac which
I've done a blog post on and i'll link
below a couple of things from the new
hey sailor collection which has this
really nice little stripy packaging and
it's all like sailor themed the first
thing i got was jaunty which is a frost
i shadow and that looks like this i'm
absolutely obsessed with this color it's
so nice it's like a champagne gold so if
you kind of see on my finger I'm so easy
to just wear all over the lid I've
literally be wearing this every day
since I got it and I really really like
it um and the other thing i got was a
blusher which is in fleet fast i just
really hard to say um and it looks like
this it's kind of like a peachy pink
it's actually a lot brighter than you
think when I put it on I was like wow
that's actually quite bright but it's
really nice and it's kind of similar to
other ones I've got but I can always
have more blushes I really like the
packaging than this so happy I got that
there's the kind of the only two things
from that collection that really stood
out to me and but I'm happy with them
and I think they're really good i'd
recommend them i also picked up another
kate moss room or lipstick because i
really like the other two i had i got
number three which is a really like
neutral color and i do like this it I
don't like it as much as the other ones
I've got which are six
aight i think um but it is nice see if i
can show you it's quite orangie but
here's nice sort of every day and it
again really nice of soft creamy formula
so easy to wear I think one of the
favorite things I got is this soap &amp;amp;
Glory hand sanitizer I'm already a big
hand sanitizer and I always have one in
my bag because I'm gonna achieve a lot
and I love soap and Gloria the hand food
hand cream it's so nice and this is
exactly the same so if you like that
sent you need to get this oh it's called
handmade hand cleansing gel and it's a
nice little travel-size bottle and it
just smells so good because a lot of
hazards just stink of alcohol and it has
a nice scent to it so I think keeping
this in my handbag and since I've got it
and i also got something from the lush I
got two things I got the ocean salt face
scrub and if you follow me on Twitter
Instagram you would have seen that I
used it one night for having a bath and
it completely burnt my face off like it
killed and I was so red for like a day
so I had a really really awful
experience for that um did I maivia's
too much products that may have rubbed
it in too harsh but I'd okay I'm not
trying again and was horrific so that's
gone in the bin but i also bought this
breath of fresh air tonal water and i
really like this actually um it's a
fresh toner this is sort of one for all
skin types they had a few different ones
but I've got kind of normal skin so I
just got this one and the only thing is
the spray is quite like direct so if you
spray it right on your face you kind of
get soaked in it hurts a bit so I just
spray it on a bit of cotton wool and
then rub it over my face before bed it's
just it's just really fresh smelling
this is nice i don't know how good it is
for your actual skin but it's doing well
on my skin and I've really enjoyed using
it so that's everything from my
collective haul I hope you've enjoyed
seeing all the things that I've got so
that hope it I just filmed was this
morning but then I went out and I bought
some more stuff and they didn't want to
wait for the next video so I have to
show you quickly the things that I just
got today when I went out so I'm you
into spitalfields and today in East
London and it was actually really
raining too we didn't stay for long but
I went about
it is because there's a new massive
store there and we were actually going
to rich to bind some trousers but of
course i had to browse a bit and i saw
this really nice time so this is what it
looks like it was 35 pounds which is
quite expensive but urban outfitters is
not that bad it's from the sparkle and
fade collection and it looks like this
so it's got kind of this gray pattern on
the front end down half of the arm and
the rest of the arm has a sort of black
sheer panel in the black and back and
then the back is like this black sheer
thing that's kind of longer at the back
and it's really nice it looks really
nice on so I had to get that and then I
also in tazara and I've been wanting
this jacket ages everyone has it it's
one of those jackets it and my best
friend even has it so I had to ask her
if it was okay but she said it was a
case I had to get it and I've talked
about it a lot on Twitter so you're
probably seen a photo already but it's
this cocky jacket with the leather
sleeves I really liked it it was 90
pounds which is really expensive but I
think for like a good jacket it's okay
Dino wear it for a while it'll sort of
it's warm enough for now and also I
think it'll be light enough when it
starts getting a bit hotter so it's
quite like thick cocky material in right
with gold detailing and the gold zipper
gold buttons and it's got a nice big
collar as well and then the arms are
leather and it's quite short where's
like it's not a long hoped long jacket
and there's a little zip on their
sleeves as well and I really like it
terms i'm really happy i got it and yeah
those are the two things i got so how to
quickly show you but thank you for
watching this video and see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
