evening skincare routine and I'm about
to go to bed you haven't went crazy is
Monday my weekly vlog has gone up a day
early this week because vlogmas starts
tomorrow so I want to get this vlog up
first and show you what I got got up to
on the weekend so it's Thursday night
now I've had a really good weekend I've
basically just been doing a lot of work
trying to get ahead before the craziness
of vlogmas starts I went to Zoe's book
launch at the beginning of the week and
that was really nice and I went out for
a really Christmassy dinner with Clarins
and in between that just lots of work
but tomorrow I'm going on a trip with
Anna and we are so excited because our
boyfriend's get to come this time they
never get to come and do like fun stuff
with us so we're so excited we're going
away with Barbour and we're going up to
Newcastle I think that's where they're
based and we're basically gonna spend
tomorrow out their factories seeing how
all their jackets are made and then the
boys are coming up to the weekend and
we're staying a little cottage and
having a nice that cozy winter weekend
so we're gonna be getting up to some fun
activities and just having a nice time
all together before Christmas starts and
Anna remark will be going home for
Christmas and probably won't see each
other much so I think it'll be a really
nice weekend all four of us together so
I'll vlog again tomorrow when I'm on my
way and I'll see you guys then okay I'm
at Kings Cross and I just least find
Anna I found Anna and it was bit
confusing because I was in I was into
pancreas she's even cut gains cost and I
don't know idea I'm so bad with trains
cuz I drove to Union and I got the train
Tina so she's like the Train expert and
now she's a we're getting a train to
Edinburgh but via Newcastle oh no idea
it goes all the way zen room we have to
get off early
okay I'd probably sell its alleged
profiles of myself who arrived in New
Castle the train journey was great and
we're about to have a tour of the barber
offices Philip me and Anna accidentally
Matt shy outfits great old black Jeep
so we've spend the day looking around
the barber head office and we went down
to where they make the samples and learn
about how they cut all the materials and
it's so so interesting I mean I was
interested before but I don't think I
realized how incredible it is and
obviously the barber jackets are really
super expensive and I looked at them
online I was like wow but then when you
come here and you actually learn about
the whole story and how they're made in
the whole process you realized why
they're expensive and it's amazing they
were like how made and designed and it's
so the detail is insane and we looked at
all they're kind of old hopes some were
like 100 years old that they've got in
their archives and it's just so
interesting and it's real like UK brands
so I really enjoyed that and I've had a
really good day of really enjoyed it if
you enjoyed it really enjoyed it it
makes me want to so yes I mean you want
to wear a jacket if I tried to so it
would be a disaster so I think we're
heading out now for an early dinner and
then we're gonna go to a little cottage
we're staying for the weekend and plan
is games pajamas get into my cashmere
socks that I pull up with me for special
occasions and watch goggle box with a
hot drink and I think that's going to be
a chocolate and Chuck that I'm so
excited but see we're in a place with
