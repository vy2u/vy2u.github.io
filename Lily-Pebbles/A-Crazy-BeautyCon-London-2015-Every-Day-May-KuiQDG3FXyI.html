suddenly got really nervous for today
but yeah I'm really excited to meet
loads of people and we're going to do a
panel which I have no idea what the
panel's about an apparently everyone
else has been setting the questions so
I'm probably going to say something
stupid and not know what I'm talking
about and then we've got meet up and
