morning is beautycon today I'm so
nervous
I don't know why I've been like anxious
all night I think it's other stuff as
well but I feel quite nervous for today
I've just been getting ready all morning
so I am wearing my Topshop shorts this
Topshop doll kind of jumper thing this
necklace is from brandy melville and
this is my case fade necklace and then
I've done my makeup using like Mac
patina on the eyes my face is kind of
the same and then on my lips I've
layered on Charlotte Tilbury matte
revolution in lost cherry with Tom Ford
wild ginger so lost cherry is like a
pinky red and while gingers like an
orange red so I think it kind of goes
with the neon yellow I've never thought
so much about my makeup and outfit
before I don't know why I've like
suddenly got really nervous for today
but yeah I'm really excited to meet
loads of people and we're gonna do a
panel which I have no idea what the
panel is about and parenting everyone
else has been setting the questions so
I'm probably gonna say something stupid
and not know what I'm talking about and
then we've got a meet-up and then I'm
just gonna like wander around and meet
everyone and yeah exciting day then I'm
going straight out tonight so I need to
now think about taking the change of
clothes and kiss I'm cold I don't really
know but yeah I need to eat some
breakfast and really decent breakfast
today okay I'm having avocados on toast
what'd she ever called a monster so it's
kind of a healthy breakfast hopefully
this will keep me going I don't know if
this give me any food at beautycon but
we have this for now we're just gonna
sit and watch yesterday's Hollyoaks
before we go gonna go pick up Anna on
the way I know I'm gonna be starving
later if I don't eat now so although
it's not even midday yet I've picked up
a couple of sushi bits cucumber Maki and
salmon Maki I think too heavy but looks
delicious
okay we're nearly at Westfield which is
where we're gonna meet Anna she's
getting achieved there and I'm feeling a
bit nervous about this panel thing I
think it's only because everyone else
knows the questions so they're gonna
have really like profound answers
prepped so apologies if anyone's gonna
be watching my panel I think I'm doing
one which is about like beautiful inside
and out so I'm gonna be like yeah just
be really nice great
so I don't really know what I'm saying
but yeah nearly there
I think it's really mental I've been
looking on twitter the hashtag and
they're like so many people there are so
many stands and very rich said he might
come at the end to say hi if he's
feeling brave because you're picking us
up so I said come early and never say hi
to everyone

very pretty on top you look comfy comfy
