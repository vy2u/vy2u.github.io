today and London is having some kind of
serious heatwave yesterday with crazy
crazy hot and it's going to be 30
degrees again today I think 30 degrees
for those of you who live in a hot
country may not sound that hot but
London just isn't cut out for getting
this hot because it's like a proper City
and like I have a garden in aircon
so last night I hardly slept it was a
bit of a disastrous night and it's so
hot but I've got a full day in town
today of me teams and all different
kinds of things I'm going to be vlogging
and honestly I have done the ultimate
lazy girl thing and I booked myself a
blow-dry this morning because the idea
of having to straighten my hair and this
heat is just I mean I don't even think
I'd be able to I think it would just go
curly like as I straighten it so I'm
going to drive by this morning I'm
getting a quick blow drys before a full
day of meetings so I'm going on a tube
like this I'm just Roopa so I don't see
anyone and first going to do is my maker
this is what I wanted a necklace of
Thomas Omer just t-shirts of Brick Lane
that's from in fact awful Brown I hate
it and he does one side brandy melville
skirts and Topshop shoes are Steve
Madden flag is Gucci
so her disco bag even this I am
absolutely boiling okay blow-dried i'ma
had a girl called Praveena
and she was so great because they'd be
kind of different when I do my hair and
I never have to go to the hairdresser so
she was right and now I'm going to go
buy my sister birthday cause I've come
into gleam and because I've got meeting
and I'm going to quickly go through my
PU box haven't been here in a little
while let me show you guys some cool
stuff I've been sent this is the
pavillion bom bom cream which i've got
in a mini version it's a really nice
moisturizer so i'm going to take that
and i've got some really nice new things
from see or maybe i'll show you guys
when I get home and I open them up also
these like bronzing jellies and you'll
sound interesting this is from this
works is perfect body muscle therapy so
it's good when you got sore muscles
which I do every week when I try and
exercise and then also some new Revlon
sauces or now I'm just opening this box
which is from Kiki K which is a
stationary brand I absolutely love Anna
and I have a meeting this morning with
the charity called coppaFeel which
hopefully we're going to be working with
and really excited about it so we're
going to kind of meet with them and see
what we can do to get involved so if
that all goes ahead I'll show you guys
properly about the charity then alright
we finished our first meeting and it was
really good I'll tell you guys all about
it I think next month when we're going
to do a little shoot with them Anna's
here and we we've accidentally matched
today I'm wearing a white t-shirt
reddy-orange e skirt Anna's our own a
white t-shirt and a red Lea right yeah
with something oh yeah
and then a red skirt oh my shoes yes yes
oh yeah for every little gap between
every meeting is filled
I didn't often come into town and get
really certain so I just ran and other
stories panic bought a dress my friend's
wedding and I thought I'll try on at
home and see if I like it
now I'm rushing to blink brow bars speak
the Vitesse with my favorite eyebrows
redder I'm going to get my eyebrows
teamed and then I've got a meeting at
Percy and founders with Bobby Brown last
year's of the friendly lady ever
eyebrows done very quick and did a very
good job as always is going to go find
Anna and she's hanging in Topshop and
then we're gonna head to the next
meeting together another very successful
shopping trip then I think like the
fabasoft on lines we just had a quick
you're meeting with the PR from Bobby
Brown because the products we provide
like typically stop coming up in
September and added I realize I'm going
to be faced the state here at Purdue
founders we're going to have lunch I
convenient chicken burger with crushed
avocado Anna's having his usual yeah who
hasn't lost one no you look really good
I don't think so I go because it's
yellow
yeah it is it's so good you haven't been
our definite recommender I just let the
lovely ladies from Miss nomer
as I said they made this necklace and
they've got so many other beautiful
jewelry pieces and we would just have
never really met and they thought I
bought this and they're like let's meet
and chat and we're talking about like
the future things that we can maybe do
together and they are a hilarious little
duo they were really fun um so that was
a nice easy now I'm heading back to
science and cuz we're going on to our
next thing we're in a very quiet tube
position to my work there are people on
the platform but people are talking
London's it's very quiet and we're going
to and what I really for anyone talking
we're going some except house because
I'm doing the job this Peroni which you
would have seen on my Instagram I'm just
going to go look at there and it was
really cool like roof God's think I'm
making an economy she's going to help
you take over so quiet
it's really choir make you scream over
at some of the house spread a little bit
rusty very hard for here's where the
little thing is that we kind of come
visit so now you have it all looks
replication the melting
this is a big lineup train to Richmond
and as we come in a minute to get mono
train maricon I'm giving the tube home I
have literally put in it an octave let
me do that press the upper lip below
I feel like this vlog is just turned
into one big moan about the weather I
feel like a lot of people have normal
office jobs to send aircon rooms all day
this flat is so hot you know all the
windows I decided that it's worth having
terrible hey Cesar so that I can have a
bit of a breeze that open the windows
and I've tied my hair up and I put on
some strange like best I thought I
couldn't show you what I bought I got
this dress from and other stories I only
have like 10 minutes try on so I want to
try all more at home and see if I really
like it I thought for my best friend's
wedding in August could be really pretty
is red with white polka dots it's quite
high next and then it just kind of goes
out and it's quite Chloe and I just felt
like red is a nice color to wear for
wedding I'm going to try that one again
I feel like I try to attend it felt
quite tight but then I knew the child
would be too big from Topshop I bought
this jumpsuit I actually also bought
this thinking it would be good for my
friend's wedding I'm going to try on
them both to AB ferb also got the gleam
and summer party so I could always wear
this to that so it's a little place suit
there goes off the shoulder it's this
really nice pale blue with yellow
flowers and it looks like a jumpsuit I'm
going to try that on as well also from
Topshop I didn't try any of these ons in
the time I just kind of grabbed them I
thought there it felt it and back this
is like a little summer dress it's a
little wrap dress I'll try that on and
see what it looks like and I've got my
sister a dress for her birthday which
I'm not sure she liked my gonna see what
did I get from my tear box I can show
you guys okay I kind of showed you
everything I didn't show you the deal
set this is a natural healthy glow
radiance powder what's a nice bronzy
shade give that a go
this is an eyeshadow quad it's got three
really nice bronzy shades a kind of very
yellowy gold in the middle and then a
pale champagne I wouldn't wear these two
colors but these three look nice give
those shadows this is the deal skin nude
air Luminizer in shade three if I can
really run Z liquid
I don't know if that's going to be too
much for me I'm gonna put one drop on my
hand and see actually that's really nice
now I'll just add a little bit of a
bronzy color to my face you get that it
goes well throwing away all the rubbish
as I go put some nice stuff to try in
here actually where are those your I
think I left the do lipsticks for next
time
oh no so take the right packaging these
are new from deal they are the lips
tattoos the colors didn't look up very
me but let me just try it for the
formulas is really sheer I'm guessing
that kind of oops I think that dries is
like a stain it's a very kind of wet
sheer formula if I can find a shade that
suits me it could be quite nice so now I
think I showed you guys the other stuff
this is the John sue I really like it my
only chapters bright comes up quite high
so I have to like save deepen that to
make sure it doesn't go too though I
really like the top I'm not sure how
flattering it is on my like hip area
which I find a lot of jumpsuit
especially if there's nothing going on
in the tummy I'm not sure I feel like I
could get away with it but it's not like
most subtly I definitely wouldn't wear
it's my friend's wedding but maybe we're
into the summer party I don't think it's
that flattering from like here for here
which is obviously my like most
difficult part can't for the life of me
figure out where the botton is that
connects this I kind of start up but not
properly I really like the style of this
dress it's a bit like the ones that are
mango doing at the moment I'm not sure
if I love the links of length of sleeve
and also the material is a bit line
again cheap so I could get very sweaty
so I like the shape of the dress I can
really like this part
I think the waist and this kind of
ruffle bit is nice I'm not entirely sure
that these this neckline and this these
arms suits me I'm going to have a proper
look without the camera and decide this
is a dress from and other stories I
really liked the top it's quite dubious
because it goes in underneath I don't
really love this panel I do cry at the
top I like feeling of the skirt and it's
got slits kind of either side which
makes it really nice and like summery
and it's not full length it's not too
smart but again I feel like I don't
think it's a fluttering around my tummy
area
I feel like this bit I just I don't know
how I feel about it it's kind of merely
what I wanted I'm going to show my
friend Deb all of these things and she
comes over and Friday and see what you
think but I'm not sure this might look a
little bit like frumpy on me
I haven't really blogged for the past
few hours I think the last time I
vlogged was when I got home
I'm now lying on the bed next to a
massive IKEA bag I think it's just full
of clean clothes our food shopping
arrived late so we had to get takeaway
because we had no food to cook but the
food shopping has arrived so we can
actually cook for the rest of the week
which got home and we've just been
watching love island and first date and
I've been doing emails with obviously I
wasn't at my computer all day so it had
a lot of you must reply to so I've done
that it's Tuesday night so I've been
scheduling tweets about tomorrow's
podcast because I think tomorrow's one
is going to be with Liz Elle boy this
log is going up next week so when this
flow goes up our interview with Georgie
Cleve who's the founder of Ostia will be
up I think go check the link in the
description box to our podcast about

guest episode 10 we wanted it to be a
really good one so we left it free for
quite a while we've just confirmed our
