to do a London style video for so so
long I get so many requests I've lived
in London my whole life so I get a lot
of questions about places I recommend
going in London and I love exploring
London and going to new restaurants and
galleries and markets so I also love
different recommendations London is huge
though it doesn't feel huge when you're
used to it when you live in it but
looking at a map I have a little Tube
map here it's big there's lots of areas
so I'm going to do my best today to
recommend places to visit areas to go to
please bear in mind that I can't talk
about everywhere it's just too much it's
too huge and I don't know everywhere I'm
still discovering new things all the
time every weekend
I don't really know South London that
well but I'm going to try and touch on
all the different kind of central ish
areas this video isn't really aimed at
people who have never been to London I
haven't spoken that much about touristy
stuff this is just the stuff that I
would recommend doing and stuff that I
wouldn't want people to miss out on when
they come to London I would really
recommend printing off a tube map and do
not be scared of the tube it's so easy
to use once you understand it it's
really great for giving you around
places also bear in mind the lot of
central London is very close together
the amount of times I find tourists
asking me how to get to Leicester Square
when they're standing and Covent Garden
and they don't realize it's literally
like five seconds up the road so just
look at a map and you'll realize that
places like oxer Circus Piccadilly Bond
Street Covent Garden are all in walking
distance from each other but for any
where there isn't walking distance the
tube is very easy to use so please take
my recommendations and use Google
alongside them to kind of work out the
best routes for you and the best places
to visit this is just a slight overview
of my London recommendations okay
intro over let's get into this so let's
start just south of the river and I love
spending time on the south bank which is
just along the Thames I like to walk
from the Millennium wheel all the way
down and you go past the globe
Shakespeare's theatre which is really
pretty to look at and around there is
the clink which is like the first ever
prison and I just love it round there
because you can really imagine like the
olden times and it's all cobbled these
streets and I love the feel around there
you can walk past the Tate Modern which
is a really lovely gallery
is free to go in a few of the
exhibitions you have to pay for but you
can definitely go in have a look in the
shop it's great at Christmastime there's
a really nice Christmas market along the
south bank and in the summer they have a
dabeli which is like a kind of comedy
festival thing with Pimm's and outside
benches it's really nice to go sit again
it's free entry and then still south of
the river is Bora market it's one of my
favorite food markets it's so kind of
buzzing and full of life on the weekends
it's mainly a food market there's also
vanilla s'right there which is a really
cool place to go for wine-tasting
and as those are nice little restaurants
and cafes I just love walking through a
bar market and trying all the amazing
food and coffee now let's head a little
bit south west towards kind of Sloane
Square and Sloane Street Station around
there is a really pretty area to walk
around it's crazy expensive and I feel
like you kind of look around thinking
like is this real but it's also just
quite nice to walk around and it is it's
just a really pleasant area and the
saatchi gallery is there which is
literally top of my list of galleries to
visit in London is free entry and it's
incredible I love the sort of art that's
there it's not just like paintings on a
wall they have amazing installations
they had huge giant ants like on the
wall and giant people that they've made
they've got like an oil room where you
just look down it's filled with oil it
just looks like a reflection of the
ceiling it's really interesting
I love saatchi gallery and right next
door there's a Comptoir Leben a I think
it's called which is a really good like
Lebanese chain restaurant that's really
nice
still that side of town is High Street
Kensington that's the local tube station
and that's a really nice High Street
full of shops and that's where Whole
Foods is the original Whole Foods in
London it's huge it's like three floors
it's an amazing kind of healthy food
store and there's restaurants on the top
floor or like little food stands it's so
so nice I love going to Whole Foods and
also in that area is guru makeup
Emporium which if you are a beauty lover
is a really cool website they now have a
little shop in High Street Ken and you
can get kind of makeup forever and a few
brands you can't find elsewhere also
that side of town is Notting Hill if
you've seen the film Notting Hill you'll
know how beautiful it is again a very
expensive area but really nice to walk
around on the weekends you have
Portobello market which has a lot of
antiques old cameras clothes a bit of
food flowers as well it's just really
nice to walk
along the market at the North Kensington
side of Portobello market is bluebells
cafe which my friend actually owns and
it's great and Pizza East which is a
really really great restaurant I love
has amazing pieces and the Westbourne
Grove end of Portobello market I really
really like for walking around there's
like a dip teak store there's otter
leggy which is lovely for lunch and
Tom's kitchen it's nice to just go there
and pretend that's where you live it's
just a really nice area to walk around
okay so let's go more central now and
Bond Street is the station to go to if
you want to go to Selfridges there's so
many areas around here that I'm going to
miss out because it's just too much to
talk about
but I love Selfridges I don't know why
it just feels kind of less touristy but
it has everything I need it's not kind
of intimidating it's not like Harrods
which I find a bit kind of intimidating
I love Selfridges on the top floor
there's actually a secret roof and at
the moment they've got a restaurant
called la Chalet which is really nice
there's like blankets little feels like
a ski chalet and they do really good
lunch and dinner and tea then they're
going to shut down for a few weeks in
March and then reopen for the summer
because there's an outdoor bit and it's
going to be all summery
but that's always changing I think there
was a crazy golf up on that roof once
it's always different things and there's
like a secret lift to get to it near the
Chanel perfume stand there's also a few
like hidden restaurants around that kind
of Bond Street area there's smack
lobster which does really great lobster
rolls for lunch it's a very casual not
really like a sit-down restaurant place
more like a pop in get a lobster roll
and go there's meat liquor which is
behind Debenhams a really cool burger
restaurant I definitely recommend that
if you like burgers also patty and bun
is around there that's great as well so
heading up towards oxes Circus you're
walking up Oxford Street towards Oxford
surface that's where like the big Top
Shop is behind that is riding house cafe
a really nice restaurant and opposite
eyes caffeine a really great place for
coffee opposite Topshop is Liberty I
would definitely recommend going there
it's crazy expensive no one really shops
there I mean the beauty hall everything
is the same prices everywhere else but
the clothes are crazy expensive it's
just such a beautiful old building
definitely worth visiting some of my
friends who have grown up in London have
never been there and I just can't
believe it because I love to go in and
walk around it's all kind of wooden and
has such an old amazing feel to it and
just behind Liberty is Carnaby Street
which is really cool that kind of
reminds me of like the sixties time in
London
chucky wucky doo-dah is just behind
Carnaby Street and there's brandy
melville and there's a few cool shops
down there if you've a see a really nice
meal no P is at the end of Carnaby
Street and that's a really really nice
restaurant so if you go down Carnaby
Street kind of end up around the
Piccadilly Circus area there's a
restaurant called Shore you there that
does really authentic ramen I really
love that place and apparently in a
Piccadilly Circus there's a really good
donut place it's called crosstown donut
I haven't managed to try it yet because
every time I go it's close I keep going
at night but apparently they do really
good donuts and I'm definitely gonna try
some next time I'm near Piccadilly
Circus
there's loads of restaurants and places
around Piccadilly Circus I recommend
heading more into Soho where there's
lots of little restaurants and cool
record shops that sort of Wardour Street
area is really cool to walk around and
discover like little restaurants so if
you head through Soho you kind of end up
in the Covent Garden Leicester Square
area
I can't them it's like the same thing
and right next to each other less the
squares a bit more touristy Covent
Gardens a bit more chilled in Covent
Garden you have the big piazza which is
the big square in the middle and there's
a lot going on there there's shops
there's bends cookies a Shake Shack
that's probably the more touristy part
Covent Garden but recently they opened
lots of little beauty stores around
there it's like a clinique shop and
urban decay shop and roam alone all
these little boutiques as a Bobbie Brown
like brands that don't normally have
their own shops have opened their own
beauty boutiques and the Chanel and
Burberry so I definitely recommend going
there if you want beauty stuff if you
had to Neal's Yard which is a little
hard to find but just ask or look on the
map it's like a secret courtyard in
Covent Garden and in there some really
cute juice shops and it's all kind of
painted in bright colors and that's
where you'll find Home Slice which is
definitely one of my favorite places to
go for pizza they're huge you buy them
by the slice or you can share a big 22
inch they are delicious just through
Neal's yard you'll find Monmouth Street
and I really like the street as well
Monmouth Coffee is on there which does
the best coffee in London I think I'm
not a coffee kind of expert but that's
daily coffee I really like because it's
so smooth and not at all bitter
there's loads of little nice cafes and
shops there and a chordally spot it's a
nice relaxed kind of street to walk up
okay so now let's head to East London
where you will find Liverpool Street
Station around here is where
Spitalfields market is which is
definitely better on a Saturday I think
I
like spitter field it definitely has a
more of an East London feel than the
other markets I think is mainly clothes
I never really buy anything when I go
but it's just nice to look around and
it's a nice mix of proper shops they
have like Space NK and market as well
which is just behind they have another
friend's cafe to recommend my friend has
a cafe quill trade which is really great
it's just around the corner so I would
recommend that and if you want something
super fancy duck and waffle is just
around the corner that's in the Heron
tower so it's like the top floor of this
huge building you get a lift it's really
scary but once you're up there it's
amazing it's just above sushi Sambo
which is also really nice for cocktails
and sushi but duck more4 is incredible
it's just the most amazing restaurants
over 24 hours so you can go for a coffee
at 3 a.m. and they'll be there and it's
really fun so let's walk over to Brick
Lane and that's still East London it's
known for its Indian restaurants so on a
Saturday night is kind of buzzing and
there's all these Indian restaurants and
people outside trying to get you in
seems a bit like holiday like a strip
when you're on holiday but the
restaurants are actually really good
I've eaten in quite a few of them before
and it was proper good Indian but
there's also a Mexican place called DF
Mexico that I would really recommend
they do great frozen margaritas and
really good Mexican food and just around
that Brick Lane area during the day
there's a lot of second-hand fashion
stores it's really cool to look around
and the summer there's loads of outdoor
bars you just get like Pimm's and sit on
a bench it's a very cool like young
trendy feel around they're over by
Shoreditch and Hoxton is where the
Breakfast Club is I love that for
breakfast and brunch and Hoxton square
is really good for a night out I
definitely say if you are in London and
you want to go out to bars and clubs on
a Saturday night Shoreditch in Hoxton is
really fun got a nice atmosphere but the
places played good music and it just has
a good feel to it
ok so let's head a bit more North London
which is a bit more residential but
we'll start at angel which is Islington
area Upper Street is one of the best
high streets in London I think it's very
underrated because most people who go
there just live around there but there's
so many amazing shops and restaurants
and it's such a long high street if you
find a Camden Passage which is just
behind it's like a secret little passage
there's a little market stands on the
weekend and there's a place called
coffee works it's a really cool place to
sit and have a coffee and a slice of
cake as a very cool feel to it it's just
behind super drive if you know what that
is there's also a restaurant called meat
people which is more kind of that
end of our streets and that's really
basic but really nice for just like
steak and chips feels like you're just
sitting in someone's kitchen and then if
you just walk down the street you'll see
all the kind of shops there's whistles
there's an otter Lengai there's a really
cool ice-cream place it's just
everything you need basically on that
high street and then the next stop is
Camden Camden the station is a really
easy one to get to and Camden Market is
very famous in London it's a huge
tourist attraction but it still feels
like you're just going somewhere kind of
local and quite chilled it can get very
busy but if you kind of know where to go
it's quite easy to navigate around the
Main Street I wouldn't recommend it's
kind of full of tattoo parlors and
places to get piercings and it can be
quite intimidating but if you go into
the market
it's just along the canal it's really
nice to walk along the canal which can
take you all the way to East London if
you want it to but Camden Market is so
cool it has a real kind of like 60s
hippie feel to it you can buy jewelry
you can basically buy anything you like
and there's a huge food market in there
as well which is so nice in the summer
you can just get some food and go sit by
the canal and I absolutely love Camden
Market don't be afraid to like explore
there's so many different parts to it
there's the stables which has recently
kind of been renovated and it's really
cool but then I also love that outdoor
bit as well just look around you can
spend ages there is bigger than you
think is and then I think the most
naught I'm going to recommend is
Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill I
can't miss that because how's that Heath
is such a beautiful part of London I
think when people think of London they
just think of the hustle and bustle and
busyness but perhaps that Heath is huge
it's just a huge green area and you feel
like you're in the countryside if you're
going to be near the kind of Highgate
area I don't know you might be staying
there you can walk all the way from
Highgate through Hampstead Heath and end
up in Hampstead HAP's there's a really
cute little High Street it has a real
villagey feel to it if you don't want
that kind of busy central London feel go
to Hampstead Primrose Hill such a nice
high streets and they're not that far
from town especially Primrose Hill you
can walk up from Rose Hill and you can
see like the whole of London it's the
most amazing view and that little High
Street is great I've spoken about green
breweries cafe loads of times to read a
nice place for lunch there's just loads
of places on that high street that are
really nice if you're in Highgate you
definitely have to go to the craft
brewery they do the best preps
there's normally a queue but it's so
worth it it's just a little stand and
there crepes are amazing so I know that
was a lot of
information but I'm going to make a
serious description box here and I think
I'm going to do a blog post to go with
this I will link to every single thing
that I mentioned I'll type it all out
for you guys and I hope that this was
interesting or helpful I'm sorry if it
was overwhelming but I'm aware that
people will be in different areas so
kind of take from it what you want and
adapt it to your trip to London thank
you so much for watching this video guys
and I'll see you on Tuesday for my next
one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
