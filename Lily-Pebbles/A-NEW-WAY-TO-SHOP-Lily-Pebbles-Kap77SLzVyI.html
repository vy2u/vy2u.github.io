Wow it's early I woke up this early in a
long time but I have a busy day I'm
gonna get ready because my hair it's
mental and my face needs some makeup on
it right I could say morning now I've
done my makeup and my hair today is a
very busy day first thing I'm doing this
morning is heading to Kiki K in Covent
Garden because I am working with Kiki
Kay they're actually sponsoring this
video and I've already done like a part
one of this job which was filming the
video for their YouTube channel and it
was a really fun day they filmed it and
edited it and created this like
beautiful video all about Christmas
wrappings so I'm actually gonna link
that in the description box if you'd
like to learn more about how to wrap
your Christmas presents beautifully or
if you just want to watch a really
pretty video because it came out really
well so I've done that and then today
they're inviting me into their store if
you don't know Kiki kay is a Swedish
design brand who specializes in
stationary gifting and home where I've
always loved the brand I think it's just
a really sophisticated way to do
stationery it's like fun but
sophisticated so they're inviting me
into the store this morning before
opening hours to take a little peek
around their Christmas and gifting
collection they do so many different
things so I know there's gonna be a
whole range of stuff that's definitely
right for my Christmas shopping this
this year so that's the first thing I'm
doing and I'm really looking forward to
going into the couple garden store with
them and then I am going to do a charity
thing which I'll tell you more about
I've got a couple of meetings and then
some friends are coming over tonight so
busy day need to put my straighteners
away I am aware that I haven't yet kind
of talked to you guys much about the new
house and stuff I will do a video on
that next I think I'm in my bedroom he
has to tear the doors off our wardrobe
because they absolutely stunk I just
don't know what the last people who
lived here did to them but they reek so
he took the doors off and we're trying
to figure out what to do about wardrobes
because we want built-in wardrobes but
we can't do that until we do the room up
and we can't do the room up until we
redo the electrics so we're kind of
stuck with this weird shiny gray
wallpaper and doorless wardrobes for now
it's very frustrating but I'm so happy
to be here I'm just so happy in general
at the moment like it was such a
nightmare
to keep writing a book and moving house
a secret and it completely overwhelmed
me if I'm honest I've had a really tough
a few months so right now to like be in
the house and be so happy here and
announce the book and it gone down so
well I just feel so content and happy
right now it really is such a relief
it's like the best part of my year so
far I just like last I was sitting on
the sofa watching TV with my like big
throw around me and I was like yeah I'm
happy this is great oh my god over five
minutes to leave I haven't had any
breakfast why does this always happen in
an hour how was it hour gone already I'm
so into this red coat from Reese and I
figured out how to make it less Martine
McCutcheon in Love Actually pair it with
really casual stuff so like denim blue
denim jeans and trainers and then I
think it looks really cool I think if I
wore it with a full black outfit look
really smart like I'm going to work but
I really love it I can't really show you
because my full-length mirror is
upstairs and now I'm down but happy with
this outfit okay I'm in Covent Garden
it's very quiet because it's so early
it's actually really nice I'm just
walking down by the station and because
ptk shop is just right down here
so I'm in the key CK shop and it's like
heaven because there's no one here just
me and it's so exciting and I love
everything I've had a little look around
and there are so many things I will show
you what I have my eye on I'm definitely
gonna be leaving with today there are so
many Christmas ornaments I'm kind of
obsessed with these oh my God look how
amazing those are they feel such good
quality as well where are the Christmasy
ones this is like all the Christmasy
stuff on here I think these are so to
cluster I love the sound they make these
are like the candy cane ones little mice
gold and gingerbread men mittens
a snowman also loads of like wrapping
stuff it's really nice to kind of tie
these onto gifts I definitely want to
get this this is instant Christmas snow
I feel like that was such a good thing
to add into all the presents for my
nieces and nephews and I think I got
them for this last year and they
absolutely loved it they also do these
really good ribbon packs so they're like
a pack of three these are really really
festive and they put some on the other
side as well
these ones I like a little bit more
grown-up and smart these are really nice
just if you're gonna I tend to wrap my
presence in like brown paper so you can
just add this around it makes it a bit
more special they also have so many
other gifts like journals Diaries and
makeup bags and it's so nice because you
can actually get them monogrammed with
the their initials on it which makes it
a really really special gift and I did
that for my mom I got her a little coin
purse and I put her initials on it I
gave it to her last week actually has a
bit of an early president she was over
the moon she loved it
so they have things like this and this
is what it look like looks like when you
get the initials monogrammed on I think
it looks so small and it really makes it
an extra special gift so there's all
these differences like a wash bag a time
planner travel document wallet so this
is actually where they do the
monogramming it's right in the windows
you can stand and watch and you can get
it done then and there
a little bit of time but then you get to
leave with your present on the day
personalized with initials which is
great if you're just visiting this is so
cool oh my god I would love to try this
machine out I think I'm also going to
get these because I think they'll be so
nice to hang on my fireplace and put
little photos on for Christmas they've
got so many different wrapping papers to
pick from I get really obsessed with
wrapping my presents I think this one
the black with the gold trees is so so
nice okay I've just left tuk and I'm
gonna walk to gleam it's like a 20
minute walk but it's not raining you're
gonna do a good thing I've got bit of
time now actually thought everything was
back to back okay I'm leaving gleam and
now I'm going to do something really
cool the ladies from the pink process
and help refugees charity have set up
this really cool shop in Soho on
Broadway extreme the shop is called
choose love and it's like kind of not to
consumerism it looks like a normal shop
and you go in it's like very minimalist
I'm excited to see it and there's all
these kind of items laid out on the
table and the idea is that you go around
and shop everything has price tag but
then when you get to the till you pace
your items you get given them in a bag
and give them back and basically what
you're doing is you're buying items for
refugees and they send them straight to
them and I think it's such a genius idea
obviously donating money to charity is
great but this kind of makes it feel so
much more real you're literally buying
the items you're handing over your card
you're spending the money you don't walk
out with any of the stuff it goes
straight to the refugees so I can't be
involved in this project I think is
amazing I'm sure look so ho now and I
think we're making like a film some
stuff for my channels some stuff for
theirs
and yeah I'll see you guys when I get in
there I can see it down there this big
sign in the window that says choose love
outside they've got pictures of all the
items that they have in the shop and
then on the front says
let me go in
from the moment we hand on to things we
cannot see I would cross the sky for
it's only just begun okay guys so I've
picked a few things from the shop the
tissues actually represents
psychological support forty pounds and
then nappies for thirty pounds and then
also a sleeping bag for 20 pounds so
they put it all on the fancy iPad and
then you just pay for it right here
actually can I also get a black cheese
lover yeah cool thanks
also if you want to do it as a present
to someone you can buy all these things
and send them this so it's like a gift
with a difference which is a really good
idea okay now that is amazing I was
talking to one of the girls who's part
of the health refugee they actually call
it a movement no charity she was one of
the like students who started it and she
literally tried to raise a thousand
pounds in a week and they raised like oh
my god I can't remember the figure it
was like hundreds of thousands they've
just done so well it's such a genius
idea and I'm so happy I could help and
go in and help them record some content
and stuff for that I bought a few things
which I don't have
it's really funny right now I'm going to
a book a meeting oh my god I can't
believe I'm actually able to tell you
guys and go into a book meeting that
feels strange but I'm today I'm meeting
with the marketing and PR team to talk
about like exclusive press stuff I might
be doing with certain magazines then
like how we're gonna do all the
marketing and promotion around the
birthday March don't we know what the
itinerary for today's meeting is but
it'd be nice to meet up with the PR
marketing 70 met them briefly once oh
I'm home I feel like I stopped slogging
halfway through the day I went for a
meeting with the PR marketing girls from
Hodder it's really interesting I've
never had a team working with me to have
people be like oh don't worry that's our
job we'll get to work it's like okay
what you need me to do it's just so
weird for me but there is lots to do the
timeline is crazy tight like we haven't
even finished the cover yet and and the
book kind of needs to go to print soon
and obviously the monthly magazines work
like three months in advance so if we're
talking right at the beginning of March
we need to get things moving so I've got
a long list of like homework and two
dues to do it's just so exciting though
we also talked about events I'm going to
do
time of the books out so if you guys
have any thoughts on that like the sort
of things you'd like me to do also like
where you are will probably start
thinking about the UK but obviously
other places as well but within the UK
let me know where you guys are so I can
kind of get an idea of which cities to
visit and what sort of events you would
like to see from me whether that's just
like a signing which i think is a bit
boring I'm gonna do say more interesting
than that or like I don't know anything
else that you think that's what we're
kind of thinking about now and though I
did a bit of food shopping and I'm home
Lucy and Georgia I think Millie's not
well today I think Lucy and Georgia are
coming over tonight for dinner because
they haven't seen my new place we're
gonna have a little like mulled wine and
dinner situation and now that we've just
had that meeting we're gonna also turn
it into a bit of a brainstorming session
because we've we've got a lot of
homework to do they both have
interesting dietary requirements so we
have all come to the conclusion that a
ramen soup would be the best option for
all of us I wanted to be really nice
though so although I could I'm sure I
could do a ramen I want to do it really
well so I'm going to my brother-in-law's
because he's amazing at cooking and he's
gonna show me how to make a really good
ramen so I bought the ingredients for
that okay he's gonna help me make the
stock so I can make the rest of the soup
before they come over all eyes it will
be all like sloppy I'd certainly come in
there is special stock they got from
orientation there you go there you go
here all our ingredients you put some
garlic and ginger in there well I didn't
I'm holding this one hot water also
gonna be using soy sauce and mirin I
love Mary this is my nephew's dinner
tonight sausages mash and trees oh my
gosh Keisha my friend Keisha is the
cutest she just sent me this all the way
from Jamaica it says congratulations
bill which is what she calls me with a
hilarious photo of us when we were
little and she's just saying like how
proud she is of me for the book and
stuff oh and it comes with champagne and
chocolates so cute thanks Keith right my
brother and all helped you make the
stock which is kind of the most
important part and I'm gonna add all the
veg and noodles and stuff when Lucy and
Georgia get here I'm just gonna like
tidy up the house a bit I've lit candle
and I put some lip balm my lips because
they're very sore because I got a
stressful email that made me made my
lips flare up one of you guys told me
that to get rid of like funny smells in
houses it's a good idea to put a bit of
essential oils on cotton pads and put
them on the radiators our radiators were
really old I can't wait to replace them
I've put a couple on here when you walk
in because it smells a little bit funny
so that should do the trick thanks
whoever gave me that tip on Instagram
okay I've put the soup on and all the
balls ready I sister bought these for me
ages ago
they're perfect for ramen I really got
to though I'll give them to the girls
and I'll have a normal spoon okay it's a
bit later now which just got back from
his work party and I really hope you
guys enjoyed this vlog oh my god this is
a terrible place to end thank you so
much for watching check the description
box for everything as always and I will
see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
