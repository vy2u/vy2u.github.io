can really say good morning because it's
well now it's quarter to five so I feel
like that's a bit more acceptable people
get a lot of time for work we've
actually woke up a quarter to four which
is ridiculously early for a Saturday
morning but we are off to the airport
which is really exciting it is meant to
be a happier morning I was so excited
and I found out some horrific news this
morning about one of my very lovely
viewers I have probably little - about
20 people that I could name off the top
of my head who tweet me comment on
videos come on a blog post they're so
supportive and one of them was killed on
her holiday and they don't wanna talk
about it too much but I just found out
and I basically had a sub-query and I'm
in complete shock and it's a terrible so
not quite the happiest of mornings and
so we are heading to the airport we are
going to South France I've been going to
the South France my whole life I spent
all my school holidays there Easter
summer is like a second home to me and
really going back to the same spot my
whole life so I've never actually taken
you guys with me because I've always
gone and just switched off but I thought
this time I would vlog and go with which
and my parents and I'm so excited again
and just relax and eat good food and I
love the South of France as the head is
like my second home
just hold it on my camera gear he said
so I want to learn YouTube couples oh it
takes a carrying my camera grave here
the plan of maybe filming a little bit
while I'm there so I've got my camera
stuff just in case
we have landed in meat and it's before
we're seven Tomatoes indexical remember
momento hilarious as good for my dad as
picking us up from airport
it's so hot it's so nice I'm gonna get
changed into something cooler and now I
think we're gonna head to the beach okay
I think I'm ready to head to the beach
now that took about five minutes and I'm
ready to go it's so hot they're wearing
my wild Fox sunglasses and my lip cplay
suit but I think I'm going to try and do
an outfit style video while I'm here
haven't got my proper camera but I'm
gonna attempt one anyway so you'll see
all my outfits in that video we're now
at the beach I'd left my camera in the
booth so I couldn't film any of the
journey but it's only ten o'clock it's
boiling hot and happens below
oh I haven't changed my watch dammit 11
we're right by the porch so I think
we're going to some outfit shot some
outfit for your sake
this beaches C's right there I'll show
you in a minute
amazing C is right here but because it's
a hotel is also a little swimming pool
there which is funny hey why the best
intentions and make it outfit video even
brought nice outfits with me but the
Canon EOS m is not good for that is -
there isn't a viewfinder forget so I
mean there isn't is only a screen so
when it's sunny it's been hard to see
how to focus things and I was actually
shaking it out a tripod so that's a
shame anything that's gonna happen I
prefer to spend my day relaxing and
stressing about a video so I found his
photos of outfits by han and continue
vlogging think it's time for some
serious peace relaxation now
which has gone for a swim quite far out
and I cannot explain how cold the sea is
it's freezing the ice they purchase or
it ordered an orange press a which is my
favorite drink on beach fresh orange
juice right it's time for lunch woke up
at 4:00 a.m. so we are starving it's
only 12:30 let's go get some yummy food
rich what you can have steak tartare
we've been joined by our lovely friends
and beds here just noise we just had a
really delicious lunch I ate way too
much pasta which is not good for me and
Jenna had a yummy healthy crudité night
was really delicious
yeah it was now we're gonna head back to
the beach and getting a seat my mom
always used to tell me not to swim
ashore after lunch I never really
understood why we always told not to
swim after lab but it has been ages as a
crab I'm not like going for like a swim
we're back at the flat now and we had a
really nice day at the beach and I had a
little nap as afternoon but I've had a
really bad reaction to posture I had at
lunch I think today's just confirmed a
really corny pasta or pizza I was to get
that I spelt pasta at home so when I eat
out I get pasta and then I forget how
bad I am with pasta so I'm in a lot of
pain right now so we have a couple of
hours to showers and I think we're going
out for dinner tonight in Antibes before
I tackle my beach hair I'm gonna tackle
my face using it all of this stuff
okay heading out for dinner I'm going to
try and get richer tasting photos of my
first really believe you can didn't I

handy thing in the world I love it she
Topshop shorts my new sandals from
office which I love and I got into
shades and my bag is from brandy
melville and my nails are Revlon got my
where it's cold and the lipstick is

very fishy restaurant but I had the tuna

doing but I reckon we're gonna go to
Antibes and run market food markets and
stuff so I'm gonna sleep see you guys

good morning I'm not wearing any eye
makeup today because I have a sore eye

red and sore so one I don't infect my
makeup or so it would just make my eye
worse so that is why I'm wearing no eye
makeup I'm just making myself some
breakfast these are the little yogurts I
always talk about that I love in France

home but they're so nice I used to eat
these when I was little all the time and
then I put a bit of honey on top and
it's delicious all we have melon pan
Chocula very French we're not sure

these trees I visited like when a bit
mental

entire leg and cried for days
partly did it have donkey rides here
