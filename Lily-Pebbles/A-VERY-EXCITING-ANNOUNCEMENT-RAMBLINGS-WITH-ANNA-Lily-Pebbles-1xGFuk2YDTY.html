have a serious case of the giggles so
it's been difficult to start this video
sometimes it just happens and then it
doesn't stop but I think I've made it
yeah beginning partner
we are here today because we have a
really exciting and outs of you guys and
then we do these occasionally but I
really think this is the most exciting
one yet yes I behind it up a bit more
yet or we say Oh teasing we are
launching a pod car every time I got the
same time I couldn't various we are
watching oh my god
ago that was just like become yeah it
has been something's been in the work
for so long literally two years like the
discussion came up in 2015 we've been
actually actively working on this idea
for a yes then that's insane it was just
like one of those look consider the idea
and now it's actually happening so let
me tell you guys what the podcast
actually is and what it's called which I
completely forgot to do in my
announcement video I'm just like so
doing pop commerce and live like you're
marching for a sec title the title is at
home which we wanted to do a podcast and
because we're kind of nosy and we just
wanted to meet ten operational amazing
women who we're like kind of connected
to in some ways we've gone into their
homes and we wanted to get to know them
in the setting that they feel most
comfortable in and their most relaxing
it's about go home so we went into their
home and we chat it to them about their
work their lives their careers that
passions what they're into all whilst
kind of rifling through their wardrobes
and the kitchens and so much it's
completely done on platform than we've
ever done before that receives for being
on camera or like writing for a blog and
just doing audio is crazy because like
Britney Mike's we call them which is
like ahead Mike so we can walk around
the home and it's just it's weird you
like to get your recording you forget
that you're even that there's anywhere
and anyone else is ever going to hear
this yeah completely forget and I feel
like you just get into a massive chat
and it's probably a little waffle going
on we're definitely not the most
sophisticated interviewing the profile
is no I chassis they're like yes
traditional in conversation with exactly
first season series that every no it's
cool I say season makes some reason yes
but for them there are ten episodes so
one a week every Wednesday morning we're
not sure exactly what time you think you
like six or seven but we will let you
know all the info reads and description
box so one a week you can listen to it
on your commute or while you're cooking
dinner that's what I listen to podcast
other than when I'm cleaning we have to
do is really go for cleaning get some
wireless headphones on you're in another
world so it's already it's just gonna
live basically on iTunes and a cast and
you can subscribe so that you get like
you get a notification yeah yeah every
time as many lumps up as like your
podcast when you go in yeah and there's
already a trailer so we recorded oh it
oh god let's just listen to it just get
five stars don't listen to it I promise
at the address things much better than
that we're really happy with service the
artwork and stuff yeah time to create
that there's been lots of like secret
shoots have to me that we haven't told
you guys so we're so happy to have this
out in the open practice is we've
practiced a lot for this program yeah
practice with friends who are very kind
enough to let us into their homes and
babble away and do really crap so we're
absolutely love it if you guys subscribe
and give it five stars if you think it
deserves it and review it we just would
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
yes that's our news yeah so weird this
is now out I know terrifying
giving birth to a baby oh my god girl we
always I thought if you've already
watched Anna's video or if you haven't
you should go watch it after this
because we're going to kind of semi
interview ask each other questions about
podcast we came up with this idea about
five minutes before yeah it really
alright really organized okay so I'm
going to do a few questions
yeah who would be your dream guest to
have on at home with I think you're
going to love these ones as well menus
melon soup oh my god Ellen soon as you
live together you know yeah kind of it
maybe we can do like especially one
where it's like a two-part Mel how firm
it sees house I just think they're so
cool and funny and I really miss them or
Great British me from size exact agree
answer I've gone thanks okay so who
would you do which have their own
Podcast obviously ryan gosling I love in
any capacity or creek crap oh my god he
was having a hard one
his wife sir no they should honor honor
I love it when he said honor is
honorable and I love him also King Matt
and fresh from Thursday oh yeah it would
oh listen to lynnea's pop cautious for
his like second friend for first date
Podcast would be great where instead of
watching on a day just here we might out
how all it puts up a like what is your
favorite podcast I care for it unless oh
my god I need to like take some news
recommendation s town which was by the
makers of cereal if you haven't listened
to cereal is it similar thing
no it's kind of completely different but
it's it's very what's the word catchy
not catching up the right word but it's
very different to say yeah captivating
that is good it makes you listen to the
whole thing like in one sitting and my
friend Matt introduced me to the
minimalist very good I listen to it
while I was clearing up my kitchen the
other day though wait how ends it yeah I
don't know how the benefit left my
kitchen messes and Jeff slightly podcast
very good me my motivational kick up the
rig it's also Oprah popke about the
making of Oprah's show and it's just
fantastic Wow let's get from I think the
what have you loved about recording at
home with I love that you can look like
a bag of crap and it's and no one knows
yet problem when we're like always just
do an Instagram photo and they were like
you're apart from the end where I'm like
sweaty and hot and like well this is a
great time to take a pictures of the
Instagram yeah but also if actually can
seem really nice to do something
different and after so many years of
making videos right place doing that
they might have a new challenge yeah yes
and like we'd use like different skills
when you're like that in forgiving is
terrifying
it really is that awkward silence has
killed me there are many we're quite
good at it if there's like a moment
where we have to think and like pause
I'm like like okay what of you not like
so much about hoarding podcast I'm
really worried that I'm going to be like
a big burp or like a smart guy up on
them by baby you should wait for me
at home so when you're with someone else
you do have to like take absorb I feel
like if I did I was very worried about
having word vomit like well there always
be you can edit around it I'm doing no
 I did that during the last one I
started sentence and then I went notes
anywhere I was going for that are you
ready you're so honest you like don't
know what I'm trying to I start them and
it just rolls off but you know what and
it's not they were well known they were
whatever no okay my final question is is
if someone was to come to your house and
do can at home with podcast like how
would you prepare I was clean the
bathroom because there's just puke hair
everywhere that's where it comes from
it's got a twenty okay those of a sink
where they should this be an air
everywhere it's just a bit grave there's
always like a layer of Sun and dust that
was great I was doing my post P drops
down the toilet oh really up ones best
invention ever practice might making tea
because I make ki horribly yes I was I
thought you'd put a little bowl of
hummus and carrots things else not our
thing to do that would be so noisy like
so somebody sings to me oh yeah we don't
eat during the podcast I wish we could I
think that would be really unpleasant
yeah it'd be a bit like ASMR realize it
looks like like slurping on things
happening about that okay well I thought
this videos got just around me about it
yeah we're great at these but we are
genuinely excited about this so happy
that we finally announced it and we can
share the artwork and everything with
you I'm terrified to hear your feedback
but also really excited I'm really
excited this is something new for us
maybe certainly you guys if you haven't
missed a podcast before but give it a go
yeah first episodes going to be out this
Wednesday so yeah few days to waste this
is me believe is never will over the air
that gift that you said earlier you know
is like that's like how it
so thank you guys so much as always for
all of your support we're so excited to
be doing this and we'll see you then
thank you then I don't know how to end
this plague over each of the rounds hi
