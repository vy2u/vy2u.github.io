I'm actually in Lisbon I'm in Solana
holiday mode I have Rosa here it's great
I've just been at the pool the aircon on
full sorry if you can hear it also no
lighting you know the deal when I'm
filming in a hotel room but hopefully by
now you would have already seen my
Lisbon vlog that was on Wednesday you
haven't seen it I'm going to link on the
screen now so go check that out I came
out here with next and then which came
to meet me and we stayed on the weekend
to have a little holiday together it's
been so nice I'd loved it but you would
have heard all about that in the vlog
I'd be sharing loads of outfit photos on
Instagram Martha being out here thank
you so much for all of your comment and
like I've just really been enjoying
taking outfit pics and sharing them and
see what you guys think so I thought I
would do a sit-down video where I talk
through most of my outfits from this
trip basically what I've been wearing
whilst I've been in Lisbon it's been
pretty easy to take gorgeous photos here
because there's so many pretty tiles and
coloured walls everywhere but this is
kind of my only summer holiday that I've
got planned so I had to use some
addresses and things that I wanted to
wear whilst I was out here and I just
love summer clothes I'm so jealous of
you guys that live in hot countries it's
just so much more enjoyable to dress
anyway I better get started because
there's lots to go through I've been
posting most of my photos on Instagram
so I'm going to use that as like a guide
for me to know what to tell you guys
okay today one day one I was wearing
this dress from mango and I mentioned in
one of my past videos that I never
really go into mango but I've seen quite
a few people buying some really nice
things in there I feel like it is a
little bit like cheaper in terms of
quality so I don't mind shopping down
the summer because I don't wear the
clothes for as long but I feel like in
autumn winter I like to invest more in
really good quality pieces but for
summer is great this is an off the
shoulder dress I'm going to put in so so
whilst I'm talking about it so you can
see it properly but it's really really
light like a light Cotton's very
comfortable with off-the-shoulder
with buttons all the way down as tie
around the waist and then it also kind
of sprays out of the bottom which I
thought was a really nice little extra
detail I got so many compliments when I
wore this dress it was very comfortable
to wear all day I absolutely love it and
I wore that with a couple of accessories
from next I mentioned in my Instagram
photo that I've kind of fallen I fell
out of love with Brown accessories that
used to wear them a lot
teenager and then I went through a long
stage of just hating brown and now I'm
back into I think in the summer and with
white brown accessories can look so nice
so this is the bag that I wore and I've
been loving this this whole trip because
it fits my SLR camera in it which is so
handy because it doesn't really look
like an ugly camera bag so if you are
looking for a camera bag I would really
recommend this one it's obviously very
affordable from the next is this like
pale Brown bucket bag and it's also so
comfortable it's got a really thick
strap you can wear it crossbody or just
on your shoulder this is just such a
good camera bag I love it and then on my
feet I wore these sandals they're really
dusty to hold in my hands but they're
like flip-flop sandal you know they like
go in between your toes but maybe not
the comfiest but they're definitely
bearable like they're worth a degree
blisters or anything I just find
sometimes having from the in between
your toes isn't always the conscious I
did a lot of walking in these because
there are lots of hills in Lisbon and my
feet were fine I think they look really
cool with a dress okay so day one in the
evening to dinner I wore this dress from
Topshop which I've had for a while I
think I bought this last summer I
haven't worn it that much because the
first time I wore this I was playing
like badminton or something with some
kids so one even like my family's kids
and I told the dress a little bit I
haven't had time to get six but I
realize before packing you can't really
tell there's a bit of a tear in it
because it's got a slit anyway but slips
just a little bit more slippery than it
should be so it's a really nice trophy
dress it feels kind of silky it's
definitely not some Topshop got a tie
around the waist
I just think having a tie around the
waist is so flattering for me like quite
high up in my waist is my smallest part
so if I do something like a tie there it
looks really flattering it's also got
little t-shirt sleeves which is good if
you something like that part of your arm
I just think the strikes going downwards
a very slimming and very flattering and
it's a very comfortable dress so I wore
that with my new favorite pair of shoes
I got these from Topshop a while ago but
I haven't really had the opportunity to
wear them because the weather hasn't
been great at home they're kind of like
clogs I'm sure there's an official word
for these it's got a wooden block heel
and they're read both ways and then it's
kind of like a love heart on the toe
which is very flattering make your legs
look really long but these are so so
comfortable I've been like walking
around Lisbon loads
and you guys know I don't like
uncomfortable shoes at all because they
open-toe my toes don't get squash and I
just think they're great loving those as
a little pop of color to outfit as well
and then I also wore this bag which is
from volgarr II I always say Bulgari
even if it's Bulgaria Bulgaria he's away
I didn't buy this bag it's a very
expensive bag this was a very generous
gift and I loved it I'm not even sure if
it's something I would choose but
whenever I wear it I get so many
compliments it's like gold and sparkly
and maybe like it looks a bit like
giraffe print or something but it just
opens like this quite small bags cockpit
much in there but it's a really nice
evening bag I'm very very grateful to
have it in my collection it's very
different anything else I have I just
thought that would look nice make it a
little bit clashing this with the
stripes now looking back on the photo
but I worked at Hooters
sorry we're filming a video with rich
lying on the bed right there okay day
two we went for a for our bike tour
around Lisbon it was very good I was
highly recommended exhausting and very
very hot I wasn't sure what to wear for
a bike ride I've ridden a bike in years
but I didn't want like something that
would ride up from my shorts I thing
which is too tight it would be really
uncomfortable a skirt I feel like it's
quite hard cycling the skirt so I wore
this and I've had loads of questions on
it I don't think it's the most
flattering piece in my wardrobe but I
love it it's on j.crew and a jumpsuit is
off the shoulder but it has these
strings that go around your neck as well
and then it cinches in at the waist
although just to know I've got a medium
and I think I probably could have got
small once I realized it was too late to
do an exchange buy quite like that it's
a bit baggy because this is so
comfortable it's a very very thin cotton
and just going to lower down and roll up
it looks a bit like the drama's but the
Compu thing ever it was perfect for the
bike ride I really really liked it and I
wore this yes with my new cheeks or
sandals
I just love jigsaw I think they have so
many good thing about especially in a
summer these are like a pale pink sandal
with this fringing detail these are just
like a good solid sandal here's the
comfy tight
they're so good like walking in I didn't
they're particularly exciting but a
really good one to have in my summer
shoe collection I
like them that afternoon we spent some
time by the pool and I took this really
cute photo of me and Kerri I loved it
and we were both wearing the same
matching swimming costume from neck it
looks like this and at the time I hadn't
even thought that it's just so likely
Lisbon but it really fits in with our
surroundings it reminds me so much of a
lot of pretty tiles on the buildings and
it's a very flattering semi costume it's
got a little bit of padding and the
boobs which is good it's halterneck
which is perfect because then you can
make it tight or not quite as you need
and it's got this like ruching it's
really hard to explain that feels almost
like the separate top that you can pull
down or after as much as you want and
then it rushes on the sides that's right
flattering if your stomach isn't like
your favorite part of your body
I know sure that like eyes a little bit
self-conscious about my stomach when I'm
in somewhere so I really really like
wearing this and on the completely other
scale of things in terms of price that
other swimming costume I have with me is
this one I don't have a photo of me
wearing it's Melissa Oda Bosh it's
actually strapless saline costume which
when I wear it strapless is not very
flattering on me I have to say but at
least you don't get tan lines but it
does actually come with straps if you
want to wear at the halter neck which I
didn't realize when I got it and I'm
really happy with that there's again
with a gift throw expensive for storing
costume but you can really tell that
it's such good quality it's so
comfortable to wear it's very very soft
really probably around the tummy it
doesn't like ride up anywhere we like
that as my second term in costume
that evening I wore the pink denim skirt
so this is from next as well I just
thought was really different for a denim
skirt because it's this really nice
blush pink and also has that like it's a
cool to drop em I'm not really sure
where it's a bit longer at the back oh
yeah step hem skirt actually send it on
it not drop him step him it's actually
quite nice along the back which means
it's not kind of too short doesn't show
you a bomb so I really like that and I
wore this top again from next tucked in
from the front it's just like a plain
black moment very computer from the
front of the plain black cami and then
on the back it's got this really nice
cross crisscross detail which I thought
was really nice doesn't my show your bra
or anything that's just on the top of
your back and I also wore my denim
jacket from Topshop on top I'm not
afraid of wearing double denim
especially the denim two different
colors I think actually looks quite cool
and the evenings are a little bit cooler
here and listen this is any jacket I
bought I should have bought a leather
jacket really but this worked out
alright I think I see was that outfit I
wore my Topshop sliders these are also
quite new for me they're from Topshop I
did a shoot a magazine shoot a few weeks
ago and the stylist was wearing these in
Carleton green and she was just so cool
I loved everything she was wearing so I
went out and bought them and they're so
so comfortably I never thought sliders
could be so comfortable I'm in love with
these and again I get so many
compliments when I wear them okay day
three and this was the last day I had
with the girls before they all went home
I wore this dress which again is new
from mango God needs the wash the straps
really dirty I really like this it's
very different to anything else I have
style
I don't normally suit me it's very
straight across on the boob and with
like spaghetti straps I'd wear strapless
bra but it kind of goes in at the waist
and then it goes out and it has these
big pockets very electricity style it's
a really nice soft cotton like slightly
textured and it's just so flattering I
love wearing this dress it's the perfect
white summer dress I've been enjoying
wearing white dresses a lot as I'm sure
you can see on my Instagram and this is
a really great one so that's from mango
and I also wore my new sunglasses which
I got at the airports while duty-free
getting some vouchers which is very kind
so I picked these up from Prada Prada
seems to be the only sunglasses brand
pop some red band occasionally that
suits me what I find it so hard to find
sunglasses I think I put quite a small
face and I really wanted some big
sunglasses I could put on when I'm not
wearing any makeup so I tried products
my last sunglasses are from there and I
found these and I really liked them so
I've got those on in the photo as well
and again I wore the brown bag and the
brown sandals from next I wore in the
first outfit so the next day when Rich
was here I wore this dress from hush
I've had for a little while now but I've
been loving wearing this both at home
and here the very loose comfortable
summer dress again it's very like Lisbon
style white with this like blue detail
on the front it ties up and then it just
goes all the way down very complete with
a little bit of frame the bottoms not
afraid I don't really know what the
terms are for these things but it's
really really pretty and I thought
because it has a blue on it I would wear
it with these sunglasses which is from
Ray Ban they fall out it's this tiny
little box which I just think it's
they're my round ones is like blue
reflectin I bought these in LA I've got
these like last year but I really like
them by the way I'm going to link to
everything in the description box below
if anything is old or not available
online for some reason I will write it
there and if I can I'll give an
alternative option and then I have one
more outfit which is what I wore last
night for dinner I want my Gap jeans
which I'm wearing now so I can't show
you those and this top which I actually
bought whilst I was here main which I
popped into man go he bought a couple of
t-shirts and I found this tops I really
like again it's very different like I
couldn't even figure out how to tie this
for a while to show off and went on the
front or the back
but it's this very light striped top
with these big sleeves but not like too
big that they get in your food and a
really long time I tied on the side and
I wore that with my jeans and with the
red Topshop shoes which I just really
liked this outfit I would definitely
wear this again and I wore it with my
future Soho disco bag which is very
handy it fits my life logging camera and
my tripod and everything in it I love
this one especially when I'm traveling
yeah I'm really happy that I got this
top and I think that better thing if
you're not already following me on
Instagram my handle is at lady pebbles
