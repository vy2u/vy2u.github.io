for today's video I'm going to be doing
a what I wore in a week video I think
that's what they're called I haven't
done one of these in ages I think I've
done home before and I'm basically just
going to show you what I'm wearing
everyday I'm keeping it very realistic
I'm not going to dress up for the
occasion so I'm going to start today it
is Wednesday and I'll do it everyday for
a week and hopefully you guys will enjoy
this video ok so let me start by showing
you what I'm wearing on my top half
today this little necklace is Hama soma
it was gift from LMS beauty and its
really really nice got a red delicate
gold chain and then it's an all like
turquoise gem I really really like that
this top is from last year from whistles
I like it because it's not too thick so
it's perfect for this kind of weather
where it kind of you don't have to going
to rain you do know if it's warm and
because it's got this like cutout cold
shoulder detail it makes it feel less
like you're wearing a big kind of heavy
jumper got a bit of free detail it goes
all the way across here and then it's
just quite tight on the arms it's maybe
blue as you can see and I'm wearing it
tucked in today these jeans are from
Urban Outfitters they're the ones that
Anna and learn other people have been
raving about for ages they are the axial
or ax while jeans I really really like
them they're kind of high-waisted and
they are cropped as well Urban
Outfitters do like half sizes so I got
these in a 29 I'm not sure if I'm a 28
or 29 if I get them in the 28 they're
like quite tight fisted if I get them in
the 29 they're comfortable so I can't
quite decide what the best size for me
is but I'm wearing them with a Topshop
belt today
my watch is from Abbot Leon and a little
bracelet that I'm wearing with it is
also from Miss nomer which is really
nice
my rings are both from the jury and then
really take these off so they're always
the same with this one's like a chain
ring this one's just a really thin gold
ring now you can kind of see that the
jeans
crop here I wear a 32 leg and I'm about
five foot seven and then these are just
my night trainer that you may hold the
Universal or something international
something like that and you get in from
other stories and they're really
comfortable today is Thursday the 3rd of
August I just filmed a Q&amp;amp;A video I've
been working all morning so I haven't
really got up I'm going to my sister's
this afternoon so I'm in really cozy
lazy outfit where am i Josie a jumper
which I absolutely love I didn't buy
this when we were in New York because I
just thought I really don't need it I
bought a little badge and said then I
got given this a glossy event and I'm so
glad I did because it's the warmest
coziest like fluffiest John forever I
got in a medium and it's so comfortable
it just as glossy and black by the way I
forgot to tell you it is glossy a I
asked it's not Garcia let me show you
what I'm wearing on my bottom half these
are my Gap jeans I did a job with caps a
while ago and I got some jeans and
they're just Maps big favor I don't even
know if they do the style anymore but
they're kind of highways dude they're
like a medium bleed in and it's got one
slit as I'm not too big and then they're
cut off and they're kind of a skinny fit
so this is today's glamorous outfit I'm
going to put on some trainers probably
the same ones yesterday night trainers
judge my sisters this is my kind of like
working from home but when I'm going out
nah we're interested bottoms working
from home outfit ok stateside everyone
wearing today the teacher I think that
was old and I got in the men's section
and I saw and my buying it when you
Jesus goes I wear everyday these are the
Urban Outfitters Axl jeans in black and
it kind of like a faded black which I
quite like actually not in a cars when
you wear white bread white converse is
really really old and buttered but I
love them and I wore the my wedding day
and they're so special so that's
everything I'm wearing today and I'll
come back to you tomorrow to show you
might help a outfit today is Saturday
and I'm doing a water ward a week video
so let me show you what I'm wearing
today again like you said if your bag it
really is the only bag or at the moment
it's just so easy this a striped top
it's like two equal to length a little
bit loose and baggy the neck is quite
wide this is some j.crew and I love it
the necklace is the Lucy Williams Nexus
from the soma so glad I bought this
really really like wearing it my belt is
topped off again and
these again are the Urban Outfitters
axial jeans they're in like the medium
denim Washington also a little bit bad
gear in places only how they all fits
are different because the black ones are
really really tight on me they're all
the same size these ones are definitely
a bit bad year but I'm wearing them with
my Topshop suede lace-up boots which are
really old but they're just always wear
them they're so comfortable I salute you
run in these boots which is great so
it's kind of like a casual Saturday
outfit ish but I'm also vain shells I
also kind of want to look nice I just I
really loved the register is red shorts
of denim very French very easy to wear
and that's about it for me today it is
Sunday today and we are going to brunch
with my family and then we just have
some like really boring errands to run
when we go food shopping and stuff so
let me show you what I'm wearing today
of course it's denim again I'm wearing
this white t-shirt which is from
Reformation and then these are dungarees
and hush I don't think that particularly
flattering I actually don't think
dungarees suit me at all but they're
kind of complete and fun and I like them
and I'm wearing my Topshop slides with
them because again really comfy for a
Sunday I think I might put a necklace on
I feel like I'm missing a necklace
probably in my mazuma horn one and my
Gucci Soho disco bag again so yeah
that's my dungaree outfit for a Sunday
very chill I'll check in again tomorrow
good morning guys it is Monday today and
I'm back in the office space I'm gonna
work it today and tomorrow I think and
I'm going to show you what my insane
first of all necklaces this is from my
soma I wear it all the time and then
this one is awesome a soma it's like the
small magnetic listening and cord is
really nice to layering with longer
necklaces my jacket is from ASOS is that
my really also leather jacket that I've
always wear I really need a new one but
I find that so many of them are too
thick and then it's it right but I
haven't found the perfect leather jacket
yet that one is still my kind of go to
this shirt is from Lilian line of the
silk shirt and it's one of my absolute
favorites it fits and hangs so nicely
and it's kind of like a leopard print
but blue and cream are topped it in this
little thin belt is old it's on
a sauce and then these again the Urban
Outfitters actual gene we seem to giving
bad year I'm so annoyed eleven by the
28th but maybe if I tell Berta lies an
l-sit better and then that shoes these
are shoes that I'm wearing today now let
me talk to you about these shoes these
are the Gucci loafer slingback yes I
have fully jumped on the bandwagon now
hear me out
I've never ever owned a pair of divine
shoes in my life I've always felt bit
funny about it because I did a handbag
myself I particularly coaster but shoes
they literally go on the floor and they
get scuffs and you said them too and you
just can't avoid that because you're not
going to be especially to live in London
you're between pressures of our shoes so
I've never really felt like investing in
shoes before Gucci loafers been around
for ages first customers are wearing
them Lizzie Hatfield and she has a
slingback ones and you can't actually
get these in the UK but I'll get that in
a minute
anna has the loafers that have the back
on them and I've never been sure if I'm
a fan of them or not they are a little
bit like grandpa restyle but the reason
why I ended up buying them because I
have like a massive hole in my shoe
wardrobe I really shovel with shoes I've
got trainers and I've got boot and I
haven't really got anything in between I
haven't got any shoes so when trainers
do scruffy and boots are just come back
with these jeans boots just said go and
sometimes it's too heavy and black and
to wintry so I really wants to shoes I
have the weirdest toes I'm not going to
show you my toes but my toes like to
flick up everything on me is curly look
how far back my son's bend my big toe is
pretty much like that so when I wear
enclosed shoes my toes really really
hurt and sometimes they even make a hole
in my shoes I'll never forget making a
hole in my other boots which are
sheepskin
so I struggle with shoes especially
because I'm a half-size so I always end
up having to get six and then my toe
gets so squashed designer shoes come in
half sizes so I managed to get these in
a six and a half because they were all
super expert of the leathers very soft
which means that hopefully they'll mold
around my feet and they'll
we're better I didn't want the shoes but
I really wanted the slingbacks which I
like I said you can't get a DK but I
found our website for my Tereza calm and
there's one pair left
this is elasticated so because the back
is open it gives more space for like
movement around the front which means
there's more space in my tote to have
room and they're just comfier to wear I
also really like turning back because
they make them more versatile they make
them a little bit more of like an
evening shoes you want to dress them up
but just a little bit different I like I
sign either way more me than the ones
like shoe all the way around they've got
a little gold buckle on them anyway I
know it means justify my purchases but
it's a bit silly to buy the stylish shoe
by the end of the summer I could have
worn them all spring and summer but that
just shows you kind of how much I didn't
just like jump on the bandwagon I'm
going to get a rubber salt on the front
with your that said that's the best
thing to do that is slip around so that
is what I'm wearing today that's pretty
much everything I will come back to you
tomorrow
with my next outfit good morning guys
today it is Tuesday and my last day of
what I wore in a week pretty sure I
started a Wednesday so this should work
out
I forgot my tripod today button clicking
to show you one wearing I actually don't
want any jewelry because I've got them
all packed up and a bias because I'm
taking some photos today for a blog post
about my jewelry collection so I'm going
to necklaces on this shirt I bought when
I bought all of my jeans and it's from
Urban Outfitters it's like a navy and
white and check and it's kind of like a
bit batwing so I contrary like it looks
a bit like school uniform and then I'm
wearing the Urban Outfitters actual
jeans again because I can't get enough
I'm feeling a bit like time of the month
and these jeans are just so comfy the
only of wearing jeans at all is quite
painful right now so I'm wearing my
Urban Outfitters jeans with my top short
belt and then my trainers I came in at
my trainers today but bought my Gucci
loafers with and to take an outfit photo
so that everything I'm wearing today
really not that exciting and I was right
I wore jeans every single day this week
which I'm kind of mortified about I
think if the weather was nice that I
would have been able to wear some skirts
or dresses but it's just been a really
miserable
rainy week so jeans atop the show
something is
I let go to outset and I think that's
pretty much everything for this video
let me know if you enjoyed this and
since I've done this start a video
before so let me know if you'd like me
to do this again maybe when I'm not
wearing jeans every day thank you if
you'd like to watch my last video and
please subscribe to my channel and I'll
see you guys again on Wednesday for my
