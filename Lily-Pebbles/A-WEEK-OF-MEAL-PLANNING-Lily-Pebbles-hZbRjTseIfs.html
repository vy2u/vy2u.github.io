thought I would start this video here
because me and Richard decided to try
and plan our meals this week I've
mentioned before how we're really bad
like food shopping and planning meals
and we always end up like panic buying
stuff and then just eating whatever's in
the fridge so I'm going to give it a go
I've tried planning my meals before and
it did work out well but then I just
kept forgetting to do it again so we're
going to try and be good this week and I
thought I would show you how I'm doing
it and kind of talk you throughout the
week like how I get on with it and
whether I regret picking any meals or
anything like that
so I'm just sitting here and I'm going
to go through some of the recipe books I
have and pick some of the meals that we
want to eat this week I've looked our
diary and I'm in most nights riches out
one and one night and I think I'm out
for most of like the days so I don't
need to get much lunch stuff so it's
kind of just dinners that I'm planning
I've got the lean machines book but
Madeline Shores book and then I've got
some more on the shelf behind me that I
might use I'm going to go through pick
some recipes that we'd like and then
write down the things that I need to buy
and I'll probably go to the shops
tomorrow okay so I've planned dinners
out for Monday Tuesday Wednesday and
Friday which the nights that we're going
to be in on Monday I think we're going
to make like an aubergine tagine from
Madeline Shaw book choose they're just
gonna make a chicken stir-fry like our
own invention and Wednesday rich is out
so I'm just going to make a spaghetti
bolognaise myself and hopefully have
enough leftovers I can have it for lunch
or something and then Friday I think
we're going to have like burgers with
sweet potato and veg and avocado and
then I'm only in for lunch a couple of
days but I thought I would make the baba
ghanoush and red pepper hummus on Ally
machines book because Anna keeps going
on about those and just get some like
pizza bread and vegetable just hop up on
the breakfast stuff that we have so yeah
I'm gonna have to go to supermarket
early tomorrow morning because we're out
for the rest of the day today I will let
you know how this week of meal planning
goes it's Monday morning
well mid morning and I haven't had time
to head out yet to do the food shop so
I'm just eating what I've got here which
is some Bayona
spelt rice cakes with kind of smashed
avocado salt pepper a bit of spicy sauce
on top this will keep me going
I've got about half an hour to like go
food shopping never go food shopping
when you're starving hungry
it's Monday afternoon and I'm ready to
go food shopping so I am taking my
with me I've seen it Richard added a few
things but that's okay okay two
learnings from that little shopping trip
one this is taken far too much of like a
chunk out of my day my local supermarket
some is like in an industrial park and
there's so much traffic getting in and
out so it seemed ages to get in it's now
going to take me ages to get out so I
think I definitely need to do this
online in the future also it was so hard
not to pick things up that weren't on
the list like when you're walking around
you're thinking oh I think we need some
of that all I think we need more of that
but then I think that's where you start
spending loads of money so I tried
really hard to stick to the list I'll
show you the few things that I
accidentally picked up the one on the
list when I get home but that's the
other thing with online shopping you
kind of do less of the picking up of
things you don't need okay I just got
home these are all my shopping bags I'm
going to show you what I got I apologize
in advance for all the plastic packaging
I apologize on behalf of the UK I don't
know why we're so bad compared to other
countries I tried to buy like my veg
from markets and I have time and like
things like this don't come in packaging
but not gonna lie there's lots of
plastic packaging I did take my own bag
just to try and do my bit okay so here's
the stuff I was meant to get milk
yogurts
more yogurt if you wondering why I got
separate this whole thing is for like a
recipe and these are for breakfast some
egg noodles loads of aubergine broccoli
peppers corn stir-fry veg carrots
chillies onions and pizza bread we've
got some minced meats and burgers and
some chicken breasts teriyaki sauce
chickpeas smoked paprika and harissa and
this is the stuff I wasn't meant to get
naked bars they didn't have the berry
flavor but I really liked the Coco
orange ones they did have the berry
flavor in these fruit nut bits I'm gonna
try those I was bought some pears
because they're in season and I love
pears and then these which looks
unbelievably cute they're like
absolutely tiny tiny cherry tomatoes so
that's everything I got it was very hard
not to go off list but this should be a
week of dinners hopefully ok so this is
what my fridge looks like it's not too
full lots of fresh fruit and veg so
let's see how I get on this week I'm
going to make the baba ghanoush and
red pepper hummus now because tomorrow
I'm kind of in for lunch but I haven't
got a long time to make it so I thought
I'll just make it now and then keep it
in the fridge and hopefully I can just
kind of eat it throughout the week and
then maybe in an hour so I'm gonna start
making dinner when rich gets home he has
to help me film some cutaways so I'll be
good if dinners just ready frosty so I'm
using the lean machines baba ghanoush
recipe and I just have to kind of roast
these uber genes for 20 minutes and then
I haven't got food processor but I've
got the UM Vitamix which kind of does
everything so I'll just like blitz it
all in here over jeans cook so I'm just
scooping out the inside blitzing
everything in the Vitamix and I'll show
you the finished product okay so this is
the finished baba ghanoush it does taste
yummy maybe a little bit too lemony for
me my lemon squeezer is incredibly good
so sometimes I think I need to put less
when using this because it said one full
lemon but it's a little bit too lemony
but it's really nice so I'm going to
keep that in Tupperware and just eat
that throughout the week rich is on his
way home so I'm going to start prepping
dinner so that we can get filming when
he gets home and hopefully the kind of
over genes do we'll be pretty much done
so this is what I'm making it's from
Madeline shores Ready Steady glow but
I'm going to get chopping just cooking
the aubergine and then I'm going to add
some of the other ingredients and I
don't think we're gonna have cauliflower
rice because it's a bit too much of a
faff we both really like chriskiss so
we're just gonna have it with that
instead this is simmering away me and
which are going to go film and then I'm
going to come back and we're gonna eat
so this is the final dinner I hope it
fills us up because there's no like meat
in it but hopefully it will there's one
for me and one for rich and then I've
got this much leftover that I'm going to
put in this little square box and
probably have it for lunch tomorrow I'm
just making some couscous in here and
then I'm going to have last night's
leftover aubergine tagine and yeah
actually feels really nice to have like
a lunch planned because normally I just
panic and eat Weber's in the fridge and
it's normally nothing so I'm really
looking forward to this lunch meal
planning going well so far I'm also
gonna add a bit of the Barbican dish
that I made yesterday yummy lunch
it's Tuesday evening and I'm going to do
a workout so I've left rich to do dinner
he's doing a chicken stir-fry
it's like veg and sauce and the chicken
is currently marinating in the fridge in
there so I'm leaving him to do that when
I get back
I've cooked at home and rich has made
the chicken stir-fry what do you think
of it pretty good
I don't realize falsely
okay so we will change the source next
time make our own the pre-packed source
isn't normally not that great I'm so
hungry
it's Wednesday night now and rich is out
tonight at a work party so usually I
would have probably just got back from
town it's quarter past six and I
probably would have gone up but no food
I'll just get takeaway but because we've
planned our meals I know what I'm making
so that's definitely a plus I'm enjoying
knowing what I need to make although I
feel the pressure to make what I've
planned but how can I do fancy takeaway
but I feel like I've got this food and I
do let's go off it's just forcing me to
cook which is fine I'm gonna make
spaghetti bolognaise which sounds like a
big meal for one but I'm gonna hopefully
well I definitely will have loads of
sauce left over which I can freeze and
maybe we can have it next week so I'm
going to make the sauce now and then
I'll show you guys oh also an update I
had the baba ghanoush for lunch not a
big fan I don't if I made it wrong I
think I put too much lemon in wasn't
really my kind of thing maybe I'll try
some other recipes but yeah I got bored
of that quite quickly I make a pretty
simple bolognese sauce sorry this
offends any Italians but onions and then
I'm going to add some garlic and then I
add the mince meat and then some chopped
tomatoes salt and pepper and that's just
how I like it I added two tins of
chopped tomatoes because I like mine
quite saucy so I'm just going to let
that kind of bubble away for a bit and
then I'm going to be cooking spelt
spaghetti to go with that spaghetti
bolognaise with Parmesan cheese ready to
get in my tummy it's Thursday night I
mean which has business up in Westfield
so we have
we're just going to eat it out we are at
bazaar be five times I love it Thai food
so I've got some credit pawns and a
chicken the crab time
it's Friday night now so we had a nice
dinner out last night and tonight we are
going to stay in we have burgers with
sweet potato and veg planned again
really nice just knowing what we're
going to eat but I'm very aware that
it's coming to the end of the week which
means that we should actually be doing
our online food shop tonight we should
go through the recipe books again and
plan the meals which I really cannot be
able to do but that's I guess how it
works anyway I'll show you what we're
making with dinner tonight okay which is
cooking dinner he's got the burgers on
there the broccoli on there and sweet
potatoes in there okay plating up why
that corn so not yellow maybe it needs
cooking more well this one looks good
corn can we put some journey Buster well
she edit that we do we never butter in
are we really don't you butter no that's
your girl oh man no butter for the corn
burger luckily in like a garlicky pasta
weeds on the you sauce sweet potato
fries we're gonna eat this in front of
the TV because it is Friday we dinner
party via every night no I said that and
thanks making dinner looks YUM good okay
we finished dinner we've done five days
of meal planning a week we don't really
shop for weekends because when we can we
just end up like eating out the whole
time there's no point we're literally
never in red so we've done a whole week
now and what do you think fine I feel
like there are pros and cons but more
pros the corners that you have to like
go through and plan and like do your
food shop ahead of time and plan your
meals and it's their pain and also I
guess it kind of stops like spontaneity
right because your thing like oh I've
bought this meal so I got to cook it
tonight but sometimes we just go out
play spontaneous nights out and meals
out and I feel like it kind of stops
that a bit but it definitely saves money
because they're just buying exactly what
you need yes so do it three or four
meals a week gives you a bit more
flexibility yeah exactly so I thought
it'd be interesting for you guys to see
us do like a week in meal planning let
me know what you guys thought of this
video I hope it was interesting also
leave me a comment if you have any tips
or let me know what you do if you always
plan your meals or you just shop when
you need to or if you have any other way
of doing it I think we will do it again
I don't think we're going to do it like
every week we're just not so people have
like a weekly routine we already haven't
done it tonight it's Friday night we
should have done the food shop and we
haven't but maybe on Monday I'll go food
shopping again and do it who knows it
was fun trying it out see you guys in my
next video if you haven't seen my last
ones click on the I button to go have a
watch and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
