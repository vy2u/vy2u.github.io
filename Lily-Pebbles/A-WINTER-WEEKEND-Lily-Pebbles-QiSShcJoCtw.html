little bit of a tradition to start my
vlogs sitting at my Beauty desk which
I'm totally into it is a Saturday
morning and really nice bright blue
skies today actually I just did my hair
and makeup so I'm just covering my lips
in Vaseline we were out last night at
Jim and Tanya's annual Christmas party
and it was so fun we had a really really
good time and yeah woke up feeling
really happy today when you watch this
it will be post Christmas so I really
hope you guys had a really nice
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and
Boxing Day as I speak now it's the
weekend before Christmas I think I don't
even know what data is but we have a lot
to do we have quite a busy weekend I've
got quite a few presents to get as you
guys know we do Secret Santa in my
family so we all have to buy a present
for one person and our budgets 50 pounds
so you get one really nice present we
don't kind of go over the top with it
but I've obviously got my family we also
do Secret Santa with richest family I
have like a Secret Santa with my friends
and then we buy all the kids presents
obviously that's kind of what we need to
do today but I ever been down stairs
yeah I've just been getting ready this
video is actually sponsored by Special K
and I was really excited when they got
in touch with me because you guys know I
have struggled with the whole breakfast
thing I mean pretty much my whole life
but I've never given up on it I struggle
to find the motivation to eat breakfast
but I really want to be a breakfast
person so although I don't have any kind
of New Year's resolutions this year and
I've written a blog post all about that
wanting to eat breakfast every day is
just an ongoing resolution for me and
I'm always willing to try new things to
find stuff that I like to eat and there
isn't like a massive effort I think
that's the problem for me I can't really
get the motivation as I'm so not a
morning person to make something kind of
really complicated so I just want
something quick and easy and it tastes
good so special cake or InTouch because
they want to educate women on the power
of positive nutrition they've got a
campaign called hashtag powering you and
I'm gonna be working with them to tell
you guys about it I'm gonna be vlogging
today and tomorrow and at the start of
each day I'm gonna try the original
Special K cereal a couple of different
ways I'm just tweaking them slightly to
see if I can find a new breakfast that's
just easy and yummy and then I could
just eat every day I'm so up for the
challenge I'm gonna head downstairs and
talk you through my breakfast and what's
in it because I really do want to start
eating breakfast more I think it's so
good for you anything is so important
okay let's go okay I think rich is
already downstairs she just got back
from all up out our lovely new console
table from West Elm very excited about
this I will show you guys this properly
in another video
okay I'm downstairs and I've got all my
breakfast stuff laid out in front of me
and it should feel like I'm on a cooking
show well I'm a milk and my bowl I'm
going to throw it all properly in a
minute but here I have my Kellogg's
Special K original so it shows a bit on
the front what it's got inside I thought
I'd talk to you a little bit further
about what goes into the cereal so it's
made with vitamin V which feeds your
defences and that basically means
vitamin D supports your immune system
it's also got b12 and b12 basically
helps release the energy from food third
thing is it's made with iron and iron is
really great to help reduce tiredness
which is definitely something I need
help with and I'm gonna show you what
I'm gonna be having today so like I said
I'm doing a slightly different breakfast
tomorrow morning but today I thought I
would have the cereal so let me just
literally filled my bowl in front of you
pouring it a little bit this how great
is that sound and then I'm gonna add my
milk I like to use skimmed milk but you
could obviously use whatever month you
want almond milk soy milk by the way how
cute is this little milk jug I got
certain ease a few years ago and I've
just never used them but now we have the
house for like getting fancy okay then
in this little Bowl here I have a mix of
dried fruit hazelnuts and a few like
seeds and I feel like that adds some
really nice texture
crunch I'm just gonna sprinkle a little
bit on top okay let me bring you closer
so this is what it looks like just gonna
like mix it all up together get a bit
the dried fruit in there mmm I like the
dried fruit in it because that's a bit
of sweetness I actually really like that
actually dry this you saw how quick and
easy that was to do so for me I feel
like this is a really non-intimidating
breakfast definitely something I could
just do on a weekday what I want to kind
of go upstairs and get on with work okay
I'm gonna eat my breakfast and then I'll
come back to you guys
so ready to go out and wearing my new
leather vans that rich got me for my
birthday but they definitely need
wearing in they feel quite like still
so I thought today's a good day to do
that whoa I did not realize it was
pouring with rain last time I told you
guys it was blue skies I just walked out
and it's pouring with rain first place
we need to go as a dump because I've got
so much colorful packaging from all like
Amazon deliveries and parcels and stuff
and piling up so our recycling bin is
just not big enough all of this so
having to drive to the dump
okay the first place we're going is Aldi
to pick up some lamps for my grandma
hopefully that was unsuccessful so I
didn't vlog it was a bit crazy and rainy
but I'll didn't have the lamps and Argus
didn't have the present for Soren and
I've just looked online that sold out
everywhere so we need to rethink his
present and find something else so we're
now onto the next load of shops just a
whistle is trying on this kind of pink
sparkly top do you feel like I might be
able to dress up enough for Christmas
Aussie I think I'm gonna get it and try
it on with myself at home I'm not trying
on this gorgeous pink velvet dress from
Anthropologie because in the sale and
I'm in cheek to see what it looks like
on nope very frumpy I'm getting these
gray pajamas my friend Gemma for Secret
Santa almost finished at the shopping
center and then we need to go to Ikea
which is giving his grandma some pasta
bowls
but his budget only covers two I think
it's really random to get someone to
pasta bowls I love watching you trying
to get Christmas presents is probably
one of my favorite things okay we are at
IKEA I'm gonna get honey my nice
imbalancing bench she's really into
gymnastics for her birthday last year I
got her gymnastics mat from Ikea and she
loved it so I'm gonna get her
the gymnastics balancing bench it's a
little bit pricey if I know sure how to
say it and I want to get a part for my
new console table I'm having some limp
because my new shoes are killing me I'm
gonna get this to go at the bottom of
the console table for our scarves and
gloves okay
aisle two location one just cool you
Santa hey we're just on our way home and
we are driving past my sister's so we're
gonna quickly pop in to see the kids
especially
so here's a very cute age at the moment
and I just need to squeeze him like
everyday so we're gonna go have a quick
cup of tea before heading home because I
need to wrap some of these presents
right and back home I've got Christmas
music blaring out the speakers I've just
paused it and I'm gonna sit here and
wrap my presents got like a mini
wrapping station brown paper but if you
flip this and make baubles and string
and tags and then all my presents over
here there's not many there's like five
or six and I'm gonna sit here and just
wrap away so cue the time-lapse
Deb zipaquira for a cup of tea and to
watch a common what we go now they're
leaving me enriched making dinner I've
wrapped all my presents and put them
under the tree very happy with my
wrapping for the kids ones I've put on
these little like present toppers and
for the grown-up ones I've done these
pretty gift tags I'm string a couple of
little mini baubles I'll just get that
focus there and a little sprig of snowy
eucalyptus Gemma's present as my nephews
oh that one's Rocco is the baby and then
honey's is huge and it's really heavy
she's gonna have no idea what that is
we've got dinner in the oven in there
we've got loads of roasted veg like
potatoes and there's onion and stuff and
we're going to be cooking these pork
chops which we've been marinating in
like soy sauce and mirin and all kinds
of stuff I'm gonna sign off for the
night so I can chill and watch TV and
eat dinner with rich but I will be back
with you guys

them in there I'm gonna add some milk
and then I've got a selection of fruits
I've got some raspberries blueberries
little sprinkle of pomegranate and then
kind of just about half banana I'm gonna
add the milk in first and then bananas
around the side sprinkle some of the
fruit on top I probably mix that all up
together I really like it with the added
banana video I think we might go for a
walk before lunch I'm gonna pack up my
stuff now I think I'm gonna head to my
parents may be there for a walk and then
we're going to the pub for lunch I think
