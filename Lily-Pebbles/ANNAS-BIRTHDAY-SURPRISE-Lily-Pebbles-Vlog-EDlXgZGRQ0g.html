makeup and got dressed Anna is going to
be here in like 10 minutes so I'm having
a filming day with Anna today we've got
a couple of fun videos to film together

then we've got an exciting announcement
video to film which should be up on
Friday the 18th and then we're going to
go into town for some meetings and then
we've got our Mac meetup we're doing a
Mac meet up for their AIDS fun charity
so it's their Viva Glam lipsticks and
summer volunteering our time to come to
store and hopefully meet some of you

coming we've only kind of promoted on
social media so fingers crossed that
people turn up we never really know with
these things and where my Lily and
Lionel shirts today black jeans I want
to wear my Topshop sock boots but
they're very high I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to like walk to the tube
etc but I want to try because I haven't
really got my where are them yet I'm
currently wearing my favourite Primark
slippers which I am loving I think it's
time for me to get my hair colored again
as well it's just sudden to look a bit
dull so I might book that in I used this
palette today it's the Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics I just got this
yesterday it's an all matte palette look
how nice these shades are so today I'm
wearing this one all over the lid with a
bit of this and the crease in that under
the eye apart from like these three
shades and maybe the black I really like
them all I don't know if you can see on
my lid the kind of look I've gone for
mine quite a lot of makeup because I
need to film and then I need to last
until tonight as well Anna's just
arrived she said she's a not feeling
great
a little bit a little bit under the
weather I've given her some slippers to
wear I know so now we're both like
slipper Dyke spaceman she well so did

didn't really get her birthday presents
very happy to have a sick weekend oh my
god this is drawing on already that's
great I'm against it you can just film
wearing that I hope it fits I have like
GQ perfect yeah good I mean that is
fashion and it likes my face oh my god
yeah you do I've set up all the lights
and cameras and stuff to film I think
we're gonna be doing lots of laughing in
these videos so we're just getting ready
I'm just putting on some more makeup
I thought your makeup I was leopard
print we finished filming our videos
well two of them you've got two more to
do that was so so funny slash mortifying
incredibly embarrassing but worth
watching maybe Oh
am I gonna regret this we finished
filming all of our videos I'm now going
to take Anna to a little local places
are some nice salads we're going to pick
some salads probably come back here and
eat it we can't eat there but quite nice
and cozy here I don't know we'll see how
we feel when we get there um I have some
lunch do a bit more work and then head
into town lunch and it's gone for these
salads you chicken mm-hmm
very hungry some chicken in here I just
had to take some lipstick photos which
is why I would okay I wanted telecom
others just stripping and there's no
mirrors behind me is there I just had to
take some lipstick photos and it's left
quite a stain on my lips I've like tried
and tried to get it off my lips so sauce
so I just bought some lip balm and
hopefully they can like heal before the
Mac event tonight because I'm probably
going to want to put on a lipstick then
and so now I just have really like pink
shiny lips which is an interesting look
at
maybe the colors left behind Jeff Ross
three bit pink and we are just packing
up our stuff because we're going to head
into town we've got a couple of hours so
I reckon by the time we get there we'll
have like an hour I really want to pop
in to Reese to see some of the new stuff
and we might go to gleam and say hi and
then we're going to have a meeting and
we've had such a fun morning and lunch I
think we're ready to go and I'm wearing
my gorgeous dusty pink the dusty or
dusky I think it could be the - I say
dusty dusty pink coat Dada
oh my new Topshop boots I am going to
risk wearing these to walk to the tube
and stuff they're quite high I feel
sorry for Anna because I think the
moaning will happen at some point I'm
going to try and my new scarf from
Topshop which is just so soft and cozy
but I was a bit risky and went for baby
blue which doesn't go with everything
and now with this coat I look a bit like
some kind of pastel lover but I like it
I'm just going to go with it we're just
a gleam now and I got my Lancome like
the new lipsticks at least Eldridge has
made earlier on the week and they sent
me an illustration of myself and we've
just come to look at Anna's pure box and
she's got one too and I really want to
see what it looks like alright let's
