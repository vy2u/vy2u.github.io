watching this on a Sunday morning I hope
you've had a really good weekend so far
I am wearing a red lip today and I
haven't worn red lipstick in what feels
like about a year and I've eaten like
six months to a year I had my whole like
lip allergy thing and then I developed
this weird fear of a red lip they used
to wear red lipstick all the time and
every time I try and wear it I feel like
it makes me look really old
some reason I took a tip from Sam
Chapman from pixie woo and I used Ruby
woo from Mac and then I used a cotton
bud to just kind of slightly like fade
out the edges and I think I've managed
to make it work so I feel comfortable
now but I just thought I need to just
get it over with and wear red lipstick
because I have this weird fear of red
lips they're going to keep wearing nude
and I thought it was about time for a
change so that's my little red lip
disclaimer today's video is going to be
my April favorite this one kind of crept
up for me actually I can't believe it's
already time for another favorites video
it's been a month since the last one I
filmed but I did put together a list of
things and I'm pretty happy with
everything I've got
so I think I'm going to split this into
four categories and yes I'm going to get
going this is a nice soft matte complete
concealer and I went to the launch of
this quite a while back I'm pretty sure
it's out now though I'm not usually into
considers that come in a pot and very
much a liquid concealer doe foot
applicator kind of girl but I gave this
a go because I really like NAS I also
was a bit unsure about the word map I've
never really thought about the finish
that my concealer gives but I don't tend
to use anything that's Matt just because
my skin is quite dry I love this stuff
you can see how much I've used already I
use the shade medium custard you see use
vanilla in the liquid formula if some
reason custard works me in this formula
and it's so so good because it's got
really high coverage which means you
don't use that much but it's not cakey
or heavy at all it's not glowy
but then I don't really think I need my
concealer to be glowy i'll shrined
brightening conceal is quite hard to use
under my eyes I just want to cover the
darkness cover any redness around my
nose and chin and I just don't really
want to see my concealer or notices I
feel like I get my glow from other
products so I normally just kind of
press my finger into this and then Pat
it under my eye around my nose on my
chin and then blend out with a bra
sometimes I do like two layers under my
eyes but it's so good not the most
hygienic packaging ever but it's only my
finger just annoying does it get under
your nails a little bit you can also
swirl a brush in there and then apply it
I love it it blends out so well it's
definitely a concealer I would recommend
also good is the sort of one you can
throw in your handbag and just touch up
when you need to so I've been loving
that recently this is a product that I
got because Anna mentioned it better as
a brand I love I often forget to go
check out their new put up so and
animals raving about this it is the
first light priming filter instant
complexion refresh well it's a long name
so it's a primer and you can see it's in
this really pretty like violet shade
there are so many reasons why I love
this primer because I know that some
people often feel like primers are a bit
of a waste of time I like this because
it adds a layer of hydration to my skin
I often do my skincare routine in the
morning and I don't always do my makeup
straight away so it's nice to add
another layer of hydration just before I
do my makeup
the violet tone to it although when you
apply it it's sheer it's very
brightening and it's on purpose for like
dull skin and I often find the my skin
can be quite dull so the violet tones in
this just kind of brighten and waking up
my skin a bit it also has this citrus
scent again on purpose because they know
you're going to use this in the morning
it's meant to be energizing and
refreshing I love the scent of it two of
my favorite products have the citrus
said that it because netic CC cream also
has this like lemony scent and I just I
think it's so nice in makeup it's such a
nice change to that sickly vanilla sweet
scent that most makeup products have I'm
really really enjoying this I just apply
one pump all over to my face before I
apply my foundation and it's definitely
one of the best primers I've ever tried
so thank you Anna for that
recommendation I know I don't blog every
day like I used to but I still do blog
occasionally when I have the time and
recently I have a blog post about my
experience with a skin consultation I
went to me and my sister both went it
was so interesting if too much to even
explain to you but we like went in this
machine that analyzed our skin I found
out something really interesting about
my skin my sisters results were pretty
life-changing for her so I'm going to
link the blog post if you want to go
have a read but from that I kind of
started a new skincare
teen I was getting in a bit of a rush I
had like three products that I loved and
I was using but I really noticed my skin
change over the past year and a half
after speaking with the skin care
specialist she said from the age of like
28 to 30 s when your skin really does
change the most so I wasn't imagining
that my skin is there any aging and she
put me on this new routine that works
for my kind of aging skin now I'm going
into my 30s I need to just amp up a few
of my serums and slightly change the
ingredients I'm using I'm so in love
with my new very simple skincare routine
it is working so well and it's just it's
great it's great so go read the blog
quick if you want to see exactly what
I'm using but some of the products I
wanted to put in this video because I'm
really enjoying using them this one is
from the rush Jose I really like the
rush Jose I think it's really affordable
very easy to get hold of and the
products are just great these it's
somewhere between like being scientific
but not too scientific like still quite
easy to understand this is the reserve
ik c10 so this is an anti wrinkle
firming concentrate I use this is my
morning serum after cleansing before
moisturizing for pannonica SPF it feels
really light and hydrating on the skin I
love the packaging it's very small and
simple and easy and this can help me
with my wrinkles in the evening I've
been using now I don't use this every
night maybe twice a week I started with
once a week and doing twice a week kind
of build your skin up to it this is the
LA roche-posay reader mix R so this is
an anti-aging concentrate this has
retinol in so this will help to let the
texture of my skin slightly exfoliating
I'm pretty sure like Ruth clearly rates
about retinol creams all the time and
I've always thought like that we
understand what it is
so when she told me I had to use this I
was like okay it's time to get my head
around this and I really been enjoying
this in the evening when I first started
using it I did notice my skin was kind
of slightly peeling here but apart from
that it's very gentle and I didn't
notice anything like harsh on my skin
and it seems to be working well after
that and the evening I use this
moisturizer from skin Ceuta cause it's a
redness neutralizer now you read the
blog post you'll see that the Machine
identifies that my skin is actually
quite red I do suffer from redness but
because I've got solid tone to my skin
it kind of hides it as
some comments on my vlog saying what if
I hide it and why does it matter
but redness in your skin isn't just what
it looks like your skin shouldn't be red
so although it's not something you can
see on my skin it's still something I
need to acknowledge and look after so
this moisturizer will correct and kind
of neutralize the redness and it's a
really nice simple evening moisturizer I
used to use a lot of heavy oils and I
still will occasionally but I think it's
much better for my skin to use something
like two like this so that's been great
the final beauty product is from Real
Techniques and this is brush on their
new collection I think it's a multi tech
collection this is point L my Mac
bronzer brush was just shedding
everywhere every time I used it to apply
ones that end up with hair all over my
face so I finally got rid of it and use
this one instead and I really like it
it's big but it's kind of printed so you
still use it when I kind of do it there
still goes into the contours of my
cheeks it's just like the perfect
bronzer brush for me
I don't like them in a too big I don't
like them in or too small this fit
somewhere in between
it's a very good quality brush no
shedding at all easy to clean and I'm
really happy with it I went into the
white company a few weeks ago and
whenever they have a new scent they tend
to like spray it around the whole store
and I also thought it was and it was
their ocean tide sense it just smelt
like clean you know that clean smell and
I was like I need this because sometimes
no matter how clean or dirty your home
is it just doesn't have that kind of
clean smell and this is the perfect
thing to get that smell so this is the
ocean type home spray it says water lady
amber and Cypress keepers I don't know
how to pronounce that those are not kind
of cents I ever would have thought that
I liked this is the perfect room for him
someone's about to come over we just
need like a bit of them in your room
spray bit of this smells like fresh
linen on a spring morning
it's so nice I love it I'm definitely
going to retouch this when I run out
although I've used it loads and I hardly
any has gone down I would really
recommend this if you just want a clean
home smell
Stephanie in my mouth if you watched my
blog a couple of weeks ago you would
have seen that me and rich got a new
bedding from West Elm we picked up the
linen duvet cover and sheep I was very
skeptical about the whole linen thing
because it does kind of crease in
crinkle very easily and I'm not one of
those people that enjoys ironing my bed
sheets like I don't really I on anything
which is the INA because none of my
clothes require ironing so if I have to
iron bed sheets I just feel like that
such a waste of my life but my mom
really shows me that the more you use
and then where you wash them the softer
they get and you kind of just embrace
the crinkles and they kind of smooth out
so she if you use your hands to smooth
them out and we are loving these bed
sheets especially the like actual sheet
that you sleep on is so soft and amazing
and then the gorgeous blush pink duvet
cover I don't mind the crinkles I'm just
embracing it I think it adds that like
linen look and they're so soft they are
expensive but I feel like bed sheets are
worth investing in you know you're
sleeping in them and it has to be cozy
and soft and you want to enjoy getting
into your bed at night someone that
struggles to get sleep it's quite
important for me so we are loving our
own bed sheets I've just been loving
style fashion related things recently I
really enjoy putting outfits together
I'm enjoy taking outfit photos which is
such a pleasure because I know at the
beginning of my Instagram YouTube career
I used to really cringe taking outfit
photos but I thought I had to wear now I
just enjoy doing it but I feel the
pressure take one I used to think my
toga hadn't got any outfit pictures of
posters now I'm like oh god I've got too
many I look really self obsessed but
it's just fun and when you're happy with
the clothes you're wearing you kind of
want to show them off and share them and
I'm having a great time doing that you
would have seen in my recent haul video
my spring haul that I invested Anabella
forage jumper this is more than I've
ever spent on clothes maybe apart from
like a dress for a wedding or something
I don't even know and it was terrifying
and I thought a lot about it but already
I'm so happy that I made the investment
because I've worn it so much already and
it's such a special piece and I think it
really suits me and I feel great in it
it's the red 1970 jumper and I love it
because it's not too cropped it's not
too thick you can wear it in all
different weather you can kind of layer
it and I always get such compliments
when I wear it such like a statement
piece and
so happy I got it I don't have any
regrets and I hate spending like a lot
of money on something I always do loads
of research first but no regret with
this one I love it
my next style favorite would be my nice
trainers feels what we're holding like
thirty trainers up to my face
I love these my friend SJ got them and I
text they're saying do you mind if I
copy you and get the exact same trainers
in the same color and she said of course
not and then I didn't even realize these
are sold in and other stories so they're
like trendy trainers they're not even
like the ones you just get in like shop
I really like that they're not
completely white little bit like tennis
shoes and it's not as scary getting them
dirty then this like off-white slightly
gray color with a slightly blue ish kick
I think they're really cool I think they
look great with jeans nothing done
they're so comfortable they have a feel
a bit of a heel to them and I would
highly recommend them probably the best
trainer purchase I've ever made yeah I
know you guys like when I put in other
favorites as well as like fashion and
beauty and it's been quite a few things
I've been loving in the past month first
of all a film called a street cat named
Bob I watched this on the plane back
from South Africa from our honeymoon as
a true story based on this man who was
homeless and living on the street and
it's based in London and when I used to
work in Covent Garden I used to see this
man and his cat pretty much every day as
I'd walk out cause a garden station he'd
be busking and he always had like a
ginger cat on his shoulder and I feel
like if you worked in that area you just
knew Bob the street cat it was like a
thing everyone knew him he was like
famous but maybe only for those people
in cotton garden anyway one day I could
have stopped seeing him and I'd had we
ever thought about it before until he
released a book and turns out this guy
and his cat became like famous and it's
such a great story and I feel it's sort
of a personal thing to me because I saw
him every day for so long anyway the
book got turned into a film and I feel
like the trailer and everything doesn't
really do it justice I said it was going
to be a really silly film but it's
actually a great film and it really made
me think a lot about kind of home
business in London and it's changed my
attitudes about a lot of things and it's
also just a lovely story especially if
you're like an animal lover it's about
the relationship between this guy and
his cat
and how the cat saved his life
definitely worth watch it's like an easy
film to watch for such a nice one I'm a
big fan of John Mayer maybe not him as a
person but as a musician I absolutely
love her stuff and have done forever his
new album is out it's called the search
for everything he released for songs
like a week for two weeks leading up to
it and it's such a good album I really
felt like his style has changed so much
it's got a bit more like country which I
really like I'm a fan of the Eagles that
kind of country rock sings it's such a
lovely album let me see if I can like
pinpoint what my favorite songs are I'm
going to see him in concert soon and I
literally cannot wait I really like
emoji of a wave love on the weekend
never on the day you leave and you're
going to live forever in me such a good
album definitely check out if you
haven't yet and then the final favorite
is a TV show I've seen a lot of people
tweeting about this as well it's called
big little lies and before I started
watching it I hadn't heard much about it
but we just thought we'd give it a go we
were kind of watching it live and I
really liked it I actually haven't seen
the final episode yet because it's next
week I'm watching it on Sky like by the
air it's got so many famous people in it
like Reese Witherspoon they call Kidman
I can't even remember anyone else but
like most people you'd recognize and
you're like oh we did it - oh she's in
it - and it's kind of dark I feel like
it's like Desperate Housewives me
revenge or something like that it's in
that time Shawn roulette Grey's Anatomy
in those sort of programs but it is dark
and it's like quite heavy and gossipy
and it's based on a small kind of a
seaside town in America where all the
mums and wives are the main characters
of the show and it's all the
publications that go on in their lives
how it's really hard to describe things
like this anyway check out if you have
it if you're into that kind of thing
just watch the first episode and see if
you like it I think it's really good so
that is everything there's all the
things I've been loving over the past
month or so just want to give you guys a
quick update on everyday May if you've
been a longtime subscriber you'll know
that usually every May I do something
called everyday May which is when I vlog
every single day
I never really expected to do it this
year and but I hadn't thought about the
fact you go to expecting it so I'm
really sorry that I haven't updated you
sooner but I have probably the busiest
month ever I can't really tell you why
yet but it's jam-packed and I won't have
time to film every day there's some
things I can't film and then edit and
upload every day it's just too much when
I don't really have anyone helping me
with that so I'm not going to be
vlogging every day and I'm really sorry
but I promise you that the thing I'm
working on is good enough that hopefully
it'll be worth it but I am going to do
two blogs a week so instead of doing a
vlog on a Wednesday and like a proper
video on Sunday I'm just going to do a
vlog every Wednesday every Sunday for
the whole of me so it will feel like
you're getting so many vlogs and there
will be like two or three days a week
where I'm vlogging so guys it won't
matter that much it's more manageable
for me to only have to edit two videos a
week and also means that I can blog all
the cool things I'm doing so I hope
that's like a nice compromise for you
guys it's a bit more realistic for me
but I'm not completely stripped away
every day May so please subscribe if you
haven't yet you want to keep up with all
my videos in May and that's about it for
today so I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
