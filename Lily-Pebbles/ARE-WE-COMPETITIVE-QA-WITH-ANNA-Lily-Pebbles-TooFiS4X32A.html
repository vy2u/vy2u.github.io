makeup skills when I think I've got
glitter all down my face it's actually
go and remove it it's a video I'm
meaning like the lighting is you can
tell from this one I mean we're on fire
yeah it's evening we're about to go for
dinner but we have to film together in
ages and we know that you guys love it
and we love it because it's just so
chilled and enjoyable so we are gonna do
a Q&amp;amp;A I put on Instagram stories this is
actually an exclusive Instagram stories
here and I've never done one of those I
love Instagram story - yes so I asked on
there and you guys sent loads of
questions most of them were about
friendship they were like book related
reserved rice week they'd even ask that
so that doing good because the book is
coming out on Thursday good it is it's
Thursday this thing that's so exciting
thank you so much to everyone that's
already pre-ordered if you haven't yet
you know I've got a little mock-up here
it's our Thursday the F word my book I
can't believe people are gonna read it
but thank you to everyone it's ordered
so far I will put the links below
there's like signed copies which is
hilarious I get a signed copy yeah my
friends like you get me a book on like I
don't get how many no one I'm really
excited god it's gonna be a crazy week
I'll definitely be vlogging at all yes
so weird anyway okay so yeah we're gonna
do a Q&amp;amp;A and I've screen shots on my
favorite questions okay so I'm ready I'm
getting comfortable okay the first one
is like blog YouTube related highly we
have a question for you and Anna I would
love to know both of your thoughts on
naming a blog or You Tube channel with
your name similar to Lilly versus coming
up with a name similar to Anna's so like
mine's self-named it's called Lilly
pebbles and Anna's is that Anna edit but
something to mention is that we've both
changed our names okay yeah yeah we did
so originally my blog was called what I
heart today I had like 10 minutes to
name it and I wanted it to be something
quite general because I wasn't sure what
category I was gonna do and yours was
originally mine was originally if
anything I chose makeup once um kind of
in a way because Zoe's
is Zoey but zoella yeah so I feel like I
was quite inspired by that because I was
super into half look when I got into
blogging so I was like all with high
weights be my name but not my name and I
was terrified of people finding my blog
like that was just get the most awful
thing that could happen in the world and
so I put the 50 before the Anna
vivianne it does make up it just it kind
of made sense at the time but it just
didn't kind of when did I change it now
two years ago two and a half years ago
change it to that Anna edit I feel like
blog names are such a personal one for
you and there's kind of no right answer
to this question I changed I changed
mine quite early on yes mainly because
my like Twitter handle was Lily pebbles
I just felt like it was always like what
I heart today finally pebbles like it's
difficult because people often address
you by your blog name so if it's not
your name ends up being like you know
Lily pebbles from what I heart today
yeah I found it was just easier to be
Lily pebbles and it was kind of one
brand name and it wasn't kind of
confusing to be like that's my name but
that's my blog name you're also lucky
lily has a cool name
Lily pebbles I'm was I was Anna Gardner
and you know Anna Newton and I was just
like all that just like an illusion calm
it's available how the healing it was
taken actually I think it was a
photographer from like America it take
it wasn't Leigh and I was like oh I
guess I can't have that so for me I
couldn't have Anna Garden what Anna
needs and they were taken anyway so I
sort of had to come up with I don't
think it affects the success of your
blog or YouTube in any way I think it's
that completely down to content I think
it's just a preference thing this really
cool names they could like Lizzie shot
from the street yeah that's like such a
cool blog name yeah it's a hard one I
just say sit on your blog name for a
long time before you kind of go for it
and also just make sure you can get it
across everything and try not to make it
too specific because if you call it like
a photo a day and then after three years
you decide to do a photo a week yeah
like you don't make it too specific
don't call it they're the Anna's of me
and then decide you want to talk about
jeans all the time
hopefully be going off to uni in
September and I'm feeling a tad anxious
about making friends and just dealing
with the move away from home in general
do you have any tips for the first few
weeks of settling in you're going to get
ill yeah
get the freshest blue really bad yeah I
had it from September to December and it
wasn't until I came home and saw like my
home doctor that she was like she's
great you oh no well I I have quite fond
memories of my first few weeks at uni
just cuz everyone's in the same boat and
you're all sort of like trying to get on
and getting to know each other that's an
important need to remember is that
everyone is in the same boat yes
everyone's first week at uni and if you
want to cry just cry like I cried when
my parents left I'm such a home girl
I've never been away from home before
I've never lived alone before and they
went to leave and I was like what no way
like crying is completely normal
yeah but then my crop aid walked into
the girls room that was next to me
turns out she was from Brighton as well
and is now one of my best friends who I
see weekly even now so I think you're
definitely in the same boat I definitely
don't think of it as like oh my god
there's hundreds of people here just
think about like a small amount of a
time like you probably gonna be living
in a flat with five people or something
yes I just focus on those people first
and get to know them and try and nurture
those relationships and then you can
meet people on your course and just like
take it early don't intimidate yourself
by thinking like oh my god I need to
make loads of friends in terms of like
being if you'll be like socially awkward
you don't know how to like make
conversations with people I would say
for freshers week
get yourself a prop if you have an
inflatable flamingo
someone's gonna talk to you about your
inflatable for me yeah like have
something that just will get well you
different it was my birthday on the day
that we moved in my mum had made me a
cake and then mark came for a slice of
my cake and that was sort of how that
all like happen or was it more than a
slice but yeah I think that's like
that's what she really gets it yeah
props
crying think of people in stages don't
panic I nearly dropped out after three
days I'm so glad I didn't so just don't
let other people influence you because
there's other goin to drop out and
sheeny made me drop out and it was
terrible your life would be so different
right now you're so different I met my
husband at uni and I started my blog so
good luck it'll be amazing at home with
season two question mark
definitely oh yeah we're in the process
now of actually we've got homo to do are
we supposed to be like
with a list of who we want to interview
with for season two and then we're gonna
be recording it and I think like last
time it's all gonna happen very fast but
yeah once the books out of the way
yeah that is what we're gonna believe
you I have a book baby and then we do
podcast baby yeah I'm excited let us
know if there's anyone do you want us to
have on we want to mix up a bit not just
like blogger industry people and not
just Beauty even maybe I don't even just
women so let us know a name I reckon I
would be like my Gosling where do you
wonderful to next want to go on a friend
vacay I I'd love to go somewhere I feel
that we've done way too bright have an
actual thing and then I want to do like
a one two three like really think about
where you've wanted to go for a while
I've got three places I want to go but I
one of them would be great with you oh
okay one two three oh yeah oh we're
gonna go we're gonna do that oh she's
booked to fly and I want to go anyway
but I want to not even just the Aladdin
no offense I want to do it properly on
do like the Rockies and I want to like
go to Canada you do know that yank we
were going to do that without Malcolm
rich I know it's a double date that's a
double date holiday happy could I want
to go to Canada I want to go to Japan
especially cherry blossom season and I
want to go back to Cape Town
those are my like three I really want to
go I feel like we could do a good
because we're talking to Lizzy and
Lyndsey about Lisbon trip I mean like
that I mean yes I mean that would be
really cool I think
the Atlanta would be amazing if not
we're also bringing the boys and have me
a legal thing and then I would be with
you know I think I'd be fun to have just
like a chill maldives II kind of beachy
vibe like I'd love to because everything
we do together is work-related yeah so
there's always like an element of we
have to take photos and stuff like that
where is like imagine going somewhere
where I can just let my hair be frizzy
for a week and like swim in the sea and
not tie my hair up like
relaxing hair-related family it's like
if I don't have to straighten my hair
that's a holiday holiday yeah I'd be
great
yeah holiday yeah stay tuned 2018 but
you won't know about it cuz they'll be
holiday do you each have a specific
moment you remember when you were like I
love this woman like the friend version
of when did you know he was the one so
you've had longer to think about no I
haven't thought about it yours I don't
have a specific moment for me I judged I
judge new friends on like how quickly I
can have like a real deep chat with them
yeah I hate like top-line boring chat so
if I can like talk about farts straight
away ya know I was gonna say a similar
thing I remember we were walking down to
the old Arad management's office and we
were having this really deep
conversation about like sex when you can
talk that openly with me but I'm not one
of those people who doesn't talk about
things I feel like I'm quite an open
book I like to discuss a range of topics
of people and I feel like when we we've
got had those kinds of chats
yeah just would be like oh my god I need
far yeah you can't beat yourself in it
out feeling like you're being judged
like I can just be half like a moan and
that being like well god I hope it
wasn't you Moni in front of her I'd
write about this in the book actually I
was like I think sometimes when you meet
someone new you know when you walk away
from the situation if they pull out the
best in you or not sometimes I in a
situation thinking like Oh God like I
was really negative and Moni because
that person mob she made me feel that
way yeah sometimes you leave someone
you're like oh my god that was so great
yeah you're like when you want to spend
we enjoy spending time together like I
see you and I want to spend more time
with you yeah like a sign of a good
friend yeah
we're better when we're together
retention there are loads of questions
about long distance like are sort of
long distance where it's like different
cities yeah it's powerful because we
speak a lot I hate I hate I like a real
talker on the phone and Lily isn't so
but when we speak on the phone I feel so
special because I'm like I know Lea hey
we're more what's uppers we like dating
what's up but I just feel like that's
not like that's not a real way to
maintain a friend you see whatever you
see each other it's like buddy like
gives us the buzz I keep going for the
next few weeks yeah we have
like verbal diarrhea with each other and
then that keeps going and yeah how this
has been quite a long stretch but I feel
like over the next couple of weeks of
seeing each other quite a lot
hopefully I check my diary don't worry
don't worry okay next question
I love the minimalist style but
sometimes I feel like my outfits are a
bit boring how do you guys make a simple
outfit more special well you have come
to the right place because if there are
two people that do non-boring style
although you know it's uh I'm sorry like
yellow jumpers it's John pursue stuff
you do own a yellow no I mean that is
just so out there I think it's all about
the accessories and everyone says that
but you know you can get like a blue bag
or like cool car gene red lip a red lip
makeup makeup accessories yeah I joke it
I just don't care if I think if I be
minimalist I think if I look a bit
boring I'm like cool on brand yeah so
boring it's chic yeah and just there's
things that I I like a very neutral
palette but then I enjoy leopard print I
enjoy a bit polkadot yeah you don't have
to wear like plain non patterned a
hundred percent that's fine you can add
a little bit of like a neutral pattern I
was I think don't worry so much about
like colors and patterns if you're
thinking your app is boring it might be
something to do with like the shapes
you're wearing the structures you know
you could wear a black coat which is
technically a boring color but if it's
like a really beautiful fit but then you
would look great whereas in the air like
a big puffer coat
you're gonna look a bit more like you go
for a walk thank you all about the
shapes of your your clothes
I think you've won aware black
head-to-toe we're back GoPro what's your
favorite takeaway and your favorite item
to order from said takeaway okay I know
what yours is wait I have a question to
ask yeah obviously yours of Domino's
obviously yeah what's with this new you
know cheese pizza situation so when you
put it on your life sometimes I get
pizza cheese I was like Moses I've known
you well it happened in the last two
years because of a couple of things one
I went to I went to an Italian and
ordered a lasagne and choked on a glob
of cheese like fully like like almost
Vaughn I've known
so close to vomiting in a restaurant
because I was choking on melted cheese
and so that's freaked me out about large
amounts of now melted cheese layer and I
also I'm not crazy about no it has to be
like just a small amount and kind of
semi crispy yeah but don't like it when
it's really thick and really stringy and
on pizza hut there is an option for less
cheese hey so you're now you're ordered
Domino's and no cheese I'd rather have
no cheese and have too much user tool
because I kept picking off the cheese
screw that so will you get tomato and
citta martini pepperoni
sweet corn red onion and I know corn on
pizza is very crunch server so I get a
lot of comments to me like why the head
of you got caught on a piece that had a
lock on it
yeah yeah it's not my red onion world
white thing when I went to New Zealand
and I had a Domino's one night it costs
to pound 50 I you not
it's gonna cool or just no muhrtelle 8
to 5 pounds oh my god red ugly cheap out
there and I asked him I was like hey um
I have a medium blonde he's like we only
do one size I was like okay I said on a
sweet corn he's like corn like she
looked at me like I had three eyes oh
baby corns different in other countries
I don't think they're cool sweet called
corn maybe then what trust me I was like
sweet corn corn corn is like no you
don't do it and then they don't have the
garlic dip no like oh well obviously
like what the garlic dips is like oh my
god that is that is Domino is what you
can imagine
well they have he was like I can offer
you wrong no it's kind of similar no
offensive but it was yeah I've been
trying to get that into a video that
story I'm Alex I need to share here you
go I need to share my daughter glad I
could jump you in that and yours has to
be ty you know what it's not very good
ty take away I love tired I'd always get
to like this Aubrey ty and there's so
many Thai restaurants I love yeah but
they take away we have the mices Indian
oh and I always get chicken korma pilau
rice and pouring on
I love it I love it now I love curry mmm
so yeah quite MiraCosta do not hurry how
do you deal with competition when you
have a friend who works in the same
industry that you do or is there any
competition at all basically describe
your work wife relationship and how you
balance work and friendship and actually
we get assets a lot like outside of
filming I mean like normal people is a
lot like oh is it really compared to my
house at work especially is like we know
I need to be working the same sector but
we make similar content so obviously we
get similar jobs and as well so there's
be something we've always had to deal
with in a way but it's never I have you
can you know one time where it's been a
problem cuz I'm not sure I can know and
I think we've kind of we've had all
situations we've had like Lily gets more
views than I do I get more views and
Lily does Lily gets the job that I was
up for and she gets it and I didn't get
it vice versa like we've kind of had
every situation that you could have so I
don't feel like there's anything that
could happen I'm trying to think that
why it's never been an issue because I
wouldn't say I'm like that with everyone
there's definitely times where I feel a
bit competitive or a bit like all that
person's getting that and I'm not so not
say might say more like perfect people
I just know each other I think when your
real friends outside of work that you're
care for that person ends up being more
because if yes say when I grow that up
for a job and I didn't get it a Nana did
yeah a happiness I would feel for her
getting it outweighs the sadness I feel
for not getting it a hundred percent
thing you feel yeah I would feel in
those situations that that's happened
I'm like ah yeah it was it was like
right for you it makes so much more
sense anyway and I'm happy for you
that you got that if I don't get
something I want her to get yeah yeah
and we're very good at like sharing like
if one of us has a contact for someone
the other dozen will you're not like we
don't keep things to ourselves and keep
secret so very much like no I tell them
that you want to work with them too or
something yeah we just
I think we've we communicate we're open
we don't keep secrets from each other we
don't do things like behind the other
ones back yeah and you know we just we
genuinely do like each other so so that
that's the overriding thing I'm
fefe when when things happened so our
industry just shouldn't be competitive
like that there's enough there's enough
to go around
very lucky so um it's just not like it's
just not like that no I think you're
right
I see if there's any more questions what
did you like most about each other's
wedding oh we love this question and
your wedding is like pinnacle wedding
for me and that's always like what
people's not be competitive but you know
I mean it's always someone it's always
someone's wedding that you're gonna be
like Lillian Richards had X Lilly was so
involved in her wedding day
but it was just so you and Rhett like
everything about it was just like oh my
god it's like you and Richard threw up
all over the room like if there was
succulents and the back like I think
Lilly ceremony was unlike something I
will ever go to like the fact that she
yeah Jake did like nobody asked the most
kind of boring bit like no one's
watching that I say that I cried
everything could go do I thought like
yours you know Jake was the like
presenter officiant hmm he wasn't
official you know the word I'm on a
mission the unofficial permission and
then like SJ and Andy yeah did a song
and all of that was just like I really
really really enjoyed ceremony
fascinating oh my favorite part of your
wedding which again was the thought
because it was so personal and so it's
been I felt like so privileged to be
there when you're a wedding when there's
like three people you feel really
special I think anyone there I felt like
my favorite moment was that when we were
having was it lunch or dinner mmm dinner
table and like I've never be no
everywhere all the guests can fit on one
table it felt like intimate and nice to
just see everyone around that one table
and you were sat in the middle of the
orluk parents there so in the speeches
with a dad his speech he was like mixed
to us and like yeah intimate and that
was really nice
that's my parabolic in the restaurant
you could my dad was sat next to rich
yeah and he was like so I'm gonna like
trying to bury sad
like like it was like trying to involve
you and yeah breathe I think everyone
just felt really involved in the whole
day that's always really nice about that
okay we are gonna end on that question
um and yeah that was it I hope you guys
enjoyed the QA have you pimped your bit
