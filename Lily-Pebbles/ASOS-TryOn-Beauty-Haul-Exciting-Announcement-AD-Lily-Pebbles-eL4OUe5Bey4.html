a ginormous beauty and fashion haul it
actually wasn't meant to be this big but
I've just been collecting stuff over the
past kind of month or so and I was gonna
just do a beauty haul but I picked up
some things as well from Topshop and a
sauce that I thought I'd just throw in
at the end and show you guys so stay
tuned to the end if you want to see
which fashion bits I've picked up I'll
do some cutaways and try them on for you
but before I get started with my beauty
haul I have some really really exciting
news to share with you guys I've been
waiting so long to tell you and I'm so
happy the day is here Anna and I have
teamed up with one of our favorite
Beauty websites cult Beauty you guys
know we go on about cult beauty all the
time we've teamed up with cult Beauty to
create our own cult beauty box are you
ready for the reveal
we designed the box ourselves by the way
this is what it looks like it's a huge
marble box and on the front it says in
gold of course
the cult beauty box Anna and Lily this
is so exciting to actually have this in
my hands because we've spent months and
months planning it designing it and Anna
and I picked out the products inside
ourselves it's one set price for the box
and there's a limited amount but we've
picked all the products inside and as
you can imagine there's a huge saving I
think it's about 40% saving on this box
there's so much info to tell you so what
I've done is I've written a blog post
with everything you need to know so I'm
gonna link the blog post down below I'll
quickly show you a couple of things
inside and tell you how you can get your
hands on one of these but for all the
information please check the blog post I
really don't want you guys to miss out
so the box opens like this
I don't want to ruin it too much of
course it had to have a full sized
auskey renascence cleansing gel this is
my Nana's absolute favorite cleanser
this was the first product that we both
said that has to go in the box and then
what else is in here everything's so
good I think you guys are going to be
really impressed by the sample size of
the Sunday Riley lunar oil because this
is a huge amazing travel friendly sample
size but I'm gonna put picture up now
that shows you guys pretty much all the
products that are in the box there are
seven products in there all handpicked
by Anna and I all of our favorite
products we absolutely love every single
one I could talk about each product for
so long but that's why I've written the
blogpost as I said there are a limited
amount of boxes so how it works is you
have to sign up to the waitlist
and I'm gonna link in the blog post
below how to sign up to the waitlist the
waiting list is already live and then on
the 29th of April at midday if you are
already on the waiting list you'll get
an email and you can only buy the box
using the link in that email so you have
to join the waiting list if you want one
of these boxes please go check out the
blog post for more information I am so
excited about this it's such a beautiful
box I'm gonna put it here on my marble
table it's a prison so now let's get on
with the beauty and fashion haul and the
first thing I picked up was a
replacement because I finally finished
my mac syrup lipstick I haven't thrown
it away yet because there's a tiny bit
left and I just love it so much it's
definitely my all-time favorite MAC
lipstick which is weird because it's not
like a traditional color and I feel like
I don't know that many other people that
wear it but I absolutely love it
it's actually a luster finish which is
it my fave but it's such a nice kind of
plummy nude it's just really interesting
it has slight purpley tones to it so
flattering I it's just my most worn I
always go and grab maxi rack when I'm
not sure what to wear on my lips also
from Mac I picked up a new brush I
haven't picked up a brush from Mac in
quite a while but this one really caught
my eye while I was in there it's the 109
and it's a very small contour brush it's
a really nice small size and I thought
this would be good to use for
highlighter because it's quite small I
think it's actually too small for
contour for me because I feel like it
would just be too kind of dense that I'd
get a really harsh line I think for
either setting concealer or highlighter
it's a really cute little brush and I
haven't got one that's a similar size to
this so after I visited Mac in Carnaby
Street I walked over to Oxford Circus
and I actually popped in to M&amp;amp;S I went
to look at some of their clothes for
those of you who are from the UK you
might not know M&amp;amp;S it stands for Marks
and Spencers and they've recently
released a new Beauty line they've
actually got an amazing Beauty haul and
they sell look good feel better products
in there
they have Stealer they've got like skin
iceland really interesting brands so
definitely check out the M&amp;amp;S beauty haul
if you haven't yet but they've also just
released Rosie for autograph so
autograph is their own range and they've
collaborated with Rosie
huntington-whiteley
and Lisa Eldridge a whole video on the
range with
herself and really made me want to try a
few of the bits so the first thing I
went to pick up is the amazing radiance
cream this is a primer it's one of those
glowy primers you put all over the skin
before it has SPF six in it that's such
a random number for an SPF I've tried
this once and it seemed really nice it
wasn't too kind of glittery or chunky at
all just a really beautiful sheen but I
haven't really tried it properly so I'm
looking forward to giving it more of a
go but I think Rosie said this was one
of her favorite products from the range
I also picked up one of the lipsticks
and took me a while to pick one I have
to say that the testers were a bit gross
I hate it when the test is all like
mushed up but the lipstick seemed really
nice so this is in the shade rose lace I
feel like Rosie huntington-whiteley is
really known for her beautiful nude lip
and this is a really pretty slightly
peachy nude a bit different to other
nudes that I have I normally go for more
of a plummy nude this one definitely has
a bit of peach in it I think it's really
nice I've tried it once I did like it I
felt like I had to dab it into my lips a
bit just to make it less found
contrasting but really nice creamy
formula actually and I'm looking forward
to wearing that a bit more lipstick I'm
wearing today is another liquid lipstick
I have a serious addiction I feel like
when I become obsessed with products
they don't normally last this long but
I'm really on a liquid lipstick train
here and this is from Anastasia I really
like the formula of the anastasi ones
I've got one other and my friend Keisha
bought this shade back from New York for
me because it was sold out on Sephora
calm and it's pure Hollywood think this
is the one that Jacqueline Hill talks
about a lot really nice like proper nude
I actually thought it would be too nude
for me but it's perfect I am in love
with this and I feel like I'll
definitely get a lot of use out of this
I love the packaging of the Anastasi
liquid lipsticks I love the formula if
you can't get hold of the Kylie Jenner
lip kits I'd say these are pretty much
on par and I think the packaging is
better I popped in to the Liberty Beauty
Hall again one of my favorite Beauty
halls in London it's just so beautiful
and calming to walk around and I picked
up something from ESOP I love how when
you buy things meets up you get them in
this cute little bag because these
things are really good actually put
you're putting your handbag if you don't
have sections in your handbag you can
like put things in here and pop it in I
just got two things the first one is the
resurrection rinse free hand wash rinse
free hand wash is basically a fancy name
for like hand gel you know the ones you
just squeeze out rub it in and you're
kind of good too
gets rid of all any bacteria this one
dries really quickly actually I haven't
had it before but my mom always carries
this in a handbag it smells it smells so
nice really like that and I just needed
another come upon jealous I thought
would get a little bit of a fancy one
this time and then this product you
might think I'm a bit weird and it's
kind of a bit of an awkward product to
buy at the counter but seriously it's
worth the embarrassment these are the
eats up post who drops yes you heard me
right post Poudre ops my mum has had
these in the house for so long and I
wanted to see if they actually work
before investing in some for myself or
for my home these are basically little
drops that you drop into the toilet
after you have Donna poo after you have
flushed and it just gets rid of the
scent I probably won't even talking
about poo in this video but you guys
know in the toilet stinks it's not just
me like it could be your partner or if a
guest visits and then they spray room
spray and for me I just think it ruins
the room spray because now every time I
smell my lovely dip teat room spray it
just reminds me of like smelly poo so
this is perfect because it doesn't just
mix with the scent it just eradicate the
scent completely there's it has a
tangerine peel Alang Alang mandarin peel
in instances where vigorous activity has
occurred in the bathroom dilute several
drops of this carefully crafted products
in the toilet bowl after flushing for
the benefit of all subsequent visitors
it's so good I don't know how it works
but it does it doesn't really leave a
scent it just gets rid of the scent that
you don't want in your bathroom
hilarious I think they're genius such a
funny product to buy come on now every
single person on the planet please let's
not be embarrassed okay so now I'm going
to talk through the style pieces that I
picked up I bought two belts from
Topshop one is just a very thin plain
black belt with gold buckle this is
simply just to keep my trousers up
because I'm finding that because I'm in
between sizes some of my trousers are
just really loose on me or somewhere
like culottes I meant to be high-waisted
aren't high waisted enough so this one's
not really going to be shown it's more
just to literally keep my trousers up
this felt I picked up because a girl I
know called Alex who I'm completely
obsessed with her stars do you guys just
have that where there's someone in your
life that you're like oh my god
everything they wear I
we're and I saw her wearing a white
t-shirt tucked into jeans with this belt
and I was like I absolutely loved that
style
it's from Topshop it's black and it has
this kind of worn vintage II gold buckle
and then it also so it goes all the way
along like that and then has this not
another buckle on the side which i think
is really cool it makes it quite hard to
put on because you have to get it
through all your Jean poops and it's
quite hard it's getting bit annoying but
it looks really cool once it's on and
I'm really glad I got this belt I think
it's a really cool like addition to my
accessory wardrobe now I know in my
handbag collection video I said I've got
one clutch it's amazing I don't need any
more this does everything I then went
and bought a clutch bag that always
happens I should just not say these
things in videos but I saw this in
Topshop and just thought it was so nice
it's plain black and it has this gold is
it gold or silver it's kind of somewhere
in the middle I think it's gold ring
metal ring and it's definitely a copy of
the Chloe bag but it's not like a direct
ripoff it's just inspired by and as you
can see it's kind of wider at the bottom
thinner at the top opens up like that
and you can actually fit quite a lot of
stuff in there I don't use clutch bags
of that often but I feel like it's nice
to have a smart one like this so when I
do she think it's really like
sophisticated and I've seen a few people
wear it and think it looks really nice I
wore this top in my Kylie Jenner lip kit
review video which if you haven't seen
go check it out so you would have seen
this jumper already
it's from Topshop and it's cream it's
high neck but not like polo neck it
doesn't go too high up which I really
like I think I know it's a quite
flattering on me and this is quite a
cropped jumper it's not short on the
website it says it's a boxy jumper so
it's just got that kind of box shape to
it and slightly shorter sleeves that
roll up so I would wear this with
high-waisted jeans or a skirt but I just
really love the top of it and I like
that it's cream which makes it quite a
good transitional piece going into
spring we're always a bit later on the
whole spring thing in the UK I feel like
we don't even get spring really because
it only starts kind of getting sunny and
warmer towards June which is technically
summer but this is kind of a good spring
piece when I picked up these jeans in
Topshop Anna laughed at me she was like
that's such a lily thing to pick up
they're so weird but once I actually put
them on even Anna thought they looked
pretty cool I'm definitely more of a
gold person and
/ but I couldn't resist getting these
jeans there the Haden style which I've
never actually tried before they're kind
of baggy but not too baggy they're still
quite flattering I can't wear the mom
jeans they look awful on me but I still
like to wear this quite high-waisted I
wear a belt with them I don't know if
they're meant to be high-waisted but I
worth of my wastage and then at the
bottom they roll up and they've got
these silver stripes
it's like silver foiled stripes and I
just think it's so cool it makes jeans a
little bit more fancy a little bit more
trendy something a bit different
something a bit special and I really
like them they definitely get a lot of
comments and I've worn them people have
said oh wow look your jeans they're
interesting but I really like them I
think they're cool which is the main
thing oh my god thank you guys so much
from your comments by the way on my most
one style items video but there are a
few people that don't really understand
that people just wear what they like to
wear I don't care if my Stars boring or
unflattering or oversized very strange
some in the comments someone told me
that I wear man's shoes didn't realize
that trainers and Chelsea boots were
owned by men did you the next thing I
bought is a dress which is very on me I
find wearing dresses very difficult
because in general my style is very like
tomboy kind of baggy and masculine I
guess but in the summer it's nice to
wear dresses and I'm going to South
France a couple of times one on a press
trip and one with my family and this
dress seemed very South of France
esque it's high-necked and had these
type dungaree straps I love this high
net because it kind of just squashes my
boobs down and makes me feel like
they're a bit smaller and then it kind
of cinches in at the waist and drops and
goes out slightly to just below the knee
so it's very kind of chic sophisticated
but the gingham print makes it quite fun
I was very unsure about this if you
follow me on snapchat my username - Lily
pebbles I did like a live Asus Hall
witness came and I tried it on and there
are a couple of things I sent back but I
kept this and I think it's gonna be
really nice to the summer I may not get
loads of wear out of it but I think for
my holidays I will and I like that it's
a bit different I often just buy like
different things just to encourage me to
wear it but sometime
I just ended up not wearing at all this
shirt was also in my snapchat Asus hall
I got a face loss but it's actually a
River Island shirt and I wanted a thin
white shirt that I can like tuck into
denim shorts or jeans in the summer I
really like this because it's got a
collar but it doesn't do up at the top
and that's where I always find it most
unflattering when I wear shirt it has
this v-neck here and then the buttons
start a bit lower down it's a very thin
soft material and has this beautiful
lace detail down the front I'm gonna
have to buy like a white bra or
something to wear underneath but I think
it's worth having to buy a new bra
because it's such a pretty shirt and
it's got gold buttons and I think it
would just be really useful I think I'm
going to LA as well it'll be nice tucked
into denim shorts I'm trying to get into
buying spring clothes now even though
it's not really spring here because I
know that by the time I need spring
clothes for holidays all the shops are
gonna be selling like summer probably
even autumn stuff I feel like I always
miss the time when you should be buying
the right things so that's really pretty
and then I also bought some new trainers
I didn't realize I was gonna put these
things in haul video so sorry if you do
follow me on snapchat and you've already
seen all of this before but I realized
that I was wearing my night black
trainers to the gym which meant that
suddenly I couldn't really wear them on
the weekend anymore because they just
felt like really gross and sweaty and
reminded me of working out so I wanted
to buy some weekend trainers and I ended
up going for these they're the night I
really should have looked into this
first though the night air fear I'll
link all the products that I'm talking
about below in the description box so
just click show more and it will show
you all the links but they are bright
white which I really love I hope I can
keep these clean they have a little bit
of a platform which is something I'm not
used to with trainers normally my
trainers are quite flat or wear converse
quite a lot I like that these gave me a
little bit of a lift I feel like they're
gonna be really good for my back because
I have flat feet they're so so
comfortable and I like their white
because I feel like if you wear them
with black jeans or like a monochrome
outfit you can really smart in them up
I'm just so into wearing trainers at the
moment it's all about comfort such a
good weekend shoe I could definitely get
away with wearing these for like
meetings as well they look a bit like
tennis shoes but I love tennis so that's
fine so those are all the beauty and
style pieces that I've picked up over
the last month please don't forget that
