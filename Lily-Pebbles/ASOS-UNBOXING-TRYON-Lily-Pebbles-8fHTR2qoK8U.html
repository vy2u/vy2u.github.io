wasn't actually planning on filming
right now it's 5 o'clock I never film
this late in the day so it's probably
gonna get very dark around me but I just
got two deliveries from ASOS and I'm so
excited and some of these pieces are
gonna be for an autumn styling video
I've got coming up but I mentioned this
on Twitter and loads of you guys said
that you'd love to see an unboxing video
as well and I've seen these videos done
before by Victoria
Amelia Lydia and I absolutely love
watching them I don't think I've ever
actually done one before where it's not
really like a whole it's like a try on
haul where you go through everything and
then separately I'll do cutaways trying
on the items and actually talking
through what I think of them so it's a
bit experimental for me I've never done
it but I absolutely love watching them
so I thought I would do a little Asus
unboxing or unbagging there's so much
stuff it's in two separate deliveries I
mean look how big this bag is I feel
like everyone shops on ASOS differently
and I'm definitely one of those people
that over orders because I know that I'm
gonna hate most of the stuff I'm so
fussy when it comes to materials and how
things feel on me and I'm also in
between sizes so I often have to get a
10 and a 12 in some of the clothing
items there's nothing more frustrating
than when you like something but it's in
the wrong size and you have to wait to
send it back and then get another one
let's start with the smaller one
slightly less intimidating I'm quite
neat when I open my estas parcels I know
that when you have to package it all
back up
I really felt like there's been such a
shift in the weather recently which is
why I've ordered loads of like autumnal
clothes because suddenly the weather's
just much colder it's quite crisp I
really like it but I need to get out on
my kind of autumn wind for things from
under the bed and put away all my summer
clothes can't really remember
I ordered ok the first two things on top
of here are little boxes I've just
remembered what these are I have a black
denim jacket I also have a blue denim
one but more recently I've bought one
from Daisy Street which is a brand on
ASOS I really love that chin up
buttercup jumper you all ask me where
that's from that's from Daisy Street on
ASOS and the black denim jacket I have
has a little unicorn on it it's really
cute and I thought I thought a couple of
pins would look quite cool on the jacket
as well so the first pin I got is a
little pineapple these are both from
skinny dip so that's a little pine
oh really sweet and then the other pin
oh my god Anna is gonna love this it's
the money flying away emoji I feel like
Anna uses this one all the time whenever
she's out referring to a hall or
anything ah so cute they're like really
good quality pins as well I literally
feel like a teenager in the 90s wearing
pins but I wanted to try something
different okay this is probably the most
expensive thing in this hall so I
definitely have to think about whether I
want to keep it or not
it's all nicely packaged this is a scarf
on whistles okay so this is a big comfy
scarf
first impressions not as soft as I would
have liked maybe a little bit itchy it
looks like this orange and grey so I
guess I should try this on in the
cutaway and tell you what I think
properly okay so this is the scarf I
always let's check how many times it can
wrap around okay it wraps around twice
which is good I really like the colors
but it's a little bit itchy that's the
only thing that kind of puts me off I
think for how much it is I remember it
being like sixty something pounds 85
pounds I think I could find a better
scarf it's a little bit itchy
I like scarves they're like a really
soft and cozy so as much as I like the
print I think that's gonna have to go
back next up is a top and this was a bit
of a wild card I don't really remember
why I ordered this but let's see oh god
I don't think I like this I tend to just
order weird things when I'm on like an a
sauce crazy shopping spree this is a
navy blue sequin top and it looks really
nice on the model but now looking at it
I'm not sure I think it's gonna be it's
got like a little zip at the back but I
think because it's high next I think
with my size boobs it's not gonna be
that flattering what size did I get I
remember they only had like one size
left oh it's a 10 it has come up bigger
than I thought actually I thought with
some like high-waisted trousers that
look could look cool I'm gonna have to
try and see but it feels not that great
I don't know how I feel about that I
don't think I'm gonna like it I'm gonna
start by showing you this top from back
here I'm wearing it with these like
whistles black trousers that I already
own I don't hate it as much as I thought
I would maybe because it's really weird
and I kind of like wearing weird
I don't know why I've already had a
sequin drop-off on the floor which is
really annoying that I hate that about
sequin tops it's definitely quite like
warm is thick which is quite nice so it
feels a bit more like a jumper than a
top becoming closer I don't know how I
feel about this because I don't hate it
and I thought I would but I do think
it's kind of weird and probably not very
flattering because it's got these like
long sleeves and quite like punchy this
is the sort of thing I'm gonna have to
stare at myself in front of a mirror for
a while to try and decide but yeah I
don't I don't really hate it I don't
know if I love it also I quite like this
collar because it kind of makes it more
casual it's a bit like a that you know
what you get on bomber jackets around
your wrists like elasticated and I quite
like that okay now onto the absolutely
huge parcel I remember correctly I
ordered quite a few trousers I feel like
all I wear is jeans and tops and I just
really want to have an alternative and I
don't know what that alternative is and
I feel like they never suit me so I just
ordered a load to try on some in the the
same trousers at different sizes these
are from ASOS white which is a range I
really like on ASOS I feel like it's a
little bit more premium than the other
range as they do and I always find some
nice kind of basic stuff on there so the
back there black trousers the back is
stretchy and then the front has like a
pleat down in they look huge 32 waist 32
waist weight oh these are size twelve
they look really really big way bigger
than a twelve I don't know what those
gonna look like I need to try but I
reckon there's gonna be big I wonder if
I've got those in a 10 as well it's a
bit of a shame with these trousers
because I really like the length and
they're really comfortable and they tick
all the boxes in terms of not being
jeans but this part here I think just
makes this whole area look bigger and I
don't think it's very flattering I like
that they're high-waisted they sit in
the right place up here but I think I
look a bit like Aladdin which is not
what I was trying to get out oh I also
ordered some nice cozy knit imagine if
every single cut where I'm like no I'm
going to send this back and I may end up
keeping nothing that would be a great
video wouldn't it this looks like a big
cozy chunky knit I am really into like
hi next row
or to winter this is like a kind of
light gray creamy color it looks a
little bit short which is quite nice if
you're wearing high-waisted trousers
high neck but not like really really
high and then like slouchy arms it's got
kind of batwing arm so I'm gonna try
that feels nice though not itchy this is
the jumper which I kind of like I mean
it's not flattering at all but it's kind
of good to have these things for
layering because the batwing always feel
like this bit looks a bit like boxy but
I like the high neck very comfortable I
like the color of this one though so
like I haven't got other ones this color
we found another box Oh a choker I don't
own any chokers I was watching a Lilly
Maria's video and I actually really
liked it it was like an autumn styling
tips video and she talks about chokers
and I thought why not give one ago she
actually talks about this specific
choker I have never worn a choker before
and I have quite a long neck so I feel
like I don't really want to add to that
let's see you feel like claustrophobic
feeling it's quite cool actually I kind
of like it I'll try it on properly and
let you know go like a velvet strip
going through the middle I mean
literally it feels like the cheapest
thing ever
hope I didn't spend much of it doesn't
say hey these look like more houses oh
these are like the faux leather trousers
again a bit of a wild card but the model
always looks good in the things and then
oh I just need to try I hope these look
good on their like faux leather trousers
with the tie waist what size did I even
get in these 12 I hope I got the 10 as
well I'm just so in between sizes I
never know and I do want things to be
like clingy on my thighs always get
nervous and then get 12 and then it
never fits like a weird panic moment I
don't know these could either be really
cool I feel like they're gonna be the
sort of thing that look cool but you
also just look like a bit of a no
wearing them okay these are the leather
trousers and I don't know how I feel
about them mainly because I'm not used
to wearing these sort of charles's but
they kind of fit their like semi
high-waisted I'm not sure how I feel
about this tie I could probably just try
it I don't know whatever you like the
time I kind of like that their phone
they're a bit different I'm gonna see
how many of my other tops like go with
them they're quite comfy I just don't
know if they're that flattering I also
thought I would give a midi skirt a go
I'm not massively fond of having bear
legs in autumn winter I do get quite
cold but again I'm just trying to like
mix it up a bit I have a couple of
events coming up I thought I could maybe
wear this if it looks nice it's much
more like gold than I thought it would
be it's like a high-waisted well looks
like it's gonna be kind of see-through
oh no maybe not high-waisted pleated
skirt when I wear long skirts and I hope
this doesn't offend anyone I tend to
look like I am religious and I don't
know why maybe it's just in my head but
I'm gonna try this again I think it
depends what you like pair it with like
a slouchy jumper could be nice I don't
know I'm gonna give that a go it feels
nice so it's like silky this is the
skirt and I do like it I kind of wish it
was a little bit shorter because it's
that a little bit too long and I'm
wearing it with like a really big jumper
because I think if I walk with a little
top it would be too dressy I'm going to
try this on with shoes to decide I like
it
I feel like it would really look blow in
the wind and be quite like dramatic
which I wouldn't be a fan of I kind of
like it there are likely with the jumper
I do wish it was shorter there I feel
like it's a little bit long I'm gonna
have to think about this one but it's
nicer than I thought it would be so
girly that I'm just not used to wearing
skirts it's really hard to get the
angles right but this is what it kind of
looks like close up you can see it's
quite gold and metallic I've just tucked
in the jumper there slightly then
because I feel like when it's untucked
it just looks too like frumpy if you
kind of tuck a little bit in there I
don't know what I'm doing but you kind
of get the gist okay another gray knit
by the way if anyone's wondering where
this t-shirts from is from Urban
Outfitters and I bought it on the
weekend and I really like it on the
Itchy factor so it's like a three or
four soft oh this is a jumper dress so
it's high neck and it has this like cuts
off so it kind of looks like it's jumper
and a skirt but it's not it's a jumper
dress and I love jumper dress as an
autumn although this one's quite fitted
and I'm not really wanting to wear like
fitted dresses so
I'll give that a go also I think that it
won't look good with tights and I don't
know if I could deal with bare legs I
think that's the same thing in a
different size I am NOT a fan of this I
love the idea of it it feels comfortable
but I feel like it just it doesn't
platen my boobs it doesn't flatten my
hips it's just it's a bit like librarian
doesn't flatter my tummy it's just not
for me
I like I like the idea of it there I
think this would suit a lot of people
you just have to have the right figure
or you just have to feel happy in it I
personally don't feel happy in this okay
the final thing is from Daisy Street
that brand which I'm absolutely loving
they just have such like cute like
embroidered clothes and I think the
detail that makes it look more expensive
than it is it's really affordable this
is a similar like dusty pink like that
chin up Buttercup job that I have I
really like this color actually it's
like a nice way of wearing pink without
being too girly but it's just a plain
sweater how do you have a why order that
but I thought it would be useful for
like layering so I'll try that on that's
probably gonna be the only thing I end
up keeping is like the boring plain
semester it's definitely the least
exciting thing from the haul it's just a
plain sweater but I wear things like
this all the time especially when I'm
working from home so I think I'll keep
this it doesn't look as nice as I kind
of wanted it to look on but it's it's
thin and it's comfy and I quite like the
blush color so I know I'll wear it a lot
so I'm just gonna keep it so that is
everything I bought from ASOS and I
don't know what I've decided to keep or
not keep yet because I haven't filmed
the cutaways but you guys will know
because you would have seen so let me
know if you like this style of unboxing
this time of year is probably when I
shop the most I'm not a big fan of
spring/summer clothing but I love autumn
winter so someone needs to hide my purse
but if I do any more shopping I will do
some more hauls for you guys thank you

be back doing videos again back in like
work mode I'm loving it I missed it and
