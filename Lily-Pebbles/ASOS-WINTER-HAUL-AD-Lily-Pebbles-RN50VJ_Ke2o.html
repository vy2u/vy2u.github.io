it's gonna be an ASIS winter pool I have
a huge parcel here I can't wait to look
through it all and show you this video
is actually in collaboration with doddle
because it's Christmastime it's a really
busy time of year for me I'm not often
in my flat
so for deliveries like this from ASOS
it's so handy for me to be able to click
the free Click &amp;amp; Collect option for
doddle pick up my parcel and my own
convenient time from one of the doddle
stores so what I did in this case is I
had meetings in town all day so I did
the free Click &amp;amp; Collect option with
Dajjal and then on the way back from my
meetings in town I just picked up my
parcel and brought it home with me
there are Dajjal stores all over the
country so it's really easy to kind of
work in with your own schedule yeah it's
great if you're too busy to be at home
or you can't get parcels delivered to
your office you can use dawdle for a
sauce like I have they also work with
brands like Amazon new-look and
misguided and for this video dadoo have
actually set up a really cool
competition so that one of you guys can
win a 500 pound a sauce about show just
so exciting oh my god 500 pounds on a
sauce I would go crazy so if you want to
enter the competition to win I will put
the link for the competition in the
description box below go and enter you
never know you might get lucky and win
500 pounds to spend on a sauce that
would be pretty cool so I'm gonna dig
through this giant purple parcel here
and show you guys what I got from Asus
because there's quite a big mix of
things actually like it's not all
clothes okay the first things I'm gonna
show you
I'm so excited because I haven't been
able to like take these out of the box
yet and I'm desperate they're from Paper
Chase but I got them from Asus for glass
dual decoration so these are tree
decorations as you can see I have my
Christmas tree behind me but it doesn't
feel quite finished yet and I can't wait
to put these on so I got two boxes you
get four and they're so me I don't if
you guys know but I love this style we
have loads of lanterns and terrariums
around the flat and they all have this
similar like copper diamond glass
jeweled style I just think they're gonna
go so well with our flat I've got eight
so I thought I could just kind of
disperse them over the tree and I think
they're so so pretty our tree really is
lacking color I don't get the coppers
really gonna help with that but it might
add a little bit like all my tree
decorations this year like see-through
and glass I don't know why yeah these
are so so cute
a car way to put in monetary while I'm
talking non fashion stuff I also bought
these snowman bath salts I'm pretty sure
my friend Rob isn't gonna watch this
video I have him for Secret Santa this
year so we're gonna make him like a
special set of bath products we've only
got like 20 pounds to spend I thought
these were really cute to go in that set
that the mr. snowman vanilla bath salts
yeah I could put some like lush bath
stuff in there as well I just thought
these were really sweet and it was in
like the Christmas section of ASOS
before I head on to my stuff I thought
show you I got rich something as well
because I'm doing a stocking for him
this year all his presents are very
practical because he doesn't like faff
he just likes things that he needs and
he loves a good cozy gray jumper so I
got her miss from ASOS it's by United
Colors of Benetton it's just the plain
grey jumper but he loves these kind of
jumper styles so yeah I think he'll like
that I'm going to put that in his
stocking okay then I also picked up a
coat I've been on the hunt for a really
warm coat and I really like this one
I've briefly tried it on before this
video but unfortunately they only had a
10 left so it's a little bit short on
the arms it doesn't quite fit but it's
such a nice coat and it's so cozy it's
like a slightly beige maybe a little bit
blush pink which is a color I really
like it's got this faux fur hood and
then it's kind of two textures so it's
slightly waterproof but then it's also
it's a bit like faux pony hair which I
think's Martens are up a bit it's a big
puffer coat I think everyone needs one
of these and I haven't got one I must
find one maybe they'll get 12 in stock
and then I'd definitely be interested in
getting this one I think it's really
cozy it's got a hood it's just a little
bit small unfortunately okay so I
haven't tried any of the other stuff on
open up this parcel right let me edit
out though the rustling of the plastic
this is a dress and it's from warehouse
I have lots of like Christmas parties
Christmas events like just I feel like
this time of year there's lots going on
so it's always good to have a little
black dress which I do not have this
one's from where
so I thought it'd look really
interesting on the website it's a slight
v-neck and the dress itself is quite
plain it just goes down to just above
the knee but the arms are really cool
they have these like bell sleeves and
the fabric changes this kind of satiny
silk and you get this cute little bow
sleeves and I just thought it's festive
and it's nice it's not too smart it's
not too casual really excited to try
this on and see how it looks
please leave me a comment down below and
let me know what you think of all of
these items because I love your feedback
and also this dress has a little bit of
a weight to it which I liked I feel like
it's gonna hang really nicely I just
thought that was a bit different
interesting oh yes I remember this
there's no denying that I have too much
loungewear you guys saw my loungewear
lookbook I don't need any more but there
was a lot of gray in there and I thought
I could definitely add a bit of color
into the mix so I saw this blush pink
hoodie oh my god it's so soft it's a
really oversized hoodie so it's got this
huge hood and like these giant like
what's it called like the string
everything is just giant about this
hoodie I don't know what it's gonna look
like on but it feels really thick oh my
god and the inside is like a really soft
fleece it feels so so cozy can I cannot
wait to try this on it's from the a
sauce white range which is a range I
really really love and I'm excited to
try that on looks really cool on the
model and as you guys know I basically
live in tracks bottoms and hoodies this
is definitely gonna come in handy I hope
that looks really nice on all right what
else is in here
oh well it's hot I'm really lacking in
the top Department I feel like I've got
dresses covered and then I've got like
jeans and jumpers but I have already
gotten in between when I kind of wanna
wear jeans and high heeled boots and a
nice top I don't have that many tops so
I wanted to add some more to my
collection I thought this one looked
really nice it's from the brand first
and I and what I really liked about it
online is that it's like this beautiful
wine color
it's like slightly maroon slightly wine
it's more sheer and realize than I
thought I could easily wear like a
little black cami underneath so it's
kind of interesting it has this like
ruffle that goes across the front and
then down the side and slightly round to
the back
I don't know how this will look on me
whether it will be flattering sometimes
fine with us too much here it's not that
flattering but hopefully it's nice
because I really like the color I think
it worked really nicely with black
trousers or black jeans in high-heeled
boots which is exactly what I was
looking for feels nice quality for sure
I'm really excited to try this one on
because I really need more tops in my
collection so let me know what you think
of this one in the cutaway please okay a
couple more things I wanted to get a
Christmas jumper and there was one on
ASOS that was black and in white writing
it said this is my festive jumper and it
was so me it was perfect
I was desperate to get my hands on it
but it sold out but I did see this
Christmas jumper and I feel like it's
good for those of you who don't want
anything too festive I have this jumper
that I'm wearing now from last year's
from lots of Spencer's which is kind of
got Santa's all over it in sequins so
I've got the festive jump sorted and I
wanted company that was festive but a
little bit of understated too so this
one's black it's really cozy it's from
Daisy Street which is a brand I really
really like my um pink and grey striped
jumper is from there and then it says on
it naughty and nice and like no T's
being scratched out and nice has been
ticked I mean I think it was the other
around it'd be more appropriate for me I
think it's kind of cute like a little
nod to a Christmas jumper without being
too overly like in-your-face Christmas
jumper and it feels really soft and cozy
as well because obviously I needed more
jumpers I'm on to the final thing oh yes
this is a scarf I have a burgundy scarf
and I've got a baby blue scarf and I've
got a really bright blue scarf but I
don't have a grey one and I think
everyone needs a good gray scarf because
I've got a lot of gray and black coats I
just keep thinking like I wish I had a
gray scarf to go with this outfit so
this one looked really nice oh it's so
soft I'm quite fussy when it comes to
scarves I like there to be a little bit
of tassels because I feel like when a
scarf just stops and it's blunt I feel
like it's always a bit awkward and I
like it to be really long so I can wrap
it round and it's still kind of hang
long this looks really nice oh yeah this
is gonna be perfect I'll do like a
proper cutaway and show you guys that
this feels so cozy I know immediately
that I'm definitely gonna keep this it's
exactly what I was looking for
and it's not too light gray so I go like
lipstick or makeup marks on it and it's
not too dark either it's like the
perfect charcoal gray but I just flipped
myself in the face really happy with
that so that's everything from my ASOS
winter haul please leave me a comment
