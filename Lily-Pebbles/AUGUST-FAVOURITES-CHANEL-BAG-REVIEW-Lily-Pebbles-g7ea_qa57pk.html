monthly favourites and update this month
I have a bit less than I usually do I've
got beauty lifestyle tech and style as
you can see from the title my Chanel bag
it's definitely a favorite this month
and at the end of this video I'm going
to talk you through it because I haven't
really shown you guys the bag so I
thought I would do it in this video I'm
gonna skip over the life update this
month because I feel like you've already
seen it on my kind of feeling motivated
video and on my snapchat if you follow
me elsewhere so let's just go straight
to the BT favorites I've got my hair
redone my hair started to go really warm
and orange and copper toned it tends to
do that sometimes and it's because I had
my hair tinted and I never used to get
it tinted anyway it's back to normal
balayage style and to keep it ashy and a
cool toned blonde as much as I can I
have been using some purple shampoo and
conditioner I try not to use it every
wash but I don't wash my hair that often
so it's not like I'm washing my hair
everyday I use it's kind of two times a
week or sometimes once they're from a
brand called Josh wood which is a really
nice brown you can actually get these
Annette Marks and Spencers beautiful
which is such a nice beautiful I really
enjoy going in there this is the
precious blonde range it's kind of
confusing because obviously I'm not
blonde but for the blonde bits of my
hair it's really good so I use the
shampoo and a conditioner and also this
stuff
Noli works really well and I think it
works well it's kind of been keeping the
blonde blonde it smells so good it
smells like a really clean fresh
smelling man which is the sort of scent
I like this I am so so excited about I
don't remember where we are going but me
and Anna were in an airport quite
recently we had loads of time to kill
and I saw the Estee Lauder stand and I
said I think I'm going to go and ask if
they have like a travel sized version of
the advanced night repair because
sometimes in airports they do travel
version of things that they don't
usually do and advanced night repair is
a serum I love but the bottle is huge so
I went and asked do you have a travel
size and they said no sorry we've got
the kind of eye serum that looks like
it's a travel size but it's not as the
eye serum so I was gutted and then this
appeared on my desk as they Lord has
sent this to me they didn't know about
this Airport
I didn't like film it or anything but
it's obviously just come out I think I
really should have done my research but
it's a 30 mil version of advanced night
repair my dreams came true when Anna saw
this in her peer box she was like oh my
god did you get this in your peer box if
not I'm gonna give you mine this is
exactly what you wanted
it's a little mini version of advanced
night repair and it's so good it's good
if you just want to give it a try you
don't want to invest in the huge size
but it's also great for traveling it's
actually plastic so it doesn't weigh
much this is a really gloopy serum that
I like to use in the evening not all the
time especially when my skin's feeling a
bit rough because I just know this stuff
works it's so so good I've used it for
years the packaging is just really not
that appealing because it's brown but I
know that it works and I'm so happy it
comes in a 30ml till on the skincare
thing you might have seen these in a
blog post I did recently I've been
trying to get more into blogging I've
got someone helping me with photos now
which although I love taking photos it
really helps timewise so head over to my
blog if you haven't seen as a few new
blog posts up there this is from a brand
called votary I just don't know how to
say this boat or E or Bathory feel like
it's going to be votary this is from the
Liberty Beauty haul it's such a nice
brand I've never heard of it before but
I've been trying out the superseded
cleansing oil and super seed facial oil
this cleanse is really nice I use it as
a second cleanse because I don't really
like taking up my makeup with it but
I'll take my makeup off and then I use
this and it just feels so great on the
skin it feels like you're having like a
really posh facial it smells amazing it
feels great and the oil I like to use as
my last step in the evening also just
really luxury they smell and feel
incredible on the skin really really
hydrating if you have oily skin they're
probably a little bit too heavy but I
have kind of normal to dry skin and it
just feels so nourishing I've really
been enjoying trying those out okay I
have a few makeup favorites as well this
one I did a blog post on this with kind
of a step-by-step how I use it it's from
the new Chanel makeup collection the
collection is called Chanel LaRue's and
it's a really really nice one I don't
always love the our collections but
this one really got to me this eyeshadow
quad is beautiful I feel like I've
spoken about it a lot so I'm just going
to briefly tell you there are three
Brown shades a lighter one a medium one
and a dark one and then a red which I
know it's really scary they always said
like dope
man your eyes makes you tired but I
think if you just put it in the middle
of the lid like a little pop of color I
love warm tone eyeshadows and I just
think this is a bit different and
special one worth splurging on or if you
have like boots points spend on this and
then I've also been enjoying this little
duo from Joey I haven't actually used
stuff from Joey in quite a while but
it's a really nice brand you can get on
cult beauty their powder products click
together so like that they come
separately if you can also make your own
little pallet so I've got my little duo
here and in this I've got some tan which
is a bronzer and Rose which is a blush
they are both so nice the bronzer is a
matte light bronze is a bit like the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one it's very easy to use
and the blusher is like a slightly
actually everything is shimmer I think
it's matte but it's just a pale pink
very easy to wear I really like the
quality of the jury product final makeup
product is what I was raving about and
snapchat I was just trying this out I
hadn't really thought much of it also it
was quite nice but then all of you guys
are like sending me snaps and tweets
saying what are you wearing on your
lashes it looks amazing and it was this
it's the bourgeois volume reveal
waterproof mascara I actually don't know
if the non waterproof one is the same I
think I first tried this out on my hand
I was views a waterproof mascara so I
gave this one a go and I really really
like it it's got one of those kind of
plastic ones and it really gives you a
lot of length to your lashes it really
separates them and makes them look like
wow it's got like a little mirror on the
side but I don't really tend to use that
ok let's talk about lifestyle favorites
and there are two books out this month
by friends of mine I wanted to mention
we just worked my aha first one I've
spoken about a lot this modern love by
will Derbyshire a collection of love
letters it's just so different and such
a nice read really good one for your
coffee table as well and then the other
one is by my friend Fleur it's her
second book the luxe life and it's a
very very pretty book and really nice
ones flick through there's a mix of like
styling tips hairstyles like lifestyle
II things it's all different really it's
kind of jam-packed
there's even cooking in here my next
lifestyle favorites I have here and it
is this bottle I've actually shown this
on snapchat a few of you asked me what
it is
it's called hydrate mate and I can't
take credit for this I was actually at
the gleam office and they're all
obsessed with these bottles also
what is this bottle the why do you all
have them on your desk Oh have one
amazing so they gave one to me it says
like nothing worth having comes easy
which is a bit cheesy but I've tried
like the bobble bottles or whatever
there before I've tried all these
bottles I'm like now a bottle of Evian
will do me fine
this one is life-changing I can't even
explain so it's basically this huge
bottle and it has this like guide here
that says 8 a.m. 9 a.m. 10 a.m. which
kind of I think if you work in an office
is really good to make sure drinking
enough water throughout the day but the
reason I love this is because of like
the sucker the straw whatever you want
to call it I'm just going to try it
again to remind myself it's so easy to
use like you hardly have to suck at all
and like the water just shoots up oh my
god that was like the worst innuendo
ever I'm actually mortified God now have
to decide whether to keep that in or not
it's so easy to drink it encourages me
to drink more water which I love is
great I don't know what else to say
about it the best bottle of water I've
ever tried get it it's really not cheap
for $13.99 which is crazy for a bottle
but I actually think I would buy another
one they're worth it my final lifestyle
favorites are these bars I've actually
just eaten one so this one's empty that
was the berry delight I think that's my
favorite flavor I have some non eaten
ones here they are the naked bars and
akd they're gluten wheat and dairy free
which is not why I buy them but if
you're interested in that then that's
really handy I just really like them as
a snack I'm terrible I kind of forget to
like eat at the right times and I get
really hungry and this just kind of
keeps me going during those times
there's really not much in it just like
war fruit and nuts yeah literally in
this is 40% dates 40% cashew nuts 14%
raisins and then this one has a bit of
cocoa in it because I've got the cocoa
orange playdoh cherry like cocoa mint I
haven't tried that yet at apple pie I
haven't tried that yet either
I'm just obsessed with buying all
different flavors I'm keep buying loads
of those and their customer fortune a
techie favorite I have this month has
literally just arrived that I haven't
even had a chance to play with it yet
but it's the new iPad pro I got it in
gold oh my god it's so beautiful I think
I'm going to be obsessed with this I
can't leave a review it for yet because
I haven't used it properly but I went
into Apple as you would have seen in my
blog and had a tutorial and the things
that this thing can do is insane I've
got the case
it comes with a keyboard so you can like
comment let me figure out how to do this
you can like prop it up like that and
use the keyboard so I'm going to using
this a lot when I'm out and about out
and about for emails and I also got the
eye pencil that comes with it or the
Apple pencil I think it's called not an
eye pencil I've just made that really
uncool by adding and I but you can use
it with the iPad so you can draw you can
write there's like a function where you
can make notes and then press a button
and it sends you all the notes in like
typed form it's just so clever the
possibilities are endless I can't wait
to just sit for like I want to like
spend the whole weekend just sitting and
getting to know my iPad so apologies if
you suddenly start seeing lots of
terrible typography all over my pictures
but it's fun I just need to get better
at it okay so finally I want to talk to
you about my Chanel handbag because this
is at 100% of favorite speed a favorite
since I bought it I bought it back in
May Marie now May June July August so
I've had it for at 3 months now
I bought it in the South of France I was
out there with Anna Ruth it was a very
fun and hilarious experience I'm not
gonna bore you with the disclaimer I
never in a million years that I'd owner
Chanel bag and it's amazing and I'm very
excited but yeah I'm not gonna do the
whole disclaimer thing you guys know the
spiel but a lot of you have been
interested in the bag and asking me to
talk about it so I thought I briefly
mention it because at first I was a bit
scared of it and then I thought you know
what it's gonna get scratched it's gonna
get battered and I think that's actually
part of like a bag that you love should
look like you've loved it anyone having
a bag you're not wearing it so although
beginning I was a bit scared this past
month that I've been wearing it's death
and I actually love it
I keep it in the dust bag and I also
stuff it with tissue paper because I
want to only look after obviously now
I'm going to be really annoying and tell
you that I don't know the name of this
bag I wish I did because I get so many
people asking me so if anyone knows the
name of this bag please comment down
below in the comment section and let me
know
and to help everyone else out as well
because I know that a lot of you are
going to want to know the name of it
but I will show you and describe the bag
to you so it comes with a chain I got
black and gold but it's not really a
yellow gold or bright gold like that
other bags it's a very kind of rusty
antique vintage looking gold the whole
bag looks very vintage which is why I
like it it comes with a chain and at the
top of the chain is a little bit of
leather which means it's comfortable on
your shoulder I really like that and
then the bag looks like this so it's
that kind of size I hope that you can
tell what I really liked about this bag
is that you can put it crossbody the
classic flat bag you can't put crossbody
and I just know that I wear my bags like
that all the time I'm not much of like a
shoulder bag person so I love that the
chain is just long enough for crossbody
but not too long it's got a pocket on
the back and then unlike the classic one
it hasn't got em like quilting it's like
more chevron is that we call like
chevron and it also has a like envelope
shaped opening instead of straight
across the I wish I knew all the terms
clasp little metal bit on the front with
the kind of CC again looks really like
vintage and antique and you basically
pull it down and then you can pop it
open like that inside it's black which I
really like and it has the CC and then
inside the actual bag is maroon there's
a little zip at the back and what I
absolutely love about this bag is it
comes with it little purse inside so
it's a little front pocket in there and
then you kind of clip out this and it's
a little purse so I love that because
then you don't have to take a purse with
you I just load this with my cards in
cash and I clip it back in to the front
of that little pouch and then I've got
the kind of inbuilt purse which leads
way more space and therefore other
things I can fit like a decent amount of
stuff in here my phone keys lipstick
anything I really need for the day the
only time I struggle is when I'm
vlogging because my vlogging camera and
my phone because my vlogging camera is
quite big and my phone has like the eye
ring and the battery pack on it it's
quite hard to fit both in most of time I
have my phone on me anyway or my
vlogging camera so it kind of is alright
most people don't blog anyway so for a
normal person I think this is actually a
perfect size day bag and it's small
enough that you can wear it in the
evening as well it is soft leather it's
not like the grainy leather so it's more
likely to get scratched
which is what I'm a bit scared of
but so far so good I really really love
it it goes with casual outfits I love
wearing like pretty expensive handbags
with like jeans and a t-shirt I think
that looks really cool but it also looks
really nice when I'm dressed up as well
so I'm very happy with it I've been
wearing it a lot you guys have been
asking to see it so here it is and I
hope that little kind of mini review was
helpful so that's everything for my
August favorites and update if you
haven't seen my last vlog it's when me
and Ana went to the gleamer summer party
and I nearly broke everything in the
room by trying to open a bottle of
champagne go have a look at our video
and I've got a really fun vlog coming up
on Tuesday with me and rich I've also
filled with three collabs this week
which is so on me I think that's more
collabs that my films in like the last
three years but I'm really excited three
girls who I'm really enjoyed filming
with and I can't wait to see those
videos I'm not sure when that will going
up I think one might be on Sunday but
really excited just a bit different for
me thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
