be filming my August favorites video I'm
actually in Stockholm and I'm not
feeling very well so please bear with me
but I wanted to film this video because
the YouTube algorithm is randomly
recommending last year's August
favorites and I keep seeing people
commenting on it and thinking it's a
really weird video and that's because
it's from 2016 so I thought I'd better
just film it and put it up because
YouTube has got very confused and I
think it's wondering where my August
favorites is this month so I haven't
Stockholm but I've got all my favourites
with me because obviously I'm loving
them so much at the moment I can't bear
to be apart from them so it's pretty
handy and I've got a few Beauty things
style something to watch on TV and like
a lifestyle thing so I'm gonna get
started with Beauty because it's right
here next to me first thing I think I
mentioned in one of my previous videos
it's from glossier and it's the
invisible shield daily sunscreen I've
been using this everyday that I'm going
outside if I'm like working from home I
don't use SPF it's SPF 35 and I really
like this because unlike most of my
other SPS which are more of like a
thicker cream this is a bit of like a
gel consistency so it's very easy to
spread over the face I've got a bit of
pigmentation on my upper lip at the
moment so I've been putting a lot on
that area just to kind of protect it
from sun and from getting any worse and
yeah you need about two pumps the only
annoying thing is I can't see like how
much I've got left which is a bit
terrifying so I don't know what I'm
gonna run out but I'm going to New York
next week so I'm definitely gonna stock
up on this the next favorite which I
also picked up in New York is an
eyeshadow from Anasazi Beverly Hills and
it's caramel eyeshadow and I both picked
up because we met a viewer last year at
an event he was wearing it all over her
lid and under and she was wearing like
no mascara or eyeliner and she looks
amazing so we both picked it up and it's
like a really nice orange e Brown
eyeshadows this one here I've got it in
my Mac quad and I just find it so easy
to use you can just swish it like all
over the lid under the eye I sometimes
wear a bit of brown eyeliner in the
evening or if it's just for the day I
just wear mascara and I just find it
really really flattering it's like a
really nice warm toned eyeshadow the
next Beauty favorite is from MacLaren's
and this is part of one of their new
collections I don't remember the name
but this is the illuminating cheek
colouring 0 9 golden pink I really
really love this it's like a soft baby
pink but it's got a gold shimmer running
through it which means that I can kind
of take it up a bit higher into the
cheek and it's a bit of a blusher
highlights kind of duo
I've just been wearing it every day it's
very easy blush to wear and I've really
really been enjoying it okay and it's a
style stuff and the first thing I've got
my little list of favorites are the
Urban Outfitters Axl jeans just just
talking to Anna about how annoying they
are because I absolutely love the style
they're like straight leg cutoff jeans
and they're high-waisted and they're
very soft and comfortable to wear
but the sizing is a bit off like every
shade comes in a different size we both
find the black ones to be very fitted I
find the dark denim to be kind of even
more loose and then the light denim kind
of true to size but they do stretch so
you kind of have to wash them and tumble
dry them to keep them a good size which
is a bit frustrating but in terms of how
they look in the shape I really am
enjoying wearing straight leg cutoff
jeans I wore skinny jeans the other day
and I still love them but it just felt
so like claustrophobic so these are just
very comfortable to wear I don't think
they're the most flattering on me but I
kind of don't care because I find them
really comfortable my next style
favorite are these pajamas from ASOS I'm
completely obsessed with them they're
banana leaf palm banana leaf banana leaf
print yeah I think that's it shorts I
really like wearing shorts I just find
it like it's like less twisted I turn a
lot in my sleep so trousers get very
uncomfortable and then it's a
long-sleeve button-up shirts but it's
very thin and it's probably thin because
it's cheap and it's from a source that
it's not as good quality but I actually
really prefer like thin pajamas because
you don't get hot sweaty
there's so much more comfortable I just
think the print is so so cute open these
on my Instagram and you guys went crazy
for them I need to actually take a
proper photo because it was just all my
stories but I'm loving these so much I
also bought some red striped ones from a
sauce which I really like but it's
definitely my favorite my next star
favorite is this dress and it's from
Alice and Olivia I bought this for one
of my best friend's Hannah's wedding I
went to last weekend I actually had a
dress from Reese which I bought using a
voucher luckily and last minute I just
decided it
wasn't me it was such a pretty dress but
it was it was kind of too pretty too
summery too formal and I just thought I
really want something a bit more cool so
I went to Selfridges with my friend
Deb's and we found this and it's
definitely a lot more expensive than I
would normally spend actually I think
this is probably the most expensive item
of clothing I've ever bought
aside from handbags and stuff but I
think it's really special I feel like it
was worth spending that much money on it
it's a silk blend like fabric and then
the print on it is velvet so it's really
really special it's got this tiny tie on
the neck the sleeves are sort of sheer
and then they they go out I just don't
know the technical terms and then the
skirt is layered and I thought it's
perfect because you can wear it with
heels and it's like great for weddings
or for parties or events but then if you
wear it with boots and a leather jacket
I think it can definitely be worn quite
like cool and casual as well I'm going
to wear it tonight for Stockholm Fashion
Week and see if I can dress it down with
a leather jacket and some boots I am so
in love with it it felt really special I
felt really cool in it it's so
comfortable because it's just loose I
feel like I can keep this in my wardrobe
forever and no matter how old I am or if
my body shape changes I feel like I
could always wear it I also just prefer
having my arms covered and my legs out
rather than the other dress was like
strappy so I had my arms out but it was
long and that just didn't sit right with
me so yeah I really really love this my
next recommendation is a TV show and
it's top of the lake the first season
can be found on Netflix and the second
season is on Sky I when I didn't know
that the first season was on Netflix I
was asking whether you needs to watch
the first one before we were second and
everyone said no you don't then I found
first season I watched it and let me
tell you I think you do need to watch
the first season before you watch the
second because you get to know all the
characters and so many things and the
second season just wouldn't make sense
without watching the first one so if
you're going to watch it start from the
beginning it's so great if you like
things like the missing you'd really
like it it follows a girl called bobbing
who's a detective and she's trying to
trying to solve like a mystery I can't
remember the first season I think the
second season is a murder but the first
one is I don't know I'm just going to
ruin it it's just very very good
at first it's a bit weird like the first
and the second episode you have to get
through them because the characters are
very strange and storylines a bit weird
but it's set in New Zealand and it's
it's so so gripping it's so great I
would highly highly recommend it so
definitely watch top of the lake if you
haven't yet okay my final favorite is a
bit of a random one but it's a suitcase
I when we went to New York last time
West Elm gave us in a way suitcase
because they're doing a collaboration
with them for Christmas they've got
these dove gray cabin size suitcase and
a gold one and I got the gold one and I
really really love it I've heard about a
way for quite a while there the suitcase
is where you can charge your phone at
the top but even without the kind of
charging thing which I don't use that
often it's just a really good sized
cabin suitcase and it's got like a zip
compartment on one side and then the
other side it's got this flap that like
flips together and keeps everything
compact I don't usually use cab inside
suitcases because they're never big
enough but I seem to be able to use this
one for three four-day trips very easily
it's got a lot of space in it it does up
very easily and I'm really enjoying it
so I just wanted to kind of put that
recommendation out there they are a
little bit expensive but they like I
ordered some for my friend as a wedding
gift and they came really quickly the
delivery was really great the customer
service is really good at all of that so
definitely recommend away suitcases okay
those are all my favorites for this
month sorry this video is a little bit
late but I will be back again on
Wednesday for a vlog I'm vlogging while
I'm here in Stockholm so you'll be
seeing that Wednesday and I hope you
guys are all well thank you so much for
watching I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
