drugstore affordable makeup in
particular I know you guys like it when
I give some cheaper alternatives as well
so today's makeup tutorial is entirely
products from the drugstore I say
drugstore we don't really call it that
in the UK but I think by now you all
know what I mean I think I'm using
around 10 products for this look and I
really like the finished look it's very
wearable great for daytime but I think
it could easily be transitioned in
tonight as well with a bit of black
eyeliner I'm gonna get straight into it
and you're gonna see some close-up
cutaways of me applying the makeup while
I talk through each product so first
let's start with foundation and I'm
gonna be applying the Bourjois healthy
mix serum foundation I think there's a
healthy mix foundation and a healthy mix
serum but I did a bit of googling and I
think serum is the more hydrating one
and I really need like a hydrating
foundation I use this in shade 52 I got
51 at first but it was too light so I
went for 52 and it's a really good match
for me I'm applying it with the Real
Techniques sponge and I make my sponge
quite wet I really like the look it
gives it just really blends it into the
skin you have to keep bouncing away and
it does take a lot longer if you haven't
got time to do this in the morning I'd
recommend using a buffing brush and then
just finishing with a wet sponge because
it really gives a nice
Julie look to the skin and this
foundation I would say is a light to
medium finish so it's definitely not a
kind of medium to full coverage you can
still see a lot of my skin but at the
moment I'm really enjoying wearing
lighter foundations and then using the
concealer to kind of cover any blemishes
or dark circles at the end or concealer
you guys know my favourite concealer is
the Urban Decay Naked concealer and I
think a pretty good dupe for that is the
hmm concealer it is slightly different
but I like the packaging it's smaller
has a good shade selection this one
which is in the shade soft sand I think
is a little bit too yellow for me but I
kind of make it work it's got a doe foot
applicator it's really nice coverage the
only thing I would say how it differs to
the Urban Decay one is it does a crease
a little bit more under the eyes so I
would recommend powdering after you've
done your concealer and I am gonna be
powdering a bit today because my
foundation is quite dewy and the
concealer can crease and for that I'm
gonna use my board or a healthy balance
powder I really love this powder I
didn't feel the need to find a new one
because I think this is a great
drugstore powder it's got a mirror
inside which is really good and
kind of slightly yellow powder I use the
shade 52 Vanille and it's a really nice
lightweight powder you hardly to take it
on the skin but it just sets your
concealer and foundation in the places
that you want it to I apply this to my
chin around my nose and under my eyes as
well so for bronzer you guys know that I
love the soap and glory solar powder I
use it all the time it's without a doubt
my favorite bronzer but I thought today
I'd do something different so I'm gonna
be using the H&amp;amp;M bronzer and this is
probably a close second favorite it's
really good I love that the packaging
has a mirror in it it doesn't have to do
it's such a cheap product but it's a
really good bronzer and it's actually
really similar to the soap &amp;amp; Glory one I
don't know H&amp;amp;M beauty is that easily
available yet everywhere but they do the
beauty ranges in some of the bigger H&amp;amp;M
stores in London and I've really liked
everything I've tried this is just a
very easy to wear bronzer it's not too
orange it's not like too grey you can
contour with it I just like to warm up
the face around the edges of my face and
along my cheekbones and I think it looks
really pretty for a blusher I'm gonna
use that hmm blusher that I mentioned in
my February favourites video this is in
the shade cameo pink and it's a really
nice pink because it's not too bright
pink it's slightly Brown II very kind of
neutral easy to wear and I like to just
brush that onto my cheekbones I'm taking
it slightly up because I'm not wearing
highlighter today if you guys know of
any good drugstore highlighters let me
know because I couldn't find any in my
jaw and I thought I'd just leave out the
highlighter today this is a really
gorgeous blush I've been really enjoying
wearing this recently okay now onto
eyebrows and I usually use the Anastasia
brow Wiz but I think this came as a
recommendation from Anna because I was
really struggling to find a drugstore
eyebrow product and she said this one's
pretty good
it's the Maybelline brow satin and it
comes with a pencil on one side and an
eye shadow on the other I don't use the
eye shadow but I do think the pencil is
quite good it's very similar to that
Anastasio one slightly bigger but it has
that kind of waxy texture so you have to
press quite hard to get the color out
and the color match is really good for
me this is in the shade dark brown and
it suits me perfectly okay now onto
eyeshadow and I'm going to be using the
zoeva palette that I also mentioned in
my favourites video this is nude
spectrum and this has so many amazing
shadows in it I absolutely love this
palette one thing I would say is
definitely
off the excess product before you apply
because these are so pigmented that it
can kind of fall out onto your cheeks so
I first use this shade which is second
in on the second row and this is a
really pretty kind of light
pinky gold shade it's a bit like Mac all
that glitters I love to wear this just
alone but I'm gonna start by applying
this one all over the lid it's so
gorgeous it really catches the light and
looks so so pretty and then I'm going to
use the one beneath it which is a bit
more of an antique gold and just use a
little bit of that on the outer corner
of the eye this reminds me a little bit
of Mac would wink it's but it's a bit
more kind of yellowy gold but really
pretty is just deepen the outer corners
of the eye slightly and then applying
this one on the bottom corner which is a
matte Brown just to the underneath of
the I always like to put a matte Brown
underneath just to define it
I always feel a bit top-heavy if I don't
do that and then I'm gonna finish the
eyes with dark matte Brown and I'm
taking a really small liner brush and
just applying that really close to the
lash line I'm not doing any kind of
fancy eye liner with this just really
pressing it into the lashes so it kind
of defines that upper lashes a bit and I
always find it when I don't wear any
kind of eye liner I just look a bit
naked on the top of my eyes so I'm just
pushing that into the lashes to add a
bit of kind of definition there or
mascara I'm gonna be using one of the
new Revlon mascaras they pull out loads
I think there's four or five of these
all with different color lids I think
it's confusing packaging because I
reckon people are gonna think these are
colored mascara Zoar and they're not
they're just normal Browns and black so
they all do a different thing so the two
that I really like are the Revlon
dramatic definition which is a bit more
of a plastic brush that gives nice and
length and definition but the one I'm
using today is also a favorite it's the
Revlon Ultra volume this one has more of
a big fluffy brush and I find that if
you really get to the root of the lashes
and push up throughout the lashes you
get a lot of volume with this mascara I
really like it sometimes I'm not into
these kind of big mascara brushes but
this one's really good and it definitely
gives a lot of volume to my lashes so
I'm a big fan of this finally on to lips
I'm going to use in a lip liner and a
lip gloss first of all the lip liner is
from Rimmel is their exaggerate full
color lip liner in the shade addiction
0:18
and this is a bit of a Kylie Jenner lip
color it's a kind of brownie rosy nude
and I like these lip liners they're very
soft so they're maybe not as good for
really defining the Cupid's bow because
they kind of melt away and they I feel
like you'd go through these liners very
quickly because they're very soft that
also makes them really nice and they're
good to wear by themselves because they
are so creamy this is a really gorgeous
shade and it's slightly darker than the
lip gloss that I'm gonna be applying but
it's fine because they kind of merge
together and make a really nice color
so this lip gloss is from NYX I think is
Nick's or NYX I never know but they now
sell this in Selfridges in the beauty
workshop so I've got my hands on one of
their butter glosses they were sold out
of so many of their lipsticks it's crazy
but this one is in stock and I thought
it looked really nice and again gave
that kind of Kylie Jenner lip that I'm a
bit obsessed with at the moment this is
in the shade tiramisu I really like it
it's a neutral brownie rose they're very
creamy
they're very creamy and liquidy to apply
I find that the best way to apply them
is just apply to the bottom lip and then
kiss your lips together and that's kind
of enough products for all of your lips
they don't feel sticky at all they feel
really comfortable to wear and I really
like the way it looks so you can the
eyeshadows is one product that was 10
products and I really hope you guys like
the finished look I'm gonna link below a
