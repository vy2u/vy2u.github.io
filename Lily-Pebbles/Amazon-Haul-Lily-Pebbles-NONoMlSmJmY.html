but it's also kind of a techie hall as
well because this happened last week I'm
doing a bit of a crazy tech hole but
I've wanted all these things for so long
and I just haven't had time so I'm just
ordering them all now I will show you
all these things when they arrive and
very excited to have a play with them
and look all the stuff is here but one
thing which I've just bought so I'm
going to plunk myself over here and talk
through some of this stuff with you guys
I also ordered a microphone for my
camera so when that comes tomorrow I
feel a little bit and insert that to
show you the new microphone okay I'm
comfy excuse the weird pile of cushions
behind me and also my friend has joined
for the video we have become best
friends this week he doesn't to leave my
side ok here is my books of goodies now
first of all I want to point out I
ordered all these things from amazon and
I don't have amazon prime and all of
these things came I think I ordered it
on a thursday and i ordered to business
working days so i assumed it would come
like next tuesday or wednesday which is
now but one thing came saturday morning
and the other came sunday morning
because amazon delivers on a sunday too
which is great so i have everything here
apart from the microphone which i
mentioned I've ordered so I'm gonna like
dig in and just talk to you about things
that I bought and sorry if you're not
really into this kind of stuff but I
really AM I'm a massive like techie nerd
I love this kind of stuff don't really
know much about it though so I don't
know how helpful i'm going to be but i
thought if i just talked in like normal
Lily language it might actually be
helpful because a lot of the techie
videos are very techy they're a bit much
so the first thing I ordered is this
this is a gorilla pod and I have a
little one I really should have bought
that as a prop i mean if i can get this
open here is the one that i ordered got
so much packaging this size which to be
honest i definitely thought I ordered
the bigger one it's quite hard to see
what size they are I'm not really one to
get measuring tape out and kind of check
I did think this is the bigger one but
it's still bigger than the one that I
have and it's for an SLR camera because
the other 1i have there's no way it
would hold up my big SLR camera it's
just too flimsy the idea of this is that
it's like a portable tripod because my
tripod that you
Iran now is huge and it's a pain in the
ass to open and close as you will see it
takes so long opening for the urban
frozen I thought this is good if I just
want to kind of randomly film around the
house or you can take this out as well
and it's really bendy so the idea is you
can like wrap it around trees you can
wrap it around your bike handles you can
kind of wrap it around anything or you
can just move it around stand it and it
will hold the big SLR camera that I'm
filming on now this is literally the
hardest thing to screw on ever it
doesn't go on uh-huh it says this should
be removed before using it I knew that
was too big wasn't fitting in my camera
thank you that's better there you go SLR
on a lot of tripod let's go see where
else we can put it oh it's just handed
you can just pick it up like huh I could
put it on a shelf I can put it on a
chair it's petrifying but I can put it
on a door from the top of my door it
wasn't expensive i think it was about 20
quid I don't know how sturdy they really
are my other ones broken and I've seen
other people's break as well but I think
it's quite a cool little thing to have
and definitely handy if I just want to
film a little bit here and there without
getting my papa Big tripod out that's
the first thing I got here let me talk
to you about my camera lenses let's do
this one first ok so I have three main
cameras the one that I informing on now
which is my canon 600d that's what I
film on my main videos on I have my
little vlogging camera here which is my
canon s120 I have an upgraded to the gx7
or whatever it's called because it's
bigger and I really like to have
something small so even though the
qualities better that has a flip screen
I'm going to wait till they bring one
out that isn't as big and then I also
have my EOS m and I use this when I'm
going out on the weekends and I want to
take blog photos or any time where I'm
out and about i don't wanna take my huge
camera because it is huge and you can't
even put it in your handbag it's that
big so this is my kind of out and about
that still takes really good quality
photos i do film with this sometimes if
a little clips of vlogs there's mainly
just for photos at the moment one minute
I'm going to go get the lens that this
camera came with okay so this is the kit
lens that came with the canon eos m let
me put it on to show you guys so it
looks like that and as you can see it's
not small it's quite long actually
and it kind of is a funny shape for a
camera and it makes it a little bit hard
to store in your handbag it does zoom in
and out a bit like the kit lens does on
the canon 600d but it's not like the
best lens it's a pretty standard kit
lens the reason i like this camera when
i bought it is because you can put any
lens on here all you have to do is buy
the adapter so this is what the adapter
looks like it's about this wide and you
can fit any of your lenses once you put
this on to the camera so you just clip
on this mount clip it in place and then
you can put whatever lens you want on
top of that i often use my 50 millimeter
lens on that so that's the canon 50
millimeter it looks like that this one
is super zoomed in so am i recording
yeah so you have to be really far away
when you take photos a lot of fashion
bloggers say they use this I don't know
how because if I got rich to take photos
of me with this I mean you'd have to be
somewhere really quiet because people
would literally just walked past you
because they wouldn't see the
photographer miles away but the quality
is really good really good like it's a
really cheap lens i think it's about 80
pounds so a lot of people earn this lens
because it is so affordable and it does
take really nice photos definitely not
one for filming you can use a remote
obviously if you're that far away but
it's i can't even see in the viewfinder
because it's so far i tend to use this
one for photos of my nieces and nephews
and family when we have like picnics and
stuff it's really nice one for portraits
i think but yes that's what i have been
using on my canon eos m taking this out
again look how large is it's really not
kind of handbag friendly it still makes
the camera very chunky because the
adapter ads on more to the lens so that
brings me to my first lens purchase this
is the canon EF m 22 millimeter f point2
or something like that i got both of
these lens recommendations from my
friend kate her blog is ghost parties
and she runs a website called nouvelle
daily and she's a babe with an
incredible eye for interiors i love her
so i'll put her legs below this is
basically i did if you guys know about
the pancake lens i got that so i'll show
you in a minute but this is like the
pancake lens for the EOS m so it looks
like this comes in all this bubble wrap
and extra packaging
and this is what it looks like it's
really slim so because you don't need
the adapter with this one you can take
off this whole thing and you can just
put this lens on and look at that it
makes the whole camera so much smaller
so much better to like carry around and
destroy in your handbag and the quality
of this lens is great as well I haven't
been able to have a massive play with it
yet but from what I've tried I really
like it um filming wise it's like maybe
not the best I try to vlog with it and
it was a little bit difficult but it's
really nice for photos for me just being
able to carry this around it's so
lightweight and it's just completely
changed this whole camera and I love it
and I can't wait to tense out to take
photos with on the weekends remember you
can buy the adapter and put on whatever
lens you like if you're willing to have
that kind of exercise in the front of
your camera this is the canon eos m with
the kit lens that it comes with this is
with the adapter by itself this is the
standard canon 50 millimeter lens
attached to the adapter this is with the
new 22 millimeter lens ok the next lens
is the pancake lens and I've wanted this
for so long these both these lenses will
by the way aren't crazy expensive I
think the EOS m one is 150 and this
one's 120 may sound like a lot of money
to you guys remember this is why I do
for my job so happy to like invest in it
but even if it's just as a hobby there
are some lenses that are like seriously
crazy expensive so 120 pounds is not
expensive for a camera lens so this is
for my SLR camera which I'm filming on
now I have the kit lens which I
occasionally use for blog photos because
it's quite easy to use photos I have my
Sigma 30 millimeter which I always film
on I love it for filming not great for
like close up filming but for filming
like this is perfect and then i have my
50 50 millimeter which i showed you
before this is called the pancake lens
well actually the official name is the
canon 40 millimeter and it looks like
this it is super tiny says macro 0.3
millimeters and yet 40 millimeters so as
you can see it's a very small lens this
means that if i do want to take my SLR
out and use this on it it's very easy to
kind of move around but also kate was
saying how she loves this for taking
photos
and because i use my kit lens taking
photos i feel like they're not the best
quality I don't love using the sigma
lens for photo taking I prefer it for
filming so this is hopefully going to be
my kind of blog photo taking lens it's
also not just about the quality of the
photos it's about usability and I love
the fact that this lens is so small you
can obviously use the adapter on the
canon eos m with this pancake lens this
is getting so confusing but Kate was
saying how she actually thinks both
lenses are quite different and because I
like the fact that that kind of eos m
lens makes the camera so much smaller so
I'm excited to have play around with
this actually while I'm SAT here I might
put put it on the camera see what you
guys think about using it for filming I
probably won't but i'll show you the
difference between this Sigma one and
this one okay so that's what the lens
looks like i am SAT slightly further
away but it makes me look closer that
makes sense and wow it is so small on
the camera though let me plug this so
you guys can see from where I'm looking
it's such a small lens it really like
doesn't come out very far at all I'm
going to carry on my whole now wait
let's switch you back okay the final
thing I have in today's who is from vel
one which is yes the same make as my
tripod I think manfrotto is a better
make i wasn't sure if i had to buy this
in the same make as my tripod and i
didn't want to risk having to get
another tripod or they're mine isn't
great so i probably could have got a new
one anyway but whatever i just got this
in the same brand just to make sure
everything fits together basically i
wanted something that can allow me to
take photos directly pointing down
because I find with my tripod no matter
how I position it it's never directly
down it's always kind of forward a bit
and you know how I like to do a lot of
stop motion videos those require me
looking at vertical downwards and I do a
lot of filming like that and I was just
doing research and figuring out what the
best way is to do that and I found one
of these which is basically a tripod arm
that's like an extension on your tripod
that you put on and it helps put your
big heavy SLR camera downwards this has
come with lots of like bits so I have no
idea but it looks like this and I reckon
what happens is you kind of loosen it
clip it on screw it up
screw it up for that dodgy put your
camera on their twisted on the end and
then your camera is pointing down I
haven't tried this yet I'm gonna see if
rich can come and help me fit it I shall
we try and do it by myself first if I
fail I'll probably get rich to come and
help me but i'll put the links to all of
these things below my video by the way
none of them are necessities none of
them will help you have a successful
YouTube channel or blog I just love
buying techy stuff and well I'm like 45
years in so I feel like I could treat
myself to a few lenses here and there so
I'm excited for my microphone to come
tomorrow I've never used a microphone
before i'm not using one now and i was
so surprised how many of my YouTube
friends use microphones cuz I really
have never felt the need to I think my
sound quality is fine I have noticed
sometimes if i'm filming in the bathroom
or if i'm from where the lens and my
camera needs to be quite far away then
the sound quality isn't great and also
when I complain of background noise like
gardeners and stuff microphones really
help with that because it's a
directional microphone so make sure that
only the sound at the front of the
microphone is heard and I think off on
the side also I'm going to be foaming in
a few different locations soon and where
there is a wooden floor so it's going to
be a lot more echoey so I thought it's
about time I could invest in a
microphone and give it a go maybe twice
a load microphone I feel like I'm saying
it wrong I keep getting the ocean a
microwave but I definitely I really hope
I didn't order a microwave from amazon
pretty sure hold the microphone i'll
show you that when it arrives tomorrow
trying to put the tripod armand but i am
terrible when it comes to these sort of
instructions if he sydney of like half
an hour look at the instructions and
watching youtube videos and i can't
figure it out so i've got rich to have a
go written is nothing about tripods or
cameras and I feel like he's just going
to break my tripod and I'm really left
with nothing oh I think we've come to
the conclusion that my velbon tripod
doesn't have a removable head and to use
one of these arm things you need to have
a tripod within a removable head ok so
it was a semi-successful hall that one
arm thing didn't fit and i've never
actually sent something back down ism
before so i'm gonna try and figure out
how to do that now bit of a pain in the
ass but i want to figure out this tripod
situation that's really annoyed me hey
my amazon order is here that might
friends here whoo okay I did next a
delivery for my microphone so it is here
it came bright and early this morning
I've never used one of these things I've
seen Anna use him when we do our BTW
chess together she always use them and I
know that sometimes they can be a bit of
drama with like did I turn the mic on
did the mic work and I am dreading the
day I film a whole video and the sound
doesn't work that really freaks me out
but I think it's a good investment okay
so comes in a little box or he go so I
got the didn't really do much research I
kind of just clicked on the one that
looked familiar it's the road microphone
i know that road is a good brand compact
shotgun microphone so i think it's a
pretty small one and then it's got on
the back like a list of all the ones
they have okay so in the box it comes in
as little plastic packaging this is the
little microphone it clips on top of the
camera and plugs in I'm pretty sure
that's it I should probably read the
instructions as I said I'm now in a
bedroom with carpet and curtains so the
sound is fine anyway but I think this
makes a big difference when you're in
echoey rooms or when you're outside or
or different situations like that more
instructions okay I've come across my
first problem something that hopefully
will help you guys if you order a
microphone it doesn't come with a
battery I lil how to takes a little
thing off and I thought I'll just check
I'm sure there's a battery in there
already nope on the way to test goes
that's what I need I'm back from Tesco I
found the right battery I got to because
one day this will run out and I will be
just as annoyed yes you just slide the
mic on at the top there that's very
simple and then this there's a little
flap here that says Mike so I'm assuming
it plugs into there okay so this is me
talking with the mic off you can hear
this is how it normally sounds just with
no microphone just using the camera and
then this is how it sounds with the mic
on well hopefully I haven't tried it but
it should be working now because the
microphone is facing me it should be
directional to me talking whereas if I
kind of stand over here and talk um it's
probably not quite as clear when I'm on
the side and I don't know how the
background noise thing works if I switch
it on to the far right say there's like
lots of background noise I don't know
can you hear that really badly like
what about that while i'm talking is
that really scrunchie this is a stupid
test I said I think if you switch the
mic off and you don't unplug it then you
just get no sound so if you're not using
the microphone you have to actually
unplug it I think I'm kind of making
this up as I go anyway I'm going to
leave it there because I have edited
this video as I've gone so I know it's a
long one and I'm aware that a lot of you
won't even be interested in this kind of
thing thanks for sticking with me whilst
i rummaged through my amazon box let me
know if you have any questions leave any
questions and I'll try and replies as
many comments as I can although I'm
definitely not an expert and as I'm sure
you could tell they don't really know
I'm talking about I just really enjoy it
me and Anna did do a blogging and
youtubing series a while ago we talked a
lot about the equipment we use in that
so that is always linked below my videos
where I the bottom of the description
box I'll see you guys on sunday my video
on sunday is the one that i filmed in
the Rosewood Hotel when I was vlogging
it's taken me that long to edit and all
of that so I really hope you enjoy it a
lot of effort went in see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
