Disney vlog you will know that I did
quite a bit of shopping when I was in
Florida I didn't have much shopping time
but with the time I had I went a bit
wild I just kind of grabbed anything
that I thought I hadn't tried or
something that was new anything that
looked interesting there's still quite a
few things in America that we can't get
here in the UK so that was kind of my
aim things we don't have at home and I
bought quite a lot of stuff from Sephora
and Target so I have both bags here and
I'm just gonna kind of whiz through I
haven't tried most of this stuff
actually I haven't really touched this
bag since I got home because I wanted to
just do a haul and then gradually work
my way through the products and I'm sure
they'll pop up on my blog and in my
videos once I've probably tried them so
this isn't really like a review video
it's more just kind of a basic haul I
don't know where to start with the stuff
from Target or Sephora but I think I
might do an order and I went to Target
first so I'll start with the target
stuff I think targets like a big
supermarket in America but they have a
lot of beauty stuff there and they have
a few brands we don't do here one brand
I really like is Sonia Kashuk and we
don't have that here and a lot of her
products are always they look really
nice I have really tried that much stuff
to be honest and the first thing I
really wanted to get my hands on is this
palette this is the ion neutral matte
and the reason I really wanted to try
this is because I thought it would be a
really good dupe for the visi odds
palette this is about 80 pounds and I
can't remember how much this is but look
how similar I mean this is definitely
affordable I think it was like under $10
maybe I'll do a cutaway clip showing how
similar these two are apart from the
really nice orange shade that the visi
art palette has writes in the middle
they're all the shades are pretty much
very similar I haven't tried it yet so I
can't tell you about the quality but if
you're into matte eyeshadows I think
this has a really good range of math
it's got some really nice kind of
neutral Browns some of the lighter
shades I probably wouldn't wear but I
really wanted to try this I'm glad I
found it and I think that looks like a
really good matte palette as I mentioned
I was on the hunt for new products and I
don't think this range has come out in
the UK correct me if I'm wrong but it's
called the visible lift range of from
L'Oreal I really like the basis from
L'Oreal I think they're really nice and
this one is part of an anti-aging range
and I always think found a
aimed at anti-aging are always really
nice because as you get older the last
thing you want is kind of cakey Matt
foundation so foundations targeted at
the slightly older market always really
nice and fresh and dewy and I really
like how they look on my skin so I
thought I'd pick up the visible lift
serum foundation this has an SPF in it
and it says it's got pro retinol a and
vitamin C the fact that it says it's a
serum makes me think it's going to be
very nice and dewy and light but as I
said I haven't tried it and I also
picked up the visible lift blur
foundation this one comes in a tube and
I just loved foundations that come in a
tube I imagine this being a bit more of
like a BB cream type thing
this also has SPF I'm looking forward to
seeing how the kind of serum Foundation
and the blur foundation how they kind of
differ I imagine this one to be a bit
more kind of silicone II and slippy this
one being a bit more like a liquid
foundation so I'm going to give them
both to try and I will let you know and
also part of the same range I picked up
the concealer visible lift blur
corrective concealer this comes in a
tube so I thought it might be a bit like
the Clarins one I love a good concealer
so I'm looking for it's giving us a girl
I can imagine this working well on days
where you're not wearing foundation and
you can just use the concealer on areas
where you need to conceal and they also
do a blur blush so there's a lot of
products in this range if it isn't out
in the UK then I think it would be quite
a big launch when it does come over I
picked up the shade 502 soft pink I can
imagine this being a bit like the
Giorgio Armani I can't but it's cool it
was like a fabric blush or something
like that I quite like blushes like this
for the warm moments you can just tap on
and blend out and I'm really looking
forward to trying this the colour isn't
as bright as the packaging but I think
it's very cute packaging and good for
traveling when you go on holiday in the
summer also for blush I picked this up
from Maybelline that I haven't seen
before it's the mastic glaze by face
studio and it's a blush stick to be
honest I don't think this looks that
great but I wanted to give it a go if
the packaging looks a bit cheap and I
just can imagine that getting really
stuck and like not blending properly I'm
also not really sure that I love the
color
not sure why I picked this up but I
thought I'd give it a go for Mabley and
I actually think it looks cheaper I'm
not sure this is going to come over here
because I feel like this wouldn't do
that well in the UK market I will give
it a go there and report back okay there
you a few more things I got from Target
the first is from Maybelline and it's
the master drama by
I studio cream pencil and this is in the
shade vibrant violet being away the
Victoria just made me want to get
everything in purple I'm not gonna lie
and this looks actually thought this was
a liquid eyeliner but now reading it
properly it's like a cream eyeliner but
in the picture it looks quite kind of
intense and opaque so I'm gonna give
this a go it seems quite different to
anything else I have like a intense
cream eyeliner I can imagine it being a
bit like a gel eyeliner so I will give
that a go I like that it comes in a
handy pen that you can wind up and then
finally two products from Revlon these
are the color stay over time at 16 hours
I don't think I've seen these here it
looks like it's a liquid lipstick on one
end and then like a clear balm on the
other that you apply on top I'm a little
bit nervous to try products like these
because sometimes they really kind of
dry out my lips and damage them I've had
that for the Maybelline product but I
love liquid lipsticks so much so
everybody want to give these ago I got
it in 0:40 which is like a bright red
and one for zero which is a darker deep
red so if these are good these could be
a really good kind of cheaper liquid
lipstick so I'll let you know if they
work out so that's everything from
Target and then I went to Sephora which
is my favorite place ever I'm not mad
about the one in Europe find it's quite
boring and very similar things we have
here the one in America it's great
because of the brands that they have
they've got brands like Kat Von D and
Tarte and brands are really hard to find
in the UK some of which aren't available
at all here so I'm just gonna dig into
the bag and show you what I picked up
I've never tried anything from white
beauty before so I got a couple of bits
from there the first thing I bought is
the matte lip crayon I try these in
store they're not matte they kind of
like creamy so as soon as I realized
that they're not matte and long-lasting
I kind of avoided the brighter shades
because with a bright red I like to have
a really matte formula so I thought I'd
go for a more kind of nudie shade and
thought this might be a good alternative
to my Mac patisserie lipstick that I
wear all the time so I picked up the
shade I'm a resto and this is a really
nice nude I thought the stick would be
really handy I like the idea of applied
at the stick because I find with
lipstick bullets sometimes especially
with my shape lip I don't have a defined
keep it's both it's quite hard to get
that shape with a nude so this is a
really nice like a pointed tip and I'm
looking forward to giving that a go it
might be my new favorite patisserie and
also from bite Beauty I picked up the
my lip mass which is one that Anna
recommended I didn't really know what it
was but I tried this out yesterday
quickly because my lips are feeling
quite dry and it is like a lip balm it's
slightly exfoliating it feels quite
jelly like I definitely to try it more
but I'm all up for trying new lip balms
this one feels quite different to
anything else I have so I'm looking
forward to giving it a go it comes in a
really cute little tube that I'm
definitely gonna keep in my handbag last
time I was in Sephora back in October
when I went to New York I bought the
roll-on version of the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana perfume in white I really
like it it's like a rose scent reminds
me of the Stella perfume so this time I
thought I'd buy the full size because I
do really like the roll-on and I've
nearly finished
I bought the smaller out of the two
sizes just because I have so many
perfumes I really don't need the large
one I love the bottle for this I think
that's so smart is so nice to hold it's
like grippy and the lid pops off it just
looks like that as I said a really
pretty rose very similar to Stella just
something a bit cooler I think everyone
has Stella so this is a little bit
different I wanted to pick up something
from Kate Somerville because it's the
brand that Caroline hyerin's absolutely
loves and last time I was there I was
kind of I mean an RN over this product
it's so expensive and I just thought I
really don't need it but this time I
kind of took the plunge
it's the Kay Somerville goat milk cream
I don't really have a moisturizer that I
love at the moment so I thought it was a
good opportunity to give this a go yes
it's very expensive but it's also a
really good brand that comes highly
recommended
I love the packaging on her moisturizers
you take the lid off and then you just
press down on this and the product comes
out a little hole and I find that really
convenient I'm definitely going to start
using this kind of morning and night and
I will let you know how I get on my skin
is terrible at the moment so hopefully
this will sort it out now you guys know
how I feel about Sephora lip creams I
have two shades zero one always red and
straw blue kissed I think this is and
I've got two of the zero one because I
love these so much they're by far my
favorite lip product so long-lasting
not at all drying beautiful Matt's
bright lip so recently I found out that
Sephora have added some more colors to
the range which is really good because
there weren't that many and they weren't
that nice either so I didn't have long
to like try them out I just kind of
grabbed three that caught my eye I've
got number 10
kind of like a bright orange number nine
which is kind of like a coral pink and
zero six which is like a soft pink I
don't know if any of these are gonna
suit me they're all quite different to
what I usually wear and I can imagine
them being quite kind of contrasting
with my dark features I'm not sure
what's going to work but I'm definitely
gonna give them a go because I love the
formula of these lip products keep it on
the liquid lipstick theme when I was in
New York in October I picked up the Kat
Von D everlasting lipstick and
Bachelorette and I absolutely love this
I used it in my get ready with me video
you guys loved it - apparently so I
thought I'd pick up another shade and
this time I went for outlaw which is
like a dark red I didn't really know
what shade to pick actually there
weren't that many that I thought were
very me but this one looks really nice
it's it's more of a traditional kind of
dark red where it's bachelorettes more
of like a dark pink so I'm sure I will
get a lot of use out of this I do love
my bold red lip and then the final
product I went for was a massive splurge
and I didn't even kind of think twice
because I was in such a rush but I do
have a few regrets after buying this
it's from hourglass and it's one of
their new eyeshadow palettes these look
beautiful I definitely wanted one even
if I try it and don't like it I just
knew that something I really wanted to
try but I was in such a rush I went for
infinity which is the kind of brownie
taupey shade and these are beautiful and
I know I'll get good use out of them if
I like the eyeshadows but it's just so
boring and I feel like I have so many
Brown eyeshadows I really regret not
getting the purple palettes as I said
Victoria made me want to wear lots of
purple so I wish I'd got the purple
palette I think it would have been a bit
more adventurous and purple and plumbers
do suit my complexions so kind of
regretting getting the brown one but I'm
looking forward to giving these ago it
looks so cool it's like a wave and all
the colors have blended together it's
funny because someone on our beach chats
or said this is her worst nightmare
because she's so like OCD she can't
stand the fact that the shadows are like
blending together but I don't mind it I
think it looks really cool and it's a
nice size palette as well for like how
many shades yet one two three four five
shades so I'll be giving this a go and
we'll let you know how I find it so
that's everything I picked up on my
recent trip to America so I kind of
whizzed through that there's not much I
can say about the products but I haven't
really tried them yet
I'm sure you'll see them all pop up here
and there and I
and blog but let me know what your
favorite thing that I picked up was and
if you tried any of these things whether
you love them or hated them let me know
comment on this video down below I'll
see you guys on Tuesday for my next
weekly vlog and thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
