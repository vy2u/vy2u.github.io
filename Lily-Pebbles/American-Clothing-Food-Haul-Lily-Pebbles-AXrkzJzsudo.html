from yesterday's New York PC haul I'm
gonna be doing my clothing and food and
random stuff haul so if you haven't seen
my beauty haul that went up yesterday
morning click the I button and go and
check that out today I'm gonna show you
some other bits and bobs so how much you
bought that much we didn't have that
much free time for shopping and the
weather hasn't been great for kind of
browsing shops but I did go to made well
I always like to go there when I come
here because it's a shop we don't get at
home and I really like the style
everything in there the moment is
stripes which I'm okay with because I
love stripes but I did pick up too many
striped things first thing I got is this
shirt and I thought this would be really
nice like I've got a few trips coming up
where it's quite warm weather and I
haven't got that many summery clothes
you guys know all I wear is like black
so I thought this would be really nice
with jeans or denim shorts if it's a bit
warmer it's a stripy shirt it's got
quite short arms and it's like a relaxed
fit with two pockets on the front but I
really like the top I find it quite hard
to wear shirts that have a collar it
just looks a bit weird on me so I like
this doesn't really have a proper collar
and then it's got this criss-cross thing
there and I think it's really cool and I
think it would look really nice on I'm
sorry that I'm not gonna have proper
cutaways in this video it's just too
hard to do the Sun is setting fast
actually there's no Sun at all but the
light is going down fast in New York and
it's just hard to film cutaways in a
hotel room so I'll kind of film the
items but I'm sure you guys will see
this on my Instagram and snapchat when I
actually wear them the other thing I got
from Madewell is also stripes and I
thought this would be so nice for
holidays and when I go to France it's a
romper play suit it's a romper that the
American word for play suit always
romper its own mode now a jump suit is
when they're long I think yeah I think
this is a playsuit so it's stripy it's
got cute little shorts elasticated waist
band and then what I really liked about
this is it's really high neck and it
ties together on the shoulder and high
neck sometimes really doesn't suit me
cuz I've got big boobs and sometimes it
really does I think it's when it could
when it kind of goes in like a bit hole
thinik and that really suits me because
I've got quite broad shoulders so it
just kind of flatters my shoulders and I
really like this so looking forward to
wearing that I also went to Lululemon
because I get my sports bra from there I
find it so hard to find a sports bra
that
caters to my larger boobs but doesn't
make them bigger it just kind of
squashes them down and makes them
invisible that's what I look for in a
sports bar and I've got a really good
run for Lululemon I wanted to buy it
here because something that's 55 pounds
at home is $55 here it's crazy how much
cheaper it is but they didn't have it
they said they're discontinuing it which
is so annoying
I did however pick up the top I love the
bags you get a new dilemma
they're so good to reuse I really like
this I'm gonna wear it for working out
the back has got this nice mesh kind of
black thing with a hole there so you can
see your nice pretty sports bra and then
the print is black and white and it's
like a rose maybe what you know if it is
but it reminds me of Beauty and the
Beast like the Rose that they draw and
it's in the windows if anyone knows what
I mean let me know it looks really nice
on you know I love monochrome it's
always good to have more tops I also
bought rich to present while I was here
I would have given this to him by now so
it's okay to show it it's from addy - I
said to him what do you want cuz I
normally bring him back chocolates and
sweets but he's trying to be healthy so
he said if you see any nice t-shirts get
them for me he loves he loves a good
t-shirt so this is from addy - they got
a huge store here and I just saw this
and thought it was really cool it's a
white t-shirt and then it's got this
like a d/deaf thing it looks like
someone's drawn it with a felt-tip pen
black and brown very easy to wear it
will go with lots of things I hope it
fits him I got him a medium yeah a
little present for rich and then I've
got some other bits that are from Whole
Foods and from CVS I picked up in a
lower magazine because they're always
like ahead here you can't you can't get
these at home but they're so expensive
much more affordable to buy it here yeah
it was like 399 I think it's $6.99 at
home it's just a magazine dedicated to
beauty if you haven't read earlier and
you are into beauty it's really cool you
can see like what's gonna be launched
soon what's coming out and the cover
stars they've always do really cool
interviews and stuff I actually really
like the iPad version because they've
got videos as well yeah I got this for
the flight home I'm just gonna keep
going with the stuff I got from CVS I
also bought some crest 3d white strips
and people go on about these all the
time and I really want to whiten my
teeth because I've always suffered from
slightly kind of yellowy teeth I mean I
think English people in general have not
as white teeth so that's quite a
standard comment to get on YouTube if
you're an English youtuber but I have
like ridges on my teeth so you know
whatever but I've also got really
sensitive teeth so I've always been put
off whitening them and I'm just so
worried like I'm
person if it's really windy and I smile
it hurts so I might give them a go just
see apparently who was it who's tried
these I think is Lydia who was telling
me it's quite like a temporary
sensitivity and then it goes away and
they're probably they're really good
sorry I bought a box set and I thought I
would just like give it a go and see
what happens so I will let you know how
much pain I'm in or knowing I also
bought this is so random snack size
ziplock bags my friend Gemma always gets
these when they when she's here because
they don't do this size at home they're
like tiny I don't wanna open it cuz I go
to packet but they're basic like Ziploc
bags as that small so they're really
good if you want to like pack nuts in
your handbag they're just so small and
cute and I just thought they'd come in
handy so I bought some of those and I
made a media Buy some - okay everything
else is from Whole Foods and I've done
so well for not eating these already
because they've been sitting in my room
and I just want to eat them seriously
like some of the stuff I'm gonna take
home but I think after this video I'm
going to open up I'll show you which
ones I want any purse
these are the harvest snaps snap pea
crisps you can get these things at home
but I actually just bought them so once
at them and thought oh I should save
them for the whole video there please
but they're like dried well I don't even
know the gluten free GMO free they're
baked lightly salted and baked and they
are so delicious such a good alternative
to crisps nothing you need an
alternative to crisps crisps are great
but I actually prefer these they're so
yummy I also picked up some whoo kitchen
chocolate isn't who Hugh Hugh
oh it's Hugh parently um I've actually
been there and I've been on this trip
I've been before and I went for lunch it
was so yummy and they do chakra and
Amelia raves about this chocolate so I
got the crunchy mint chocolate bar I
don't even gonna like this because I
normally like kind of the Dairy Milk
unhealthy chocolate this is no cane
sugar no soy no refined sugar no gluten
no emulsifiers no GMO I mean it sounds
like there's nothing in it I hope it
tastes good I like mint chocolate so
we'll see I also bought some roasted
unsalted almonds I always buy these when
I come to America especially in Whole
Foods I mean I still haven't found them
but I don't think you can get roasted
almonds that are unsalted because at
home if they roast them there we salt
them so if you want to be a bit
healthier and you don't want salty
almonds or you know just gets a bit much
with all the salt these are delicious
I have opened them but I haven't had
many I'm gonna try and take them home
and then the final thing from Whole
Foods is Justin's peanut butter it's a
brand I doubt that you can get at home I
always pick but actually last time I
came here I got one of these and for
some reason put it in my hand luggage
and forgot to pack it in my suitcase and
they confiscated it from me so this time
I'm gonna get at home I love peanut
butter me and rich go through peanut
butters so fast he loves it more than I
do
he eats peanut butter on a tortilla wrap
it's so sick I can't even handle it but
I just like it on toast and like normal
things so I'm excited to try this one if
I remember right it's a bit more like
oily than a normal peanut butter I don't
think it's got any yeah it's literally
just dry roasted peanuts and palm oil
that's all it is in it so there's no
added like sugar or salt or anything
like that so that's all my kind of
non-beauty stuff that I picked up in New
York food magazines clothes a little bit
shorter than yesterday's haul but I
thought you guys would like to see don't
