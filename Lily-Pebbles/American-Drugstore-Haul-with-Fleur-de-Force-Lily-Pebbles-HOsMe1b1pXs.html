I'm finally filming with flash we were
just saying that we've known each other
for years and with finally film together
and we're in LA
even though yeah I'm like hey we could
be doing this in London like any time in
the last three four or five years
know each other no but it's fun and we
met up the other day and we had like a
huge shopping day together with Anna and
we went to Target and also and Sephora
so we've just done a big Sephora kind of
Ulta haul on Flair's channel so I will
leave that video down below go and have
a look and now we're going to do a
target cool was it just talking about -
yeah yeah what didn't we like CVS or
anything yeah
they don't think everything know I have
like a random bag but it's not target it
is from Target I just didn't want to
keep the huge bag yeah it was huge like
everyone bit wild so can you go first I
had the same thing that you're about to
hold up so let's do that together cuz
you got it and I was like it's basically
a soft lips cube I have never seen it
for I really like the soft lips lip balm
it's really cheap I think I'm like three
two or three dollars but the original
stuff looks really nice I thought okay
it's in like an IceCube shade like the
ear is like yeah I think so
and it's vanilla bean flavor five in one
lip care hydrates replenishes smooth
protects and adds shine I've never tried
soft this so nice over there I beat my
leg right around and just picked up
everything that everyone knows has been
your money all I haven't seen that I'll
get that I'll get that to be really
sweet
look how you did it's really sweet but
nice I love anything vanilla though I'm
the obsessive vanilla mmm love it that's
exciting
I enjoyed that I loved ink you can never
have too many lip balms that is the rule
well I don't know I appoint you many but
I mean another one I picked up this from
precision fist
economicus Physicians Formula I'll be
like yeah I haven't tried that many
different things from them but you said
the brushes are good the blush is all
good I haven't tried this one and this
one says it's for brunettes which sounds
like you're liking the illustration at
the front like I like the things
targeted to let your hair I color go be
fun to try it's like a mix of like
peachy pinky
it's in like crazy pink packaging was
not very me but it says it's new my I
was trying to get things that are new
and that I can't get home that was like
my rule and I really like Physicians
Formula as a brand I actually have a
couple of things from them which I'll
talk about next but like I really like
this yeah you tried a lot better yeah I
think the packaging is like really not
me but then the products are always
really good when I tried them so this
one I got the Argan wear bronzer coz
like last time I was over here I bought
the Argan wear blush which I really love
I bought this and then my friend Tati
came over the other day I was like that
sucks
oh no reason why she's like smell it oh
yeah it's gets the argan oil it smells
like incense it's like really ah but I'm
hoping it will be good anyway she was
like if you can get past the smell it's
okay but I was like it's not like the
L'Oreal lipsticks or so I can't deal
with I smell it's just like granny
slightly in sentence oh yeah it's very
strong if you like that like in sexy
food kind of thing in makeup and you
might like it you might like this but
I've never smelled any makeup it smells
like that more that's fine 10 it's quite
a temper Blanca but up there Hamza
that's not what I thought it target
there were many tests is out there's not
so they don't have testers over here and
drop so how do you it's terrible how do
you know what you want but then you can
bring stuff back yeah if it's rubbish
you should be like don't want this
anyone they take you back yeah that's
good but the tester things like weird
right yeah even if they've like
recommended for you together and like
shake much you can be like I didn't like
it very weird yeah so I kind of
struggled shade wise well I haven't
tried this yet it might be a perfect
match but I got a tinted moisturizer
with some sack Sonia Kashuk
the perfecting luminous foundation and
sounds good yeah I got it in zero to
vanilla I'm normally like a vanilla
shade um and I think it's there's
another foundation that's slightly
heavier so I'm hoping this is kind of
the lighter foundation the packaging
kind of reminds me of Mac's some reason
that it like yeah I don't know why but I
can't say much about it because I
haven't tried it but I love a good base
so I'm hoping this is good we will see
my next thing is again from Physicians
Formula and this is their shimmer strips
where they do like three eyeliners in
one and I just thought this looks
interesting
they're like glittery so you have like
gray bronze I like to wonder maybe I
should know what their cool black pewter
and champagne there we go and I think
you know it's a great black and I don't
know what kind of champagne they're
drinking but it's definitely going off
um so yeah they're like extreme I mean
oh yeah so you can't try them and try
out so I just thought they looked pretty
cute
Oh why is it gone was it go the whole
eyeliner just came half up yeah stick it
back in tragedy so they're like it's all
the black ones are really soft actually
yeah they're like shimmery yeah a little
bit of something could do a good little
smoky kind of I actually quite like the
taupe one yeah I feel like it wouldn't
show up that much but it's a nice color
you kind of blend outward yeah
I also got an eyeliner and this said new
so I wanted to try it so it looks pretty
good actually it does but they didn't
have the there's a complete eNOS way
time so it is it's l'oreal infallible
never failed silky pencil eyeliner and
this in green ivy which I quite like her
nice kind of greeny smile I know but
they made exactly all if that's the way
I was thinking of but they had a really
nice gold one that that would be nice
for the inside but they were sold out
but it looks like the picture makes it
look like smeary smooth yeah you know
what is weird like what's this word so
kiss me so chasm so kids kissing me so
this is so silk as me
it's like totes amazing that the next
thing I got two of the side hats on
Sally Hansen's salad on effect nail
polish strips I know they were like an
old thing that everyone got into a few
years ago I've just discovered them I
think they're amazing you went crazy
with you wait I just know my toes right
now basically I don't really get on with
nail wraps that well because they just
peel off like within about five minutes
and they drive me crazy and you know we
get a tiny bit and you're like oh I want
to rip it off these like stick on and
made of real Nirvana so they just stick
on I don't move and they say for like
two weeks
it's literally the best thing ever no
drying time they take like five minutes
to put on they're really expensive
they're like thirteen or fourteen
dollars a pack I think is quite a lot
I've used the more Ito's this time but
she's quite sparkling my toes are really
ugly about making Lily look up to
something like my pain so yeah I got a
pink sparky one and the French manicure
one which I was really excited about but
then I opened it and discovered that you
stick tips on separately which I'm not
sure how I feel about it
but we'll find out we will see all right
my next thing is something for these
they are the L'Oreal I was looking for
the Lamar are you bullish I nee ones
oh my there's ala lack one I've done
terribly what's dropped me in this trip
I keep like everything I want is sold
out it's a good though I have that my
phone it's good okay these are the
little luck I was looking for them the
matte ones which is that the chordal a
map yeah I think so no but they have
matte and shiny tarty talked about them
in a video just boy came out so I was
thank you for them and also a red and a
nude but no I think these are the glossy
ones well hopefully they're still nice
maybe not I don't really do glossy red
but yeah there's my like a nice like
pinky nude this is good I have it yeah
it was good I liked it I also got
another like nudie movie lip product
which if you watched our Sephora haul
you know I really don't need because I
have about 50 million of them this is
from our May I've never used anything
from our May before ever and it is in
the shade nude light/medium which is
really bizarre for a look like a
concealer the smart shade butter
actually like the Revlon Revlon one so
yeah ounces Alyssa I put this on really
hairy puffs my hand let's not do that um
it's like a slightly darker nude it's
nice yeah quite like it it seems quite
feels quite nice we'll see
so the last thing that I got is from wet
and wild and it just wouldn't expect you
to buy this I just jump in like it's
extremely yesiree okay so it's good for
us and it's intensely surgical and
intensely sparkly glitter the reason I
got it because it looks like the one in
like the Charlotte Tilbury
and the Tom Ford palette and there's
always one glitter and I quite like
after DiMaggio just kind of pressing a
bit on with my finger and if this is
good then it's like a toothbrush
I don't know though because sometimes
with these they end up being like gel
I'd be really interested to see because
sometimes they're just like a jelly and
they have like a tiny bit of beer in
there oh no other times they're like
intense glitter yeah we'll find out
hoping it's like a press-on filter type
action hopefully this print is pretty
color I've got two things left the first
one are these mini face masks which you
were like oh in the shop you're like no
they look terrible I like oh I think cuz
I just didn't get excited as Anna did
when you showed how's that
Anna's oh yeah you're like I'm not sure
I wanna try them they're so cute they're
in these like little pods from nug the
face mask what's soothing one and the
hydrating wanna shall they be good for
travel that cream cheese thank you
Marmite you know I really bizarre and
then I also got a lip scrub which comes
in a stick lip scrubs are generally
really hard to find apart from like lush
and fresh I don't really know if any
others and in a stick like let's find
out basically you're probably saying
lipstick and what it smells really good
so you put it on and then kind of on and
it's nothing or maybe keep it on so you
like can work it on let's call it grains
in it and then and then wash it off or
find these things I need to get better
at this whole like drugstore shopping
thing right so now I just although it's
gonna get messy they look that's gone
like yeah really messy I don't even say
what it was it's um it's from a brand I
never heard of called 29 by Lydia and
Monday V that everything yeah cool
that's our entire target haul so if you
want to see what we picked up from
Sephora and Ulta head over to first
channel I will link the video down below
