beauty haul so as you might know if you
reading my blog I'm in New York at the
moment with Birchbox or by the time you
watch this video I'll be back I've been
here for four days and I've just had the
best time and obviously one of my
favorite things to do I'm here is shot
for beauty because there are loads of
products that you can't get in the UK
you can get here and that's my main
mission when I'm here not to just buy
stuff that looks nice my stuff I can't
get at home and there are loads and I've
had loads of recommendations so it's a
little bit crazy in the drugstore and in
Sephora but I've picked up some nice
things so I thought showing you what so
first up is CVS I think all you American
people are gonna think it's hilarious
that we get excited by drugstores we
literally like me and Patricia jumped in
a cab we were like duane reade please to
it because like hey why you so excited
but we love American drug stores say
first of all magazines American
magazines they're just so much better
than UK ones so I picked up to
especially beauty magazines we don't
really do Beauty magazines at home so I
picked up the new and little magazine
because I don't know why I pad with me
and I wants to be the new one on the
plane and then I saw this the Beauty
Authority new Beauty magazine
is this huge chunky all about beauty of
just heaven I'm gonna read that a flight
home then beauty wise I picked up a few
bits first of all Neutrogena ultra
shared dry touch Sun cream SPF 55 Anna
recommended this it's a really nice non
greasy
SPF it's a special to fight which is the
highest one that I own now I think and I
love SPF for my face might try different
ones I've seen how they work under
makeup so I'm looking forward to trying
that I haven't tried any of these things
yet by the way so this isn't a review if
you want to see proper reviews I'm going
to be talking about that all on my blog
over the next like month so I'll put the
link to my blog I then went to Milani
and Amelia from the other Beauty is big
fan of Milani so I wanted a little but
they had and this is a really pretty
blush highlight it's going - Rose in
print with about three different shades
I like these last we can just swish the
brush around and get recognized all over
pinky glowy color and this is called
zero three beauties touch illuminating
face powder and I have a Milani blush
it's really nice texture so I think this
would be similar to that I also saw the
Maybelline Baby Lips neon I think
they're cool but yeah I think it's like
the neon colors and this one is Oh
Orange which is a priority I haven't
tried this yet and as phone is going off
in the background this is the shade Oh
orange so it's mint neon orange
but I am a feeling that's gonna be kind
of sheer because it is a lip balm I
can't imagine it being like really
pigmented but I'm gonna try it I didn't
know where to get this one other purple
one but it looks really purple so I work
for the aura and then the last people
CVS is a L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow I
mean here goes big fan of these and this
is the shade our moon rush which you
can't get at home
to get it it's a nice bug orangie brown
color these are just really pigmented
like you loose now they're not loose
that I pressed I shadow and you can pack
them on get a really intense amazing
shimmery eye so I really like these and
it's a shady hole get it home here's an
extra strain Reed which I think we
prefer to drain read there was a little
part called the look boutique or the
look Beauty I can't remember it's just
really nicely laid out and really smart
so if you're in New York going on the
hunt for one of those because it was
pretty nice and the first thing I ran
for is this it's the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in product and I've seen a flower
and a couple of other people talk about
this and it's like a leave-in detangler
one of those all-in-one it says it
prepares dry damaged hair I'd shined at
Arles controls friends there's like ten
things that supposed to do and it seems
we denied so I wanted to try it I was a
bit shocked at the price though it's
about $35 and I really armed a nard over
for a while in the end obviously
shopping with two girls they were like
no fur so I bought it in the end
and then I went to CVS and saw they had
like a tribal version for $10 less a bit
like um but I am if he was trying this
if it works then definitely worth the
money because you know me and the whole
hair thing
so the next thing I bought was such a
cliche products with the weft and wild
comfort zone palette and this is one of
those cult makeup products that all the
Americans talk about it's got two four
six eight are shadows and they're kind
of brownie neutrally greeny tones which
is right up my street and when one is
really affordable so I wants to give it
a go they also write on the shadows like
where is this to put their brow bone
eyelid crease so I think that's really
helpful and
the last thing I got some grain weed is
this owl may I've never actually heard
this brand but Ana saw this as she was
like they look right history and the
things one of her subscribers that said
these are really good so it's an alum a
name on it things like a lip cream this
one says what a day it's like a bright
red lip creamy lip lacquer kind of thing
I don't know as I said I haven't tried
it but cute packaging and I like red
lips so I've got that as well
finally I saved the best for last it's
Sephora my favorite shop ever we used to
have this in UK and there was one right
by my house and it went before we even
got good but we went straight story when
it's about four actually it's got a bit
crazy first thing I got was this it's
from an alternate which is the Haier
brand and this is the bamboo range and
this is the anti-breakage thermal
protectant spray and my hairdresser used
this on me you can get it in the UK but
I never Ricci it in stores and I always
forget to buy it online so I just saw
this and thought I'll get it every like
this range I also got Josie Maran they
say I'm never sure 100% pure argan oil
light and this is the one by the counter
I love that section by the counter where
they have all the travel sizes I always
get straight there and this is meant to
be really good I actually tried this
last night we had a little pamper
session in Anna's room and we went
through her skincare and we use this and
it's so nice it does go on like really
oily but it's nice to use at night and
when you wake up my skin felt amazing
today especially after the long haul
flights it was really dry so this is
nice and I like the chocolate ice I've
got quite a few oils I don't want to get
the big one I also picked up from the
bit by the till the Josie Maran
Barenaked nail wipes these are kind of
cuticle nail treatment and nail brush
remover all
one now I tried this last night on my
nails I have glitter on my nails at the
moment so I thought I'd give them a go
and they didn't budge the glitter that
matter like you didn't even make a
difference so I'm not sure it was just
this glitter I'm gonna try out a normal
polish and see how they do but these
maybe aren't so good
we also went to tart because we don't
get tart at home and it was actually a
really nice girl called Victoria who
work for tart and read both mine and
Anna's look so it's lovely to meet her
and so I picked up an Amazonian 12-hour
clay blush I have I think three of these
already at home but this color I always
had my eye on and I've never picked up
before and it's natural beauty it's a
right ready pink it's kind of like Mac
frankly scarlet which is what I wanted
to try it because I really like this
color and you sort of dust on really
lightly it's some natural flush color so
very much looking forward to trying that
sound
I think it'll definitely have to suit my
complexion what else Missa for this is
gonna be a little video I'm really
finished makeup forever much harder to
get in the UK so I picked up an aqua
shadow in 22e I asked my mom to give me
from America and she came back with a
blue cream eyeshadow in a pond so that
was a bit of a fail so I got this and
it's like a rusty brownie cream
eyeshadow pencil and Anna actually fit
this up as well we were like opposite
ends at the store we have such similar
tastes
I also got one of the macro eyeliners
because I really like the brown one into
L so I got 23 L which is a nice light
champagne color and I thought that would
be nice in the inner corner is slightly
underneath and actually Patricia bought
this and she tried it and it looked
amazing so looking forwards giving that
a go I also spotted the Marc Jacobs
counter and I think you can get this in
London now but I haven't seen it yet and
I picked up one of the nail polishes
this one is Delphine I think that's
going to say and it kind of reminds me
of Chanel oh I can't open it
but I just demolish the packaging okay
this reminds me of Chanel colored I
guess that's the color very similar and
also SCM remain oh cool can I have my
assistant in about like Lana so yeah I
really like this gun they're delicious
I'm not sure about the whole make part
Jacobs thing I didn't really I should
have took nice but didn t like packaging
so I didn't go for that
Tim with things from Sephora and then
one little extra I'm done the next thing
is a makeup forever full cover concealer
I first so much about this few years and
I've never had any interest in buying it
because without sounding like arrogant I
don't really get spots that badly and
this isn't really an under I can see
that but lucky me I've had awful skin
loss I've been in New York just from all
the flying and I haven't had my proper
skin care routine with me so I thought
pick it up to have a go I bought it in
six um and I also got six me I probably
similar skin tones it's slightly too
yellow for me but it's amazing it's full
cover without being cakey it's really
moisturizing and I like to just dab on
my finger and then blend out the edges
of the brush if I need to it's probably
just this the color that I need to do
that but this is really nice I'm really
looking forward to trying that and I
might go to Sephora today and see if I
can get another shape that's a bit
closer to my match yeah so the final
thing isn't from Sephora but we went to
if you've seen my vlogs I'll link them
all below we went to the cordially spa
and had a little mini treatment and they
used this with us it's the great water
it's like a spray and I haven't seen
this at home I don't know if I saw it in
France but definitely didn't see this at
home so I thought one of these is really
nice it smells like fresh and there's a
lot better science about where it goes
so on
all right now but it felt really nice on
so that's obviously a lot of stuff but
hopefully I'm going to be able to blog
about all of these and make videos and
give you some good reviews so hopefully
you like seeing my pic don't forget to
check out my vlogs from New York I did
three and Patricia Ann Turner in them
and we had such a fun time so I'm gonna
link this or below and thank you so much
