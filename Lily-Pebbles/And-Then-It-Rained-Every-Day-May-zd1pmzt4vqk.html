makeup for the day I thought I would
show you what I am doing
haven't many plans today I've got a
meeting at Dean my agents and I'm
probably gonna spend the day there
working because I like to be in an
office environment I always get a lot
done I have a lot to do right what am i
doing so I'm gonna do my makeup just go
put on a bit of shell serum
I'm starting to really like using this
just as a base very hydrating for very
natural days I'm loving mixing Estee
Lauder CC cream in the Chanel CC cream
Chanel one is slightly more coverage and
it's a bit light for me and the Estee
Lauder one comes out great and then it
tints and it's a little bit dark for me
so the mix of these at the moment is
really really good I'm just kind of
going to put a squirrel on the back of
my hand with both and you can just use
your hands for this and I really like it
for chewy natural makeup days you're
wearing this a lot recently so I watched
Grey's Anatomy last night on the sky
living and they said at the beginning
this is the season finale and it's a
double episode so got excited but then I
think everyone on Twitter said that it
wasn't theirs like the finales tonight
in America so it's like two episodes
home for us it was really good one
that's very sad there's a double also I
think I'm gonna change the whole
snapchat at the end of the video thing
one because I never have my camera on me
when I'm watching them so I'm not sure
logistically how that will work also
I've had a few snapchat some people were
saying like I don't want to go in your
vlog but just ones I say so I think it's
how to put off putting off people from
sending me snapchat videos because
they're worried that it means they'll be
in the vlog so I'm not gonna do that
anymore
it was very nice while it lasted I'm
still gonna watch all the snapchat
videos you guys sent me so send them to
me and don't worry you won't be in the
vlog I might have a few left from when I
film the other day I'll put those in if
I can but from now on let's just say
let's not do that anymore and you guys
can just send me snapchat videos when
you like because I love watching them
especially in the morning in the morning
I get a little ones from people in
Australia and New Zealand which I love I
haven't been to New Zealand I really
want to but I've been to Australia quite
a few times and I spent a month there
and I love it
so I'm gonna finish off my makeup now
you watch this whole thing it's very
boring so I'll be back with you in a
minute well so I'm completely obsessed
with those air biscuit podcast they're
so good that's like really depth
interviews and with really well-known
youtubers and they talk about things I
haven't spoken about before so I've done
Tyler Oakley and I've done grace Helbig
I'm now listening to Hannah Hart's he's
like my favorite I love her
and it's so good I think it just shows
like even if you haven't got like a
dramatic painful life story I think it
just shows us so much more to youtubers
than just what you see in their videos
and I really have enjoyed just having it
like either I fell asleep last night
listening to it that's why I'm quite
tired and I just had it playing while I
do my makeup and I like podcast I feel
like it's nice not to watch something
just to have something nice going into
your ears I'm gonna get more into
podcast everyone says that serial
podcast is amazing so my gains that next
okay I'm actually gonna stay at home
this morning and then just had to be in
for a meeting and stay there this
afternoon so I'm gonna get some stuff
done now
I'm gonna paint my nails because I need
to take a photo for my Sunday nail post
I do a blog post every Sunday on a new
nail polish I actually haven't been
buying many new nail polishes recently
I'm very good and this one is from the
new Chanel spring/summer collection
maybe some I think I mean it's like a
royal blue which is quite different - I
usually wear so I'm gonna paint that and
see what it looks like on your watch oh
but I've got a cut on my nail on this
one don't if you see that and I just
know it's gonna sting so bad when I take
my nail polish off especially if I use
this because this is really strong stuff
I like it it takes off my polish well
but I find it kind of dries out my
cuticles a little bit and it's super
super strong so I'm going to very
careful okay I'm just taking the photo
of my nails they are like this
I'm just importing it now here it is
they go that really said it much money
give it brighter I haven't really said
anyway yet because I wasn't sure I
wanted to promote it because it is quite
expensive to go but I'm gonna be at
beautycon London obviously I live in
London so I'm I'm not gonna dis not go I
really want to go and meet people and
there's loads of youtubers there as well
that I wanna meet and say hi to so I'm
gonna be there if you guys are already
going then I'm really looking forward to
meeting you but I completely understand
if I don't sold out but I know it's
pretty expensive so I understand if
people can't go or don't want to go as
well I'll hopefully see you guys another
time but yeah I'm gonna be at VidCon so
see you there if you guys are gonna be
there to look at this worker
look at this weather yesterday was like
the sunniest hottest day ever
and now it's absolutely pissing it down
this is what we had for up with in
London in the spring this is the perfect
day for my yellow raincoat because it's
like spring April showers a month we are
definitely May May showers and it's like
I've either got my big to hot winter
coat or my really light summer coat so
this is kind of in between and it's got
a hood so no frizzy hair for me today
ish or I'm gonna head to town now about
one o'clock meeting I share reading to
go I managed to convince him to have a
meeting in pasaba so I could just eat
yummy food
okay guys I'm home and massive fail so
anyway first my first fail and rich
what's the date today this is like 14
days in I think I'd done pretty well too
only now fail I'm home now and I haven't
really flogged today because there
wasn't anything to vlog after the last
thing I blogged was lunch
and after that I went back to the gleam
office and I just worked the whole time
Victoria was there that was nice but
don't wanna vlog because there's like it
one in the office and I just worked for
hours and hours and hours went through
millions of emails did all suffer knees
to Jim and there's nothing to vlog and
then I got on the tube to come back and
there was no chance of any sort of like
swishy swashy you wanted to go past me
yeah okay Jim there was no chance of any
swishy swashy filming because what
happens in London when it gets so so
busy on the tubers they stop letting
through that many people so there's like
barriers like six or the Sundays knows
barriers and they'll only open to so
it's like queues and Q's it literally
feels like you're a cow and you'll be
like moved around so that was mental it
was hot and the weather today so it's
like a full-on moan but I'm just like
trying to explain what's happening the
weather today is horrendous like so
rainy I've been wearing my night
trainers down there when I put them on
thinking I'm gonna wear some practical
shoes because it's raining I forget
they're like they're like knit like
knitted I don't not knitted that's not
the word is and all water goes in so
like my feet you're like soaking wet I
know that some of you get annoyed when I
moan but I'm just being me and there's
no point me pretending like hello I'm
home and I'm making dinner cuz that's
not how I feel right now I feel like
I've had a really crap day and I just
not having a good day on a video you'd
be grumpy so now I'm home and me and
rich needs to make time for dinner
but we haven't really got anything in
the house so I'm gonna make spaghetti
bolognaise which was pretty easy that's
a no I just thought I should update you
guys yeah I'm gonna make polonaise I'm
gonna use two garlic's I love garlic
onion mince and chopped tomatoes it's
really easy that's how I make mine some
people want mushrooms and carrots and
other stuff in but we like it just like
that
we like it quite tomatoey though so I'm
gonna make that now I haven't got any
spelt spaghetti left I'm gonna have
normal spaghetti and
have stomach cramps all night but it
will be so worth it it's gonna be
delicious
I'm just chopping up all the onions and
garlic I haven't like got into home
clothes yet yet so I've just shoved it
up to rich like can you bring me down
her de t-shirt tripe soup or sins and
socks and a hairband like a full outfit
so there's like a challenge
everything's gonna come down with like a
really smart nice t-shirt I'm not gonna
wanna wear I hope you feel like a grey
t-shirt and blue tracksuit bottoms my
Disney hoodie that's what I'm making for
all right what have you got for me
nice nice Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
t-shirt good choice that is my fav T
Disney hoodie reimpose and blue well
meant to be mine all right let's make
some Bolognese okay now I'm happy
Hera makes me so much happier Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles t-shirt attractive
bosoms and my hoodie will go on as well
okay wait I've chopped everything up now
so let's do onions first then garlic and
then mince No so look how bad the my
finger isn't uh since this morning let's
see if it focuses I think it's like
quite affected this fourth finger I'm
gonna put it in warm water and salt
water just a blonde
okay so this is how I make my polonaise
oil olive oil in the pan and then I'm
gonna add my onions first wait until
they get a little bit see-through and
then add the garlic
I'm always freaked out the girl it's
gonna burn I don't really like cooking
colleague it freaks me out and then
we're okay until it goes a little bit
Brown Oh actually until most of its
Brown and then we had the chopped
tomatoes officially the noisiest person
to have in the background of a vlog ever
what are you doing
my chicken is cooking for what me video
it one more day
you don't even at work tomorrow why are
you making this for why she is gonna go
out day so I'm gonna cook
breakfasting I knew then you see how the
onions have got a bit like shiny and
glossy that means it ready for the
garlic when you can start to really
smell the garlic cuts mean you know it's
kind of cooking and you don't want to
burn because once it burns it tastes
really bitter then we're gonna add the
mince it mixes in and I'm gonna let that
go Brown and then add in the chopped
tomatoes just watching my friends the
lean machine saucy cook okay so the
meats brown now as you can see I'm gonna
add in the chopped tomatoes and then
season it with salt okay so it looks
like what's the tomatoes added putting
the longer you could get the nice whip
taste so I'm gonna leave it there for as
long as you can
starving me how I'm gonna scale of 1 to
10 a 12 me 12 so that person that
answers things like that this is how
much pasture we're making for two people
with such pigs but I always I don't get
full on pasta I think does it take you
like I think was correct I might be
making up I think it like expands in
your stomach so it takes a while to get
full with it with me I can eat like
bowls and bowls of pasta I wouldn't be
full but then like an hour late it's
like BAM okay it's ready off I mean look
at this portion size is ridiculous and
also looks like poo but it's delicious
I swear doesn't smell good it's good
there is cheese I've seen it before
cheese if I used it the other day
there's no parmesan this is absolute
disaster Bolognese that parmesan is like
lily without rich it's like pecorino
it's not the same no I'm just gonna do
it without which one do you are okay
dinner done Holyoke is done we're now
watching watchdog because it's a special
episode where Claudia Winkleman if
you're not from the UK she's like a TV
presenter she talks about her daughter
who Halloween last year October just
been her daughter was out
trick-or-treating and her Halloween
costume her which is outfit caught on
fire and immediately went up in flames
and she nearly died and it was terrible
and they're now like doing a whole
program on how those outfits as
Halloween questions passed all the
safety tests even though they're clearly
the most flammable things ever and it's
really interesting actually and really
sad and it hasn't got to the bit yet or
Claudia Winkleman is talking about it
but she's very brave bathtime
don't know what to put into my by night
the options are so Elif is bar river
therapy associates coils here epsom
salts which I really like when I've
actually got bad back I should really do
that which is not as like nice I still
have got loads of stuff here I might go
for the oils actually and maybe one of
these to make it smell nice
I like the scent of a thatch they
thought they'd be really sweet and I
think initially when I talked about them
I said they were sweet but they're not I
kind of floral and quite fresh smelling
okay I like my bar quite my mum I
remember when I was younger she used to
be a boss so hot I'm also gonna listen
to what I have my god and at the moment
I'm listening Ballinger one which one
have I got here deep relaxed revived
morning and destress mind drawn a
destress mind with deep relaxed
I think it's just mind my mind is a
little bit stressed you only really need
a cap full of these oils but they're so
powerful I love them sometimes I used to
I might use two tonight okay skincare
tonight is gonna be Charlotte's Aubrey I
makeup remover mmm Renee's cleansing gel
Estee Lauder advanced night repair and
origins make a difference night that is
what I'm gonna do
