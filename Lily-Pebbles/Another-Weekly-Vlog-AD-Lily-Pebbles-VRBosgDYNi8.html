keratin treatment which was yesterday
although it was last week for you guys
so I thought I'd show you what my hair
looks like the morning after having it
done normally I wake up and my hair
looks like this and it's never stray I
always have to straighten it and this is
how I've woken up obviously I need to go
over the roots a little bit just because
you have to keep it straight when you've
had a keratin treatment but apart from
that it is the straightest it's ever
been I've never woken up with hair like
this it was a bit of a struggle to sleep
my hair down because I hate having like
hair on my neck when I'm hot I really
wanted to tie it up but I can't believe
how straight it is this morning oh my
god I said I've got cold with a variety
of her pills which is perfect as a stir
I'm just gonna do some work today
tonight I'm heading out for Louise's
book launch and for dinner with Anna and
Mark so I think I'll vlog a bit today if
I can we ditched our duvet last night
because it was so hot and instead slept
with the duvet cover it's so much cooler
today it's like 10 degrees cooler it's
amazing it's so nice I miss sitting at
my desk and scheduling for the rest of
the week and planning or when I'm gonna
do my videos I think we're gonna do
another day in the life video because
that went down really well last time but
I think this time I'm gonna do a really
busy day out so I don't know how that
will work but I'm gonna try and make it
happen because I want to make them
different each time that's kind of the
whole point every day it's different so
hopefully we'll do that on the schedule
in some videos trying to plan ahead
because I'm going to LA I think I've
told you guys me and Anna are going to
LA because we're gonna go to VidCon but
we're also going out there like a week
early to have some fun in LA meet some
youtubers that we like and maybe
hopefully doing some kind of meet-up
event thing but I will let you know when
it's confirmed because I'm not hundred
essential yet but we are going to be at
VidCon which would be fun I have no idea
what to expect never been by I'm excited
to go to LA I can hear my washing beep
pain and it's ready to go in the dryer
wow this is such a riveting vlog isn't
it it's riveting the web the right word
exciting
Dixie ok a bit hot she doesn't like the
hot which is from Tibet
so now I think I've ruined my favorite
shorts they were all like silky knit
come out or hard and crusty I think they
were hand wash only damn I hope they're
still on sale oh I need to buy another
pair rich is definitely better washing
clothes than I am because he has to wash
his like sports stuff and shirts all the
time so he normally does it I'm really
annoyed I've just ruined those shorts
I'm gonna try this makeup forever
hydrating primer that I bought when I
was in needs it's a bit like the Laura
Mercier one but better packaging it was
nice actually on the skin I'll see how
it helps my makeup hold out the other
day I'm just gonna do my makeup now you
guys to see me do that a million times
before so far back there sec okay makeup
done I've done pretty much the same
thing with my skin that I always do but
with the Kevyn Aucoin candlelight to
highlight and I feel like ready brownie
eyes that's what I fancy for today and
tonight I think I'm gonna try and film
part of my granola video now I'm not
gonna do the speaking part because the
house is too noisy but I might do the
cutaways actually like the cooking pot
I'm gonna go and see if I can go do that
now I absolutely love my new tripod but
it's so much heavier than my old one
so when I was like area downstairs it's
like carrying a baby I just got like a
quarter way through filming my granola
video and then I realize I just don't
have time to do it today it's already
half won I don't know why the wait time
I need to leave here at like half two I
think I haven't eaten yes so I'm just
gonna unload the future of bean which is
all here and then I've really used to
get dressed and head out I'm going this
afternoon to get a blood test done for
my whatever it is
see if I'm wheat intolerant or gluten
intolerant or any of those things if not
then my friend Jemma who's a
nutritionist is helping me with it and
if it all comes back negative she'll
just help me figure out what I shouldn't
be eating why I should but it would be
interesting it's better to get tests
than kind of self diagnose so I'm gonna
get that done today and then they send
it off I think it takes two weeks to
come back you have enough fruit apples
mangoes watermelon
nectarines no peaches pears and
dreams avocado lemon line banana think
for lunch I'm gonna make avocado mango
and hair just let all smash together is
like a salad you type of thing
this is what I'm gonna eat bit random
but mango avocado and tomatoes nice
light and fresh for a hot day
okay I'm finally ready to head out my
feet is so swollen I just had to run
them under cold water me and my mom have
this thing we're in the heat off heat
just swell up it's really weird so I'm
wearing my blue Topshop top the one with
the kind of side bits and my top shops
court which means it looks like a skirt
but it's actually shorts that's not
attractive my office sandals which I
should not be wearing with swollen feet
because they are gonna make them worse
and legs covered in mosquito bites that
I've tried to cover up using the laura
mercier secret camouflage hasn't really
worked though I'm gonna wear my ray-ban
Wayfarers today and I'm gonna head off
for a blood test I haven't really
thought about fighters I'm going for a
blood test but it really freaks me out I
really hope I don't faint I'm not good
with heat and blood and injections and
things like that so I'm just gonna go
and get it done it's not much blood just
need to not be a wimp and just do it see
the problem is when they do it I hold my
breath and then I get lightheaded so I'm
just gonna try and breathe
in London when you drive into central
London like town
if you drive you have to pay a
congestion charge which i think is like
13 pounds but I really don't want to go
in the tube in such a hot day so she
really having a blood test and feeling
faint so I'm just gonna have to pay the
congestion charge loads of people say I
can't believe you drive is it under or
aren't you scared with something I'm
completely used to go obviously been
doing it my whole life that's a lie I've
only been driving since I was 17 and
I've been doing it for 10 years so I
don't find it scary until I actually
find it much scarier driving in country
roads where there's like no lights at
night where riches from in the middle of
the country there's no lights big windy
roads do run out of the middle of the
road I find that waste area that central
London where everything's very slow
okay I'm out and it didn't hurt or
didn't even feel a thing I just turned
my head didn't look she was like a new
occasion that was gonna be wicked but it
was fine I didn't feel it and I've got a
little plaster now Wow
it's all good I'm gonna head to Topshop
I think is I've got a now or so there's
nothing to do so I'm gonna go see if I
can find any nice clothes for her legs I
really need some more dresses and places
I'm happy with my purchases and everyone
looking in thinks I am talking to myself
right now maybe they think I'm on
loudspeaker yeah I'm gonna pretend I'm
just on loudspeaker talking to someone
anyway only thing I pick up rich from
Green Park and then we're both gonna go
to Louise's book launch Ana remark gonna
be there and then we're going out for
dinner afterwards because wait Hosanna
said she's moving I think Anna's told
you guys that she's moving so I'm
allowed to say I think it'll be our last
dinner asked for before they move I
can't talk about it with my friends and
moving away and leaving me so selfish
making it about me I'm gonna go get rich
and see you guys in a minute
she went over friends have a drink
celebrate Louise and then head up dinner
right now it's so hot it's messy in
there we're going to go find somewhere
really vicious and I think Alex and
Victoria maybe the twins are gonna come
to dinner with us
hopefully everywhere before we have to
get the supper because I've always
wanted to go there that's always on mate
and Chelsea perfect cook you specially
doing when within I feel like everyone
goes there so I think we're gonna try
the Big Easy
which meant to be like ribs it's such a
nice dinner with everyone such a lovely
group of people it was really nice of it
and frustrated because Jaclyn hill
youtuber makeup artist released a
collaboration with Becca cosmetics she
did a highlighter and it was gonna go on
this floor website at 5 p.m. today but
obviously I was out having my blood test
so I said an alarm because I when I
thought I was home and I couldn't get it
cuz I was Al and I've got this little
Anna to buy me one and I've just seen
her tweet they sold out but she said
they're gonna be back on the website a
few hours but it's like half 11 here
can't wait up for a few hours so I don't
know I really want war I'm so upset
there might be install when we get to LA
but I think they'll be sold out I really
want one anyway and when I go to bed and
I will flop again on Saturday so I'll
see you guys then I just realized that I
haven't started vlogging but I literally
did just wake up and I'm doing my makeup
because I'm just filming a few cutaways
for the video it's going up in a couple
of weeks because as I said I'm trying to
get ahead before LA so that means
working a bit on weekends which is fine
because Richards gone out for the
workout oh gosh windy and so I'm just
gonna throw like five cutaways it's
quite hard when you do make makeup
cutaways and it sounds ridiculous but
it's quite hard because you have to like
I don't I never do my makeup take off
and do it again on the same day
thought that's really bad for my skin so
you have to kind of make the time enough
days to do your makeup I'll try to show
like three different foundations and
that's like three days of filming I
can't really explain but it takes up a
lot of time doing like the cutaways and
showing how the makeup actually looks on
my face so I'm just doing those now my
camera setup here just in front of my
little stool in my bed have made a very
neat because I don't that you guys
really care what's in the background is
more of what's in the video so I'll be
back with you in five minutes okay my
makeups done but I won't show you what
put us in museum because that will we're
in the video I think I'm gonna film
cutaways the products if his bitch isn't
back yet so might as well keep going
okay I'm now gonna film some cutaways
for another video I'm doing with all of
these clothes and I'm gonna go into the
gardens to do it's quite hard to do it
for myself because you need to keep
changing the tripod or it takes forever
and also and you're standing that far
away from the camera I can never see if
I'm in focus or not I'm gonna try
hopefully Richard be home soon and he
can help me out okay I finally finished
all my cutaways I think it actually went
quite well something about doing things
like this on a weekend when there aren't
any emails coming in or any distractions
kind of works maybe I should start
working on weekends more me and rich are
gonna head out to the supermarket soon
because it's a gorgeous day so we're
gonna have a nice barbecue for lunch us
Brits always like to have a good
barbecue and it's sunny because it
doesn't happen that often having some
kind of heatwave at the moment I think
everyone around the world thinks we're
all mental for just talking about the
weather all the time
but it is being insanely hot like ten
years record hot so I don't know what
we're gonna get I kind of fancy like
ribs or something like that I'm wearing
these sandals today which I got last
year from whistles and I love them the
color is so happy and bright we're just
gonna go pick up some food for lunch you
haven't got much actually because any
mean rich and my parents have eating so
just gonna get ribs sausages we've got
loads
salad stuff at home making my mum's
gonna make a watermelon and tomato
gazpacho which sounds amazing and richly
skits and shirts as well well we're here
okay we're home and we got everything we
needed and I didn't if you guys remember
from my picnic vlog where we went for
picnic with my friends and I bought some
of the recorder League flavored cider
which I love and then I also had some in
Brighton so the guys from Accord league
wanted to collaborate somehow and so
they sent me this amazing parcel I'm
gonna have some of the strawberry and
lime flavour for our barbecue today look
how amazing this is recorded lakeside a
beautifully Swedish wouldn't know a
Swedish this oh my god they've basically
sent me enriched like loads of their
premium strawberry lime cider

in the summer oh look there's a really
nice floral crown in here - that's super
see wait let's not damage that that's so

cucumber and peppers and asparagus which
are burning in the oven now and then we
bought some sausages and ribs and rich
insisted on getting this beef brisket as
well we're just waiting for the ribs and
the brisket to cook and asparagus whoa
steamy I think I'm gonna go to the
outside and have a drink because it's
getting a bit hot and steamy in the
kitchen cuts up a couple of wedges of
lime for the drinks and I think rich put
them in the freezer just to give them a
quick cold quickly which ones that I'm
rich put the glass in the fridge as well
this looks very professional
alright it's a breakup slice amazing
weather today okay so I've got my cold
glass and ice sure I haven't tried to
savor I've tried the passionfruit one oh
I think there's probably a more
professional way to pour it than that
I'm not very good at this Rich's on the
phone you probably should have done it
oh no looks fizzing down oh my oh that's
so nice very refreshing I'm gonna get
rich one he'll like that
rich try some
nice yeah I would forgot my line I cut
the help and then I thought to put in

squeezing it in you know he's like -
yeah I like mine
Richie's still work in a bar for desi
you don't know so he's into his drinks I
lifted oh that's actually nice because
the strawberry is quite sweet so the
lime like adds a bit of zing eNOS all
right let's gets food I'm hungry
here we've got some sausages I'm here
already
I'm gonna head to the cinema now with my
parents and with my sister Jojo Richards
got out to see his friend for the
evening we're gonna go see ami which is
the Amy Winehouse film and I'm really
looking forward to it I was a huge Amy
Winehouse fan from her first album Frank
and I will never forget the day we found
out she died because I was on holiday in
Israel with three of my best friends as
Chiquita Jenny and she was really like
our generation of music and we were also
shocked and we all like had a little cry
and I really really loved her music so
I'm looking forward to seeing it then to
be really good has had amazing really
cinema and George is really exactly the
same thing as me same white top and the
same necklace just realized I haven't
finished my vlog the film was so so good
if amy winehouse had a vlogging youtube
channel i feel like that's what it would
look like it was all like home footage
and videos
it was really well made as the same
director is called Senna really good so
I would definitely recommend going see
at going to see Amy yeah it was sad but
very good I'm gonna go to sleep now
tomorrow we are heading to East Sussex
to celebrate my parents anniversary and
