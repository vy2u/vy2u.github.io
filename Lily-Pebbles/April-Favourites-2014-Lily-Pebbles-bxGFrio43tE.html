April favorites video and I know I'm in
Milan at the moment but I prefilled this
video just before I went so I'm gonna
skip all the waffle and get straight
into it first product I've been loving
all month if NARS sheer glow and I love
this foundation for years but when Anna
mentioned in her vlog it kind of like
triggered my memory and I went into my
drawers to find ones I had and I only
had two shades that were way too dark
for me I don't know what happened there
so I went to get another shade and this
time I got Deauville which is perfectly
matched for me and I've been wearing
this every single day this month
absolutely love this foundation it's
very skin-like but it has this amazing
glow that's not kind of it's not a Jew
EEP lo it's just kind of like a lit from
within and I absolutely love it so I got
the pump as well which you can get from
space and K I think they're five pounds
and I had one on one of my older bottles
it makes it much easier to use I
definitely recommend getting a pump but
yeah absolutely love this foundation
I've been wearing it everyday another
kind of glowy skin makeup products that
I have been loving is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear brush on glow BB highlighter
that's the longest name ever
it looks like the why I sell tissue
klutz like you kind of thicker so it's
one of those pens that you click to wind
up and put up comes out and I've been
just using this on the outer corners of
my eye on my forehead down my nose and
on my Cupid's bow and it's a beautiful
highlighter it's not at all shimmery
it's just like add lights where you want
light to go and I prefer this to the Y's
LT should play I'm not sure why but it's
got slightly more coverage it's less
watery so I find it easy it's kind of
Pat in and blend in with a brush there
have been a couple of nail polishes that
I've been obsessed with this month the
first one is from the SE spring
collection and it's called truth or
flare and this was my favorite pick from
an Essie spring line and it's a
beautiful kind of elephant gray blue I
don't know that's how you describe it
it's it's definitely a blue but it's not
bright blue it's not possible blue it's
kind of somewhere in between and I think
it's so she and if you're scared of
wearing blue nail polishes I think this
is an easy way to kind of try them out
and I think it just looks really pretty
on another one is front of the models
own new range and there are a range of
nail polishes that are supposed to kind
of complement your skin when you have a
tan and we all have those kind of neon
tops while I have had like at neon
messed up that I've had for years and I
always get it out on someone like oh
it's Han because it just makes my skin
look really nice and then basically made
it nail polishes that do the same thing
so this one is good beach bag it's my
favorite pick from all the colors they
released it's kind of a light peachy
coral like a muted down neon it's not a
bright nail and it's kind of a
capacitive neon and I think it's so
pretty it makes your hands it really
nice even if you haven't got time I
haven't got sound at moment it just
makes your hands a bit clean and fresh
and I think it's really pretty color for
someone for my eyes there have been two
products I've been reaching for pretty
much every day this month the first one
is the by Terry Andhra black star in
brown perfection so this is a cream
eyeshadow stick I'm so super easy just
wind it up and you can apply it straight
up to your eye and then either blend out
with your finger or a brush and this is
kind of the most basic brown shade that
they have it looks really dark when you
apply it but once you blend out it's
just a really nice easy everyday Brown
and who are in it under eyeshadows but
also by itself the size of the shadows
really good for getting underneath your
eye and I think there's a really
long-lasting and creamy and I'm a little
bit obsessed with this so I'm going to
go to some other shades and maybe pick
up an all along this is by far the most
exciting product in this favourites
video I think it's the new Laura Mercier
spring artist palette they bought one of
these out at Christmas and I missed it
and I was so upset because I really
really wanted it but then the spring one
has come out and I am so excited about
this early problem before I show you is
the one that came around Christmas was
around those five pounds and they have
really bumped up the price I think this
one is now 55 maybe 60 it comes with a
mini mascara and cream eyeshadows stick
so I think that's why they popped up the
price but I think it's a bit of shame
I think people just want the palette
ready so they shouldn't have done that
but I still think it's worth it I
seriously haven't been as excited about
palette
since the Naked palette so it looks like
this it has a row of mash our days and a
row of shimmer shards and they're such
good quality the max day virtual key
they don't separate on your eyelid
they're really easy to apply and blend
and the shimmers are not at all glittery
they're not even that shimmery they're
just really buttery and add a little bit
of shimmer to the lid
I think they've picked the perfect shade
there's some really easy everyday Browns
there's a few kind of purples and Pink's
if you want a more kind of purply look
there's a lighter highlight of shades
and then the Navy and the black are
really good for liner shades and I've
been using the Navy as a liner shade a
lot and I really like the look it's just
there isn't one shade in here that I
wouldn't wear I love every single one
and I've been using this everyday it's
such good quality and really excited
about this palette it comes out on the
1st of May I think I'm not antisocial
which stores I see the space of care
John Lewis in the UK so I'll put all the
info below don't miss this one seriously
you will regret it is amazing so my next
favorite is for hair and it's these
ghd's in the periwinkle shade now GHD
have released three new kind of pastel
shades for their hair straighteners and
their periwinkle Jade and color but the
other one is that they're all beautiful
it's very hard to pick but I ended up
getting these ones in periwinkle you can
get these on ASOS and oh my god not only
are they beautiful I just love looking
at them in this parcel shade I think
that's so pretty and they let the
standard small size I actually find
these are easier to curl my hair with
then I have to supply a black ones
before and I don't know if it's because
they're getting old or they're dirty but
I find curly my hair with is much easier
smoothie just has my clamp it and twist
it and it creates really kind of natural
curls and they're so good for
straightening they're not too big so
they're good for
and let's just face it they're beautiful
the final Beauty favorites is a pixie
glow tonic and I picked up a new one of
these this is the old packaging and it's
the new one I think before it was a bit
of a side project for them and then they
realized how popular it got so they've
repackaged it I think is the same
formula though and the thing is mine
started orange in this bottle and it
went clear and I think it stopped
working so I don't know if that's just
because it's got kind of like fresh
ingredients or something or maybe my
bathrooms too warm so I just picked up a
new one and it's bright orange again and
I got a bit lazy with using this and I
was using it in the evenings kind of
every other day but since getting the
new one I've been using it morning and
night I just put a bit of cotton wool
and I use it as an exfoliating toner
after I cleanse my face and it's made
all the difference to my skin I was
getting a little bit kind of spotty and
this is completely cleared things up
made my skin much better and smooth and
glowy and I really like this and I like
the new packaging so a couple of non
Beauty favorites and first one is this
necklace that I picked up from
accessorized a couple of years ago
accessorize accessories
yes accessorize they have this really
nice kind of coral rope up here and then
it turns into like a brassy metal and
there's three parts to it and it's
layered and I think it looks really nice
I can imagine looking be nice with like
a white shirt or any kind of summery
outfit it really it's just really
relaxed and I really like it
then another non Beauty favorite and my
final favorite from this video is the
Breville blend active blender so yes
this is a bit random but I love this
blender and I have been obsessed in it
if you read my blog you would have seen
that put up a recipe or a couple of
recipes on there for some smoothies I've
been making this vendor is amazing let
me explain it comes like this and then
it comes with two sports bottles that
look like this so all you have to do is
unscrew the lid take the top of the
blender and screw on like it's a lid
turn this upside down and screw it in
and then you just press the on button
and knock that so then once you've
blended all your products you can take
this off put on the lid and then you can
just drink it straight out of the bottle
and I think that is genius
you don't have to drink out the bottle
you can pour it into a cup but they're
like hardly any cleaning all you have to
do is clean the bottle and clean this
top part the blender I have a juicer and
I love making juice but it's such a pain
to clean the juicer there are so many
different parts to it and it's just a
nightmare so I love how quick and easy
this is and I've been making fruit
smoothies with like banana kiwi
strawberries
Greek yogurt and I'm also be making
green smoothies with like avocado and
kale and lemon and it's delicious I will
pop any recipes that I've posted already
below in the info bar but I think this
is great then if you can pick them up
for like 25 pounds of Amazon as well
which is just such a bargain it's really
encouraged me to kind of have a smoothie
in the morning if I had more time for
breakfast or have a green juice in the
afternoon to rehydrate I absolutely love
this thing it's genius
and I have thoroughly enjoyed using it
so those are all my April favorites I
hope you enjoyed seeing what they all
are as I said I am in Milan at the
moment and I would putting up a vlog on
Thursday or my time it's a tube so look
out for that thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in my next video
