you know what that means it's April
favorites time I've been keeping a list
all month of my favorite beauty products
but also films TV shows all different
kinds of things because I know you guys
like it when I kind of mix it up a bit
and there's so many things I'm
interested in not just UT so I'm gonna
get started and I think I will start
with some beauty stuff the first thing
is a brush and this is from Clinique
it's a new buffing brush that they
brought out and I really really like
this when I received it I didn't think
kind of that much of it I wasn't majorly
excited about it but then I tried it and
thought actually this is brilliant
because it's somewhere between the bobbi
brown buffing brush and the Real
Techniques stippling brush it's got a
similar shape to the Bobbi Brown buffing
brush it's quite rounded but it has
these kind of Jo fiber bristles so it's
quite densely packed at the bottom but a
bit softer at the top and it's so so
good it's great for foundation I've also
used it for cream bronzers and cream
blushes and it's worked so well with
those I absolutely love this brush and
I'm so glad I've got it in my collection
now because I really do use it quite a
lot and I think it's gonna be great in
the warmer months but I'm using more
like creamy liquidy products I've also
been using this product every day this
month and it's the Delilah brow line
Delilah's quite a new brand still I
think they sell it in space Inc and it's
actually a really nice brand I've tried
quite a few things from the line and
everything I've tried I've really liked
that this has really stood out and I've
been using it everyday it's got a
spoolie on one end and then pencil and
the other it's very similar to the
Anastasio brow is so far the packaging
is much better because the anastasi brow
is always break something
this is shade ash one-zero-zero-one
which is slightly browner and lighter
compared to my brows but i don't really
like to match my pencil with my brows
because then i end up making them far
too dark so when i apply this it does
look a bit strange at first but it does
really mesh together well and I don't
really fill in my brows that much so
this is perfect and I've really been
enjoying it okay let's talk about films
I've got two films I want to recommend
this month I saw them both in the cinema
and just came out thinking oh my god
that was so so good the first one is
Eddie the Eagle
the film is about Michael Edwards he was
the first-ever British ski jumper and
it's a comedy it's absolutely hilarious
it's such a kind of light-hearted fun
film you leave just thinking like oh
that's so good
I laughed so much in it was really
relaxing to watch the very kind of like
British comedy film I loved every minute
I just highly recommend go and watch it
while it's in the cinema proper
feel-good film next one is the Jungle
Book
they've redone the Jungle Book and I
don't know if you guys know I mentioned
this in a Q&amp;amp;A video years ago but the
jungle book is my all-time favorite
Disney film it's my dad's as well we
watched it so much growing up so I was a
little bit skeptical at first when I
heard they were kind of remaking it but
I saw the trailer and just thought that
looks insane it's a completely different
type of Jungle Book I think it's more
based on the book and it's a very adult
film it's not one to take kids to it's
actually quite scary but the the
graphics is incredible it's so well cast
it's got Bill Murray Christopher Walken
Scarlett Johansson plays car I think
it's so great that they made car the
snake a female character because there
definitely weren't enough female animals
in the original jungle book it's so
exciting I actually loved it so much I
would see it again so I really recommend
it and they kept two songs in it so it's
not like a full-on musical there's just
two songs okay let's get back to beauty
for a minute and I've got a body lotion
that I'd really recommend this is from
the bride Amelia rate I think that's how
you say it it's the skin smoothing body
lotion so this has a lactic acid in it
which is a really gentle iha and that
means that it really exfoliates the skin
whilst moisturizing her so I've never
tried a body lotion as EHA in it but it
really really works I use this on my
arms you know if you get like rough skin
on the back of your arms it's really
good for that I kind of use it
everywhere and I've just really been
enjoying it because I always skip the
body moisturizing step because I'm just
not sure if it's doing anything and this
one I can really tell instantly like the
next day my skin feels so smooth and now
we're getting into spring/summer gave my
arms out more it's really nice to kind
of look after my skin and this is a
great body moisturizer I actually
discovered this when watching one of
coastal beauty's videos she said she
uses it for the dry skin on the back of
her arms so I gave it a go and she was
right it's great got quite a bit of
skincare in this video because I've kind
of changed up my skincare a bit this
month my skin was getting a bit dodgy
towards the end of last month and my
skincare routine needed changing up a
bit so I've gone back to my Liz Elkins
and polish I love this cleanser it's
great when my skin just doesn't know
what
and it needs a break oils and balms are
amazing but sometimes they can be a
little bit heavy on my skin and I just
need a couple of weeks of like a creamy
basic cleanser and that's what the Liz
Earle cleanse and polish is and it's
really helped clear my skin it's just so
gentle I love using this it takes of all
your makeup you can use a muslin cloth
to take it off and it's just so like
natural and calming on the skin I've
also been using the pixie overnight glow
serums this is an exfoliating gel again
it's got a HK in it and it really takes
off the dead skin from your face but
it's gentle as well I use this in the
evening you have to be careful to wear
SPF when you're using this a lot but it
doesn't like burn your skin or anything
like that it just really exfoliates it
gently and my skin feels really soft in
the morning so this has really been
helping as well I've mentioned this a
lot in the past it's not a new favorite
but I really wanted to give it a mention
because I've gone through so many this
month
it's the Clarins instant eye makeup
remover and I have to thank Anna for
introducing this to me and I have to
thank Anna for introducing me to this
years ago it's so so good I finished one
of these bottles this month got another
one I've nearly finished my travel size
and then Clarins
oh my god I love them for doing this
they've sent me like a salon size one
this is so exciting I love this product
so much it's like when I bought loads of
ostia rennaisance cleansing gels when I
love a product they just want to have a
million backups because I never want to
run out I need to get more of the travel
sized ones because they're really good
but this is amazing so I keep this in my
bathroom I use it every night to remove
my eye makeup before cleansing and it's
the best one I've tried the Charlotte
Tilbury one I've tried which other ones
a boat ride I can't remember I've tried
all the ones that have this like bio
phase and nothing is as good as the
Clarins one you shake it up mix it all
together and it takes off your makeup in
one swipe okay let's go back to non
beauty and a TV series that I would
really recommend is love manwich
finished it in two days there's only one
season there should be another one
coming soon and I think it's a better
title it's about going a girl battling
with kind of love and emotions but it's
so quirky the characters are so
interesting it's created by the guy who
plays the main character who's Paul Ross
and Judd Apatow and I didn't realize
when I started watching it but I googled
it and then I was like of course it's so
good Judd Apatow also created some of my
favorite films like knocked out both
your old virgin this is 40
so it's so funny if you've seen any of
those films you'll know they're
brilliantly funny so enjoyable to watch
and yeah me and rich finished it in like
two days it was so good so I'd really
recommend it that's on Netflix they go
back to beauty I have been loving this
Schumer straightforward
time saving blow dry oil I don't use
much of the Schumer O'Hare stuff it's
quite pricey but this is a really good
blow dry oil so you just
it says part your hair and spray it in
sections I haven't really got time for
that I tend to just spray it on like
damp hair and with hair product
sometimes I can't really tell if they
actually make a difference or not but
this makes an instant difference to the
texture of my hair my hair is so soft
after I wash it now so if you do have
quite textured rough hair like I do this
is definitely good for softening it up a
bit and treating it before you blow-dry
it so I really like this another oil but
this time a nail oil this is from Essie
and I recently did a shoot with SC and
Rankin and the lovely lady who did my
nails that she gave me one of these it's
an amazing bright green color but it
doesn't come out green it's just a nail
oil and I told her that my nails are
always flaking and chip pain and she
said it's just because my nails are so
dry so I should just keep this on my
desk every now again just paint it on my
nails so I've been doing that for like
the past few weeks and it's really made
a difference to the quality of my nails
because it's such a nice bright green
color if it's sitting on my desk I
always remember to do it yeah it smells
really fruity as well so I really like
this and I'm gonna try and continue to
use this everyday okay the final product
is my Kylie Jenner lip kit in candy cane
it's what I'm wearing today I really
like this I'm so glad I got them this is
definitely my favorite shade it's like
the lightest one out of all the ones I
picked up the line is gray soft and
smooth and the liquid lipstick is really
long-lasting I just love that you can
put it on in the morning and not have to
worry about reapplying I hate reapplying
lipstick so I know this one's just gonna
last all day it's gonna last through any
meal that I eat if you want to see my
full Kylie Jenner lip kit review video
press the I button you can go and watch
that afterwards I kind of talk more in
detail about what I think of them okay
so those are all my favorites and as you
can see from the title everyday May is
happening for those of you that don't
know what everyday May is last May
I've logged every day in May but before
you guys get too excited it's gonna be
different this year as you know I'm
getting married so I've got so much of
my plate than
trying to plan a wedding trying to do
work try joggle life my sister's having
a baby in May so everything's a bit
crazy so I don't want to commit to a
vlog every day let's think of it more as
like mayhem may I hopefully there's just
gonna be a load of new videos I don't
know if they're gonna be up every day at
6:30 I don't know if it's gonna be a
vlog every day some days there might not
be a video I'm not going to be that
strip to myself this year because I just
don't want to resent doing it but I'm
gonna try my best to put up loads of
videos in May vlogs of other videos just

flexible about it this year so I hope
