my April favorites and stay tuned until
the end because my last favorite is a
new handbag and I'm going to be talking
all about it so if you want to hear
about my new bag watch until the end but
I'm going to go through all the products
that i have here and there aren't that
many this month I feel like this month
hasn't been a major Beauty month for me
I haven't really had that kind of
excited about makeup feeling I know wow
that's like a big statement I don't know
why it happens every now and again so
I'm going to talk you through my
favorites and let's start with nails
because I actually forgot to feature
this last month and I was kicking myself
so annoyed that I forgot so I made sure
it was on the list for this month and
it's a nail polish from nails inc and
it's from the Alexa Chung edit and it's
called winter Lila I have the wrong lid
on it's not cool Alexis stars it's
called winter lilac and it's a really
beautiful muted down bluey grey it's
very much in the same category of SC
maximilian Strauss hell Strasser have
you say it but less green and more blue
and it's also very similar to this one
from Topshop which is new and this is
blue rinse which I've been wearing in my
last few videos and i really like it
they're both very similar so if you want
a kind of cheaper alternative this one
from top shots just five pounds i think
the nails inc polishes are 14 but i
really really love winter lilac it's
just such a sophisticated blue by the
way i didn't mention my hair is up and
it's never normally up so i feel like i
should address this I just came back
from Topshop in oxford circus which is
like central London because hersha sins
have just started a little braid bar
there and it's 15 pounds for a 15 minute
braid and they did my hair and I feel
pretty updo so I kind of like it I'm
going to keep it in for this video the
next favorite is a mascara and it's by
Max Factor it's the masterpiece glamour
extensions three in one volumizing
mascara I think I used this in a get
ready with me recently I really like
this i've been using it everyday the
packaging is quite wide from a scholar
of packing is nothing special but the
wand is a very kind of small plasticky
wand and it really grips to the lashes
and the reason I'm holding this one of
my other hand is because it really
reminds me of the benefit roller lash
which is their new mascara and i think
is actually a really good drugstore dupe
for this because the benefit one is
quite expensive they're not exactly the
same but to me they give the same effect
on my lashes length not too much kind of
fluttery volume so it's not it's not
like you're going on
is very good like daytime mascara but
just nice separation and length and I
don't need to put on too many layers
like I do with some mascara so I really
like this one from Max Factor I've also
been using this from Mac a lot and it's
their paint pot in ground work I've seen
people using this and videos for years
and I've never tried it I finally got
hold of one and it's just a really nice
light brown family toned cream eyeshadow
it's nice to use as a base before other
eye shadow but this one is quite
pigmented and it's quite a strong warm
tone brown so you can swear it by itself
you can use your finger to blend out and
apply under the eye you can use a brush
it's very versatile very easy it's
really flattering on if you have skin
tone like me or if you have bluey-green
eyes it would look really nice as well I
have invisi bubbles coming out of my
ears if you don't know what invisi
bobble is they're these little hair
bands you can get in boots and superdrug
I'm not sure massive jerk I've
definitely seen them in Boots and they
look like what phone telephone wires
used to be made out of so like you know
I used to get keyrings like this in the
90s I've heard really mixed reviews on
these some people say they don't kind of
keep their hair in place I like these
when I'm at home because they don't put
a kink in your hair they don't feel too
tight and uncomfortable I probably
wouldn't really wear them out although
the clear ones very hard to see so if
you are doing like a top knot bun these
are actually really good to use but i
like to use these at home and i'm just
kind of scruffy i want to tie my hair up
there so easy i like that when you put
them around your wrist they're not
painful because normal hair bands i find
really dig in the only problem with
these is once you've used them twice
they do kind of stretch like as you can
see this one's a bit more stretch than
this and if you tie them run three times
which is what i need to do to keep my
hair in place they really do stretch but
use them a couple of times i think
they're really cute you get about three
or four in a little box i cant rember
how much they are i will put all the
details in the description box below but
i really like these and they come in so
many different fun colors as you would
have seen in my vlog when i'm at
Selfridges and in my last monthly makeup
routine I used this new brush from rmk
their brushes come in these little
plastic cases might as very dirty but
it's really helpful for keeping your
brush in good condition and I'm really
grateful that it comes with the case
this is the cheek brush and it is
amazing I was going to buy the suku one
but i ended up getting this because it's
a lot more affordable and apparently
they're owned by the same company
anyway so I'm sure they're pretty much
the same I love how the RM k brushes are
very short so they're really good for
traveling even if you're not traveling
actually I just think it's nicer to have
a small handle and it's nicer to store
it's matte black some actually but it is
black as you can see the brush is
slightly tapered it's like flatter on
one side and wider on the other tape it
slightly at the top it's just so soft
I've been using this for powder you can
use it for blusher bronzer highlighter I
haven't washed it yet I'm kind of a bit
scared to I'm sure it or wash well just
be really careful when you wash
expensive brushes well this was about 30
pounds Ashley so it's probably up there
with like the Bobby Brown brushes which
are similar price and actually I think
this one is a lot softer it might be
goat hair or something I'm really sorry
to any kind of vegetarians out there but
it is very soft the next favorite is
from first aid Beauty I've been trying
out loads of their stuff recently you
guys know I like the exfoliating pads
there's an eye balm I'm really enjoying
at the moment as well but this is also
up there on my favorites list and it's
the first aid Beauty ultra Repair lip
therapy it's their little lip balm I
really appreciate this in a little tube
like this I just much prefer lip balms
when they're in a tube then when they're
in a pot cuz I with get it in my nails
it's very irritating oh this has pink
lipstick on it and now it's on my nose
this smells really minty and fresh and I
find that when you put it on it is a
little bit kind of zinging on the lips
I've has such sore lips recently I don't
know why it keeps coming back the same
lip thing again and again but this has
been really soothing I've been applying
it pretty much all day and in the
evening before I go to bed it's like a
barmy cream it's not too slippy silicone
II it's definitely not like Vaseline
it's more like a cream yeah it says
petroleum free actually which i think is
really important in lip balm so I would
definitely recommend this and I think at
first aid Beauty on a feel unique which
is free delivery worldwide the last
beauty favorite before I talk about my
handbag is from Max Factor and this is
one of their oh I don't know what these
are called there some kind of bomb it's
like a lip battery type thing and this
is in refined Rose I also use this in
that get ready with me and I really
really like it i've used up quite a lot
this already is quite a small amount of
products but i have just been loving
this for a daytime lip I'm not wearing
it today i'm wearing max syrup but it is
quite some
it's just a very easy lip balm this is a
really good deep for the clarins into
the light lip balm version so not the
gloss Pat the bomb that pretty much
looks like same packaging they're very
very similar sheer easy to apply but
also have a good color on them as well
and this rose is just a really easy
everyday pink okay so let's talk about
my handbag I really wanted a new handbag
for ages I wasn't fussed about what kind
of brand I didn't really have a brand in
mind I just knew I wanted a date I me
but smart maybe crossbody I have my
Chloe bag which is like a big shoulder
bag and then i have my rock sack i don't
really have anything else or anything in
between i was actually looking more
around the michael kors price range i
started with the high street obviously
but i couldn't find anything i liked and
then I thought I'd kind of up my budget
a bit but at that kind of 200-300 price
range it's really hard to find stuff i
looked at brands like tzadik and
Voltaire and I looked in Reese I
literally looked for months and months
and I definitely didn't want to spend
over like a thousand I mean I don't want
to spend a thousand pounds for that to
me I couldn't spend over that so I just
looked and I looked in Selfridges and I
looked in liberties and I tried all
those a different stars I kept finding
bags that I loved but they're just too
expensive for me I eventually found this
one which is from Sophie whom and I only
know the brand because anna has a
handbag from them and another lady that
I met once had a really nice bag other
than that I didn't know much about the
brand oh this reminds me actually the
bag I really wanted to get was from
mansur gavriel I think that's how you
pronounce it but it's the sort of brand
because the bags are about 300 pounds
which if you're not a bad person this
all may sound crazy to you but it's
quite affordable for that kind of bag
because it's real leather and it's
amazing quality but they literally come
into stock and sell out straight away
and it was kind of driving me mad I kept
missing it so I found this one from
Sophie home and I will show proper
cutaways of it etc it is a bucket bag is
leather and it's black and I know
another black bag so boring I wish I was
a sort of person that could buy an
electric blue bag but when i'm investing
a lot of money in a bag I just feel like
it should be something that I will wear
forever won't go out of fashion if I was
buying a new handbag every month it
would be different but this is like my
one big purchase of the year so I
to get something that I'd wear for a
long time and I wouldn't get bored of
and would go with every outfit I got a
bit of a discount on this it's fun
liberties because it was a display one
they didn't have any others left but it
wasn't actually anything wrong with it
so I don't mind having the display 1 i'm
definitely not precious about bags like
this it was a lot of money i think after
the discount it came to about 600 which
is a lot of money and I see feel a bit
sick thinking about it but rich was with
me and he was enabling me and you know
when your boyfriend convinces you to buy
something you think I really should get
it this is never gonna happen again I'm
not precious about than though it's
gonna get scratched it's smooth leather
it's not textured like my Chloe one
which is a little bit of a shame because
it is getting it scratch but then I feel
like I just need to do with that it's
gonna get scratched it'll look good it
will look worn I'm fine with that so let
me talk you through the bag it is a
bucket by it has a top handle and has a
long handle which is adjustable there's
like six different settings there it's
black with gold hardware I really like
the size it is quite big but when it's
it's it doesn't feel too big there are
pros and cons of the bag mainly pros the
pros are I really like how the strap is
attached with metal so it won't tear if
this strap was attached straight into
the bag then I'd be worried at the
stitching would come out but this I feel
like it's really strong and secure and
it's like never going to break I like
that there are many different ways to
wear it you can wear it with the long
strap on your shoulder just hanging down
you can wear it a crossbody with a strap
a little bit longer or you can hold it
by the top handle either like on the
crook of your arm is that what it's
called or just kind of hold it down low
beside you one of the cons is that it is
a little bit open it doesn't close
securely so if you do live in a city
like London I like to just keep the
scarf on the top of my bag so it's not
so easy to access and this is the little
kind of drawstring that does it up and I
have noticed that mine looks like it's
kind of the stitches coming apart a
little bit was obviously if you're
pulling it close all the time it's going
to start to open up so I'm going to go
back to liberties and ask them about
that and what happens if it does kind of
break so that's probably the only thing
I would have changed on the design may
be made that bit metal so it doesn't
break but i really really love this bag
I just think it's a really good
investment and it's definitely a
favorite for me this month I'm sure
you're going to be seeing it a lot when
I buy a bag that's it that's my bag so
you'll be seeing it in lots of outfits
hopefully that was helpful to anyone
who's interested in that bag I don't
really do bag reviews although I'm
obsessed with watching bag review
on youtube if you haven't watched any
type handbag reviews in to youtube they
are addictive so those are all my
favorites from April I hope you guys
enjoyed watching this video I will see
you on Tuesday for a new vlog and then
Thursday for a disappointed product
video I'm going to film that now I'm
going from favorites too disappointed
stray off to the other so if you see me
with the same hair again on Thursday you
know why see you guys then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
