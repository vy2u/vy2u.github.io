favorites and I feel like it's quite a
random selection of products this month
but that's because I've been buying
loads of new things and trying loads of
new things so I feel like next month's
favorites are going to have loads of new
stuff in it but for now it's just stuff
that I've been loving through April
first of all I'm going to talk about
skincare and I've been loving using
these two products together in the
morning so they're both from indeed labs
which is a brand that I think gets a bit
overlooked it's quite expensive for what
it looks like so it comes in really
plain white little packaging and they
sell in Boots and I think it's just a
really amazing brand but I can see why
some people might kind of overlook it
because it's quite expensive for what it
looks like but that's just because the
products are really really good so the
first product I've been using is pepped
bright and this is mainly to heal any
sort of scarring and just brighten your
skin overall I don't really have much to
gory and I've got a few bits here and
there but in general sometimes I feel
like my skin can look a bit dull so I've
been using this first and this is like a
cream so I just put a little bit this
into my hand and apply it all over my
face and then I follow up with Hydra
luan which is a serum and this has
hyaluronic acid in it so it's really
good for hydration and it's just like a
clear kind of gel consistency and I just
put this all over after I've applied the
pepto brights this doesn't feel that
nice on the skin it kind of feels a
little bit tacky but that's because
you're supposed to put your moisturizer
on afterwards and it kind of helps to
moisturize a stick so it's pepper bright
then Hydra Lauren and then your daily
moisturizer and I just feel like that's
been working really well for me recently
I'm really glad I've got loads of
backups of Hydra neuron because I use
this all the time and I really really
like it so yeah those together have been
working really well for me I've also got
a new strange obsession with neck creams
I know that sounds really weird I have
this theory that when you get older even
if your face looks nice and fresh if
your neck looks old but just completely
shows your age and I've seen it on other
women where their face looks young and
fresh and they have this sort of wrinkly
turkey neck and it's just awful and I'm
so scared of that happening to me so
I've been loving using this Clarins
advanced extra firming neck cream
recently and this is the sample size
that Clarence gave me but I'm definitely
going to repurchase the full size when I
run out even if it doesn't end up
working it's worth taking a chance just
in case
does work but it feels really nice and
you can also just use your skincare
routine on your neck you should do
anyway but I like to use this the last
step in my evening skincare routine I
just use a little bit of this cream onto
my hand and then I just rub my neck
upwards and apply it all over my neck
and this area that I can't pronounce
it's some fancy French word but I just
really like this it feels really nice
and refreshing and it's nice to have it
in your routine it's worth spending
money on it just in case it works
because then you'll have a nice young
looking neck when you're old next up a
candles and you guys know I absolutely
love my candles and these are my
favorite too from April and first one is
from Anthropologie I'm a huge fan of
anthropology but their clothes are
really expensive so I often go in
looking for home where stationery and
especially candles whoever is their
buyer for candles is so good at their
job because they have just a really nice
selection of candles you don't really
see anywhere else
so I go around kind of sniffing them all
finding my favorites and I saw this one
and it's avocado mint natural soy wax
candle and I've never heard of a scent
like avocado and mint for a candle it's
really kind of unique and different and
I really really like it it's really
fresh and you could definitely smell the
mint more than that avocado I'm not even
sure if avocados has a sense oh it
smells very minty but very like savory
and edible not at all sweet but whenever
someone walks into the room and I'm
burning this they always comment on it
and it comes in this kind of cool like
baked bean style tin which I really like
with a little lid and I'm only kind of
halfway through this one I've been
burning it for ages so definitely good
quality wax that lasts a long time and
I'd really recommend the candles man
apology I love them the next one is
quite exciting for me and it's the Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works market peach candle and
I've heard so much about this I've heard
so many American youtubers talk about
this candle but annoyingly we don't get
bath or body works in the UK I really
wish they'd come my best friend lives in
New York so I asked her to pick one up
for me she couldn't bring me back for
the big three wick candle because
they're so heavy she got me this little
jar which I actually really like I've
never seen this size before comes with a
little lid you unscrew and then it's an
acute love job which will come in handy
when it's finished so I thought this
would be really really sweet and I
didn't think I was gonna like it I just
really wanted to try it for myself and
when I smelt it as soon as I started
like the most gorgeous scent it's really
fruity but it's not too sweet and
overpowering it's just so lovely and I
was worried because a few other bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candles that I've tried they
smell really nice when you sniff them
but when you burn them they don't really
do much so I thought this was going to
be the same because my started Bernie
and I couldn't really smell it in the
room after it started burning properly
in the wax will melted down it really
filled the room with this amazing kind
of peachy scent and I really really like
this so if you're in America I
definitely recommend picking up one of
these and if you're not I don't know try
and get a friend to bring one back like
I did I thought what I can really
recommend but I really really like the
market peach I'm sad I'm gonna finish it
next up is makeup and I have a few
products here to talk to you about the
first one is a primer and I've been
loving this all month I've used it every
single day without fail and it's the
doctor luring skin perfect anti-aging
primer I feel like dr. luhan's is such
an underrated brand everything I've
tried for them is so good but I don't
really hear people talk about them that
often trying a highlighter at the moment
I really like their nail products are
really good and I think they have a new
foundation as well which I haven't tried
yet but I've heard it's very good so
this is the primer I think with primers
you're either a water-based primer lover
or a silicon-based primer so water base
is more like a Laura Mercier one and
silicone base is more like the benefit
Porefessional and I'm definitely more of
the water based primer person but
sometimes water-based primers aren't
that good at sort of keeping makeup stay
all day but the silicone ones just feel
too slippy and greasy for me so I really
like this one because it's kind of a mix
of both so I'd really recommend this if
you're not sure about the water-based
primers you're not sure about silicone
base because this is a real mix when you
put it on it feels really fresh like a
water-based primer it's really easy to
spread it around doesn't feel greasy at
all but it still has that kind of silky
texture that silicone based primer has
so it really smooths out your face like
what primers are supposed to do which is
means it's really good for applying your
makeup on top and I really like this it
comes in a really handy pump and I just
squeeze one pump with it's enough for my
whole face and yeah I just really think
this is a really good primer the next
product is a clear brow gel and this is
from blink I've been on the hunt for a
good clear brow gel for a good few
months now everyone I tried seemed to
make my eyebrows too crispy or leave
white bits in them and I just couldn't
find a good one I don't know why I
didn't go too
sooner because I've been getting my
eyebrows rented a blink for years so I
don't know why I didn't go there it
wasn't cheap was about 17 pounds maybe a
cop I'll put the link below I can't
remember but it wasn't cheap but I'm
happy to spend a bit more if it's a good
product that works makes I use these
every day I don't fill in my brows I
just use a clear brow gel so this is a
really good one it holds them in place
doesn't mean crispy doesn't leave white
bits in them the only annoying thing is
that it comes in clear packaging so it
kind of gets a bit grubby but because I
didn't use eye pencils it won't get that
dirty yeah really been loving this use
it every day and I'll definitely keep
repurchasing it because I found the one
that I like now next up is a mac
eyeshadow and I did a blog post on this
so I'll link that below and it's Mac
patina I did a blog post talking about
how I use this and satin taupe together
because they're a really nice mix of
eyeshadows I really love patina I don't
know if it's like one of them most
popular ones I don't really hear people
talking about it that often
I saw pixie we use this in a wedding
makeup tutorial a year ago or a couple
years ago and I just wanted it straight
away it's beautiful it's just a really
easy everyday eyeshadow to wear it's
kind of like a frosty bronzy taupe and
it's not too kind of pigmented so you
can kind of wash it all over your lids
and it still look really natural but
just a really nice color I can't explain
I just really really love it so
definitely go and have a little swatch
of that if you're near a Mac counter
because it's a very pretty eyeshadow
shade next up is a nail polish and I'm
wearing this now I've been wearing it
like all month every time I going to
repaint my nails I just want to use this
color again which is very unlike me
it's the bourgeois Solak glossy in a man
to feel and it's a mint green I really
love this I actually think I prefer it
to se mint candy apple which is a big
statement for me because that's one of
my all-time favorite nail polishes but
this ones are more of a green mint
rather than like a bluey mint and I just
really like it
the quality is really good they last
like I've had this on for four days
haven't shipped and the brush is really
nice it's really easy to apply and I
just love this color I'm completely
addicted to it and I know I'll be
wearing it throughout spring so I
definitely recommend this one which is
out now I think in boots and Superdrug
so it's a hand cream it's the Antipodes
joyful hand and body cream I don't
really use body cream so I just mean
this is a hand cream I keep on my desk
and I've just been reaching for it all
day throughout the day it's really
really lovely it comes in this huge like
metal tube so it's going to last for
ages I really like this because the
scent is really it kind of reminds me of
actually reminds me of Joey Malone black
brand face if you like that perfume
you're definitely like this good this
also has black currant in it it's got
black currant and hibiscus flower the
german-owned Black Moon Bay is a very
similar sensor this really reminds me of
that and it just smells like a expensive
kind of perfume scent so I really like
this it's not kind of sticky or tacky
robson really nicely it's very luxurious
and yeah I really really like this my
memory so my final favorite before I
finish has been sitting down by my feet
throughout this video and no it's not a
puppy
everyone's getting puppies I wish I
might be getting the kitten but not yet
it's my new handbag and it's a Michael
Kors Selma bag and I am so excited to
have this I've never had like a designer
bag before and I've always kind of
wanted one but they're just all so
expensive so as soon as I saw this one
and the price tag I knew it was more in
my price range and I actually got my
friend Keisha to bring it back from
America because it was about fifty
pounds cheaper there which is quite good
I think so I got it in Navy in the end
because I thought Navy works all season
summer winter and also works day and
night and I've already got a black bag
so I don't need another black one so
yeah I'm really happy I got a navy
definitely happy with that I'm not
really bothered about the whole navy and
black thing anymore when I was younger I
was like never wear navy and black it
clashes but I really don't care about
that now see I really like it looks like
this is very hard and structured so it
kind of sits and it doesn't flop about
which I really like it's scratch proof I
think the guy said I didn't really have
to protect the leather it's not like
soft leather it has the no micro cause
there in the front it's got short
handles so it's one that you kind of
hold under your arm and it's also got a
long strap so you can't put it over your
shoulder and it's not too long that it
like doesn't hang too low when you hold
it so I like that yeah it's just got a
big slip and nice compartment through
the side it's smaller than my Zara
office city bag whatever it's called
which I like that is a really big bag
this is a more like an everyday bag so
yeah I'm really really happy with it I'm
so glad I've got it and I've just used
it everyday since I got it I said I'd
use it especially
Asians but I haven't I've used it every
single bear can't bear to be without it
so yeah really happy with and that's all
my April favorites so I hope you like
seeing them and please like this video
if you did and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
