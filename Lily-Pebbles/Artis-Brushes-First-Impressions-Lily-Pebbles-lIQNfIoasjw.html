really well thank you for watching all
my videos so far this month if you feel
like you're missing any I've made a
playlist for this year's everyday May so
click the I button if you want to check
out the playlist and it's a good way of
keeping up to date with all the videos
I'm uploading this month today's video
is gonna be a first impressions video
and it's a really exciting one because
it's one of those new products that's
coming to the market everyone's a bit
excited about unsure about quite
judgmental and opinionated about so
today's video is gonna be on the artist
brushes I'm so so lucky and I got to
meet with the founder of the brand and
he actually gave me the entire set so I
thought I'm so lucky to have this
opportunity it's so rare to be given an
entire set of a product like this so I
really wanted to make a video for you
guys our first impressions it's not
sponsored at all but it's just something
I thought you guys would enjoy if you
haven't heard of the artist brushes
already they're exclusively sold in
space and K in the UK and it's a
completely new way of applying makeup
let's get the factual bit out the way
there are 10 brushes in the entire set
you can buy them individually or as a
set they start from 25 pounds and go all
the way up to 55 so they're definitely
more of a high-end thing they're for
makeup artists and consumers but
definitely for makeup fanatics it's an
investment and definitely not something
for beginners because they are that bit
more expensive I met with the founder
whose name is Matthew and I'm not gonna
lie before the meeting I was very
skeptical about this I love makeup
brushes I feel like I've had enough
practice in my day-to-day routine that I
know how to apply my makeup and I didn't
really feel like there needed to be
anything changed I love spending ages
applying my makeup I feel like I've
learned all the tips and tricks on how
to hold my brushes to get the right
application I feel really comfortable
with my routine and so I was very
skeptical before the meeting but I
wanted to go in open-minded to hear what
he had to say and why he felt like this
was needed in the industry Matthew is
actually a former Mac senior executive
he was a makeup artist who ended up
working for Mac he was there when it was
privately owned and then when it got
taken over by Estee Lauder she's very
very experienced in the industry he was
talking to me about how he feels like
makeup has evolved so much over the
years so many new inventions and
creations and new ways of doing your
makeup but that the makeup tools the
brushes themself have never really
changed different handle
as having bought out maybe different
hairs but the style of the brushes
hasn't changed that he thought that it
was necessary for them to evolve the
shapes of his brushes take inspiration
from how he naturally would paint a face
how he would do makeup using circles
lines oval shapes on the face the way he
explained it to me is that if you took a
cream eyeshadow pot you wouldn't stick
your finger in it directly and then
stick it on your eye like that and
that's nice that's kind of what on a
standard makeup brush is like it's
straight on or as his are to the side
and he said if you naturally put out you
do it from the side and then you'd go
like this so it's trying to just enhance
natural way that you would do your
makeup and that's what I got really
interested because it's so right if you
used your hands everything would be like
from the side like this you wouldn't be
going like this to put on your
foundation and your eyeshadow so that to
me is when it kind of clicked and I
thought yeah you're actually really
right that is way more natural but
obviously we're also used to using our
brushes how we do that we now use our
brushes from the side even though
they're like that and we found ways of
working around it so something like this
that is so new it's gonna take a lot of
getting used to and I know that I
definitely need practice using these
brushes and I'm sure that I will fall
more in love with them as I get used to
using them so bear that in mind when
watching today's first impressions it is
my first time ever using a brush like
this so it's gonna feel weird and
different he calls this state of the art
multi-purpose brushes and they're
definitely multi-purpose each brush can
be used for very different things and
for more than one thing the bristles
themselves are called kozma fiber it's a
trademark that the brand has and they
are literally made up of thousands
hundreds of thousands of hairs then
they're not animal hairs this is all
kind of animal cruelty free but they're
so incredibly soft and densely packed
seriously you need to fill these things
they are so so soft
feel like I haven't really introduced
what I'm talking about properly and if
you back up a little bit this is what
the the collection looks like here so
this is the whole set of brushes I've
turned them all around in the box so we
can kind of see what they look like
better but I'll go through each brush
individually in a moment taking the big
one as an example to hold while talking
through them they are so so soft this
brush has hundreds of thousands of cosmo
fiber hairs in them it has three to ten
times more hair
than a normal makeup brush would have
which is why these are supposed to have
a much more uniform application than a
normal brush let me go through each
brush and then I will talk you through
the example that he showed me on why
these brushes are so much better than a
normal makeup brush starting from the
smallest to the biggest the circle one
brush is the smallest brush this brush
would be great for lip products or for
small concealing it's round but with
quite a hard edge to it
Circle one our brush would be great for
your eyelid crease or the inner corners
of the eye can see Linux and the
nostrils or spot concealing as well this
is a small circular brush but with a
rounded edge the linear one is the
smallest linear brush this would be
great for the lash line
or to fill in and define brows it would
be great for the lower lash line and a
lot of these brushes are also used for
special effects makeup the Lee neo 3 is
quite a bit longer this would be great
for the upper or lower lash line and
again for special effects makeup the
linear six is even longer but a very
similar shape to the linear three again
would be great for that upper or lower
lash line and probably best used for
special effects makeup the oval 3 is a
shading or blending brush for the eyelid
this can be also used for foundation in
smaller areas or for concealer around
the eye around the nose but for smaller
areas over 4 is slightly bigger this
would be great just for the center of
the eyelid this one is also great for
concealing under the eye for all for
highlighting on the brow bone
over 6 again slightly bigger this one
could be used on the eyelid but it's
also great for Foundation and smaller
areas for concealer or for contouring or
for blush this is probably the most
multi-use brush that out of all of them
the oval 8 is quite large this one is
great for foundation or / setting powder
it can also be used for bronzer or
highlighter oval 10 is the biggest brush
in the set and this one is mainly used
for body coverage it can also be used
for setting powder the powder foundation
or for shimmer to the shoulders or chest
area so when Matthew was showing me an
example of how this is different to a
makeup brush or makeup sponge because I
think he could see on my face that I was
a bit like really the brushes need to be
changed I'm not sure sure
he took a black piece of paper and he
had kind of three circles on it and he
took some liquid foundation and he
applied it with a normal buffing brush
applied it with a sponge and then he
applied it with this and I could
literally see in front of my eyes the
difference the sponge left a really
weird kind of dotted coverage it was
very dotty and spotted you could see
that most the foundation was in the
sponge itself with the buffing brush it
was a bit more even but definitely not
completely even there were places where
it was really sheer places where the
coverage was heavier and it wasn't even
a tool and then he used this and I'm not
joking the entire black circle was
filled with an even amount of foundation
and that kind of blew my mind of it the
next example he gave was with I think
one of the eyeshadow brushes like one of
these and he used a standard eyeshadow
brush and took some black eyeshadow
swiped it in a line and it was really
full-coverage at the beginning and then
very quickly faded out
whereas when he used this one in one
long swipe it was complete even coverage
from the beginning of the swipe to the
end again it blew my mind so it was at
that point I got really excited and kind
of understood the point of these brushes
it's an even coverage and that's what
you want from your products that's what
you want from your foundation and it's
not that it gives a fuller coverage is
that it gives the exact amount of
coverage to that foundation or product
is supposed to give often when we use
makeup brushes or sponges it's maybe
taking away coverage that is originally
there in the products if that makes
sense something else that I was really
interested in is the way you clean these
brushes you buy this little mat and
after you use the product Matthew said
most the product sits on the edge of the
hairs and doesn't go that deep in so you
just take it on this mat and you swipe
it like this and it's instantly clean
and I've tried it with black eyeshadow
I've used black eyeshadow I've swiped it
on here and then I put it on my hand and
is absolutely no product on there so
that's really nice I like you can just
keep kind of cleaning your brushes as
you go you don't necessarily have to do
a deep clean he said if you want to you
can there's like a foam you can buy or
you can use a normal brush cleanser but
you shouldn't need to wash them that
often which is amazing so let's get
started with what you're all here for
and it's the first impressions video
I've done my makeup that you can see now
and as I said please bear in mind is the
first time I've used these I'm
definitely gonna keep practicing and I
know that it will get easier as I use
them more but breaking a habit that
you've been using for over 10 years is
hard but I love the idea of these and I
think it really does
make sense I was very skeptical at first
but I'm really interested now I'm quite
excited about these brushes so I hope
you enjoy the first impressions part
this video and now you're gonna see me
with no makeup I'm gonna start by using
the oval-8 brush which is the second to
largest one and I'm gonna use this for
my foundation I'm gonna try my wire
style to shake lat foundation so I'm
gonna apply it with my finger like I
usually do I love the smell of this
foundation that's normally how much
foundation I would put on my skin
okay then using the brush I'm gonna do
long swiping motions this is definitely
gonna take a bit of practice it's
completely unnatural for me just because
I'm so used to buffing brush or a sponge
so let's see what happens it says not to
lift the brush off the face and to just
swipe instead feels so incredibly soft
on the skin so it's all pretty much
blend it in there let me just do a bit
of my forehead as well I don't love the
action of going back and forth it feels
a little bit messy I prefer to kind of
lift my brush and do it like this which
they say you're not supposed to do but
I'm sure you can adapt it to what feels
comfortable to you okay so my very very
first impression is that it blends in
really really quickly and it does look
like it's got an even application I'm
gonna do the other side of the face I'm
kind of even it all out okay so I'm just
doing long swiping motions
it feels so bizarre to be putting on
foundation like this oh it's very good
for like blending out from the chin down
cuz I normally find that bit quite hard
to do okay I'd say that is all blended
in it's very quick to blend and it gives
a really nice even finish actually the
foundation is pretty much undetectable
on the skin and I normally can really
see foundation around here this is quite
a light coverage foundation but I think
that's really nice actually I'm just
gonna keep going before I do I'm gonna
white put the brush onto the mat as it
says to do and that just takes the
product out of the brush one thing to
note is the white handles I've already
made very grubby full of foundation
because I had foundation on my finger
yeah that's definitely gonna get grubby
I'm gonna take my concealer and the oval
six brush which is the third down I'm
gonna apply my concealer like I usually
do under my eyes around my nose and on
my chin there are a few different
brushes you can use for concealer so I'm
just gonna start by using this one under
the eye and I'm just gonna swipe that
back and forth underneath the eye it
feels very gentle on the eye area which
I like no that's pretty much blended and
it's not really creasing that much which
usually my concealer is quite greasy
under my eye that actually looks really
nice and smooth let me do the other side
it's quite hard to get the inner corner
of the eye with this brush so I'm going
to take again I've made that brush
really grubby with concealer I'm gonna
get the circle one hour brush which is
the second smallest and just use that
and inner corner of the eye that's
really nice actually that's blending out
really well through around the nose and
down the nose and on the chin emitted
oval for which is a bit smaller than the
one I was using before and I'm gonna
take that down the center of the nose
well this one would be great for
contouring the nose take that to the
sides of the nose and also on the chin
it doesn't feel that strange to hold the
brush I thought it would feel more weak
but it actually really does feel very
natural to be going in this direction
because I would anyway does feel a bit
like I'm brushing my teeth I'm gonna
take a tiny bit more concealer I usually
do this anyway
like a second layer just where I get
dark and I'm gonna use this brush I'm
trying so hard not to take my brush off
the skin because that's something that
the founder Matthew said you shouldn't
really do and that people got into the
habit of doing okay that's all looking
really great really nice kind of lights
based very smooth I'm gonna go on to
powder products now which I'm a little
bit scared of because I know that with
these brushes that liquid and creams are
going to be great for some reason my
comedy get my head around and working
with powder so I'm gonna go in next with
my bronzer which I've been holding here
is a mirror and I'm gonna go back to the
larger brush which is the oval eight
this is the one I used for foundation
I'm gonna swirl it around in the product
oh this feels so weird and then we have
to tap it off a bit and now I'm going to
try bronzing with it because it's so
dense it does feel a bit like I could be
moving the foundation around I don't
know whether I am but it does feel like
I could be it has applied my bronzer
though and it does look pretty even let
me try the other side
to be honest I'm not sure if I love this
way of applying bronzer I prefer to have
more of a kind of blend II light-handed
action I do with a normal powder brush
this feels a little bit too dense I
don't want to keep going over that case
it's moving my foundation so I do feel
like I'm wearing a little bit less
bronzer than I normally would not 100%
sold on using them for bronzer really
like the foundation and concealer
bronzer not so sure so I'm gonna keep
going with the powder products and I'm
gonna try blusher and highlighter now
I'm gonna use that same brush for
blusher because the one that's smaller I
feels like it's a little bit too small
it's gonna take a little bit on the
brush and then apply it oh that's not
good no to blend that out maybe I should
have used the smaller brush okay I'm
going to try the smaller brush for the
other side this is the oval six let's
just try to blend that out a bit
okay I'm not so sure about that it's
definitely applying it quite patchy
again I don't know if I'm doing it wrong
this is all very new to me and try not
to take the brush off the skin it
doesn't feel as light-handed is using a
normal powder brush and now I feel like
it's bit uneven hmm I'm gonna leave that
there not massive fan of using it for
powder blusher either again I feel like
it would be so good for cream products
I'm going to use that same brush and
apply some highlighter dabbing that I'm
really lightly going back and forth on
the tops of my cheekbones that's really
nice that feels very natural to do that
action for the tops of the cheekbones
it's applying the highlighter very
nicely that one worked out very well
each time I'm using the brush I'm just
swiping it on the map afterwards to
clean with the product off okay so let's
move on to eyeshadow I'm gonna try and
just do what normal eyes shadow I
normally would do I'm gonna start by
using that oval four and I'm taking my
Mac all that glitters which is a nice
kind of all over the lid color putting
products on the brush and then just
tapping it off and I'm gonna apply that
back and forth on the lid I went on very
quickly I would say that I got a bit
more product on the inside then I would
have normally put just because I feel
like with a normal brush you focus it
more on the outer part of the eye but
this kind of goes all over but that
applied very nicely
claim just gonna do the same on the
other side this side you've got to get
your hand in the right position
it still feels comfortable okay so that
was really nice a really even
application all over the lid as promised
I'm gonna take the slightly smaller oval
three brush now and take a matte color
and try and focus this in the crease
definitely doesn't feel like it's taking
any of the color off from the base
shadow it's a nice shape for the crease
again it's just getting used to a
different method that I'm really not
used to I personally love using a
blending brush to blend out the edges
that see what happens if I go back in
with the the clean slightly bigger brush
to blend yeah that blends really nicely
and unlike a normal blending brush that
could sometimes take the product off
this isn't taking it off it's just kind
of blending it out of it I'm gonna take
the linear one to do the lash line and
underneath the eye as well so for
underneath the eye I'm going to use a
matte Brown that's Lots in really nicely
under the eye I'm doing that thing where
I'm gonna going back and forth with
these brushes you can just do one swipe
I need to kind of get into the habit of
doing that just feels a bit strange to
be doing it from the side because for
this one I would do it straight on okay
that looks nice I'm gonna use the same
brush and take a dark matte Brown and
I'm gonna do a liner for this I'm gonna
try and do this in one swipe thing only
go from that way and then that way okay
that was nice as a first attempt I'm
gonna go the other way as well I mean
that as technically applied align really
nicely on my upper lash line if you're
not great at eyeliner that was actually
pretty easy I'm gonna try and flick it
out a little bit it definitely applies
an even amount you don't have to kind of
put on more eyeshadow halfway through
and find it quite hard to do this eye I
usually do find it quite hard but I
wouldn't say there's a perfectly even
but I'm going to
therefore now if you would like to do an
inner corner highlight the circle 1r
would be great for that I'm going to
take a little bit of this kind of
highlight color that is the perfect size
for inner corner highlight you literally
just have to dab it perfect size that
one okay I'm just applying some mascara
okay now I'm going to try using the
circle one brush which is a circular
brush with quite a hard edge and I'm
going to apply a matte lipstick using
that I don't tend to really use lip
brushes that much but for the purpose of
this video I'm going to try it out this
is just a matte charlotte tilbury
lipstick so I'm gonna cover the brush in
that I'm gonna start with the bottom
okay I think I might need to take more
products than that because it didn't
really come out that much that's quite
nice but I'd say it doesn't give that
much coverage actually because I'm
putting quite a lot of lipstick onto
this brush it's like pretty much covered
it's not really translating onto the
lips feels nice to use and it's giving a
nice subtle lip definitely a nice shape
for getting around the lips I like the
shape so I think technically that's all
my makeup done naturally so I definitely
think these brushes are really
interesting and exciting I'd say there
are four brushes that are my top picks
from the entire set the oval-8 which I
use for foundation I think it makes such
a difference to the application of my
foundation and this is probably my top
pick from the entire set if you're gonna
invest over 6 because you can use this
for so many different things the
concealer
contour highlighter probably a bit of
eyeshadow blending as well this is a
really nice size brush I also love the
oval for because this is great just for
eyeshadow applying all over the lid one
quick swipe so easy and quick in the
morning and then I really like the
circle 1r which is the more rounded of
the small circle brushes this is great
for the inner corner of the eye for spot
concealing for eyeshadow in the crease
such a multi-purpose brush these for
definitely my top picks from the
collection so hope you guys enjoyed my
