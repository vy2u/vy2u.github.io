video I feel like I haven't filmed in
ages because my past few videos were pre
filmed and scheduled to go up so it
feels a little bit weird right now but
it's nice to be back and I'm excited to
show you some of my favourite products
from August all this has been a really
nice month the weather's been amazing
and I got to go to summer in the city
which was so nice I met loads of people
who read my blog and watch my videos so
thank you if one of them was you it was
really nice to me everyone and I met
loads of cool youtubers as well some who
I already knew and some who I've wanted
to meet for a while so it was a really
nice day I'm going to show you some of
the products that I've been loving this
month so the first product is a nail
polish and surprise surprise it's a blue
I love blue nail polish this one's from
butter LONDON and it's called pool and
it's part of their new summer collection
I think and it's just a really nice blue
color slightly darker than Essie mint
candy apple a little bit more
sophisticated less kind of pasta Lea and
I really like it I love the formula of
butter LONDON polishes they're really
good and they have these kind of
separate lids and then a smaller lid
here and a nice size brush it's not that
wide but it's really easy to use the
next product is for hair and it's the
L'Oreal ever riche conditioner for very
dry rebellious hair there's one for kind
of normal to fine hair and one for very
dry hair which is what I have and I
bought this over a month ago I think I
put an Instagram picture up saying that
I was gonna test it out and I have been
loving it it's gonna last me for ages
this is a huge bottle and as you can see
I haven't even used that much of it the
first time I used this I was washing my
hair over the bath and I didn't rinse
out properly and my hair was felt really
greasy and I thought maybe it's just too
heavy of a conditioner for my hair but
then I tried it again in the shower
washed it all up properly and my hair
felt amazing it really really is
conditioning so don't get the very dry
rebellious hair one unless you really
have that kind of hair because it's a
very heavy conditioner but it's so good
it makes my hair feel really soft and
conditioned and I kind of like the smell
it smells a bit like men's aftershave
yeah it's kind of strange but I like it
and I like the packaging as well I don't
think when I get the shampoo as well
because I've been using a bumble and
bumble shampoo that I really like but
this goes really well with it and I'm
really happy with it and lipstick I've
been loving this month is the Rimmel I
think it's called moisture and new this
collection it's the ones
the purple and it's called Notting Hill
nude and this is the most gorgeous nude
lipstick ever it's the perfect nude for
me I always find nude lipsticks are a
little bit too pale for me make me look
a bit dead and then I don't want one
that's too Brown this is kind of a nice
pinky nude and I actually did a blog
post on this because it's a perfect dupe
for Tom Ford Spanish pink which is one
of my favorite Tom Ford lipsticks and
they pretty much as actually the same I
really like this they're really
moisturizing I think I'm gonna go and
see what other colors they have in this
range actually because the only one I
have and I really like it but I've been
wearing this a lot this month whenever I
wear a smoky eye I like to have a nude
lip and the song works really well with
a smoky eye the next product is a tinted
moisturizer and it's the Laura Mercier
oil-free tinted moisturizer and I've got
the color nude I had the original
version of this for years and I quite
liked it but I wasn't kind of blown away
by it and Anna from fel does makeup it's
always loved this and I just thought the
only difference was that this is oil
free so people with oily skin get this
one and I don't have all these skin so I
never picked it up but I was in space
and Kay and I asked the lady what the
difference is and she said this one
actually has more coverage than the
original which is what I didn't really
like about the original it's slightly
too sheer for me so I picked this one up
and I loved it I'm so obsessed it's got
the perfect amount of coverage it's just
like a foundation it kind of reminds me
of my origins plant scription foundation
which I love so I've been using this
with my Real Techniques buffing brush
I'm wearing it today I've literally worn
it every day this month and I really
really love it it come in loads of
different shades but I think they're
kind of low on stock in space and Kate
in London at the moment I found it
pretty hard to find this but once they
stuck up again I'd really recommend
picking one of these up it's just the
best tinted moisturizer ever
I really really like it then I've got a
makeup brush and this is one of the Real
Techniques - or fiber brushes this is
the face brush and I got the duo fibre
set and I quite liked it I wasn't kind
of blown away at first but this one is
kind really handy to use of my hourglass
ambient lighting powder I think that's
what it's called something where you
want to put a really light dusting on
this works well with a setting powder if
you don't kind of get too powdery this
is just really nice I also have been
using it to blend out my blush so if I
put a bit too much blusher on
it's a lovely soft really lightweight
brush
and it's become a staple in my brush
collection really like this one
a mascara I've been using everyday this
month is the YSL babydoll mascara in
black I've had this for a while but I've
been kind of going through mascaras and
eventually got to this one and I love it
it's got a really long plastic II brush
and I get loads of lengths in my lashes
I don't get a huge amount of volume but
the length is so amazing that it's kind
of worth using it really separates the
lashes and gives loads of length and I
just really like the look that it gives
so I've been using this a lot and I
probably continue using it until I
finish and then I move on to another one
so to non-beauty favorites that I've
been loving this month the first one are
these sandals and they are from Steve
Madden I got these years ago when I was
interning at a PR office I think they
looked after Steve Madden and they let
me take these home which is very nice of
them and they are purple they've got two
straps that go around the ankle and then
down the front and meet on the side that
was the weirdest description of a sandal
ever but they're really nice and they're
really comfortable I've walked all the
way around London in these and they
haven't hurt even though they are quite
flat but they kind of seem to go with
everything I've worn them with dresses
I've worn them with black jeans and
denim jeans and yeah I love them so I've
been wearing these all month and really
happy with them and they've lasted me
years the final favourite is this little
notepad from Muji and just to turn all
my notes over and it's a little
checklist so you just get every page is
the same and it's just lines with boxes
pretty simple I picked this up from Muji
for my back to school blog post if you
didn't see that I'll link it below and
this is coming really handy I use a big
notebook for everything else but if I
just want to quickly write sign down
make sure I don't forget it I just write
it on here and then I can tick the
little box when I've done it so this is
coming very handy and I just love Muji
and everything they do so those are all
my August favorites I'm excited to go
into September it's gonna be really busy
but I am excited I'm going to France at
the beginning with my parents and rich
and then I think I'm going to New York
and then I'm coming back and it's London
Fashion Week and I'm going to be working
with L'Oreal backstage so it's gonna be
a bit mental but I'm really excited for
a busy month and thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
and I'll see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
