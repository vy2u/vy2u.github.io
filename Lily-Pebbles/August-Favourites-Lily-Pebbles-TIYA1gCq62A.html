gardener in the background and it's far
too bright but I'm gonna get on with it
anyway and this month I'm doing my
August monthly favorites and I've got
quite a nice collection of products here
actually lots of body products because
you guys know I've been like moving and
stuff I've been covered and pain and
just feeling a bit gross so I spend a
bit more time here and there on my body
making me feel extra nice and pampered I
hope it sounds alright with the mic
because to me this is like the most
echoey room ever but anyway I'm gonna
start with an old favorite and I just
saw this on my carpet and thought I feel
really bad that I haven't spoken about
this to ages because it's still my
absolute favorite like Holy Grail
cleanser is that aa skier and a sods
cleansing gel and whenever Anna and I do
our Beauty chats I always recommend this
as my like one skincare product I would
recommend buying I've nearly finished
the only annoying thing they really
should be like a clear panel on the side
so you can see but I think I've nearly
finished my second bottle it's an
amazing cleansing gel that when you rub
it into the skin it turns into an oil I
use it to take off my face makeup and my
eye makeup and it's so gentle on the
skin it smells good yeah smells really
nice and I love it I love us your as a
brand but the renascence cleansing gel
specifically is amazing another skincare
product that I've really been enjoying
this month is quite new to me it's from
a brand called skin owl and this is a
brand that's new to cult beauty I've
never heard of it before but Lex who
owns the site called Beauty introduced
me to it
Lex is amazing if you've never been on
cult Beauty I would really recommend it
because she hand-picked all the products
pretty much herself and she has such
good taste everything is really kind of
hand-picked and I know that you can
trust any products on there is going to
be good because she has such great taste
in beauty products so the Browns pulls
the skin out I don't know that much
about it but I know that the lady who
started it had really bad acne and she
was looking for more natural products to
help with her acne and this is the
beauty drops PM mangosteen now this
really appealed to me because I love
mangosteen the fruit I really like it
and the ingredients in this is literally
just organic cold-pressed African andis
and insomnia baobab oil anyway so it's
that oil and it's mangosteen oil and
it's literally there's two oils together
so there's no kind of nasties in here
at all it says you need 10 drops in the
evening I use around 6 or 7 and it's a
really good like lazy product because
you can use this alone instead of your
serum or moisturizer or oil it really
injects some hydration into my skin it
smells incredible it really smells good
smells really sweet and lovely so I've
been using this pretty much every
evening and it's made my skin feel so
good because I've been so lazy with my
skincare routine it got really kind of
dry and the texture went funny and this
has just got it back to normal if not
better so I really like this and I'm
looking forward to trying some other
things from the brand ok I've got a
couple of shower items here and first of
all shampoo and conditioner I've using
the pure ology range this is the
hydrates shampoo and conditioner these
are both sulfates and paraben free so
they're great if you've had a Brazilian
blow-dry like I've had and I really like
these are very gentle they smell kind of
minty yes I'll cut minty and fresh
really nice and kind of gentle on your
scalp and really hydrating and good for
hair if you have dry hair like me I've
also been loving this for quite a while
now I forgot to mention it in my last
month's favorites it's the original
source all-in-one moisturizing shower
pineapple and coconut oil I think Anna
mentioned this in a video and I thought
that sounds really good so I went to
pick it up I've had a really bad
experience with original source before
if any of you girls have tried the minty
one you might know what I'm talking
about I won't go there but I was a bit
nervous to try this but it's not at all
the same it's moisturizing and it feels
great on the skin and it smells like
holiday Oh smells so lovely in
pineappley so me rich have been showing
this actually weren't nearly finished
but it's actually lasted a really long
time you might remember from my la vlog
that Anna and I went into the fresh
store and I fell in love with this
fragrance which is fake and apricot I
didn't get it while I was there but now
I have it and I realized I showed my mom
and she was like that's the perfume I
used to always wear for years and years
and that's obviously why I loved it
really reminds me of my mom it's a
really different kind of fake smell
because it has the apricot in there as
well it's kind of a sweeter fake and
it's really fresh and I love it and I
love the bottles they come with a lid
and then you kind of screw in the spritz
a bit I'm gonna spray some of this on
now oh it's so so nice I think this
could easily be my favorite fake scent
favourite to fake a sin that's hard to
say so definitely go and have a sniff
you're near a fresh counter there's a
fresh store modern high street in London
I'm not doing this in any kind of order
I'm just picking out of my little basket
I've got here but my next favorite is
from two-faced and it's the hangover
replenishing face primer this is very
very similar to the makeup forever
hydrating primer that I also picked up
quite recently they're very similar just
for some reason I've been going for this
one of this month it's a really nice
hydrating base really good to put on
before your makeup it's nothing fancy
really it's just good if you have dry
skin because a lot of primers I feel
like can be quite drying whereas this is
hydrating it's just another layer of
moisture and it helps eye makeup to sit
better on the skin I've used quite a lot
of that already okay let's go back to
body and I've got a really luxury item
and then a really affordable item as
well do I keep saying item I definitely
mean products I don't know what's wrong
with me this is from Jo Malone so it's
definitely a luxury treat to buy
yourself or this is really good to buy
as a present this is the geranium and
walnuts body scrub and I don't know I
don't really get like excited about
scrubs but I put this on my bathroom and
I used it in the bath and oh my god I
fell in love it looks like this it's
quite a thick scrub but it's so
hydrating and moisturizing I have the
perfect amount of scrub in it I used it
with my arms and legs in the bath and
then kind of washed it off and even rich
like you like touch my arms like oh my
god why's your arm so soft my whole body
was so so soft afterwards
it smells nice it's like nothing kind of
crazy smell it's quite a nice like
subtle scent that's what I was trying to
think of and yeah this is I think this
is a really nice gift to buy someone on
the lower end of things this is from a
soap &amp;amp; Glory and it's the sugar crush
body lotion now I would never think this
is this is my kind of scent a sweet lime
fragrance but I really like it I can't
believe I've only used that much I use
this all the time this is gonna last me
forever and what I tend to do is I mix
one pump of this with my this works
tinted gel or any kind of tinted tanning
gel and I kind of do a pump of each and
then I put on my legs before I go out or
I've got my legs out and it's really
hydrating I also use this after I
applied my arms and legs just to kind of
smooth out my skin and moisturize and
it's great and I love the pump that it
comes in this just sits on my shelf
everything in this month's favorites
very like scented yeah it's nice it's
limey I really like it it's
such a good product I used this in my
last video my last monthly makeup
routine videos so you would have already
heard about this it's the clinic chubby
lash in black honey so it's like an
aubergine kind of tinted mascara it's
amazing it's way more interesting than
brown a bit more subtle than black
somewhere in the middle and I think for
brown eyes especially I think this would
look great on green eyes as well it's
just such an interesting shade for
mascara I've never seen anything like it
the mascara itself is really good as
well but it's the shades it's like a
brownie red I mean it's amazing I love
this so if you want to see me using this
go watch my August monthly makeup
routine I also love this from Clinique
and I'm wearing this now on my eyes it's
a skinny stick eyeliner in slim sable
0/3 it's just a brown eyeliner one of
those ones you twist up but it's so kind
of opaque it's just like a pure dark
brown and I it's so soft I really like
it for applying on the top of the lid it
doesn't smudge at all it lasts all day
and it's just a really nice Brown I
don't know I would never thought this
was anything special but I just keep
eating it every day and I realized I
probably use this all month okay finally
I got this one I went to wilderness
festival with Neil's yard this is the
remedies to roll at nighttime so it's a
little rollable I keep by my bed and you
basically roll it onto your wrists or
behind your ears or into your temples
and it's so lovely actually what is in
it what's going to say let me have a
look it's got lavender citrus rose I'm
pretty sure knowing Neal's Yard they've
got like the perfect mix of essential
oils that help you get to sleep and it
really does work it's so relaxing
I sometimes find that I'm working kind
of all night and I go to bed and I'm a
bit like pumped up I can't sleep so I
like to just kind of read a bit of a
book and roll some of this on just kind
of have a little sniff and it's very
relaxing these are great as well for
traveling especially if you're nervous
flyer like me okay so those are all my
favorites from August I hope you guys
found some good products to try thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
