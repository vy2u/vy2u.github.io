obviously I thought what better day to
film a video today i'm going to be doing
my August favorites but I'm gonna do a
remix style which no unfortunately I'm
not going to be rapping or doing
anything cool but I'm going to be
throwing in a load of different
categories like beauty fashion lifestyle
home because I was on holiday at the
beginning of the month so it turns out I
don't have that many beauty favorites
saying that let's start with beauty my
holiday must have this year and my
Savior was this product from Vichy it's
their capital salay after sun and it
says it specifically for sunburn care
obviously I would recommend avoiding
sunburn completely but it's a great
after Sun and just moisturizer when you
are on holiday out in the Sun in the
swimming pool in the sea or skin can get
really dry and this is just so nice I've
like nearly finished it up I'm going to
save my next holiday why also did was
keep this in the fridge so if I did have
any sunburn on my skin just felt a
little bit sore from being out in the
Sun it felt really nice and cooling on
the skin it's just a lightweight
moisturizer the sinks in really quickly
think it smells nice yeah it smells
really fresh I'm a convert and I think I
would just keep repurchasing this when I
go on holiday seriously is the best
after survive ever use one more beauty
favorites is this concealer from Revlon
and it's their colorstay concealer and I
really really like this I've mentioned
in the past that i am not a fan of the
collection 2000 lasting perfection
concealer that everyone loves i hate it
i think this is a really great
alternative if you find the collection
12 drawing and cakey which i do this is
so much more moisturizing i think it
works well under the eyes and on
blemishes probably not on like proper
spots but if you use it on your chin and
around your nose it's really
moisturizing so it's good if you have
dry skin i'm using the slightly darker
shade at the moment because i have a
slight tan but the lighter shade works
well as well for style I've loved
layering it's got really cold in london
i can't believe it's all this it's
absolutely pouring down with rain it's
gray and it feels like it's about
october november time so i've been
layering and i do if you saw this
instagram photo but this is kind of the
first weekend it got cold in london and
i just started layering my clothes i put
a long vest top a long sleeve top and
leather jacket and i love that's like my
favorite kind of style this event
so I got on the wall st. sale is really
good for layering because it's a really
long bestop so it will hang out the
bottom of your clothes and then these
tops from hmm a really good as well as
just really thin kind of sheer long
sleeve loose top and I lay that on top
of the vest top and I also really like
layering checked shirts and just leaving
them open and then wearing a leather
jacket on top and it's good if the
weather changes because you can just
take off some of your layers I've also
really gotten back into jewelry I did a
blog post at the beginning of the month
saying I really wanted to and I've made
a proper effort to wear more jewelry I
am especially loving wearing bracelets
at the moment and you might have seen in
my videos these bracelets are I'm
wearing I will link to where I got them
all down below I did a blog post about
it there's one from Daisy lola rose my
nephew made me loom band and Donnelly V
as well I just love all these bracelets
and I've been wearing them every day so
I will link that blog post down below
for the home I have really been enjoying
burning this jo Malone candle it's there
with sage and sea salt and you guys
probably know by now especially if you
read my blog that I'm obsessed with the
scent I have the perfume and it's
amazing I've used that much it's just so
so good and the candle is just as good
it really really like sense a room I
think this one's a good one for like a
corridor hallway because if you put it
in a small room it might be a little bit
overwhelming smells really fresh and
zingy and perfect for this time of year
I love German own candles I think they
burn pretty clean compared to dip teak
which can get a little bit kind of smoky
just make sure you always trim the wick
you see how it's gone a bit bobbly there
just trim that off before you light it
and it should all be good I've been
listening to a lot more music this month
because I got some noodle headphones
when I was at the airport so I've been
listening to music when i'm on the tube
and on the go and the three albums i've
been listening to that are on my phone
are Sam Smith ed Sheeran and John Mayer
John Mayer I actually have like all his
albums so I normally just shuffle all of
his music but those are the three
artists that I'm absolutely loving at
the moment so I will link them down
below and Sam Smith is just really
chilled and soulful ed Sheeran you guys
know by now just obsessed and John Mayer
has a completely different range of
music he's got some more country stuff
I'm so more rocky stuff but he has the
most incredible voice and the most
amazing guitar player so I love
all his stuff I've been completely
obsessed with the youtube series hey USA
which pizzas grace and memory and they
are just so so funny i will link it down
below it's not like a bit of a random
youtube channel called astronauts wanted
but they have their own little series
and they're basically traveling around
america and just being themselves and
being really funny and it's so well
filmed and edited and it's like cut
together so well it's just so
entertaining I've been watching it like
when I get ready in the mornings and I
think it's great i've also been obsessed
with this guy on Instagram called Final
Cut king I think mark Anna's boyfriend
introduced it to rich and then rich told
me about it and it's basically this guy
that makes really short little Instagram
videos using Final Cut Pro and it's
clever things like he'll smash a window
and it would turn to water or he'll put
a picture of a cat in a printer and then
an actual cats will come out the
princess is really clever little editing
things and I find them so entertaining
when you're just flicking through
Instagram something really different and
something that editing geek like me
would love and I definitely recommend
following him on Instagram so I will
link that down below as well I've been
trying loads of different restaurants
recently in London as you would know if
you watch my vlogs I'm just basically I
should basically call my vlogs just like
eating in London because I'm just always
eating in them but I've got to
restaurant recommendations for you one
that's more expensive and it's chotto
matte a I think it's called and it was
delicious kind of asian fusion slightly
Mexican II maybe but mainly kind of like
sushi foods and since soho is a little
bit expensive but you can do like
sharing menus which is what me and my
friends did and it was seriously the
most delicious meal I've had in months
it probably since like duck and waffle I
really really liked it another one is
when I went to last week which is called
EF Mexican I think it started by the
same lady that does Oaxaca which is a
really nice Mexican chain I think she
won MasterChef they do like really cool
drinks you can refill yourself they do
nice like homemade ice cream and then
they do all the kind of burritos tacos
you normally get in a Mexican and it's
really cool it's a good one to go to you
with friends you kind of is like self
service and it's very laid back and
relaxed and just delicious I thought it
also throw in some newbies which are
basically products I think will be
favourites but I've only been loving
them in the last week so they're quite
new still the first one is for Matt
Keiko's
new collection come on what the
connection is called it something to do
with like Queen of Hearts maybe as I'm
like that this is their sculpting
bronzer in 02 precious sienna and I love
this it looks like this so it has a
bronzer contour side like a lighter ones
and a darker one and then a highlight
and this is so nice it is a little bit
dark so it works for me now but i think
when i lose my tan it might not work for
me the lighter bronze is perfect for
contouring the darker ones too dark for
me but the highlight is really nice as
well and i like how they give you more
bronzer than highlight because you're
obviously going to use more bronzer it's
a really nice formula it's a really cute
little palette and yeah definitely
recommend that from the new key code
collection I've also been loving this
mascara from stealer and it's the
mile-high lashes I think still have had
a bit for makeover I will talk about
that more though in my next video this
is there Jeff black mascara and you guys
know what I'm like with mascara is I
think the minute I try I just know if
it's me or if it's not for me and the
minute I tried this one I got so excited
and I haven't really felt that way about
mascara since the clinic high-impact
full volume that I absolutely love it
probably could give a little bit more
volume but in terms of length and curl
it's amazing you hardly need to put any
effort in I'm wearing it today I didn't
if you can see my lashes look pretty
long and I know with mascara is because
I have quite long curly lashes anyway a
lot of them work better for me than most
people but I do also far mascaras that
don't work for me and this one's really
really great it's got like a plasticky
brush and it grips the lashes really
easily and I feel like you can really
get length in there so I absolutely love
this so that's everything from my August
favorites remix let me know if you like
the different format this month I've
been trying a lot of new products
recently so i'm going to do like a
product review video coming up but for
now if you want to watch any of my past
videos i will link them at the end of
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys next time
bye
