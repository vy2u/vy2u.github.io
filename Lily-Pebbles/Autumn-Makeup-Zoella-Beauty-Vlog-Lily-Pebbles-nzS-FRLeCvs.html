starting my weekly vlog on a Thursday
this week because I haven't really been
up to much well I got that photo shoot
on Monday but I was not gonna have to
film or take photos or anything so I
couldn't bring you guys along but that
will be out end of October and I'm sure
I will share it on my Twitter or
Instagram or something Inc which is at
lady pebbles so today I'm just going to
stay at home and do some work got a lot
of work to catch up on but then tonight
is the launch of Zoe's Beauty range so
it's the zoella Beauty launch and yeah
I'm really excited to see everyone and
see what it looks like and I think it
would be a fun event so I'm gonna bring
you guys along for that first breakfast
time
alright time to go to the post office to
collect on my parcels and they're just
gonna have to deal with my face
I will try to pay my nails whilst
working because I need them to dry and
be alright ready for tonight I don't
know what color to do though because I
don't know I'm gonna wear and this is
why I've got to choose for them it's a
bit ridiculous always attractive to the
blues but I feel like my nails are
always blue maybe I'll do a dark color
I'm gonna go for this one which is SC
after school boy blazer which is like a
dark navy blue
this is what it looks like it kind of
looks nearly black I did pretty well pop
on that nail smudged a little bit which
is a bit annoying but you might be able
to see right I think I'm gonna do my
makeup now so I can take a photo of it
for my blog but also have my makeup done
ready for tonight I still don't know
what I'm gonna wear but I think first
step the new Burberry fluid foundation I
have to shade honey which was a bit too
dark for me so I've got the shade and 26
beige and I think this should be better
it's a really nice foundation but I'm
still kind of testing it out so I'm sure
it will pop up in a video if I decide I
really like it I think it's really nice
I've been using this Bobbi Brown brush
as well and I'm quite liking quite
natural foundations at the moment
because then even if I have blemishes
there like then use my concealer to get
rid of those but I like quite a natural
base I've also been using this Real
Techniques brush a lot with the Chanel
vitomir loose powder foundation just to
like set things and you can really see
but just to set my foundation a little
bit add a tiny bit more coverage if I
need it this is another product I've
been loving the Charlotte Tilbury
contour highlight kit it's just the
perfect shade of contour and the perfect
highlight and it comes into the cutest
little packaging okay I think I'm gonna
use this Tom Ford palette which is the
cognac sable one and it has four really
nice shades I'm not sure having an easy
glittery one but I'm definitely gonna
use these three and then I think because
it's like a brown smokey eye I can
always decide later whether I want a
bold lip or just something neutral so
this is what it looks like just with the
three shades so I might add a little bit
of sparkle just to make it a little bit
more interesting and maybe some black
eyeliner I've done black eyeliner but
it's definitely not equal but oh well
I'm not starting again okay I think I'm
done I'm gonna leave the eyes and face
there and I might put on a bright or
dark red or something clip tonight but
I'm gonna leave it now for the rest of
the day I'm just popping it out because
I need to get a few bits I need to print
some photos and I'm gonna meet my mum
for a quick bite to eat for like
I also might lurk in Zahran chop shop to
see if it anything to wear to Zoey's
thing tonight I mean I was gonna go
really casual you guys know I just
casual in jeans and boots like all the
time but everyone else seems to be
dressing up so I might have a quick look
if something catches my eye then I might
try it on but if no I'm just wearing my
normal clothes I'm sure no one will mind
if I came home I did some work I really
needed to catch up on and I was just
trying on the leather skirt that I got
from River Island I don't know if you
saw when I was vlogging I got this like
leather skirt it's kind of hard to say
let me lay it down so it's like that's
quite high waisted and it comes just
above the name and I was try not on with
this shirt maybe to wear tonight and
it's so different to what I normally
wear but I quite like it and I've just
tweeted and literally everyone replied
saying yes they liked it which is a very
rare occasion so I guess I'll keep it
feeling a bit weird now I'm being very
unproductive and just finding it hard to
like process things in my brain I can't
explain what I mean so I think I'm gonna
go sit down have a cup of tea because I
feel a little bit like funny I'm glad
I'm driving tonight I'm not feeling good
today I don't know why I feel already
like cold and weird I was just watching
Lisa L judges knew him we can't see her
there yeah she did like a face so facial
massage video and I fell asleep it's a
really good video hungry too tired and
it's like 10 past 6:00 so I've got to
get ready for Zoe's thing I'm definitely
still gonna go and hopefully it will
cheer me up so I think I might wear this
new skirt that I got it's really high
waisted and I might just wear this like
Topshop t-shirt but I have this massive
bruise on my leg look so I'm gonna try
use secret camouflage to cover it and
pretty sure it's not gonna work but I'm
gonna try my best
nope didn't work so I'm just gonna have
to leave my bruise there but you know
we're human we have bruises it's fine
okay so I think
I am ready I've just touched up my
makeup a little bit this is what I'm
wearing now it's far too cold to be
wearing bear legs
I think it's freezing but I'm always
only God I have like all my boots
shopping Pokhran sorry for that mess
over there um I'm always kind of look at
girls who have bare legs and think how
can they can get away with bare legs
well I'm always cold so I thought just
tonight see is I'm driving I'm just
gonna do the bear leg thing and I don't
know be brave so I'm wearing the leather
skate from River Island Topshop top and
other stories necklace I think my Acuras
watch and my Steve Madden boots to make
it kind of less smart because you know
I'm scared of looking small I'm a very
casual person so I always like to make
skirts dresses look more casual by
wearing flat boots with them so I'm
gonna go now as I said I'm going to
drive I'm looking forward to a nice
drive and some music and singing and
I'll vlog when I'm there probably won't
do talky vlog because I just want to
kind of enjoy it but I definitely film
some stuff and show you guys the new bTW
range and stuff this spider has lived
outside my house for weeks now can you
see it and it's right in between every
time I walk so I go through its where
but it's freaking me out lesson number
one it's really hard to sit down in a
car in leather skirt techniques like no
time at all like me there
I'm just leaving
that was beautiful 40 and so it is
amazing little refund I'm here with
media yesterday right
so home now and I had such a nice
evening I'm so so happy for Zoe I think
everyone in that room you could just
feel that everyone was really proud of
her and yeah she's just such a lovely
girl her range is really cool I just got
home the leather skirt went down well I
think next time I might wear a little
bit of talcum powder you know what I'm
saying the alt could but yeah exactly I
think I'm not going for the toilet
no way I'll never get it back on we were
given this um little goodie bag as well
as I thought to show you what's inside
so nice all a zoella and inside
is this it's also she has two makeup
bags or like pencil cases this is one
has her eyes on it is a zoo Ella very
cute and like I like how it's like why
purple and then I also got that's like a
body mist I love the packaging it's like
two rose gold a polka dots it's called
blissful mist full and it smells sweet
really nice and then this one is I
thought this is really clever
this is a fizz bar all focus focus so
instead of like a bath bomb it's like a
ball you break up edit fizzes in your
bath and I'm really looking forward
seizing this because I do love a good
bath
so yeah really excited to try those
products and now I'm really ready for
bed and today I watched Lisa Eldridge
new video which I'm gonna link below
it's 20 minute long video about how she
gives herself how she gives herself a
facial massage and it's amazing so I'm
gonna go to the bathroom now rich I
might be a while 20 minutes maybe and
that's that for today I think we're
gonna wait into the weekend's vlog we
have no plans but we're gonna have to
make plans because I lord this is gonna
be a really boring vlog it's just
putting his thumb up that means yeh took
fun plans and can you help me film we've
got plans what are we doing secret whoo
good morning it's Saturday and I just
woke up and had to straighten my hair
because I slept a bit wet and I woke up
with it looking like this which was just
sort of a little bit hilarious I don't
know what we're doing today but I'm just
gonna get up and go do my little morning
skincare routine I'm gonna use this
which is the oscar renaissance cleanser
and maybe some of this chanel hydra
beauty serum and this first apt
moisturizer I'm also really hungry I
need some breakfast okay I'm ready and
we're off and it's feeling very autumnal
today I've got my whistles cashmere
jogger out that I haven't worn in a year
and I had my jacket on and I've got dark
kind of this is Mac plum for lipstick
and I've got the nice kind of purply I'm
feeling very like it's all to me
we don't really know what we're going to
do we've been trying to decide what to
do with today I think we've decided on
Spitalfields market which is like Youth
London didn't--we because we kind of
have stuff that we need to get and
there's shops on there but I don't
really want to go to Westfield to stay
inside today so we're gonna go have a
look around if it feels right we're in
East London the land of the cool people
I've already seen two girls walking on
with yoga mats this is where all the
cool people hang at school yeah we're
actually going to find a cafe who'll
trade friends of ours own it they
started it a little while back we
haven't even been yet and it's on
Commercial Street if anyone wants to
visit we're gonna go and have some lunch
cuz I'm getting hungry any Londoners
will understand the pain of parking the
signs are so confusing this one says it
says Monday to Friday and there's some
day so does that mean you can park on a
Saturday I reckon we're getting here
ticket that's just London for you and
it'll be 80 pounds as well the ticket
just in case any of you don't know about
London parking prices it's just a
terrible Palkia for like you're not in
alright alright let's go get some food
look guys this shows how clever
marketing is coke evading you coke that
says natural sugars rich never ever
drink coke and he came back from the
shop to the coke this is why we studied
marketing I find that hilarious step a
new green packaging and something this
is natural learning to make the hell
freak like rich buy coke funny now in
Kingston and robots find hope
oh my god I just want Oscar to make
I had no idea they had a store they've
been EPA for a couple months and I went
in and happy was amazed
you can't find in the UK their makeup
forever and this other brand I always
see this youtuber use this amazing matte
eyeshadow palette I'm going to show you
what I got when I get back in the car

I got from guru makeup Emporium I'm so
excited so this girl I follow in YouTube
icon remember her name the moment she's
Australian I'm gonna link her below this
video she always used this palette and
she's a makeup artist she needs it I
definitely don't it's by a brand called
visi art or visor so I don't really know
but it's this palette and let me open it
so it's a palette that has two four six
eight twelve shades and and they're all
matte so I think it's really good if
he's a lot of matte eyeshadows it's got
some really nice kind of warm orange
ones and a few cooler taupe sand like
gloomy tones and yeah I've always loved
the look of this palette so I'm really
excited that I found that and they're
really really good quality shadows I was
testing them out and whenever she used
to videos they look great I also got a
couple of these mini biodome was one for
me and one for my mom because be this
size the tiny mini ones really hard to
find in the UK and they're really good
