guide so this is a new little video
series on my channel and hopefully if
you guys like it or do one for every
season it's basically a little style
guide so there are three categories
nails style and home and I'll be talking
through like three products and three
different items from each category so
it's something a little bit different
for me and I really hope you guys like
it and I'm gonna start with the nail
category so I have three polishes here
two slightly darker and one nude and you
guys know I'm obsessed with nail polish
I have so many so it's quite hard to
pick just three the first one's a bit
obvious though and it's one that I have
been absolutely obsessed with recently
it's from ESI's new Woodson collection
and it's after school boy blazer which
is a really really dark maybe blue it
looks almost black when it's on the
nails but then you can slightly see the
blue in different lights and I love it
I've always loved navy blue that's why I
bought my Michael Kors handbag in navy
blue I think it kind of goes with
everything that's really chic and
classic and blacks a little bit like
more on the boring side so maybe
something a bit different and I think
it's just really classy and I love Essie
nail polishes so this is a good pick the
second one is a slightly cheaper
drugstore version and it's the Revlon
vixen and this is pretty much a cult
nail polish color I think everyone knows
this and everyone loves it it's a really
it's the one I'm wearing today it's a
really deep burgundy wine and it's not
too Brown I find I tried a lot of
different colors for this video and I
found that a lot of them were a little
bit too Brown they kind of looked a bit
Aging
but this has enough kind of red in it
that it just looks like a really nice
pretty dark burgundy third nail polish
is a need and this is deborah lippmann
fashion and I always thought the one I
had was naked but then I just went to
look for it it's actually called fashion
but I really like this because it's a
nude nail polish but it hasn't really
got much pink in it it's very much like
bare skin color so when you wear it you
look a bit like you're a mannequin hands
but I kind of liked that and I I really
like wearing nudes in the autumn
lips and on my nails so I think it's
always good to have a nude option and
deborah lippmann polishes they're quite
hard to find in the UK but there's such
good quality so if you can't find them I
think fennecs leave them and there's a
few pharmacies around along that I know
that do them you can get them online as
well I'll link all these products below
everything that I'm talking about this
video will be linked in the description
bar below B I really love this nude for
water so onto the Style section and I
don't really talk about fashion much on
this channel so I thought that would be
a good category to have and show you
some my favorite bits from each season
I think autumn it was quite easy for me
to pick 3 because there are a few
staples that I always have in my
wardrobe during autumn the first one is
a nice cozy sweater now as much as I
would love cashmere and my mom is a huge
fan of Kashmir and I would love it I
find it quite hard to part with a lot of
money on like one clothing item just
because I went to change my wardrobe
quite a lot I get bored so I was on the
hunt for an alternative I'm like I know
there's not really an alternative to
Kashmir because it's just such amazing
quality but I wanted to find a nice soft
gray jumper and I found one in age hmm
and this was only 20 pounds I think and
it looks like this it's just gray it's
slightly longer at the back but not much
and I like to roll the sleeves up and
it's so soft it's not itchy I hate itchy
clothes it's really really soft and I
like to wear this like you can layer it
over shirts or you can wear on its own
it looks really nice under jackets and I
just think they're really good I like to
wear lots of layers when it gets cold
and I love these kind of jumpers and
because we're looking 20 powers
it may not wash as well but it's
excessive cheap that doesn't really
matter but I still want the cashmere
jumper one day but this will do for
another key piece for awesome is a
leather jacket I've had a Topshop
leather jacket for about three years now
that I wear every year but it's got kind
of surely myself the first one is called
on the neck and it's got a bit grubby
and I have to try and get it replaced
but it's attached so that's a bit
annoying so I've got a new one this year
and this is from ASOS and I love it I
think it's limited edition but last time
I checked they still have some in stock
so if they do I'll link it below its
proper as a real leather jacket and it's
quite similar to my Topshop one actually
it's got kind of silver zips
pockets here it's quite plain really I
don't like my leather jackets to have
too many bits and bobs but it's got a
kind of faux fur collar that stash of
all it's got a zip and when you take off
it's not like colourless it's got a
little leather collar so I think that's
kind of the perfect combination because
if this starts to get bit tatty you can
just take off with the zip and it's not
too short but it's not too long it's
perfect it's really soft leather and I
love leather jacket so you can wear
hoodies underneath them if they're a bit
cold if the weather like gets really
cold but they were going good for nights
out there good during the day at wearing
leather jackets all the time and for me
it's proper autumn staple and I've been
wearing this one every day since I got
it really really like in the finest
style staple are a good pair of boots
and I tend to buy a new pair of boots
every year pretty much I love black
boots it's definitely my addiction or
maybe a certain clip of my shoe right
here because it's ridiculous how many
black boots I have I don't really have
any heeled boots a lot of my boots are
quite flat and they're getting a bit
scruffy and although I like that look if
I'm going to like an important meeting
or a party I like to wear slightly nicer
shoes so I was in the hunt for something
with a bit of heel but I really can't
wear heels so it has to be something
comfy and easy to walk in and I found
these at Aldo which I don't really go
into that very much so I was quite
surprised they look like this they're
quite chunky they're black leather with
a bit of kind of suede on the side
they've got laces like ice skating and
shoes do and then they've got a big
chunky heel which you can see here so
it's really easy to walk in and they're
really comfortable so far they've got a
nice padding rather ankles I've got
quite skinny ankles so I really like
what I feel like secure and I could do
them up pretty tight and they look
really nice black jeans they look really
nice with dresses and skirts as well and
with denim jeans think I've kind of been
out to wear them with everything so far
I'm really happy with them they weren't
cheap they're about 90 pounds which i
think is quite expensive but I think a
good pair of black boots that will last
me all winter are a good investment and
I really happy about this I've
definitely worn them enough for it to be
worth it so far
all the time so I love those so now on
to home which is definitely something
different for me on this channel but I
love homey stuff I'm always buying bits
and bobs to like decorate my room and
the house and I love it so I'm going to
talk through three of my favorite homey
things for autumn first one is my bed
and I was on a mission this season to
sort on my bed make it nice and cozy
because it hasn't been that cozy so I
have a Mooji duvet cover and I've had
that for a while and I love it it's made
of jersey so it's so warm and cozy and
soft and I would definitely recommend
the Muji Jersey duvet cover but I also
got some other bits to adds my bed the
first were some big cushions and I'm at
least Mike here they were 9 pounds I
think when they come just decoration it
doesn't really matter about like the
quality of the cushion although these do
feel really like comfy I put these at
the back for my bed for when I sitting
up on my bed or just when the beds made
to make it look really nice and it's a
kind of gray taupe color it feels a bit
of velvety and I love these got two of
these and they were really affordable
and also for Mike here I got some bed
throws and I wanted to get like an
amazing bed throw from the white company
but again she's not gonna happen can't
afford it so I've got a cheap
alternative and the way I made it look a
little bit more expensive is by layering
I think that's kind of really key I want
it to look like I've thrown some
blankets onto the bed and just to look
really cozy so the first one I got is
this one and it's kind of like a knit
donkey it's pretty plain grey but I lay
that one down first on my bed and then
on top to make it a bit more expensive
looking as I said I got this one from
Ikea which is a very thin one as well
but it's got nice it's like a tartan
print as you can see which I really like
at the moment I'm a bit obsessed of
tartan but that's another subject I
really like this so I just put the grey
down first and I put this on top and it
looks really nice it's really cozy when
you get its bed you can kind of keep on
or just use it decoration and now my bed
looks really cozy I've got new pillows
as well but that's not really a style
staple that's just comfy sleeping so
I've really enjoyed making my bed
the autumn my next autumn home staple is
actually behind me I need to just grab
it this is the Jo Malone dark amber and
ginger lily candle and it's amazing I
love German line candles this so there's
such good quality in sa luxurious but
this is one of their kind of deeper
darker sentence and it's so nice I've
had it lit while I've been filming and
it's just filled the whole room with
this amazing it's kind of like a it's
sweet but kind of musky as well that you
have to go and smell it if you like
German handles this I've really
recommend this on for autumn it's such a
nice warm scent and I love lighting
candles all year round but especially in
the autumn and winter I never really go
in a room where there's not a candle lit
I have to be careful when there's
candles all around the house but I think
it really makes the house feel like warm
and cozy and I love candles so this is
my favorite waffle the final home autumn
piece it's a bit of a funny one it's
crate and I have this crate this always
actually sent me by Lurpak and the
butter
so thanks lower back for this but I
actually already have a few as well as
you can see behind me I've got a big
crate and I got a little one that's
normally behind my videos anyway and I
think these are so nice I'm a bit
obsessed with crates it's a whole kind
of shabby chic thing you can get these
online for so cheap and the one I have
behind me I got online and then I
whitewashed it myself and I've done a
blog post on how to whitewash a crate or
how I did it anyway
so I'll link that below but this one in
particular is really nice because it's
slightly darker wood and it's got
handles and I think this is so nice you
can decorate them with your pumpkins
like I've done behind you can put
magazines in them you kind of do
whatever you want my friend uses them as
side tables in her flat I'll stack some
one top and then has her lights and like
a little coffee table books and stuff
and I just didn't look so nice
especially for autumn I initially have
had this one sitting outside my room for
a while and my sister my mom my dad my
boyfriend everyone has asked if they can
have this crate everyone's falling in
love with it I just think the whole like
crate thing is really nice and it's a
really nice way to kind of decorate your
house tree an awesome especially around
Halloween with the pumpkins I think it
looks really cute
so that was my autumn star guide I
really hope you guys
let me know if you did because then I'll
film some more like a winter style guide
