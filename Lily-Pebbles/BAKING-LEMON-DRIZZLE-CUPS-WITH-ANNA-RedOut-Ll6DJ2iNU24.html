be in Hannah's kitchen and are you also
fighting we're actually taking part in
the comic relief read out campaign you
may have noticed my video yesterday with
a little bit different we have you've
been completely silent on social media
for an entire 24 hours and interest rate
awareness for comic relief and their
annual Red Nose Day which is something
we're setting both have loved forever
all resin they're so fun you get these
little noses and they're very poppy
these days that I show me what color I
don't know what's another question which
is a very appropriate is know what
community insane in videos and reproduce
is amazing therapy in the UK which helps
disadvantaged people all over the UK and
some of the poorest communities around
the world
it's incredible charity so we wanted to
create a video today to encourage you
guys to raise money raise awareness
we're ever going to do amazing videos on
my channel was going to do lemon drizzle
cake and our mind it's like smarty
splash Emmons
really will see amazing gooey cookie I'm
so excited
without the liver as we needed to making
tables work or school sell them and
raise some money and I always eat them
so to get raising they're serious and
it's getting the recipe up for the
computer but I just realize I have no
idea what I'm doing
it's definitely better at breaking I am
so this is definitely collaborative so
these all the ingredients are going to
be using is got milk baking powder lots
of butter sugar flour lemon zest and
lemon juice and more sugar why would you
show people different place apart
yeah who is for the cake and then the
granulation see I was when a country
that's so good I need it I so need and
also look how fun these toppings of
raspberry and strawberry like dry
tonight they refine we're also for eggs
as well what was going to try and put
red dye into the cake to make them red
nose day appropriate because so much
more fun than yellow let's be honest and
we're going to try to them in cup little
very experimental I think it's going to
work thank you let's try we're going to
preheat the oven to
180 mm yeah hundred eighty get that oven
all nice and hot
there you go yes I'm going to list the
full ingredients and instructions under
the description in cases isn't clear but
we're going to basically mix everything
together in a big bowl and it's going to
taste the mission especially will do is
sift the flour into this big bowl here
pour it in and give it a good shake I
always think if there's really fun give
it a little tap and that makes it all
nice and smooth so now I'm going to add
in my water softener in this very
Hollanders 400 grams add the sugar all
in I now add in one tablespoon of baking
powder looks so professional yeah you
love you very supervisor yes and then
I'm going to have four eight this is
little egg blue how dare you
I think mr. way of doing this about
making you this might be quite good at
packing is what you can do it with one
hand it's been a lot of my work very
impressed the pressure but I'm a man in
my own bed or table shoes thank you
welcome good Robin all these directions
where okay ready for I'm now going to
make anammox it all together because I
just feel like you'll be better at this
dog well so we're using the electric
whisk and mixing everything together
until it nice and smooth like this video
if you're a ball licker okay now we're
going to add in some of the red dye we
see how red we can get thermic I just
start dropping in I feel at five drops
okay ilgar Pinkus okay look whoa whoa
kind of more like a mo
but I think it's cool it's interesting
when it turns out like when it's kick
yeah we have the muffin that cake cases
patent cases mustard faces and
we're going to put these in here well
kind of hard to do one-handed but I'm
basically gonna place all of these into
the hole Ana's found her ice cream
scooper and she hugger theory that this
might be the best way to scoop totally
into here I mean looks sloppy enough you
don't really need to do that
now I know the color doesn't look great
so I can play well over NL tastes great
too they will stick to that digit these
cases these are now ready to go into the
oven for 20 minutes new to the honor of
opening the thank you
we're going to leave both Maps 20
minutes we're going to film Anna's video
head over to Anna's channel to see us
make smarty cookies normal so go what's
that when you're done with this one I'm
going to come back to you when those
already 8 minutes to go on these and
look how much they have risen they are
looking great and it smells good case
they are ready we're going to get them
out and see they are big Lucy if they've
got have settle down a bit if not we can
always chop the top off make them a bit
flat oh my god they're blue interesting
very interesting some of those so funny
they have fun a little bit blue but oh
my god guys they smell so good
whilst those calmed down we are going to
make the topping with my favorite I'd
like a lemon sugary goodness and we're
going to add in the raspberry and
strawberry bit just to make it a little
bit special because they are a red-nosed
a lemon drizzle cups after all okay so
I'm going to add in sugar now I start
with my party Matt we've got a lot of
fresh lemon juice if you run out they're
not juicy enough we got some it lunges
are going to start mixing in their lemon
mix that all in yeah the best bit it's
so lemon sugar make someone have a crap
right now I look good yeah it's good you
had running it you want it to expiry
like spreadable you also need to
crunches the sugar once the cakes called
out again a few holes in them that will
spread it on top because
in Decatur make them nice juicy with a
little message click and there's a whole
East were not going to agree because I
think it'll Matthews is going to have a
couple holes Silex so pacifying
diversity now I'm going to spread on
this mixture probably going to go
everywhere but it doesn't really matter
mmm this might take a while maybe I said
I'll come back to you well it's awesome
I now get sprinkle on some of these
strawberry raspberry like sprinkles but
not too many because there has to be
really strong like the smell it's not
incredible it's not really natural but
I'm just going to put on a few I
sprinkle it all over a bit of a mess
really but they didn't stick that one
once this is dry I'm going to here are
the lemon drizzle cups of lay them all

thumbnail photos I haven't tried one yet
