about BB Creams
I suddenly realized I have quite a few
BB Creams so I thought it might be
interesting to talk to you about the
ones I have and what I think of them and
just do a little comparison things so in
case you don't know BB Creams they
originated from Korea and they are
basically an all-in-one base product so
it can replace your foundation gets into
moisturizer but it's also supposed to
moisturize even skin tone since that of
your serum is basically instead it's
like everything all-in-one they
originally came in one shade and were
lighter than your skin tone and adapt to
your skin once you put it on but the
sort of more Western ones now come in a
few different shades because it just
wouldn't work if it was just one shade
here so I've got quite a few like a mix
of high-end ones and sorts of drugstore
ones so I'm gonna go through and talk
about them and show you me actually
applying them on so it's sorry for the
awful no makeup face but yeah I'm gonna
get started okay so I'm going to start
by talking about the Bobbi Brown
BB cream which is quite a new launch for
them and let me just take that packaging
it comes in a really nice black thin
tube it's really like sleek and nice to
keep in your makeup bag so this is 28
pounds it comes in five shades and it's
got an SPF of 35 so kind of more the
higher-end
with price five shades is quite a lot
for a BB cream considering like
originally they only come in one shade
so that's quite good and SPF of 35 is
really good that's quite high so when I
apply this I felt like it's quite thick
it's a lot thicker than I was expecting
but it's still easy to sort of spread
around the face it smells really nice I
love Bobby Brown products do smell nice
that's something she did on purpose when
creating the products it has light
reflective pearls in it so it leaves a
really nice of chewy glowing look and
it's also skin tone correcting which is
really good too even in out your skin
tone I did feel with this that I'd have
to use some concealer
certain areas because it doesn't get
really high coverage but it feels really
nice on the skin and I think I
definitely it's a good one
the color I was using is fair which is
quite a good match for me I think the
next BB cream is the origins a perfect
world BB cream which is 27 pounds it
comes in six shades and it's SPF 15 so
six shades is really good the thing is
the color I was using is the lightest
shade zero one light and it was too dark
for me well so I'm not really sure
what's going on with that that's a bit
funny 27 pounds it's quite a lot as well
but I really like this one if definitely
feels more like skin care products when
you're applying it smells really nice
it's really lightweight and just feels
like you're applying and moisturizer
rather than a foundation so this is what
I definitely use my hands for it has
white tea in it which is really good for
anti-aging and leaves a really nice
cheery finish on the skin it's not high
coverage at all so you definitely need
concealer to cover up any blemishes or
dark circles or anything like that but I
like this one this is good for like when
you're at home and you're just relaxing
and you don't want to wear lots of
makeup it feels really nice on the skin
and it feels like it's doing good for
your skin as well the next one is from
Rimmel and this is actually a new launch
for their autumn winter collection which
comes out in the 3rd of October so this
is the Rimmel London BB cream nine in
one and I was a bit skeptical about
trying this because I'm a bit funny with
drugstore products when it comes to
foundations and skin products because I
want to make sure I have good
ingredients so this is $6.99 it comes in
two shades and it's SPF 25 25 is quite a
high SPF for a drugstore product so it's
not great that it comes in two shades
really because it just means it's not
available for as many people but um it
basically claims to do everything like
it says nine in one says it primes
moisturizes minimizes pores conceals
covers smooths mattifies brightens and
protects and I just think sometimes
high-street products really
over-promised it just can't do all of
those things
but it is quite mattifying if you like I
found after I applied it it was quite
tacky so you have to be really quick
with blending it because it dries quite
quickly and it's quite mattifying so if
you have oily skin and you want a high
Street View Coon this is probably the
one for you but I think it's worth
trying when it comes out it's not
expensive so you know you're not going
to regret buying it really if it's not
for you it's not the best one but it's
quite good for a ho Street so I'm quite
impressed with that the next one is from
the body shop and this is also a new
product so this is the body shop BB
cream in this big box thing let me just
take it out and show you it looks like
this in this silver again like you're
thin cheap like for the Bobbi Brown one
and I quite like that rather than like
the shorter stumpy tubes this is the
body shop all-in-one BB cream so this is
12 pounds it comes in three shades and
it doesn't have SPF unless I'm going mad
it doesn't say on the cheap and I'm
pretty sure I had SPF it would say it in
the front so that's a massive negative
for me not having SPF um I think some I
do use foundations that don't have SPF
but for BB cream that's kind of the
whole point so I'm not sure the best
kind of BB cream so this is really
different to any of the others and it
comes out white you'll see as I apply it
now so it comes out white and it's it as
soon as you put it on your face it
changes color and I have the shade 0-2
which clearly is not the right shade for
me zero-one probably would have been
better because it turned orange pretty
much straightaway and just made me look
like an oompa loompa and the white cream
is quite grainy so it feels kind of
exfoliating as you're rubbing it in
which I didn't really like I don't want
to exfoliate and leave it on my skin so
it was kind of felt bit weird that was
white and it felt weird that I have bits
in it it says it color adapts even
hydrates conditions smooth finish
lightweight and undetectable non
clogging again over-promising with far
too many things
do all of those things at all it does
after I've sort of blended it in and
gotten over the whole white exfoliating
thing it does the quite chewy on the
skin and it doesn't look bad but I
didn't like this and I wouldn't use it
I'm probably gonna be giving this away
so I'm maybe worth trying in store I'm
not sure it's out yeah I think it is so
worth trying on the back your hand and
see what you think of it so the next
one's you've probably heard quite a lot
baron it's the dr. jart BB creams and
I've got all four here so there's the
water fuse one the premium one the
platinum and the regenerating which is
the one with snail secretion in it which
everyone went crazy over and they will
they're all four different skin types
but I'm just going to talk to you about
the two that I really like which is the
water fuse and the premium so the water
fuse one is 18 pounds and it comes in
one shade and as SPF 25 so these come in
one shade because these are actually
from Korea and they're much more of the
original type of Eva cream and they're
not sort of westernized so this one goes
on really kind of thin and watery like
the name implies and spreads very easily
it feels a lot thinner but the color
adapts to your skin tone really well I
mean I have got very fair skin so I'm
not sure what it's like on darker skin
tones but it that's - my skin tone
really well
SPF 25 is really good it's oil-free this
one which is why I think it's been one
of the most popular ones these are sold
in Boots now by the way and this has
been one of the most popular ones
because I think is oil free but it's
really easy to blend I think gives quite
a good coverage and I like the sort of
jewelry finish that it gives and which
you can see I really like that one I
think that's better for sort of younger
girls and it's worth trying these are
sold in Boots so that one's 18 pounds
which is a bit more than the high street
ones but I think it's I think it's
definitely worth 18 pounds so I'm worth
trying that and then the second one is
the premium one which I think it's meant
for older skin but this is my favourite
one out of all the dots jar BB creams it
comes in a different sort of tube it's
like hard even though it's squeezy and
then it's got a pump on the end
so this is 24 pounds it's more expensive
than the rest of the dots of junk ones
and it comes in one shade again and it
has SPF 445 which is amazing that as
such a high SPF because it is for older
skin types this one's all about
anti-aging the shade is a bit more dull
than the other B perfumes I've seen it
looks a bit grey when you first put it
on but it adapts to my skin tone really
well it's definitely thicker than the
other BB creams it's more like a tinted
moisturizer foundation which is why I
like it because I think it gives quite a
good coverage and I don't have to
conceal as much afterwards
it's brightening anti aging and it has
antioxidants in to help with skin's
elasticity so I really like this one oh
sorry I said it was SPF 45 I just read
SPF 40 but still really high this is my
favorite one out of the doctor jobdiva
creams and I think is actually my
favorite out of all of them I do really
like the Bobbi Brown one and the origins
one and Bobby Brown one I'd wear out if
I was going out the origins one's more
for like an at-home day because it's a
lot thinner so that's what I think of
all of those BB creams and let me know
what you think if you've tried any of
those whether you want to try the Rimmel
one when it comes out in October or just
what you think of BB creams in general
they're kind of a mix between tinted
moisturizer and Foundation and I really
like them actually because there's a
some day so you don't need that much
makeup on and it's nice to wear
something a bit lighter so yeah so the
dr. jart ones you can get from boots
Bobby Brown you can get from most
department stores body shop from the
body shop and rim off on boots and
Superdrug
so I hope you find that interesting let
me know what you thought and I'll see
you in my next video
