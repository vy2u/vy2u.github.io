channel this feels really good to be
sitting down and filming a proper video
this is my first time filming in 2017
and I'm very excited for all the content
I have coming up if you are an old
subscriber welcome back if you are new
to my channel hello
and if you guys haven't seen my last
video it was an old blog format New
Year's Eve and I really really loved it
so I will link it up there and if you'd
like to have a watch please click on the
I button it was a really cute fun vlog
today I'm going to be doing my 2016
beauty discoveries and I'm calling it
Beauty discoveries because I kind of do
this every year it's not really a
roundup of my favorites from the year
because so many favorites get carried on
year by year and there are some products
like Oscar O'Neal's cleansing gel that
I've just been using for years and I
don't want to keep repeating myself so
like I did last year I'm going to list
down in the description box the products
that I'm still loving that were
mentioned in previous year's videos
but in today's video to keep it
interesting for you guys I'm just going
to talk about the new Beauty discoveries
so don't worry if there are some cult
favorites that aren't mentioned here it
doesn't mean I'm not still loving them
just didn't want to repeat myself really
so let's talk about some new products
that I discovered in 2016 and that I
absolutely love and I know I'll continue
using this year I'm going to start with
like hair body skincare and then move on
to makeup first product is from weigh
and weight as a brand I discovered in
2016 and that I love it's a haircare
brand it's like oh you a I but I'm
pretty sure it's away it's a very kind
of cool trendy brand but I actually
think the products are great I love
their texturizing spray as well this is
the clean shampoo so it's a detox
clarifying shampoo which is the sort of
shampoo you use when your hair has
product build-up so if you have that
problem where every time you wash your
hair it just doesn't feel clean it's
probably because there's a buildup of
product in your hair and shampoos like
this are really good at kind of
stripping it back to clean hair but with
clarifying shampoos you have to really
careful if you have dry hair like me or
if your colored hair I also have colored
hair and this one is safe for dry and
colored
and it doesn't leave your hair feeling
like squeaky clean so squeaky that it's
gonna like break into pieces it's so so
nice I've used about half a bottle and I
picked this up in Harvey Nichols so I'm
really loving that the next haircare
product I got towards the end of 2016 I
did have you guys noticed I really hope
you didn't but I'm sure you did I kind
of kept getting little bits of white in
my hair and I wasn't so much dandruff
because I only got it on the last day
when my hair needed a wash so I washed
my hair like every four days which is
fine for hair that's really dry but I
found that on the day where it kind of
needed a wash whereas they used to be
able to get away with just one more day
before I washed it before I found on
like the third or fourth day I was
getting loads of white bits in my hair
like crazy amounts and I'm pretty short
us down to having a dry scalp and I
tried quite a few products my friend
Ruth from amodal recommends recommended
philip kingsley flaky itchy scalp
shampoo and the more i think about it my
scalp was actually quite itchy as well I
don't know why I didn't like try to fix
it earlier
anyway gave this a go again I had a same
problem trying to find one that was safe
for color-treated hair and this one is
absolutely fine for color-treated hair
it's really gentle but it actually does
the job and now I don't seem to have any
more kind of white flaky bits in my hair
and I am loving using this I don't use
this every time I wash my hair but I
think it's really really great
the ameliorate skin smoothing body
lotion is absolutely a favorite from
last year for me I never really got into
body lotions before but this one is so
good because it really smooths out your
skin it has a chaise in it and I find
especially if you have like bumpy parts
on the back of your arms or legs even if
you don't it's a sort of body lotion
that actually works and I loved using
this last year
I'm not massively entertaining but I
found a tanning product that I love and
I'm just kind of sticking with it it's
the bond ice and liquid gold this is so
so good it just makes tanning so much
easier because you don't have to put it
on and walk around your house for 3 to 4
hours like in your underwear cold sticky
and then wash it off you literally just
it's a dry oil you just spray this onto
your skin I tend to like exfoliate the
night before so that my skin's just
prepped and ready but you just spray it
on rub it in with the tan
and that's it done it dries you can get
dressed straightaway it's so easy I
never ever get streaks with this it's a
really nice like golden tan I've been
through about three bottles it doesn't
smell like this kit it's so so good I
think this is the best fake tan I've
ever used
I also discovered Clinique take the day
off balm this isn't a new product I
don't know why it took me so long to try
it it's a bomb cleanse us it's like a
solid oil when you rub it into a skin it
turns into like a liquid oil and it
takes off makeup so well it's kind of
fragrance free it's but nothing in it
but it really does the job well and I
really like it it's actually quite
similar to Caroline hyerin's cleanser
which you actually get a cream one in
that as well I only just started using
that towards the end of the year which
is why it's not in this video but I
would recommend both I really enjoy this
cleanser and it's definitely become part
of my routine still on the skincare
thing this year last year I just go with
the brand Chi press I have four products
from the brand I do not want to drop
this that would be a disaster today and
I really really love them it is
expensive but totally worth it I've used
it for almost the whole year and I know
it's definitely worth it now moon-like
catalyst i would use in the evening
sometimes if i want like a bit of an
exfoliation clearing serum i would only
really use if I had like a proper
breakout on my chin or something this
one's probably my least used antioxidant
Joo I love this one I would use this in
the morning to give my skin a nice glow
and beauty elixir one I also actually
have beauty elixir 2 which I probably
use more because it's little so I travel
with it this is just the gorgeous rose
oil and I absolutely love it
their products are incredible definitely
one of my best kind of skincare
discoveries from last year okay couple
more skincare bits the Estee Lauder wake
up balm I love this stuff I use this
every morning now as my moisturizer it's
probably not the most like moisturizing
I should really use moisturizer and then
be using this as a primer but I've just
I've been so lazy with my skincare
routine like past six months so I've
been skipping quite a few steps and I've
just loved this because it's like a
moisturizer that gives you proper glow
it's like an illuminating balm it could
definitely be used as a primer as well I
love this
100% we purchased this I think it is
great
there are many lip favorites in this
video because you guys know I've been
suffering from my lips like the past
four months now they're kind of getting
better I'm still not at this age where I
feel comfortable wearing lipstick yet
the lip balm in the end that kind of
saved me although I still think I might
need to go see a dermatologist but the
lip balm in the end the only one that
works I swear I tried every lip balm
ever was the Bioderma moisturizing stick
this is my fourth stick I'm going
through these so quickly I just got it
for my local chemist it's so so good if
you suffer from dry lips just give this
one a go because I tried so many and
none of them works in this one like
instantly made them feel better so I'm
in love with that I will repurchase that
forevermore okay I've got one perfume
favorite before we go on to makeup stuff
this is the Jo Malone nutmeg and ginger
Cologne and I wore this on my wedding
day along with blackberry and Bay which
is one of my old favorites this isn't
like an everyday perfume for me but it's
really special and I'm so glad I
discovered it it smells like a beautiful
spa and it will always remind me of the
wedding and so I absolutely love this
perfume last year I discovered the Real
Techniques complexion sponge which
completely changed the way I apply my
foundation I used to always use the Real
Techniques buffing brush or the Bobbi
Brown one what's called the buffing
brush there version but now I use a wet
sponge and I never use a brush to apply
my foundation I really think this is the
best way I thought it was such a fast
before I tried it and I actually did try
the Beauty Blender and then I kind of
wasn't into it and didn't use it for
months and then I tried this and I don't
know what the difference is but I loved
it I think it's the shape I basically
run this onto water and make it really
wet squeeze it out and then no matter
what foundation or base I'm applying I
will use this to Pat it in and if you
want that kind of jewy skin I just think
this mesh is your foundation so much
better with your skin it makes it look
so much more natural it does mean that
if you want a fuller coverage you head
end up having to do kind of more layers
than you would do with a brush but now
when I use a brush I just feel like my
foundation sits on top of my skin this
is the only way to really make it look
like it's part of my skin I use it for
concealer as well but I tend to kind of
go over my concealer again and use a
brush just because this kind of meshes
the concealer too much I I love this I
have four of them on the
at the moment a foundation I discovered
this year is the hourglass mm vanish
foundation I think it's called I've got
two shades here ivory and nude neither
of them are perfect for me so I'm
definitely to go to a counter and see if
I can find like the perfect match but
this is such a great foundation I am
going through it quite fast because it's
very creamy but it's basically a stick
foundation wind-up I just kind of put a
few strips on my face and then I have to
use a really wet sponge because at the
beginning I find it quite hard to like
move around the face but once I've
blended it in it does take a little bit
extra work but once it's blended in I
just think it looks so nice I always get
so many compliments when I wear it and
wearing it today I think it's good when
I'm like filming or if I have an event
it's slightly full of coverage that my
other foundations but still like so
glowy and natural and so easy for
traveling on the go I just think it's a
great foundation a couple of lip
products last year was the year of the
nude lip for me I just really went off
red lip even during the Christmas season
well by the time Christmas came I had my
so lip situation so I really don't think
I wore red lip throughout the whole year
which is crazy
I could probably throw in loads of lip
products but I just wanted to talk about
the two main ones that kind of stick out
in my memory Laura Mercier spiced rose
it's a gorgeous nude but like a brownie
nude
it's very 90s it's very chic I just
think it's so pretty and 2016 was also
the year of the Kylie lip kit and I'm a
fan I think they're great I've also
enjoyed like the Stila liquid lipsticks
which are definitely easier to get hold
of but I think the Kylie lip kits really
did impress me last year how I shadow is
did as well I'm excited to see what
happens with the range to realize I've
kind of stopped though I'm not going to
keep buying online because I find the
process really stressful and expensive
I reckon at some point it'll be easier
to get hold of or she'll open a shop
here or something so I'm just kind of
holding out for now and watching what's
happening but I really did enjoy the lip
kits here I have candy Kay Posie K and
Dulci Kay and I think they were really
nice the Becca shimmering skin
perfectors have definitely been a
favorite for me champagne pop was
created by Jacqueline Hill who's an
amazing beauty youtuber in America and
it's a gorgeous like peachy champagne
like orangey highlighter I'm wearing it
today
if you can see it there
it's definitely like a wow highlight if
you want people to see your highlight
this is the one to use and it's so
pretty I just absolutely love it but the
other one I use on days where I just
want like quite a natural highlight is
moonstone this is really pretty as well
and this is just one of the better like
original shades but I think better
highlighters are so nice the Anastasio
ones are also great but I think I would
pick the better ones if I had to pick
between the two and the brush that I
discovered in 2016 to apply my
highlighters with is the morphe M 501
this was also recommended by Jaclyn hill
and I bought it when I was in New York
it's so great it's the perfect size you
could probably just buy it from any
brand it's like a basically a big
eyeshadow brush it's really fluffy and
it's the perfect size for highlighter I
think before I was using a brush that
was too big and my highlights would just
be too much this is way more precise you
can just put it exactly where you want
it I have two mascaras to talk about the
first one is the one I'm wearing today
and it's Charlotte Tilbury legendary
lashes I was so disappointed when I
tried Charlotte Tilbury the first
mascara I really really didn't like it
but when she bought out the legendary
lashes it's the most incredible mascara
is definitely my favorite all-time
mascara which is like a big thing I also
like the Clinique high impact extreme
volume I haven't repurchase that one for
a while but I do really like this I just
bought YouTube it's so good I always
recommend it to people and if you're
looking for a waterproof mascara the one
that I really love is the bourgeois
volume reveal waterproof this comes with
a little mirror on the side which is
pretty cool if you like doing your
makeup on the tube or something I really
really like this it's got like a plastic
brush head and so you really get like
defined long lashes whereas this one's a
bit more like fluffy lashes but these
two have definitely been my favorite
mascara is from this year we just
realized that I forgot to talk about
this when I was talking about
highlighters this is Mac hush it's a
cream highlighter and this was used on
me on my wedding day and since then I've
used it so much I love it whenever I see
Sam Chapman or Nick Chapman and they
have like amazing highlighter I always
ask like what highlight you're wearing
and it's always this they love this
stuff Sam used it on me in my
day it's a gorgeous like peachy golden
cream highlight this is like my day
highlighter and I love it
I also discovered the benefit precisely
my brow pencil I love that anastasia
brow wiz but it's really hard to get
hold of and benefits obviously way more
easier to get whole dogs and boots it's
kind of everywhere and I really think
there is that keep the same so I've been
using this since I got it I would
definitely repurchase it I'm using shade
for it's just got a pencil on one end
it's like a really soft I like using the
little ones rather than the big ones I
think the big ones often people think
it's easier I think you just end up
going over the top it's also got a
spoolie on the other end if you want to
brush through your brows this I actually
repurchase yesterday and this is Mac
groundbreaker it's my third eyeliner of
this I absolutely love it
it's part of their modern twist Kajal
liner range I'm so glad that it's
permanent because it's the perfect Brown
I find teddy as much as I love Mac teddy
it's quite a matte dark brown so it's
quite heavy
whereas I find this is perfect for
everyday it's somewhere in between like
a dark brown and a light bronze it's
like a medium brown with a tiny bit of
shimmer and it's so perfect every single
day without fail I will wear this well
on the final product the zoeva nude
spectrum eyeshadow palette so this is
what the palette looks like it's got
such a nice range of colors in it the
only ones I don't really use black
I hate when eyeshadow palettes are black
in it and this like bone color I don't
understand why palettes always for the
need to have those two colors in does
anyone ever really use them it's got a
really nice dark matte Brown which you
can use as a liner it's got like this
gorgeous red coppery shade which is just
really unique but it also has the like
easy to wear bronzes gold some nice
light a nice matte Brown for the crease
and under the eye this really pretty
kind of lilac e taupe shade this one
which is like Mac all that glitters
that's probably my most used one in the
palette so pretty I think this is an
incredible palette definitely one worth
investing in it kind of does everything
you need the packaging is a bit cheap
there's no mirror but I always do my
makeup in front of a mirror anyway I
just think that's such a good discovery
from last year so those are all my 2016
Beauty discoveries if you haven't seen
