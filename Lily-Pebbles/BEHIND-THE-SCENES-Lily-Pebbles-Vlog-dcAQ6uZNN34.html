Wednesday and it's a very very exciting
day for many reasons first of all Ana is
on her way over here she doesn't come
over much some excited to that and to
stay in the night tonight so I'm having
like a sleepover with my friend and we
are recording a special announcement
video today which you would have already
seen on Monday I'm so excited to finally
tell you guys that we are launching a
podcast I'll link the video here where
we explain what the hell I'm talking
about just in case you missed it but
today is Wednesday which means our first
episode would have been released this
morning and I can't wait for my future
self next Wednesday to be reading all of
your messages tweets and hopefully or
giving it five stars and leaving reviews
and all that good stuff so I can't wait
to hear the reaction nervous but yeah
when you guys are watch miss lock the
podcast would have been released already
so as mad I'm just pretty smart today
well ignore the pink thought some
trainers because I'm just going to the
station to pick up Ana but I'm wearing
my whistles jumpsuit which is a little
bit smart for Wednesday but I'm going to
a concert tonight and I haven't worn
this yet and I just thought it was a
good excuse I don't normally dress up
for concerts but we are in a box so I
don't know maybe I can get away with it
it's very comfy though so it doesn't
feel like I'm overdressed definitely not
wearing these I'm going to pop to the
shop to get some breakfast stuff I'm at
zero morning she was like I'm really
easy I just have like toast of cereal
and I was like yeah I don't have either
of those things because I don't really
normally eat breakfast so I'm going to
go to the local shop and get some bits
for tomorrow morning and then go pick up
Anna rich put the washing on before he
left this morning and it's been going
for so many hours and it's so loud
anyone just get like really irrationally
angry with the sound of a washing
machine oh shut up I'm just sitting in a
car waiting for Anna and it is pouring
with rain it's like freezing and
miserable the weather hasn't been bad in
ages so I think I'm gonna have to change
my outfit because this is like
sleeveless and I'm just cold I want to
get like a Dom foreign jeans so I think
I'm definitely gonna change when I get
home I didn't have time to go to the
shop before picking her up so I think
I'm gonna drive her there with me and
then she
picker and breakfast cause I'm wearing
Mac would wink I shadow which is just
such an old favorite of mine and it kind
of goes with a new coat so we're sitting
down now to film the announcement video
with Anna so that's not great shot of
you so that's like a great angle it's
really like we're like getting ourselves
in the mood for announcement but let's
do this we're now going to head into
town because I'm going to lunch again at
Percy and founders this is restaurant
I'd never been to and now I'm going to
it twice I packed an umbrella still
raining but we filmed our another video
and we got some research done for the
podcast oh it's so nice I can now talk
about the fact that we have August
research to do because obviously each
time we do a podcast we've got to
research the person we have we come up
with like a structure you know we're not
like reading questions when we talk to
them but we like to have some kind of
idea of how we see that episode going so
we've been meeting up a lot kind of
works on those and we've just well
actually on this up session wasn't that
productive but hopefully we're going to
do some more work this afternoon and
plan the next kind of three podcasts it
is such a relief to get to talk about it
my meeting doesn't start for another 15
minutes so i'm following Anna because
she goes by lunch and she's going to try
it our heroes key because she's never
tried it although I think Islands pokey
which is a convicted felon two different
brands so I think that hangover day I
never know how to say I don't embarrass
my science Tokyo there yeah very nice
colorful top it is I'm going to head
into Turkey and fountains for a meeting
and we'll try to drive off
just finishing up lunch and I happen to
you who have been having luggages this
is creepy

everything sorry Xena look it's so soft
I'm in the gleam office and someone has
brought back donuts from right in here
which is like Anna's I mean I'm a Dana
concern these Bob being incredibly
making yourself at home over what a fun
day suppose refurb actually I happened
yeah we've had a really productive well
semi productive not doing the things we
were supposed to do but doing other
things that have been great right so
like a gremlin oh I don't think I've had
like a strange bird of positivity always
fun we're now going to East Street which
is Thai obviously and we're going to
meet Fleur for dinner which we so nice

say Barcelona mean fly waiting for that

my directory but I think I'd be used to
be blogging by now it seems like
Barcelona Disney has attracted most
people there about I don't think it is
like an album track we just got home and
Ed Sheeran was so good much better than
last time I saw him I feel like he's
happier more enthusiastic and I didn't
notice it as just him on stage because
the sound was better it was just really
good I really enjoyed it rich has made

fair it looks like a single bed the fact
that my have a conveyor bed is real yes
