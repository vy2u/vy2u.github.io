today is going to be a nice day
it's Friday is the end of the week and
it's been a really short week because
Monday was a bank holiday so it's been a
four-day week so it feels like a
Thursday but it's actually a Friday and
I am seeing Anna today which of course
I'm very excited about and I'm also
seeing Carrie Anne dream who are our new
best friends and we just love them I
think we're also gonna get to meet Reem
sister Natalia which would be really
nice to be able to see her and all of
her snapchats and stuff I am starting
the day by rushing to the shops
I've got about half an hour actually I
need to go buy some bowls because I have
some sponsored instagrams to take and I
really want to get some nice bowls to
kind of make the photo look nicer so I'm
going to go buy some bowls I might have
a quick look in sales I'm pretty sure I
had some other things to buy I've got
like a list on my phone so I'm going to
quickly rush to the shops then I'm
hopefully gonna have time to go to my
mom's to get a lot of my pubic stuff
that gets sent in there and then I need
to drop our courtesy car back if you
guys remember dream vlogmas I had a car
crash well our car got written off that
is gone it's been squashed dead so sad
at the same time of telling us that they
also told us we need to give our curtsy
car back so from today onwards we have
no car which is a bit of a disaster
I know London is quite good for getting
around but where I live it's not that
easy and we're just so used to having a
car I've driven for over 10 years now
it's going to be weird this weekend and
I'm not really sure what we're going to
do lots of tubes buses and uba's I think
and we've also got to look into getting
a new car which is just not what we were
planning on doing this January to take
you the car back and then I'm going to
meet Kerry means Ana and Natalia and
we're going to go for brunch one of my
favorite places I am going to bring you
guys along with me today for all the
adventures and I'm going to try my best
to do one vlog a week so every Wednesday
hopefully I will upload a vlog and
sometimes they'll be really interesting
sometimes they'll just be like a day
like this but doing vlogmas shows me you
guys love my vlogs even if it's a boring
day they don't have to be epic so I
definitely want to try and do one vlog a
week for those of you that enjoy
watching them and we could he show you
what I'm wearing today before I go this
purrs from Anthropologie I got it as my
secret santa present for my mum jeans
are Topshop and I'm wearing tights
underneath because it's freezing and I'm
wearing my jigsaw boots I'm going to
take my camera with me today and
hopefully take some photos to do a blog
post because why do I use as Alicia's
try and block more so I'm going to try
and make content out of the stuff that
I'm already doing I'm going to take my
Gucci Soho just go back because I can
stuff so much in here like that I've got
my Olympus camera and another lens and
then hopefully a I'm going to change my
purse for a smaller one I'll be able to
fit in my vlogging camera and my tripod
right let's do this I've actually
stopped my bag for my silly mum because
it fits a lot more in and I haven't worn
it for a while anyway I put on my and
Other Stories scarf and my Zara jacket
they all good to go
okay I just got to the shops and it's so
exciting because mine and Anna's jumpers
have just gone back on stale we did a
restock with like more sizes and more
delivery options and maybe both on this
vlog goes up there might still be some
left I've no idea sorry if they sold out
quickly again we never know my phone's
going crazy with like notifications of
people buying jumpers so that you guys
so much for the support as always I'm so
happy that we were able to restock
because we didn't have plans to restock
and we were like let's just make it
happen because we don't we never one
like disappoint people so thank you
think thank you first shop I need to go
into with anthropology this is what I'm
getting this tea towel this bowl and
this nice pink one as well and two water
glass and I couldn't find three bowls
but I'm gonna get one somewhere else
pretty happy with my anthropology haul I
absolutely love the shop and I got
pretty much everything I need maybe to
get UX
that was a bit of a mad dash around
shops I didn't have time to vlog but
I've come over to my mom's to pick up
some of my posts I've got 15 minutes
anything on with my day I can see here
that I've been sent some of the Caitlyn
Jenner Mac collection and some wire sell
stuff and Jo Malone I was also sent some
leggings from sweaty Betty and he's are
so nice they're like a dark blues light
kind of marbled print they're called
zero gravity leggings it says say hello
to your new favorite leggings with our
new bum the sculpting superheroes this
is like a 31 days to fit challenge not
sure I'll be at working out 31 days in a
row but I do work out once a week so
these will come in really handy if we
can have to come home to drop off the
car I'm in such a rush I'm running so
late bye wants to show you guys what I
found in boots because I'm super excited
this is a travel wet brush so it's a
full-size wet brush which I love it's
the best brush for getting out tangles
but it folds in half love this don't
love that it's pink but how to get it
anyway

sometimes you have to wait like you
can't book a table at Granger and codes
you have to wait like 20 minutes maybe
depends how busy it is but it's Friday
and it's lunchtime so it's probably
quite busy I'm really excited because I
love the food here we're trying to eat

I'm picking up from M&amp;amp;S the double
chocolate mini bites we're now it
carries flat and oh my god it's just as
beautiful as you would imagine it to be
I feel like I need to give you like a
mini tour loving this print with the
light and the table loving the shelves
look at this amazing huge mirror we are
now leaving calories we've had such a
nice time here it's been like hours just
hanging out in her lounge which I'm in
love with I want to live here thanks for
having us um Anna were you doing you
bussing training to Brighton as welcome
home to Brighton been so long I just got
home feeling a little bit carsick for my
uber but I've had some water and I feel
good and I had such a nice day I love
hanging out with a neriman Carrie really
enjoying our little crew it's so nice to
see Carrie's home I was just showing
snapchat actually I'll show you guys on
the vlog this week which and I did some
meal planning this is from Kiki K which
is a really nice stationery shop there
Kikki K and we planned our meals this
week and it's worked out really well
I've had I made a big batch of muesli
and I've had that all week and then I
planned out dinners and like some of the
lunches of just being like leftover
dinners and it's been so nice it gets to
like 7:00 and clock 7:30 instead of
having to think all what should we make
we just come and look at the fridge and
we know that we've got the ingredients
to make these things right I have a huge
a sauce parcel here it's basically huge
because I have to order everything in a
10 and a 12 because I just don't know
what size I am ever my like antennas I
would show you guys but it's for an
upcoming haul potentially I needed to
get stuff for now but also stuff for my
honeymoon because we're going to South
Africa and it's going to be really warm
and I have no summer clothes so I've
ordered loads of stuff from ASOS I'm
going to try it all on and the stuff
that I like will probably feature it in
an upcoming
so maybe in this vlog I'll show you the
things I'm not going to keep which might
be Oliver because that happens a lot
when I would have made us get into a
parcel I really expected to love this
coat I mean it it was only available at
12 which I'm normally a 10 or 12 so I
didn't think it'd be that big but I
think because it's a boyfriend style
coat I literally look like I'm wearing
my dad's coat I love the length but yeah
this this is just a little bit too big
it looks like a dressing-gown on me I
picked this up thinking it would be in
like a jersey material just to wear on
like casual days because I really love a
deed of stuff but it's actually like a
kind of like prairie like sweaty
material so I think I'm going to go to
other outfits and see if I can find
something like this but in like a softer
material I do I think it looks really
nice it just doesn't feel it feels a bit
like I should be going to the gym or as
I want it to be more for like casual
wear I really like the pattern on this
dress and I love sin it's like thin but
it's long-sleeve it would be nice for
like dinner in the evening on a
honeymoon but it's something about I
think where the waist is there's like
too much fabric here so I feel like if
there's less fabric and the elastic was
a little bit higher where I'm kind of
smaller it would be more flattering was
I think it looks a little bit frumpy
which is a shame because everything else
I really like about the dress there have
been some very good things by the way
that I'm keeping I'm only showing you
the things I'm not keeping I think this
would look really cool on someone but
not on me and the neckline for one I
think is to like square I like the print
but he is a bit March all over and I
don't think this is flattering on me on
this area but somewhere else I think
this would look really cute I got these
really cool like high-waisted bikini
bottoms I never tried high-waisted
before but I actually really liked them
I'm going to keep them but I ordered the
bikini top in I mean I don't think they
have many sizes so I went for 32 double
D seriously a sauce look at my hand even
that's a double D it's like tiny didn't
even cover my nipple so I don't know I'm
gonna see what the sizes they have I
have no idea what size to order now I
mean I find it hard enough finding a bra
that fits the back was alright 32 so
maybe I'll just go up like loads of
cops I don't know so those are the fits
that I'm not keeping for my call and
you'll see everything else when I
eventually film this full video which
has kindly made dinner tonight because I
did it the rest of the night all theirs
but really dry do you have any barbecue
sauce what it is
oh man got dry like dry rub ribs ribs
sweet potato chips and salad
I'm currently editing some photos that I
took today of grain drink oh and Anna
took some outfit photos of me so I'm
hoping to turn that into some kind of
blog posts I also posted something on
Instagram and I've been trying really
hard at my Instagram in 2017 I know it
hasn't been long but let's see where
this goes
I'm just loving Instagram at the moment
I think of my favorite platform at the
moment although I don't love Instagram
stories I know that everyone's like
loving Instagram stories I know that
like some people that what I keep saying
like this is a new thing that's
happening to me tell me off every time I
start saying this is so and every time I
say like too many times please quite a
few people are quitting snapchat just to
do Instagram stories I find Instagram
stories so glitchy like as a viewer I
find it so hard to view as a social
media person it's much better because
you can like link to items and that you
can do more with it but I don't know
anyway I'm loving Instagram just like
the photo part of Instagram at the
moment I'm going to edit some of these
photos and we're going to have a cup of
tea oh yes he's already made one I was
going to hint but it's already being
made one step ahead we are going to
continue watching this is us and I hope
you guys enjoy today's vlog not much
