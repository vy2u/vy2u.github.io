with the one and only Bobby Brown how
are you I'm great how are you yeah I'm
really good thank you I'm so excited to
have you here
do they want part me yes oh my god
lovely I wish this is amazing in here I
thought as Bobby Brown is so well known
for being and New York cosmetics prime
then I'm from London and you've been
here all week I thought we talked a
little bit about London and makeup and
whatever things have put some questions
together first of all do you remember
your first ever visit to London um I do
it was a very long time ago I believe it
was when after two years when we
launched the brand so I guess it was
about 23 years ago I was a very long
time but it's my favorite city by far
really I'm always really excited to come
to London I love it so I Love New York
as well that's the only other place I
can imagine living yeah so what is some
of your favorite memories from coming to
London well certainly just walking my
husband I always just put our sneakers
on leave in the morning and I follow him
and we get probably 20,000 steps a day
and we see everything do everything and
you know I I love the stores and I
cannot believe how great the food scene
has become in London especially healthy
food yeah when I used to come here
twenty-something years ago the food was
not the best it was a lot of tea and
toast yes but now there's everything
there really is I know I'm obsessed with
like trying all the new restaurant
movers pharr have you been to pharmacy
yeah no I god that's what you had last
night that's food that's what I've ever
eaten
I can't it's gonna cost a lot of money
when I when I order it for lunch oh my
god I need to try it it's really good so
you obviously travel a lot I work and
personal and if we were to look inside
your suitcase what sort of things would
we find in there well it depends when I
travel for personal I have on I have
sneakers exercise sneakers and I have
another cool pair of sneakers that I
usually wear on the plane my husband
doesn't like to check bags so I take it
with me did I bring you know I always
start packing by exercise you know tight
shorts t-shirts a couple sweaters couple
scarfs that's about it boom yeah I don't
know dresses no Blazers yeah I bet
packings come
easy now it's gotten easier we're a lot
of Navy and a lot of black and I didn't
have fewer white things thrown in and
work is more complicated because I
usually have to bring five or six pair
of shoes because I'm five foot tall so
when I have a cocktail party afterwards
some very tall shoes and sometimes I see
the editors and I have to wear medium
shoes and other times I just say I'm
done and I put sneakers on yeah do you
use the same makeup when you travel do
you have different products that you
bring with you in Asia now I pretty much
use the same makeup and unfortunately my
makeup I have to dump it every night
because I end up trying so many new
things and I never know what's in my bag
yeah so I like to be organized and I am
pretty like I like things you know lined
up in orderly but then I get very busy
and it just becomes a mess yeah so I
pretty much pared it down do you have
like a bag I do not I do a hack
how would you describe a typical London
makeup look and do you think it's quite
different to the New York makeup look
well it's very funny because our City
collection that is out now celebrating
25 years we chose three iconic cities
it's going to say Chicago we're in front
with me because I'm in New York London
and Paris so New York you know you can
almost guess Browns you know a lot of
Browns and a tawny and then a nude lip
and Paris was the smoky gray and
charcoal with a little bit of white
highlight and a bright red lip so when I
thought about the UK
I thought about royal blue and you know
were low is not exactly a color of
makeup that I would say is wearable so
we have a royal we have a beautiful blue
gel liner that we're
Union Jack and that could be worn over
the beautiful more gray tones that is in
the London palette nice I love a blue
eyeliner they have oh then you'll love
it it's actually really pretty and it's
quite striking it was really nice like
hopefully yeah it's really pretty and
then in the palette there's a darker one
more Navy yes so this is the London
palette little more peachy or cheek and
a little soft peach on the eyes which is
pretty not that an elliptic goes with it
is called your majesty which was created
and inspired by Queen love it that's
very nice I love the nude as well yeah
well that's called Bobbie the color is
called Bobbie actually I really it is my
favorite color yeah which is a nude lip
just you saying that's not like everyone
gonna wonder about my mummys favorite
meal so in London if you go on the chief
during rush hour which I haven't you
haven't don't haven't you know me I'm
everything I used to travel by the tube
yes
no but now I luckily I have John yeah so
if you go during rush hour you're likely
to see girls doing women doing their
makeup on the road to work and I've seen
some like terrible liquid foundation and
airline disasters right I also once saw
a lady do liquid eyeliner without
holding on and it was incredible Wow I
actually captain
she was a yoga instructor that had very
strong yes exactly
but do you have any tips for women who
want to do their makeup on the go
definitely because that's how I do my
makeup
I honestly I've never done my makeup
sitting in my bathroom really and that's
a true story I do it in the car if I'm
driving in my town I do it at stoplights
and I have pulled over even but I do it
in the back of the car on the way to
work and so I have a little palette that
I that I customized
put concealer corrector blush in it and
then I just kind of throw it on really
quickly yeah and you know you don't want
to spend a lot of time lining your eyes
when you're driving or you're on the
subway even though that one lady did it
yeah yeah so you know easier things and
things you could use the two places like
the pot Rouge you could put on your
cheeks in your lips that's yeah so easy
they say what is your favor
in London spend time in like where do
you normally hang out when you come here
well I'm on it's very interesting
because I stay a lot it I can't say
right come on
Conan Conan hot corner every day a
wonderful hotel coño thank you I have a
spokesperson I I love this hotel I stay
here whenever I come so I really am
learning this area yeah Mayfair like its
Mayfair right exactly say I saw where
Bridget Jones lived the neighborhood so
there's so many undiscovered
neighborhoods here yes so cool so you
have stores and counters all over yeah
well then you have ever gave most of
them in the UK really I have I am 10 10
that's a Miss and we have one in the
United States of America Wow yes that
almost two we have two right now
amazing and I love the studio in Covent
Garden I went now recently with my
friends and sisters and I had makeovers
and it was so nice and obviously what I
love about the brands you don't just
focus on like makeovers and selling
products it's a lot about teaching women
how to do their own makeup why is that
so important well often makeup artists
that think it's all about them you know
how amazing they are blending 15 colors
together I started the brand teaching
women how simple makeup was and and
still is
so I teach my artists how you're only as
good as the woman that does for own
makeup it's not about how good you are
it's how good they are at learning it's
about how good a teacher you are yeah so
we created these things called how to's
so when you go to a counter and you say
I don't know how to look less tired I
don't know how to line my eyes I don't
know how to you know teach my daughter
about makeup and it's very simple ways
you know for women to learn themselves
yeah it's so important because even when
my friends have found me asked me to do
half of it there's no point in walking
away feeling great because in there
right against it themselves right yeah I
love that you're obviously here to
launch the be who you are going yes me
tell us a bit about that sure be who you
are actually is celebrating 25 years but
it's really just you know reminding and
enhancing the brand message you know I
started the company 25 years ago with a
few products in a simple philosophy that
it's about being comfortable in your
skin it's about being confident
and for a woman to look like herself and
that's finding her true nudes her true
colors and so 25 years later it's the
same message so the campaign we shot it
in four days in my home studio not in my
home but in my studio near my home we
had 40 women four models including those
women and it was an amazing time Wow
yeah women of all ages skin colors and
if you go on the website you hear their
stories that's because I'm all about
beauty stories Wow and 25 years is epic
it was a pretty abject you know it's
amazing to me that my oldest son is 26
because I started the company when I was
pregnant with them wow that is amazing
and if you could go back kind of 25
years and give your younger self some
advice well I would certainly tell my
younger self how good I look because
even 25 years ago you know oh my god I
look tired I like this my hair is this
I'm you know not tall I'm not this I
wish I looked like I did 25 years ago so
my my advice to myself now which I work
on all the time is appreciate Who I am
now
because in 25 years from now we 85 sorry
yeah yeah I do think I'm a parent 59 on
59 I could still say I'm in my 50s yeah
yeah so I'm in 25 years I will be 85
which is crazy I love some of the early
phases of you like actually making stuff
working they're so cool I still I cannot
believe I'm still backstage fashion
working I work with my artists and I
really enjoy it yeah it's amazing it's
amazing to love what you do yeah thing
that is and I don't really think about
my age and I don't spend a lot of time
you know looking in the mirror and
cutting myself apart I just don't and
you know I'm a mom to three boys so we
don't really talk a lot about Beauty
phanpy yeah as you know I just got
married yes like yesterday yep pretty
much and for my makeup I really wanted
to just look like
I didn't want to look different on my
wedding day I just wanted to look like
in the outside of myself and I know a
lot of women I speak to you now say that
they do their own makeup right on the
other day so do you have any tips or
advice for people who want to do their
own makeup but they want to make sure
that is good I do I have a lot of advice
and I'm really proud that I really think
that the Bobby Brown is the brand for
brides because it does allow women to
look like themselves so we have you know
definitely we have how to is a counter
how to do it but my advice is you have
to have a foundation that matches your
skin because when the flash goes off if
it doesn't match it's not going to look
natural so that's yellow tone you have
to wear corrector because you have to
brighten under your eyes for the photos
and you should wear all of all of your
eyeshadows should be long wearing your
eyebrows long wearing yeah so we have
formulas that you can literally put on
gel liner 12 hours and waterproof
mascara yeah and don't forget the blush
I think I underestimated how sweaty I
was gonna get any day after the dancing
oh my god pretty hard today yeah but
hopefully all the main pictures are over
by that exactly
they definitely were I think now just to
end the video we thought we'd do a
little bit of makeup moment okay and
talk a bit about transforming makeup day
to night and maybe if you'd like to you
can kind of top up what I've got sure
because I know a lot of especially like
London girls at the end of the day on
their desk lights just I want to make
sure out absolutely okay so to go out in
the evening people don't realize just
touch up a little bit under the eyes so
I'm going to add a little bit more of
corrector and this is the color I use
and it's great because it's not too
light but it really I want to show you
because it really looks good yeah and
I've used it for years yeah and then you
have such beautiful skin you don't
really need anything but I tell people
to make sure that they just test and see
if there's something to touch up a
little bit on the nose and this is the
retouching pencil so it's really easy
you can
in the back of the taxi you could do it
in your office at your desk and you just
touch it up and if someone has a blemish
it's easy yeah that's always the first
basically ever I might need to always
read yeah everybody's and you've got
beautiful skin a lot of women have a lot
of redness but this could cover anything
up you said you love a bit of balloon so
I'm going to use Union Jack right over
your day liner and did you line your
eyes with gel or with pencil today
andropause it's kind of like a gel
pencil okay so I'm going to put it right
over open up for a second that's so nice
I mean you go stronger than that I think
that's pretty nice good right it kind of
mixes with the brown it does yeah so and
I use someone that likes a red or a dark
lip or you more a light lip person I
like both I'm definitely having more of
a nude moment well especially if you've
got a little bit of you know color on
your eyes yeah it is is definitely good
okay and then you can add a little bit
of sparkle so we have this really pretty
color and it's called pebble it's named
off me it it had been actually a really
pretty color and you could use either
your finger or a brush and sometimes the
back of the car you just use your finger
and it's so pretty this is from the
sparkle collection line you have a
little blush on I'm going to add a wee
bit more so since we've got the London
collection happening here a little bit
and I like to use it almost as a bronzer
at night and then I'm going to add a
little bit of the highlighting powder
so then I'm gonna actually make your
lips a little bit softer
let me try almost news and see what it
does get a little peppermint at ya I
like this one especially since we just
put shimmer on your lips and your cheeks
I think we'll keep this not shimmery so
pretty you want to look and see yeah
that's so nice ah that highlight is
amazing also I love the eyeliner yeah
it's definitely weather yeah really like
it's nice around your eyes thank you
welcome a woman that doesn't need very
much more thank you I was wearing lots
to begin with so that everything I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
