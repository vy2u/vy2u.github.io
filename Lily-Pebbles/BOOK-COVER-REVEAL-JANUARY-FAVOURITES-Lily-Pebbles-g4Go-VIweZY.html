today is a very very exciting video it
is my January favourites but it's got
one absolute mega favorite in it and
that is my book cover I didn't want to
do like a whole book cover reveal video
because I was like I don't know if
there's that much to say but saying that
this will probably turn into a really
long video but I just thought I would
add it into my January favourites
instead but it does deserve a hype
because this was a big deal for me as
I'm sure you know and if you don't know
I wrote a book it's called the f-word
it's coming out on March 8th which is
International Women's Day and I can't
wait everything's getting really
exciting now there's so much fun stuff
coming up it's gonna be mental but one
of the most difficult things apart from
writing the book was coming up with a
cover for it it's something I thought
about since day one but really tried to
put into the back of my mind because I
had to concentrate on writing the book
and then as soon as that was done we
were like okay cover and I'm a creative
person and it's so important to me so I
was just like oh my god I can't deal
with this pressure I found it really
stressful but I love it I'm so happy
with it
so let me talk you through how I got to
this cover and then I promise I'm gonna
show you you won't have to wait much
longer I'm not making you wait to the
end of the video I promise so the book
is about female friendship and it's
really hard because there aren't many
items or symbols that signify friendship
a lot of them are very young and cheesy
Diaries friendship bracelets crossing
your fingers like that and we really did
explore all the options but I wanted it
to signify adult modern female
friendship which is what the book is all
about and the thing that I've in my had
in my head since day one is a cup of tea
for some people catching up with a
friend you know some people like get
into bed and snuggle with their
girlfriends for me it's always a cup of
tea like me my friends catching up over
a cup of tea and a lot of people said
wine as well like that was something we
explored in the end we decided to kind
of focus around catchin up over a cup of
tea in terms of like how it looks I
always had this image in my head of it
being quite I don't either wise
geometric but I really like lines and I
wanted it to look like a pretty coffee
table book but also look and represent
what's inside the book as well okay I'm
gonna show you
this is just a mock-up for by the way so
this is not the final book it's
literally a piece of paper stuck on
someone else's book so it's a little bit
off-center not gonna live are you ready
this is my book cover I can't believe
I'm showing you this I'm gonna quickly
talk you through it this section up here
is marble this section down here is navy
blue with my name in gold foil and then
there's this middle section which is
pink and that wraps all the way around
to the back as well and on the side it
says the f-word lily pebbles pod um yeah
this is the cover that's the title this
is the image and the strap line says a
personal exploration of modern female
friendship so this is the kind of
central image that took us a long time
to get to but I'm so happy with it these
are actually my hands up here and
wearing my favorite nail polish the one
I wore on my wedding day this is merely
my manager and then this is lovely
Christabel who came and helped me out
I've got a few clips from the day when
we were taking this photo I will link
down below the photographer Saphir who
took the photos she was absolutely great
as well
I'm so happy how it came out we did it
on our my marble dining table downstairs
and it really ties in nicely with the
book and for me this just shows what
it's like to catch up with your
girlfriends I really like the text on
the back I just think the colors work
well together and I'm so happy with it I
think if I saw that in a shop I would
definitely want to pick it up I love it
I really love it I'm so happy with it
I will put that your cover up on screen
now so you can see it really clearly
I'll move to the side so I can put this
here and but yeah it was it was so hard
to pick a cover way harder than I ever
thought it would be but I'm really
really happy with it and I really hope
you guys love it too I don't really know
what else to say it's very weird to hold
this even though this isn't my actual
book I won't get a copy of my book until
like a week before it comes out it's a
very strange feeling to see it in book
form I'm just so proud I feel like I'm
gonna be talking a lot about this book
over the next couple of months so bear
with me it's such a massive project for
me oh my god I haven't shown you the
inside of the book sorry this is also
Redux I think this was like a last
minute addition I suddenly thought oh my
god there's that
but at the book we can do something cool
there this is what we've gone for it's
like a navy kind of Dalmatian print kind
of I just think that looks really cool
I'm really happy with that actually I
came out so well what I really what a
relief to show you the cover I can't
believe it this literally just came
through the door by the way so I feel
like it hasn't even like sunken in yet
okay now I'm going to talk through my
January favorites which just feels weird
to move on to this but that's my epic
big favor of the month but I need to get
on before it gets too dark because it's
like four o'clock and it's gonna get
really dark in a minute my first
favorite is the glossy a perfume when I
first smell this I really didn't think
that I was gonna like it I thought it
was quite like floral I was like I'm not
sure but I actually love it now I wear
it almost every day it's got the kind of
like edge to it that the eccentric
molecule oh one perfume has it's just
something a little bit edgy and
different also scalp smells a lot like
the stellar perfume to me which is one I
used to love things of use half half of
this bottle may be such a nice perfume
definitely try it you can order a sample
when you order things with glossy age so
next time you make an order give the
perfume ago it's worth it
primers the one I was using for the
whole of Christmas and most of January
was actually the laura mercier radiance
primer I went back to this this is like
an old favorite it's a really nice
hydrating creamy primer that's got a
gorgeous glow to it and but I did stop
using this and move on to the Smashbox
one when I discovered that which I had
to add into this because I'm obsessed
with it so this one's a bit more like
creamy this one's more like a serum it's
very hydrating but it hasn't got a glow
to it so to make this one a little bit
glowy because I love having that kind of
come through my foundation I've been
adding this into it this is the neon
knild photography fluid opacity 12% and
this is such an interesting product this
is like it literally looks like a white
serum but it's it's glowy it's like not
at all glittery it's like a lit from
within glow you can use this by itself
as a highlighter as a primer but I've
been enjoying mixing these two together
I'm not going to do cutaways in this
video because it's getting so dark it's
gonna be really difficult and I want to
get this video up on time so I'm just
gonna link to all the products down
below if you
wanna look more into them and take a
little closer look I've got a couple of
like home centi favorites this one is
the dip teak bay candle I got sent one
of these like luxury candles a while ago
I think when I was living in my flat and
I saved it for the house and I've just
been loving burning this it looks
gorgeous obviously look how much I've
used I've really been taking care of it
I've been like cutting the wick make
sure it doesn't burn for too long or for
too short and it's doing really well
it's burning really clean when people
walk in they're just like oh my god what
is that smell it's incredible
Bay it's just lovely and he's got
blackcurrant in it it's such a nice
scent definitely go smell that if you're
near a Dipity store counter and then the
other scent are our entryway smelt a bit
like funky for a while so I wanted to
get a reed diffuser this one is from
Oliver Bowness I actually bought this
separate this is just the kind of
container because the one that the scent
I liked
it comes in just like a plain glass one
and it wasn't as nice so I bought this
and I decanted into it
the Oliver bonus I think it's Indian
pomelo and the only reason I went to
give that as smell was because my mum
has it and it's so nice you walk into
the home and it just like hits you this
like fruity fresh scent everyone who
comes into my house comments on it and
they always think it's the candle that
sits next to this but it's definitely
this reed diffuser so all the liquid
sits in there and then these like sticks
the liquid kind of soaks through them
and that's how the scent kind of
circulates and it's so strong you can
really smell it but it's not
overpowering at all so if you're after a
really fresh kind of reed diffuser to
make your home smell clean and fresh the
indian pomelo one-component bonus is fab
this is quite a random favourite but I
got this from the white company you ask
you have to ask for it it's behind the
till but it's a is it pilling or piling
I think it's a piling comb I'm not
really sure it looks like this and this
is for cashmere jumpers or any sort of
jumpers of that similar sub material you
know in your jumpers get a little bit
bubbly
I hate that and I've never known what to
do about that that's what this is for
this trip is almost like a Velcro strip
it's similar and you just rub it over
your jumpers and it just catches those
little bubbles without pulling or
damaging the jumper at all so this is
such a good way to look after those kind
of more expensive cashmere jumpers or
anything
more delicate and it gets rid of the
bubbles it's genius I love it I keep
telling everyone to buy it it's like
four pounds so worth its if you're gonna
buy a nice jump that you might as well
look after it properly really happy we
have a hot I also wanted to add in here
a couple of style favorites I haven't
got it on me but I will add in a photo
of my Suzanne Jo coat I'm pretty sure
it's the Joko and I love it so much I've
wanted a camel coat for so long and they
really kindly sent me this one and it's
so it's such good quality it's quite
thick and structured it looks really
smart I feel like when I wear blue jeans
and vans I can really wear it dress it
down and make it quite casual but if I
wear it with like black skinny jeans and
high boots I can really make it quite
smart and I've just been loving it I
love the more kind of structured coats I
kind of can't get enough of it and I
can't believe I didn't have a camel coat
before this one and they're so handy
definitely recommend getting a camel
coat in your wardrobe and then to go
with that I've really been enjoying my
Topshop Baker boy hat which I've spoken
about a lot but I just think wearing
those together I think they look really
nice very into the Baker boy hat thing
okay two TV favorites to finish this off
one is the sinner we watched this in two
days we literally smashed it but it was
so good
Jessica Biel is incredible it's a murder
mystery but it's not a whodunit it's
like a why done it if that makes sense
and she is brilliant in it I really
enjoyed it I kind of wish that I haven't
watched it so I could watch it again
it's so good I probably would watch it
again definitely recommend that that's
on Netflix I think and then the other
one is peaky blinders rich got me into
it he'd actually watched like three
seasons already but he really wanted me
to watch it so he reworked it with me
from the beginning it's based just after
the first world war in Birmingham and
it's all about the gangs these are like
specific gangs called peaky blinders
used to wear those kind of Old English
hats and but they keep little like knife
blades in the front and use them to
fight with I'm really not into that sort
of thing normally but it's so great that
actors are brilliant it's so well cast
the costumes the the scenery the
production of it is like beautiful it's
so well done that it really is
definitely worth watching I'm kind of in
love with the main character I just
think it's great I watched the whole
thing like I think it's like four
seasons maybe five it's just taken us a
long time
but I finished it I'm really excited for
the new season to start whenever that is
I very much enjoyed it and would
definitely recommend watching that as
well we watched someone Netflix in
someone's sky I think so so good I think
may is it all my favorites I kind of
whisked through that because I'm just on
some like hi after revealing my cover
just gonna just gonna show it one more
time very exciting I can't wait to see
you guys all receive your books and
hopefully take photos where they take
photos of the cover I'm gonna leave
below the links if you would like to
preorder my book as I've said in
previous videos is so helpful to
pre-order I know it's a bit weird
pre-order books because you don't get it
straight away you get it when the book
comes out but for my end of things it is
so helpful just to like hopefully get
somewhere in the charts and it helps as
loads of different things so if you
would like to I would really appreciate
it and obviously I want you guys to get
it like the day it comes out so it will
just come through your letterbox loads
of people are asking if it's available
in America and the best links you use if
you're in America is the UK Amazon link
it will ship to America there's book
topia for Australia and New Zealand and
WH Smith have signed copies for those in
the UK so I will leave all the links
down below I would so love it if you got
the book I can't wait to read it
also terrified excited and terrified in
equal measures I'm gonna stop rambling
now but thank you guys so much for
watching this video hope you have a
really great Sunday and a great week
ahead I'm off to Miami tomorrow I can't
wait for a bit of sunshine I will see
