hope you all having a really great
weekend so far today I have a Boots haul
for you guys I'm so excited to be
working with boots you guys know I love
the brand it's where I've been shopping
since forever
I remember going in there like 12 13
years old and buying my first clear lip
gloss I remember it smell of coconuts I
was obsessed with it so it's really fun
to be working with them on this video
this month they're running they're three
for two offer which runs until the 26th
of September is such a good deal it runs
across makeup and hair care on selected
brands and products I would put all the
details down below so you guys know how
you can take advantage of the 3/4 to
offer
also in September they're launching
their new Beauty season campaign which
is all about stepping into autumn and
revamping your makeup it's about how you
can make little changes to your makeup
which will make a big difference to your
look and for me spring and autumn is a
time where I love to revamp my makeup
collection get rid of old things they're
like way past their expiry date and then
buy a few new pieces to add into my
collection as part of their new Beauty
season boots have identified that pink
is set to be a key color trend for
autumn makeup which I'm totally happy
about you guys know I love pink you can
see it here I usually wear kind of
Burgundy's and greens more in autumn but
I think pink is just a color that's
sticking around so I purchased a few
kind of lighter blush pink makeup items
as well to show you in this video and as
I was going around the shop I realized
that I was kind of buying enough
products to make up a whole look so I
made sure I got like one of every item
and I applied all the makeup before
sitting down so when I'm talking through
the products I can show you guys
cutaways of me applying them so the
order 5 products here in my boots bag
and I'm gonna go through one by one and
show you what I picked up spoiler alert
I'm really happy with the things that I
chose right let's get on with the haul
the first thing I bought is a foundation
I was looking at the Max Factor new
foundation but I tried on the back of my
hand and I wasn't entirely sure was for
me and then I saw this one which is also
new from number 7
I feel like number 7 as a brand doesn't
get enough kind of height but the
products are so so nice this is the lift
and luminate triple action see
Foundation and I'm always interested in
foundations that are called serum
foundations because I know they're gonna
be extra hydrating and they're not gonna
be heavy and cakey I got this in the
shade beige which I think I have to
trying it on I've realized it's maybe a
little bit too dark for me but once I
blended it in with a damp sponge it did
mesh into the skin very easily and it
feels great on the skin feels really
similar to the CC cream that I use every
day and you can build this up as well if
you want a bit more coverage like around
the nose and the chin which is where I
do it feels really nice I think it would
work really well on a slightly more
mature skin as well and it comes in a
pretty sleek packaging so I was very
impressed with the foundation and I
really like how it's like sitting on my
skin now I went a bit nuts for
concealers I'm not sure why I mean I've
always loved concealers but I love
trying out different drugstore
concealers so I bought three let's talk
about the one from Maybelline first this
is more of a brightener actually I have
the Maybelline the eraser eye it's one
of my all-time favorite concealers I
really really love it would highly
recommend it and then this is new from
Maybelline it's the eraser eye
brightener so it's like a pinky formula
so the idea of a brighten is that you
put it on the dark circles under your
eye and it it just lifts and you can
then put concealer on top it comes in
the same sponge applicator that you
twist to get the product out and it is
very pink it does blend in and there's
no denying that it definitely brightened
up my under-eye area
I bought two more concealers and I used
one on one side of my face and the other
one on the other this one is from
L'Oreal Paris and it's the H perfect
radiant concealer this very much looks
like a dupe for the NARS one the color
was maybe a little bit too yellow for me
but I really love the flat day 4
applicator and the formula was really
nice
I feel like drugstore concealers used to
be so cakey and it's just not the case
anymore it blended in really nicely sat
on the skin really well but then I think
if I had to pick between the two my next
concealer i think i slightly preferred
this one is from revlon and it's the
revlon youth FX fill and blur concealer
this is part of a new range that they've
got that has a face primer a forehead
primer and a foundation I got the
concealer I really like the packaging
you click
at the bottom and it comes out of a
little foam applicator it's not as big
as the Maybelline one it's actually like
a third of the size which I just find a
lot easier to use under the eyes I
really like the finish of this it's
quite similar to the L'Oreal one but you
get a little bit more coverage and I
feel like this is a great concealer to
just throw in your handbag for touch-ups
just because the packaging is so great
this next product I've actually tried
before but I wanted to buy another one
because I can't find my one I don't know
where I think I lost it somewhere but
this is from L'Oreal Paris
it's the glam bronze cushion delay so
this is part of their cushion range and
it's a cushion bronzer I think these are
so good I've tried like solid cream
bronzers I have a cream bronzer that I
really like and obviously powder
bronzers but there's something about
these that are just so easy to use comes
in this packaging and it comes with a
little sponge which I don't really use
and then it opens up and you can just
push your brush or your sponge in there
and apply straight onto your cheek and
although it may look heavy at first
they're so easy to blend out at very
sheer like water-based formula and I
feel like you can get a really nice
natural contour with liquid bronzer you
can also just put it across your
cheekbones and across your nose for a
more like summery look but really this
just works all year round I think it's a
really great bronzer so to go with this
or pink look that's very on-trend for
autumn I picked up a pink blusher and
then left a pinky lipstick this one is
from the natural collection they seem to
have upped their game because their
blushes used to be really little with
like a lid I remember buying them all
the time this one has a little flicky
packaging and it has blush imprinted in
it and this is just a really pretty pink
shade it's in Rose blush I thought would
be a very easy to wear blusher which it
is packaging is very sleek and simple
but also keeps the brine like very
affordable okay now onto my eyebrows and
I had to pick this up of course it's the
ILA and Fleur de force collaboration
Fleur as a friend of mine and these are
so so great I think there's three light
medium and dark this is the brow define
sorry so it's a double-ended pencil with
a lighter color and a darker color even
though I have very dark brows I went for
medium because I don't like to make them
darker I just want to fill in the
Front's and the arch just
kind of fill in the gaps but I don't
want to make them even darker than they
are so I have a medium and I really like
this pencil the lighter color is perfect
for the front of my brows and then the
darker color is perfect for the arch and
it's a great dupe for some of the more
expensive eyebrow pencils out there and
look how pretty flower looks such a good
products just a whole range of brow
products and I would definitely
recommend checking them out I then set
my brows with the Max Factor natural
brow styler sculpting gel so there's
just a clear eyebrow gel and I pretty
much collect these I love trying
different ones actually let's see yeah
it hasn't made by eye brows crispy at
all which is the number one thing I
check for all my eyebrows crispy have
they got white bits in them because
you'd be surprised at how many do that
and this one hasn't it seems to set them
in place but kept them kind of soft so
I'm just looking at myself in the
computer I think this is great actually
and if it saves me money cuz the one I
usually use is quite expensive so I'm
definitely repurchase this okay now
let's get onto eyes and I saw this
product and I tried it on the back of my
hand I was like wow I really like this
it's from L'Oreal Paris and it's the eye
paint it's meant to be an eye kind of
primer base this is in the color nudist
so it's a light brown but a little dough
for applicator and you put all over the
lid and it is very sheer you could wear
this alone if you wanted like a really
minimal makeup look but the idea is that
you put it on before your eyeshadow and
it works so well as a base it's the
perfect kind of warm brown for me
I love these tones and it's got a slight
kind of slip to it that makes it feel
like a primer really really like that I
think I'll definitely use that on
weekends when I just want a very simple
eye and then for eyeshadows I picked up
a couple of the NYX like solo mono or
eyeshadows these are so affordable and
the quality's really nice to me ages to
decide on a color I went for day club
which is a kind of golden shimmer and I
thought that would look really nice all
over the lid it's kind of like a
champagne shimmer I'd say so I just
brushed that all over the lid and then I
went in with happy hour which is a matte
Brown and I like to put that in the
crease and blend it in and then under
the eye just a crime to find a bit more
and I don't know that's just the look I
like to do like a lot
the eyelid and then the matte Brown of
the crease and under the eye you could
definitely kind of build this up and go
quite heavy it's a weekend so I didn't
want to do my makeup too heavy today but
these are really good quality such an
affordable price and very impressed by
necks okay now onto mascara and I knew
exactly which mascara I wanted to get
because this is new and I've heard so
many people talk about it it's the
L'Oreal Paris paradise ecstatic comes in
its packaging it's quite different and
packaging for L'Oreal I think it's like
a rose gold it's really pretty actually
and I really like this mascara it's got
a big fluffy brush so if you're into
like the more plasticy brushes this
might not be for you but I kind of like
either it depends on the look I'm going
for
I like the plasticky brushes for more
subtle lashes whereas this gives you
really full lashes I'm very impressed
with it I'm definitely gonna keep this
in my collection and use it all up so
that's a really good new launch from
them ok the final product is a lipstick
and I wanted a pinky nude I don't really
wear like bright pinks and baby Pink's
don't really sue me because I've got
dark features but I always find that a
nudey pink is like my perfect nude color
this again is from number 7 they have so
many lipstick shades to pick from so I
knew that that was the brand I wanted to
go and look at for a lipstick and this
is in the shade honey bloom it's very
creamy
it's a nudey pink it's just such an easy
lipstick to wear you could pair this
with a really heavy kind of smokey eye
at night or just wearing like I am now
for like a daytime look very easy to
apply on the lips it's not too matte
it's not kind of shimmery or pearly it's
a great everyday lipstick really happy
that I picked that up it was the first
shade I picked up I just saw the tester
and I was like that's gonna be the one
tried at my hand I was like yeah that's
exactly the shade that I want so that's
everything for the whole let me know
what you guys think of the products I
picked up if you've tried any of you
have any opinions on them don't forget
to check out boots this month and all
the amazing offers they have on
especially the 3/4 to such a good deal I
really enjoyed doing a little haul for
you guys and I'll see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
