lifelong dream watching the beat beats
girl
good morning everyone today is Sunday
the 18th of December I had a day of
logging yesterday but I am back on it
today I've just been getting ready do my
makeup and hair I look so tired
it's Sunday and my lips are still so saw
the this part of my lips feels much
softer since I've been using the biodome
and lip balm but the edges are so
cracked still I'm gonna book an
appointment at the doctor's this week
and if she even suggests a lip balm to
me I will punch her and get arrested I'm
fine with that we have a few things we
need to do today I need to go to a
couple of shops to get some Christmas
presents I need to go to Ikea to buy
some frames because I have a couple of
prints that I want to frame and put up
in my office and I think then we're
going to the pub for my brother-in-law's
birthday and this afternoon we might be
seeing Deb's I need to pick up some
stuff from her house and I would quite
like to meet her parents new puppy so
that's pretty much what a Sunday looks
like as busy as ever I haven't had any
breakfast yet I would quite like some
but I think we need to go out now so I
guess I will just have my advent
calendar oh I didn't have the 17th
yesterday 18th is there what the
nutritious breakfast I am having and
thought I've just really made a mess of
up we also need to go and buy some
frames and print some photos for Rich's
grandparents for Christmas so well the
photos are on this USB stick or I go
take them to snappy snaps or somewhere
and get them printed look at Rich's hand
this is why we hate Lily's bloody hate
them the pollen you just chuck them away
I'm getting this frame from Oliver bonus
for my grandma excuse my lips I have
cream on the edges I managed to convince
the pharmacist to give me some kind of
like really really small like 0.1%
steroid cream she wasn't happy about it
but I was like I don't care we are now
headed to Ikea we've got a frame oliver
bonus for my grandma we got the photos
printed i went to the pharmacy and now
we're gonna go here to get frames for my
gallery wall and also frames for Rich's
grandparents I'm hoping it's not gonna
be too mental sunday ikea christmas
period i think
yeah did I maybe people aren't like
redecorated in the some of you maybe
they've got at all exactly enough
exactly but we can just go straight to
the marketplace you don't need to like
look around with the bedrooms guys you
know what would be a genius idea
if you could like zoom in on a mirror
like this so it's basically like a
camera so that you can see like I was
just gonna look at my lips but I have to
go like this I reckon one day that's the
future of mirrors you'll be able to like
zoom in we've arrived in the IKEA land
I've been given a list of things they
need to get other people as well we're
going backwards through IKEA which is
definitely breaking IKEA law we want to
go to the marketplace
makin trouble we're literally going like
past the tills
we're walking against the traffic and
everyone's giving us such weird looks
like we're breaking ruining their life
it's already in a frame section got a
list of my phone things we need okay
this is our frame whoo we got this one
which I'm not actually gonna use like
this we're gonna take that kind of
template out these little ones for the
grandparents this one for a prin that
richest sister got us and then these two
big ones for the quotes I'm going all
white I don't know if that's little
gallery walls I'm meant to like mix it
up but I'm just gonna do white because I
don't know what else to do and I think
my so many frames I'm gonna share slowly
the car
lunch was good and we had some chill
time at the pub was a really anything to
vlog really we're now heading to Deb's
her parents house because they have a
new puppy called Wilma cute like my mum
because of the hole pebbles Wilma thing
kiss you didn't get that I'm very
excited to meet the puppy and see Deb's
and pool is Pooler she's cute
and Missy look how cute this puppy is
Deb's is here now I actually got here
before her in her own home and look
they're twins actual twins resting
bitchface
we're now home and we love winter
parents and saw the kids and stuff and
had a little bit more stressful
afternoon but all is good I'm now gonna
put the prints into frames these are all
friends you got for Mike here so I
really hope they fit I don't know some
of the sizing was a bit different so I'm
gonna have a go now I'm gonna try and
put the cactus print into a frame like
this hopefully it'll fit
this is a print from Panamax panas shop
Panama's London it says eat sleep create
and like a rose gold foil they very
kindly said to Smith and I'm gonna frame
this one also in the same frame
working mattified I bring your ring
I look so cool I love it oh I'm so
annoyed I forgot to get another frame I
got one for the cactus print one for the
quote and then I was meant to get one
for the polaroid photos that's so
annoying to do it in the new year right
now it's frame the grandparent prints I
got this frame from Oliver bonus to give
to my grandma and very cooked inside
this space oh man rich from the wedding
which is hence a bit cut off that's a
shame I think it's because of the type
of frame that it is and the photo his
head is a little bit cut off hmm
I don't think your mind okay well we can
become another koto if you want
oh god that's so annoying I think we
should pick another photo of us and do
it
portrait all right you have to do that
this week now I can put these on the
Shelf that looks cool actually maybe
I'll bring this one down because
something you have to read that one go
there I really love this practice print
from Urban Outfitters no add a bit of
color I think I need to get a white
frame for that so I think that we can
feel had the same I don't know I'm not
good at this gallery wall thing I like
having my award there adds a bit of
color this is definitely a work in
progress we have no food in the house so
it spaghetti with pesto it is hi guys
it's two days later it's the morning and
I didn't finish this blog so just wanted
to say thank you for watching and I'm
about stop vlogging again so you'll see
this one tomorrow night
hope you're all really well and see you
