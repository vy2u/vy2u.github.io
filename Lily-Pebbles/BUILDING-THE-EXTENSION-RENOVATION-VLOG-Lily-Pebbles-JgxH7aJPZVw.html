is a really exciting one and I'm not
going to talk for too long because we
have a lot to fit in but this is the
first in my series of house renovation
vlogs I've been going back to the house
every single day to check up in the
builders to chat to them and to vlog the
process as well so I really wanted to
share this with you guys one because I'm
just so passionate about the project I'm
really loving every minute and two I
just think it'll be really helpful for
other people who are going through any
type of renovation big or small this is
in no way me showing off and I know
there will be a small percentage of
people who will kind of be quite
negative towards this but hopefully the
most of you would just really enjoy kind
of sharing this project with us and
seeing the progress I think it's so
interesting so I really hope you enjoy
this and there will be more to come
probably every like couple of weeks or
something so yeah I'm gonna insert the
clips now okay it's day 1 of our house
renovation and I've just popped in to
see what it looks like because I think
today they were planning on ripping out
as much stuff as they could so I haven't
even looked yet I'm gonna bring you guys
with me okay so the carpets all gone Oh
actually I wanted to see what the stairs
look like they seem like pretty good
quality stairs actually because we were
trying to Southworth to have a runner or
not and obviously someone previously has
had a runner so that is interesting ooh
okay this is exciting let's see oh my
god that is a lot of rubbish this is our
lounge Wow oh my god they've literally
ripped out the kitchen in a day this is
so exciting so they've ripped out the
entire kitchen pretty much and there is
a lot of rubbish in here oh my god let's
see ooh
under stairs cupboard that's been ripped
out as well let's see upstairs
the bathroom is completely being ripped
out so the floors still here all that
kind of bit scared to walk in here but
this has all been ripped off all the
tiles pop from the shower this bit
hasn't been ripped off yet that's so
crazy
all the floor all the carpets gone and
this room
it's just floorboards - it's quite cool
actually to see my office with the
floorboards
they are nice but I think they're too
much work to kind of sand them down I
think do they
that's so mad they said they were gonna
rip it all out today but I kind of
didn't believe them okay so day two and
I've just realized that the
electricity's not going to be on so you
guys and nothing we have to see but rich
blabbering a torch who just walked in
and the walls are completely stripped so
all of the crazy funky wallpaper has all
gone
I should really come and do these
updates during the day when I can show
you guys properly okay so the rubbish is
still the same there's just loads more
so as you can see this is the wallpaper
we had before and they've stripped this
Wow look rich it's like pink floral
wallpaper okay oh my god there's so many
things in the floor the castle showers
come out all the tiles have come out the
floor tiles have been stripped
so in our bedroom the wallpaper oh my
god the grey wallpapers finally gone
it's all been stripped smells delish in
here space so I was like what my parents
house got flooded these updates at the
beginning might be a bit random and
short because there's little things
happening I don't want this video to
drag on too much so sorry for that but
we'll be back tomorrow I think to see
what they've done then I've realized
that counting days isn't going to work
because I can't keep track and we're not
necessarily coming every day but it's
kind of the end of the first week so
weekend we just got here and this is
outside so I think they must have
started digging out the back for our
extension which is so excited and
they're having to do it all by hand
because we live in a terrace house so
you can't like get a digger which
obviously would make it so much quicker
so I'm gonna go outside and see it look
like okay so this is the outside and
then as you can see they've started
digging down so this is where kind of
the extension will go to it's kind of 3
meters I'm a bit terrified you sure I'm
not gonna fall and die
well they've gone really deep 618 so all
of this will be our kitchen and our
dining table will be here so we're back
in the house
it's the Tuesday off to bank holiday
weekend and we just came to see what the
builders have been doing today they're
so nice and very tidy and very impressed
I see they've been eating watermelon I'm
gonna bring them some ice lollies it's
very hot this week so the trench has now
been turned into like the side trench
they've just moved this fence up a
little bit to give them some space but
it's just temporary so I swear on you
it's gonna go this is the back of our
garden and we're trying to figure out
how we're gonna get rid of all this
bamboo because it's completely overgrown
like there is so much bamboo so yeah
we're gonna have to get someone to come
around and give us a quote on doing
something with this how you feeling
about house renovation stuff good so I
think to be in a garden in summer we
haven't really been in here yet yeah
this is for your first time in there
it's definitely my first time it's a
little bit overgrown just that bamboo
ridiculous how quick it grows it's good
to take a photo in the bamboo for the
memories it's Friday and I've come back
to the house to see what has been done
because yesterday I came and they were
doing the foundations and then they said
they were gonna fill it with concrete
today so what's really exciting is this
doorway has been created so as you walk
into our house and this is gonna be a
sliding door into our toilet as you can
see it adds so much light into the
hallway I'm gonna ask if they can put a
little bit window up here cuz I really
like this light coming through when the
door is there it will go dark again so
keeping this bit like this but then
having a sliding door here that's the
under stairs covered so that's really
exciting the kitchen's like floors
exposed now it's all concrete there and
they've also taken all the flooring up
in the house so as you can see it's all
kind of covered they've also ripped off
the fireplace which is amazing because
actually that opening is bigger than I
thought we're going to have a wood
burner in there and I think like tile
the inside so that's all prepped but
the company's coming on Monday to have a
look at that we're using a company
called stoke limited so that's really
exciting and then if I take you outside
concrete mix are there so I don't want
to go out because the concrete's like
wet and stuff but basically they've
filled the trench it's called a trench
yeah I've been saying the right words
with concrete which is like the
foundations so it's really exciting to
see like how much further it's all gonna
be going out so I think that's what was
done today good evening guys you'll have
to excuse what I look like I am so tired
today because I went to the BAFTAs last
night with Deb's and we got back so late
I had to have an afternoon nap so I look
like crap
and my lips are going crazy but me and
rich really wants to come look at the
house today well we're coming every day
I didn't vlog on Friday because I wasn't
really much to update you guys on and
that there will be days like that where
the builders are doing work that you
can't really see but I think today they
started putting the walls up off the
extension and we also had our fireplace
seen too we're using a company called
stoked limited I'm gonna link below any
kind of external companies that we use
they're gonna be fitting a wood burner
for us so I think one of the guys from
them came today to prep the fireplace
and kind of get it ready for later on
when we actually are going to put the
wood burner in like later in the summer
so that's really exciting so looking
forward to going in and seeing what it
looks like today ok we just come into
the house and actually so much has been
done it's really exciting this is just
today actually because we're here on
Saturday
so first of all like I said the
fireplace has all been prepped this was
just like crazy bricks everywhere and
well Britt what do you think they've
done they probably cleared the chimney
and then they've like kind of locked it
all out I don't know any of the official
terms it's really cool to see what the
openings gonna be like gonna have tiles
in there waiting here like they're just
oh wow yeah it's done so well so neat
idea and then this you'd legally now
have to have like a bit of slate or
something there which is a bit annoying
you can't have it like flush to the
ground but it's gonna look so great
and then mantelpiece that looks really
cool I'm so happy with that and then
another really exciting thing
is this bit so you know that this
doorway had been opened
well they've started to put where the
walls gonna be for the Twitter which is
this so if you can kind of imagine you
walk into the toilet here the toilet
will be there sink will be here and the
washer/dryer will be here so you can
kind of see now sorry if this guy's it's
making me feel bit sick but this is
gonna be the toilet there and you can
really see it starting to take shape
that's really cool
how are you happy about that okay and
rich is here there's my I checked should
have outside open the back door okay so
remember where those trenches were well
they've now started breaking the walls
so rich why they use a different brick
of the bottom oh yeah so they've got
like this like inside layer and then
outside layer that's original brick mark
would love this
Montana needs to come and look at this
in here they'll put insulation okay so
they've done the brick all the way
around to like kind of hip height and
all the way around here and then this
wall is going all the way up so I head
height that's so cool to see it like
taking shape so it's quite exciting it's
difficult to show you guys but this this
is the space we're talking about Wow
just pop back onto the house not much
has really happened today but it's all
kind of electrical stuff so if you like
pulling up the floorboards to do with
the electric so it's when I think you
don't really see but it's happening so
as you can see they're like putting in
new sockets there are hardly any sockets
in this house so it's really exciting
that they're putting lots of these in
it's all gonna have to be replastered
same in our bedroom as well like double
sockets there we're probably gonna have
a TV on the wall it's not gonna look
great but I want a TV in the bedroom for
when we have kids and stuff as you can
see all the floorboards being ripped up
and
sockets behind my beauty desk which is
gonna make straightening my hair a lot
easier and then website sockets bedside
lights we only have a king-sized bed but
we've done it for a super King just in
case one day we change our mind more
sockets here finally a light switch that
is near the door because our main light
switch was down here before
CQC outside they have dug this for the
drain because we have to move this drain
to behind the new wall I'm not sure what
I showed you last time I came but I'm
here it's the day of the royal wedding
we've just watched it it was glorious
I'll show you around quickly they've
taken out the second fireplace which
we're gonna cover up they also so that's
where the toilets gonna go
they've also let the steel has arrived
and they've kind of opened it up to have
a window there so this is where the
toilet will go
washer/dryer will be here as you can see
here this is the steel from upstairs
coming up from downstairs you come back
to check on the house again not much has
changed that you'll be able to see a lot
of it's like electrical stuff but they
have put these up so this is basically
holding our house up right now which is
terrifying it's really crazy to see kind
of how a house is built so you can kind
of see when these are up but they're
gonna put this steel up tomorrow and
then knock this wall down and hopefully
the whole house won't fall down the rest
is basically spot lights upstairs but
it's really feeling like a proper
building site right now doesn't really
look anything like a home we just popped
into the house and I couldn't like vlog
properly because all the builders were
there and it would've been really
embarrassing but I did take the clip
it's really exciting because they've
actually knocked down that back wall the
extension and they've put the steel up
so it's really exciting to see you can
kind of start to see how big the space
is gonna be now and we were just talking
about like Covina and skylights and the
difference between the like new wall and
the old wall and all boring stuff like
that but we're actually going away in
two days time so it's so much it's gonna
happen while I'm away and I'm really sad
that I'm not gonna be able to update
like vlogging while we're away it's just
a week though so hopefully not too much
what happen well I want it to happen but
I also wanted to vlog in it so I think
now's a good time to end this video
because we're going away and I've showed
like the first stages of building the
extension the next stuffs gonna be like
plaster walls and floors and like second
fixings kind of so I hope that you guys
have found this interesting it's all
very exciting and I'm so happy and so
grateful and all the fields let me know
if you like this video and hope you're
looking forward to the next one which
would be in a few weeks time maybe not
sure do you love it when your camera
battery runs out anyway thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
