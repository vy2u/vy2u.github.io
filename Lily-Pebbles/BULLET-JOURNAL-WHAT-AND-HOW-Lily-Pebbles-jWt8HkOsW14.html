this video that I promised you guys for
like over six months today I'm going to
be talking to you about the bullet
journal what it is why it exists and how
I incorporate it into my life this video
might be really long it might be really
overwhelming and you might finish
watching it thinking what am I meant to
do with all this information but I
promise it will all make sense I
discovered the bullet journal around
this time last year so January 2016 and
I've been using it for a year
it's a journaling system to help you use
your notebook so your work notebook to
its best ability and I'm a stationary
geek I love stationery but I've always
found that the sort of notebooks you buy
in shops are just so structured and so
limiting and I never really know what to
do with like a plain notebook when I'm
given a plain notebook as a gift I just
like end up making such rough scrappy
notes in it losing everything it's so
disorganized and not at all productive
so a guy called Ryder invented a system
called bullet journaling and it's very
clever
now what I would recommend you do right
now is pause this video go to bullet
journal com it's a website by Ryder
Carroll and explains the system
completely or watch this video here you
will be confused at first but it will
make sense when I first discovered the
bullet journal I spent hours researching
and watching hundreds of different
videos which is why I wanted to put my
video out onto the Internet to kind of
have my say so if you've watched that
video and looked into bullet journaling
a little bit you might know what it's
all about and the reason I use the
bullet journal system is because I find
it's really flexible it's less time
pressure than a normal notebook that's
so limited to days of the week and
months it's non job-specific
so sometimes I work weekends and some
weekdays I don't do as much work as
others it's flexible and it doesn't
matter what job you do you can use it
and it all works around having an index
which I never thought of doing before
and I absolutely love the idea so in
this video once I'm done rambling I'm
going to show you my 2016 bullet journal
and how it's changed to my 2017 bullet
journal and I learned a lot from doing
it in 2016 and I've changed
a lot for my 2017 bullet journal so when
I'm flicking through my 2016 version
please stick with me because I actually
hate it now looking back and I'm really
excited for my 2017 version I think the
main points that I've taken from bullet
journaling for a year that I love having
a dotted notebook the notebooks I use
are from I just can't say this brand
Loesch term 1917 you can get them on
Amazon last year I just got a plain one
with dots this year I actually got the
bullet journal version they've
collaborated with bullet journal to
create one and I'll talk through that
when I'm flicking through but having a
notebook with dots in I never really
knew the purpose of them before I'd
always seen them and thought why would
you ever want a notebook with dots in it
life-changing I'm telling you it's
life-changing luck I can't use notebooks
of lines anymore because it's so
restricting and it's so kind of one-way
squares are good but I find it quite
distracting having all the squares
they're dots are perfect because when
you look from afar you can't really even
see anything it looks quite clean and
like minimal but when you're looking
close is actually really helpful as a
guide if you're working a lot with kind
of tables and grids it's so nice to have
the option to go in horizontal or
vertical and I'm so happy that I've got
into this whole like dotted notebook
thing the use of an index as I said is
so helpful so with bullet journal every
time you kind of create a new page you
add it to the index at the front of the
notebook and it just means finding
things like a video idea or packing list
it's so easy to find things in the
notebook you're not forever like
flicking through pages the idea that you
kind of use it throughout the year so
the notebook is plain and blank until
you create the page so I don't know if
I'm going to be able to explain this
properly but as you're adding the pages
in yourself you're creating the notebook
it's not like a normal notebook where
you open it and all the pages are
already laid out for you it's flexible
because one week I can do a day-to-day
diary the next week I can just do some
brainstorming and I love that about it
the whole bullet journal system works
around having a key and as you would
have seen in the explainer video the key
is all about moving tasks like
scheduling them ahead or ticking them or
and although I don't stick to that
completely it is
for to have it when doing lists before I
would have just done tics but now if I
decide actually having what time to do
that tasks today I can move it and do it
another week a lot of this isn't going
to make sense by promise once you kind
of done all your research it will all
become clear so I feel like what you
really want to see is my actual bullet
journal so I'm going to start by
flicking through my 2016 1 a lot of the
stuff in it is quite private which is
why I've put off doing this video for so
long because I can't show you inside my
work diary but I'm going to try my best
to show you as much as I can and I'll
probably have to blur things out and
then I will talk you through my 2017 one
which I haven't started filling in
properly yet so I can really show you
how I'm going to be using it ok so let
me show you my bullet journal so these
are my two bullet journals side by side
my 2006 and my 2017 I just used label
maker it was like 8 pounds from Amazon
to label the front of my bullet journals
they are both from this brand and
they're both the dotted notebooks as I
said before this is just the original
one this is actually one specifically
for bullet journals it's a collaboration
and there is not much difference apart
from there's already an index and future
log you'll see there's not much
difference really the main thing and the
most important thing whether or not you
want dotted or whatever the most
important thing is that the pages are
numbered because that's really how the
whole thing works and how the index
works and if I had to number every page
it would be an absolute nightmare so I
love that these come with numbered pages
so let me start by showing you my 2016
bullet journal and as I said this is the
first time I've ever done it so a lot
has changed on the first page I just put
my name and my email address I start
with the key and I just wrote it here on
a plain page I used washi tape I felt
quite a lot of pressure at the beginning
to make mine really kind of arty whereas
now I feel quite differently about that
so this is the key a dot for a task X
once you've completed it a circle for an
event forward and backwards if you're
migrating a task or scheduling it notes
and priority and there's also one that
you can cross through I don't use all of
these this is my main index from last
year these are
like the big thing so I put the page
number and then what it is and then I
also ended up doing a blog and video
index because I had more of those so
these are just all different like blog
and video ideas this is where I did my
whole year interview so this is kind of
just the calendar for me to look at and
I just drew this myself and then this is
where the future log and brain dump
starts now this is something I don't
really do anymore brain dump I mean
that's something I would never say so I
don't know why I always put it in my
notebook but the idea of this is that
you write kind of big things are going
to happen throughout the year and this
is just somewhere where you can throw
any kind of notes or thoughts that you
have and for some reason it just didn't
work out for me I don't really use that
so that's that and then I created a
statistics tracker so a way for me to
jot down the subscriber number views
Twitter Facebook Instagram page views
unique visitors snapchat there's kind of
all my different platforms and every
month I wrote a number although clearly
I forgot to do it some months it's not
something I'm obsessed with but it's
quite nice to just see how things are
changing or not changing so then this is
what a monthly log looked like for me
last year I wrote down all the days of
the month and what I found is that I
actually found it quite difficult
because I have so many things going on I
can't possibly fit all the things that
happening on one day on one line so I
ended up just putting a few things in
and this became a bit of a wasted space
I liked the idea of putting big things I
need to do that month and it's kind of a
nice thing to do beginning of a month to
like plan ahead
this is how I started to do my weeks and
I experimented a lot with this I ended
up doing let me flick forward for you
what I ended up doing is splitting my
page into six parts so I had the five
days of the week and then a section for
notes and I'm going to be doing this
going forward but I'm just not going to
pre draw them I used to do it for the
whole month but some days I'm not at
home working some days I'm out all day
and then I I ended up having a lot of
wasted days so I'm just going to do
these sections bit by bit and I'll show
you that in my 2017 journal but this is
how I like to lay out a week when I want
to use it as a diary and as you can see
I used the kind of key system here so
I'll start the day by putting tasks and
events and I'll cross them off or move
them to the monthly log if I want to
move into the monthly log that's kind of
how I did it some pages I would use to
plan videos and I really liked this I
never really used to do it and I find it
so helpful because when I sit down and
do a video I've got these kind of clear
notes with me
these were when we were coming up with
names for our jumpers and this was a
one-week on his food diary that I think
I did as a blog post again more videos
it's just really helpful for me to have
it all in list form the same for my like
monthly favorites videos I like to list
them all out this was just meal planning
for me and rich so again you know you
can use it for non work stuff as well
and every time I put something here I'd
go back and write it in the index so
that's kind of what I did but as you can
see some months you know I was away and
these were just getting wasted so that's
definitely something I've learned from
last year last year at the back of my
bullet journal I wrote my video schedule
which looked like this
I'd write all the days that I had videos
going up
I'd write the video title and these
letters stand for film edit info box
scheduled Facebook tweet and blog so
that there's all the things I need to do
for a video and as I do them I'd put a
little dot and I'm continuing this into
the new year but I'm going to
incorporate it with a blog schedule
because I had my blog separate and I
just found I got really lazy with it and
you know I need to kick up the ass to
actually write on my blog so it will
help if it can if I can integrate it all
into the same kind of planner so let me
show you my 2017 bullet journal I just
kept the sleeve on so I could show you
guys but this is going to come off now
so this is my bullet journal for 2017
and I haven't really properly filled it
in yet so I can show you guys I give you
a proper tour as I said before this one
comes with a key already written in and
you can add other icons if you have them
I'm just sticking with these ones for
now this version of the book also comes
with tips and at the back it has like a
sleeve here but it also has more tips
and it kind of tells you what everything
means so if you are a beginner I would
actually recommend this one because it's
easy to forget how to do it all and this
kind of tells you what rapid logging is
and future log and all of that confusing
stuff which to be honest even a year
on the line I'm still a bit confused
about so here is the index and I've
decided this year to keep everything in
one index so you can see here I've got
2017 goals statistics tracker content
calendar January favourites video ideas
2017 Beauty discoveries which is a video
just filmed and I'm just going to keep
adding to here and this time round I've
put the page number afterwards so the
index is already on here and you get
more pages in this book so I think
that's good just to let you know this
version is about 20 pounds on Amazon and
the plain one is about 10 pounds so it's
double the price so this is what my
future log looks like this year I've
split it over four pages I've done a
little calendar so it doesn't take up
too much space and you can see I've done
it over four pages so what I'm planning
on doing here is using bullet points
like this I'm just listing the big
things that are happening so not every
little detail not every little meeting
but if I'm going on holiday or if I've
got a special content planned I haven't
filled this in yet but I will do that so
it's really nice to look at and you can
plan ahead for the year I find that
really satisfying so that's what my
future log looks like and it can take a
while to set all these things up you
know I spend an evening doing this in
front of the TV and once it's done it's
done ah 30th birthday this page is going
to be for my 2017 goals it's pretty much
just like the video I did or my news
resolutions but I'm going to add in some
more specific work goals and then I've
also created a statistics tracker I
thought this year would be easier to see
it going down last year I did the month
that way so this is youtube subscribers
youtube views twitter facebook Instagram
blog post views blog unique visitors as
I said I'm not obsessed numbers but I
think it's important just to keep an eye
on things and I'll be able to look at
the end of the year and see how things
have changed throughout the year so this
is how I'm going to be doing my content
planning and I've done a page per month
so I've got January February March April
May June July August
Tembo October November December it took
a while to do but now it's done for the
whole year so this is what a Content
calendar looks like for me I've put all
the days of the month so last year I
only put the days where content was
going up but I think this year I wanted
to see the whole month later
even if there's gaps it doesn't matter I
think it's more clear for me so what
I've done is I've incorporated my blog
posts and my videos into one content
calendar the blue pen is videos and the
black pen is blog posts this top row is
for blog posts so the P sales are photos
text links scheduled and underneath it's
for videos filmed edited from nail
information that's description box
scheduled trying to keep it more simple
and not have too many steps because I
found that I was skipping them last year
so I've just listed the videos and blog
posts I haven't filled it completely in
because I don't want to share with the
whole world what content I've got
planned I just realized that my head was
like poking out here sorry if my like
frizzy hair has been like doing that
this whole video so I'll list the
content as I get things done instead of
a tick which I find quite messy I just
do like a dot and then at the bottom
I've got a little bit of space for notes
if I want to just kind of put some notes
and remind myself in February like do a
Valentine's Day video or something like
that so that's how I'm going to be doing
my content and I find it really
satisfying knowing that that's all laid
out for me to fill in as I go if I
suddenly think like oh in October I want
to do this I can just add it in now and
I really like that
January favourites so that's a video
I'll have at the end of the month and I
just start jotting down throughout the
month things I want to mention
spoiler alert loving these two things
video ideas for 2017 I have this list in
my old bullet journal that I'm gonna
transfer over to this one and then this
is what a week will look like for me as
I said last time I don't want to make
this like a whole week because for
example this Wednesday I'm going into my
management office and I'll probably
spend the day working there so I don't
want to restrict myself or I don't know
not every day will be a day where I get
things done like this so I'm going to do
it day by day
I had to typic something out here I put
the date and then these are both kind of
events that I need to do I need to film
these two videos something I need to
discuss with someone and I'll just add
notes as I do it really
I'm keeping is quite flexible but I'm
not going to put in like a whole month
that's just for this week and then I've
got a list for a video my best beauty
discoveries 2016 if you haven't seen it
I will link it it will pop up on the
screen there so again I'm just going to
be using this
in videos and I think I'm going to be
doing more of this in this bullet
journal less of this because I quite
like using my phone for lists more for
video planning and that's kind of it the
rest is all blank for now I'm just gonna
go with it and see where it takes me
this year but I much prefer my 2017
bullet journal I'm really happy with it
I'm obviously keeping my 2016 one and I
really glad I just went for the black
kept it really simple I'm gonna try and
not over complicate it this year I know
some people go really arty with theirs
and I think that's great but for me
keeping it really simple is the whole
point otherwise I think it will
completely overwhelm me I hope that I
showed that clearly for you guys and if
you have any specific questions about my
bullet journal please just leave me a
comment I'll try to reply to as many as
possible I'm not an expert I'm just kind
of figuring out as I go but it works for
me
so I hope you guys enjoyed having a look
through my 2016 and 2017 bullet journals
sorry if this has blown your mind I went
through exactly the same thing this time
last year but just my one tip would be
don't rush it I know right now you're
thinking oh my god I want to buy a
notebook and I want to do this and I'm
really excited to buy all the pretty
pens but just take the time think about
what notebook you want because I think
it's really nice to stick with one for
the whole year and not have to keep
changing it because you want to redo it
it's not meant to be perfect some of the
pages in my bullet journal I hate but it
doesn't matter because you move on and
it changes as you change throughout the
year so take your time think about what
notebook you want don't worry about the
Pens I mean you can make it as creative
or not creative as you want some people
are really arty with theirs and some
people are really minimal with theirs
do your research and I hope this has
kind of inspired you to get into the
bullet journal thing and I hope it's
showing you that you don't have to do it
exactly the way it's meant to be done
you can be flexible with the kind of
rough idea of a bullet journal I've
linked my last video here if you would
like to check it out please also don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
would like to see some more videos and I
will also link a recent blog post here
if you'd like to go have a read thank
you guys so much for watching this video
I hope you have a really good week ahead
and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
