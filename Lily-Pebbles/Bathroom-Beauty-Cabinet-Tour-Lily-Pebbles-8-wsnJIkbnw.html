excuse the sound of the extractor fan
but I was going to make this video
really fancy I attempted to do a
stop-motion and then I went through film
err close-up of every single pods and I
thought this is getting ridiculous and
if I watched a video like this I think I
would just want to watch someone kind of
going through their bathroom cupboard so
that's what I'm going to do it's going
to be very quick and casual but I'm
basically going to show you inside my
bathroom cupboard so you guys could be a
bit nosy please remember that obviously
my job is to be a beauty blogger and
youtuber and I try a lot of products so
I kind of have like four or five of
every type of product because I'm always
trying things out so this is a lot of
products you definitely don't need this
much I think a good skincare routine is
like five or six products but for those
of you who are interested in what's in
my cupboard let's go have a look so I
removed in there was just a mirror here
there's hardly any storage in this
bathroom at all puffs from a tiny little
cubby hole under the bath which is why
we keep on toilet roll there's literally
like no shelves or anything no area
around the sink so obviously I came in
and thought oh my god I need to make
some space for storage so what we did is
we ended up buying this mirrored cabinet
from Ikea I love it I'm so happy with it
as you can see at the bottom it's
slightly higher up and it's got some of
the original mirror sticking out the
bottom that's because we had to drill
into the tiles which was really hard big
pill Arbor but basically we've got the
cupboard up and it's huge and I love
that it's a marriage because it makes
the bathroom feel bigger mirrors always
make a space feel bigger especially
because there's another mirror here on
this wall the front doors are Merritt
and the whole of the inside is mirrored
as well so it does I think it makes it
look like I have way more products that
I actually have whenever I show someone
they're like oh my god but it just
doesn't make the space look so much
bigger so it's got two big doors that
open like this and most of my stuff is
in one side but I'll show you everything
that's in here just below the cabinet
I've got a room spray from the white
company which is in the scent world min
and peppermint and white tea I love the
scent I've also
the scented oil with the six in and then
I've got another room spray from dip
teak which is the scent bay which I love
as well and these little hand soaps and
I'm on brought back from the South of
France for me I feel these plants here
for now but as you guys I'm sure you've
seen them actually from my lounge we
need to get a plant for the bathroom I
think a plant will work better than
flowers because there's like no natural
light in here so I just need to find a
nice plant to fit in the bathroom so I
haven't really organized it properly yet
I probably should have filmed this video
later down the line when I've really
organized it but I could always do the
video again I haven't really got any
kind of compartments I just put all the
products in and I just thought I'd show
you what I've got really well this light
they're not fluttering okay so down here
I have cleanses and morning moisturizers
so I have the super facialist my silica
lensing water that you use in the
evenings and I'm feeling lazy and in the
morning and then I have the Clarins it's
an eye makeup remover this is the best
eye makeup remover especially if you're
wearing waterproof makeup
I've got a few cleanses the emma hardy
cleansing balm this is an amazing balm
that kind of turns into an oil takes off
all your makeup really well and then Liz
Earle cleanse and polish which I always
have one of these there's such classic
great for when you're wearing lots of
makeup great if you're feeling if your
skin's feeling that it's sore and
sensitive because it's really good for
sensitive skin and then of course my
osteo renee sorts cleansing gel I can't
be about this one it's a gel cleanser
that turns to an oil this is the one I
use every single day and then a newer
one which is the pixie glow mud cleanser
I'm still kind of testing this out on
deciding what I think but it's really
nice and my skin's feeling a bit spotty
if I want something a bit more
clarifying because it has got the the
mud in it then I've got some morning
serum the Sarah Chapman intense
hydrating booster this is my favorite
serum for just whacking on a bit of
hydration in the morning and then I've
got the Kate Somerville quench
oil free serum this is very similar
slightly more creamy feeling and this is
an again another one I'm kind of testing
out I also have the Askia get up and
glow which is a really glowy morning
serum I really like to use this one
definitely you can notice the difference
on your skin instantly and the Sarah
Chapman morning facial which is an oil
and I only tend to
it's really in the winter and my skin is
very dry dry because it's quite a thick
oil I also have the boots the tan X
radiance balm all bright which you saw
in my boots haul I'm still loving this I
read on the back that it has some
natural IH s in it so it's slightly
exfoliating which is why I probably
already like it indicate some of old
goat milk moisturizer which is one I got
from Sephora in America this is a really
nice kind of light moisturizer and then
I also have the Olay 2 in one instant
hydration and radiant this is what I
tend to use when I'm about to do my
makeup because it's very light it won't
kind of feel too heavy under your makeup
on the second shelf is where I keep my
exfoliator
nighttime moisturizer soils and serums I
don't tend to exfoliate with like a
physical exfoliator tend to use chemical
exfoliant more so I have quite a lot of
radiance pads I've got the pixie glow
peel pads so these are like little
cotton pads a pre soaked with 20%
glycolic and rose water it says and
there's 60 pads in here I really like
these they're very similar to the facial
radiance pads from first aid beauty I
can't really tell much difference really
I like both of these they're such a
quick easy way to folio and then I also
have the pixie glow tonic as well which
is a classic that I always enjoy I
haven't really uses that much recently
but it's always good to have it in the
cupboard these two again are quite
similar
Sarah Chapman overnight exfoliating
booster so this is that exfoliating
serum which I really couldn't get my
head around at first the I do put my
serum on the exfoliates but leaving it
on your skin and not washing it off
seems really bizarre but it works and
you wake up with glowy skin that just
feels really soft it really changes the
texture of your skin and the pics the
overnight glow serum is very similar I'm
testing this out and they seem to be
very similar the only kind of physical
exfoliation I have is the one from Kate
Somerville this is exfoliate which is
very similar to kind of fruit enzyme
masks that I've tried in the past it's a
bit heavier a bit more abrasive so I
wouldn't use this more than once a week
but I'm still deciding if it's for me or
not I do quite like it and I also have
the Ren wake wonderful night
which I really like smells a bit funky
smells a bit like Solero ice creams but
again it's really nice exfoliating nice
to put on as your last step in your
skincare routine and the evening you
wake up and your skin just feels amazing
the last exfoliating product I have is
from Chanel it's the low weekend of
Chanel I don't use this one as much I'm
still kinda sidon if it's for me but
it's Chanel so I can't get rid of it
okay so those are all the products that
kind of take away the dead skin these
are all the products that put all the
goodness back in the Estee Lauder
advanced night repair this is like my
third or fourth bottle love this stuff
especially when my skin is just not
feeling right it's not feeling at my
skin I always use this and it goes back
to normal
this is from skin owl it's the beauty
drops p.m. at mangosteen these are new
I'm still trying them out and I
absolutely love them I did a review on
my blog smells amazing
interesting hydration you just need like
a couple of drops and I just love those
soils and serums that when you put them
on your skin you instantly feel hydrated
I have a few kind of hydrating mists the
LA roche-posay sarah zinc I don't use
this one as much as I used to but I
always like to have one in the cupboard
it's really nice spray to spray on your
skin after you've exfoliated or cleanse
and I also have the tattoo Harper
hydrating fluorescence this is a really
nice one and this is the the trial size
boom looks a bit funny inside it's got a
bit gross made it's time to get rid of
that I also have the queen of Hungary
mist from our movie amirev it's always
so hard to say this was really really
pricey for a skin mist but some people
like spend loads of money on their
skincare some people like to spend lots
some people like to spend a little so if
this is in your budget then it's a
really nice product but I do completely
agree that it's crazy price I was very
lucky to get setting this one I've had
the sample size for ages
it is lovely and I have my pixie beauty
sleep cream which I'm obsessed with at
the moment this is my nighttime
moisturizer that I use every night it's
like silk on your skin it's got this
lovely glow to it as well and it just
it's the knee makes her skin feel soft
and hydrated couple more oils and serums
up here the Sarah Chapman overnight
facial is still one of my favorite
overnight oils just really beautiful oil
not too heavy not too light perfect and
Sunday right the Sunday Riley Luna
sleeping nights oil this one I tend to
use when I'm feeling a bit spotty when
it's that time of the month that my skin
doesn't feel right it's a blue oil it's
very strange but it sinks into the skin
well I like the scent of it and it feels
like a really nice luxury oil and then
last on the second shelf is the oski of
bedtime Beauty boost I still haven't
decided if I like this or not it's a
nighttime moisturizer I think it's a
little bit too heavy for me
it takes quite a while to work into the
skin which I find a little bit annoying
but I still use it occasionally okay now
onto the third shelf which is masks and
eye creams
oh I randomly have my Clarins liquid
bronze self-tanning products out there
as well I like to use this on my face
occasionally here the two hydrating
masks I have at the pixi nourishing
sleep mask this is again new I've been
trying loads of pixie products recently
this one I really like the packaging is
just so cheap and small is annoying but
the products really good inside my
origins drink up intensive I've used
this for literally about five or six
years now I love the scent of it this is
my like guilty pleasure oh it's amazing
I have four clay type masks going at the
moment the one that I always repurchased
always have to have in my cupboard is
the ESOP parsley seed mask this is the
best one because it really draws out any
of like impurities in your skin and it's
so easy to wash off I find that so
annoying with clay masks when it's hard
to you have to like tug at your skin
this one's incredible I also have the
Charlotte Tilbury goddess skin clay mask
for baby skin I do like this this is one
I'd probably use if I had to take my day
makeup off and then we do it for a night
out because it's a bit heavy to use in
the morning a bit unnecessary
it really kind of has a lot of hydration
in it you can really feel the hydration
on your skin it's a little bit heavy
which is nice I always feel like as soon
as you're taking your makeup off if skin
flaws but war and dry so if you need to
put it on again it's a bit of a
nightmare I also have the Liz oil deep
cleansing mask which I've always really
liked reading places got manuka honey
and it's rose scented and geranium I
really like this it's just a really good
claim mask and actually it's a little
bit similar to the next song which is
the super facialist by Tina Brennan not
my fave hour before my least favorite
because it does have that skin tugging
problem it's quite similar to Liz
although I do prefer that is Earl one
sitting just underneath those masks I
have a glam blow brush I don't actually
love glam girl in the product as much
but the brush is great I always like to
apply clean master the brushes in
doesn't get all gross on your fingers in
it's quite fun it's like painting your
face I also have some exfoliating mask
there is a little sample of the tattoo
heart but resurfacing mask and the Askia
renaissance mask which these are both
very similar they're like Foley 18
chemically masks but nice actually you
can put them on leave them five minutes
take them off very similar to an
exfoliating serum really this doesn't
really have a home but it seems to be
sitting up on that shelf it's the pixi
nourishing lip polish this is like a
kind of sugar lip polish that I'm trying
at the moment and then I've got four I
creams which is ridiculous but someone
that always forgets to apply eye cream
but I've got the sundae where I do you
start over this is a gel cream then I've
got the Ostia
I wonder which is very much a kind of
cooling gel then I've got the origins no
puffery which is a roll-on gel when you
have puffy eyes in the morning and then
I've got the boots botanics which is
more of a cream so they are all a little
bit different and really I just grab
whatever I'm feeling at the time so then
the only other things on that side of
the cupboard are some backups I've got
them off Sarah Chapman backups I
obviously went wild one day so there's
there in case I run out and then on the
top shelf I've got some Margaret dabs
products which is for my feet like a
foot serum and a foot mu
and one of those horrible shaker things
okay so in the other cupboard there's
only that much stuff I've got my
emulator that sits down here and I've
got a few of these kind of travel
roll-on things
it's dry Brian clipped it around and I
think if you have bought this for me
when I was on a trip once no thank you
if that was you
there's one for sweet dreams on for
travel and one for energy and then I've
got a few products that I'm just trying
out to remind me to kind of give them a
go one from lucky tan one from Sunday
Riley a new cleanser and a L'Oreal face
oil
I've got cotton buds and cotton pads and
then the rest of this stuff is all rich
she's got two shelves of skin care he is
a skincare hoarder he's nearly given as
bad as me he has like five moisturizers
and whenever I ask him do you really
need all of these moisturizers Perrineau
he likes to have them as backup so to
learn from the best
then on the Shelf up here I've got a lot
of kind of travel minis I had so many
and I went through them when we were
moving and I got rid of loads so I just
like to have a shelf so that if I'm
going away I often have like last-minute
trips I can just grab a shampoo
conditioner cleanser and moisturizer
everything I really need in mini sized
so I know that was really quick and
probably seemed ridiculous with all
those products but it's the best they
could do at this time I promise I would
do another kind of fancy video soon with
lots of funky editing and stuff but I
thought you guys might just want to have
a peek inside my bathroom coverage
because I like to watch these kind of
videos so I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I hope you're having a lovely Sunday
I'll see you on Tuesday for another
weekly vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
