I'm going to be talking through my
summer beauty essentials it's coming up
to August now so I think a lot of people
will be going away if you've already
been away sorry but if you are planning
on having some kind of beach or swimming
pool holiday then this video might help
you so I'm going to talk through a few
different categories and let's start off
with Sun care so I am big into Sun cream
I would never go in the Sun without it
especially on holiday and but I'm not
that picky when it comes to brands I
just think as long as it's UVA and UVB
protected then it's fine and it's more
to do with the texture and how you think
it feels on your skin I like to start
with a higher SPF especially if I
haven't been on a holiday for a while
and I'm very pale my skin is very kind
of vulnerable and I've just been trying
out this one recently which is the
Garnier I'm Raziel air dry mist high SPF
50 and this is like a kind of misty
spray it's bit like deodorant which is
quite nice this is even nice when you're
at home and I'm in London and I'm in the
garden this is really easy just spray on
it doesn't give kind of high coverage so
I think you do have to focus it more in
areas where you think you burn more but
it's not sticky it feels really light on
the skin and it's very easy to apply
because of the spray after a few days
when my son's got more used to the Sun I
like to go down to a 30 but I would
never use anything lower than a 30 I
don't personally believe that anything
lower than a 30 really protects your
skin again I don't really mind what
brand I like salt on as well but his
blond I think that's how you say I'm not
sure and this is a brand I really like
and this is the ultra light dry touch
Sun fluid which comes in this kind of
funky packaging it's quite easy for
traveling because it's quite lightweight
and it just comes out this tube you just
twist it you don't have to like you lose
a lid or anything and so yeah I kind of
prefer a lotion if I'm sunbathing which
I don't really do if I'm lying in the
Sun for long periods of time I think a
lotion will protect you more than a mist
but this is good if you're just kind of
out and about in the Sun I like to use a
separate SPF on my face just because I
think the skin on your face is slightly
different to your body it's bit more
sensitive I think you might break out
easier if you use this sort of heavier
Sun creams so I like to use a one
specific for the face this one's from
Eucerin which is a really nice brand for
sensitive skin so like fragrance free
and very kind of good for your skin and
this is the SPF 50 plus which is UVB and
UVA protected very good for travel
small lightweight and yeah it's not
sticky or anything it feels really nice
on the skin so I would apply that in the
morning before going out in the Sun and
just reapply that throughout the day
I think SPF your lips is really
important as well it's something I think
most people forget and I've burnt my
lips once and it was really painful it's
very different a thin sensitive skin on
your lips so it's important to protect
it you can just put some cream on but
they do a lot of like lip balm SPF now
separates which I think are really great
this one's from UV stats and I got this
from Boots
it's SPF 50 and it's just a normal kind
of lip balm comes their little tubes
it's really easy to put in your beach
bag and it just feels really nice and
moisturizing on the lips and will
protect your lips all day probably won't
have to reapply this that often but I
think it's an important step not to miss
I'm big into off the Sun as well I think
if you do tan it's good to kind of keep
your tan it's also just really nice and
moisturizing on your skin skin dries out
a lot when you've been in the Sun and in
the sea and in the swimming pool and I
don't really mind which one I use but I
saw this one the other day in Boots and
thought it looked really nice it's from
Hawaiian Tropic and it's there after
sonic cream it's in the flavor flavor
scent island mango and this is really
weird let me try and show you without
like getting all over me comes out is
like a kind of like thick whipped cream
it is very thick I'm just going to put
it on my legs um so if you don't like
that kind of thick texture than it might
not be for you but it's really nice and
moisturizing so I'm just rub it on my
legs that's probably looks really dodgy
oh it's so nice it smells like summer
and I really like this it's not sticky
at all it's just really really ultra
monstro boy striving and I just love
this little spray thing I think it's
really fun to use and it's quite big
maybe not amazing for traveling but look
at the cute colour it's just so nice I
can move it onto hair hair is a big one
for me when I'm in the Sun because I
like to protect my hair it's already so
dry and damaged that being in the Sun
and the sea water and the swimming pool
it just like I come back from holiday
and my hair's just like falling out of
my head one thing I always make sure is
if I do go in swimming policy I always
try and go into the shower you know
sometimes there
outdoor showers and rinse out of my hair
because leaving the salt or chlorine in
your hair is really bad for it but I
have got a few products here as well
that should help I normally take any old
kind of small shampoo and conditioner on
holiday with me I'm not that picky but I
like the Sun protecting products I have
a couple here from Vito this is from
their feet up large range and he says a
really good Brad especially for hair
like mine this is their protective son
veil so this is a spray you put on
normal to dry hair before you go in the
Sun and this will protect it from all
the kind of UV rays and it will stop it
from drying out as much and it's a
really easy kind of light spray that you
can just spritz all over your hair and
then they also have a spray for after
you've been in the Sun so this is the
recovery spray which will help kind of
repair any damage done by the Sun and
the water etc these are really
lightweight and they're plastic they do
have another product that's an oil
that's in a glass bottle so it's not a
great if you are traveling these to a
very lightweight and easy to pack I tend
to wear much makeup during the day when
I'm on holiday especially if I'm by the
pool or on the beach but if I do then
it's normally a mascara and concealer
and I would definitely recommend going
waterproof it means you just don't have
to worry about checking the mirror all
day see if your mascara is running down
your face and I think mascara and
concealer are the two products that make
you look kind of more like you usually
look with makeup and just less kind of
scary well for me as anyway the
waterproof mascara that I like it at
moment is Maybelline the rocket volume
Express waterproof because I really like
this the normal version of this and this
is just waterproof so it's great I'm
definitely gonna use this when I'm on
holiday and a waterproof concealer which
is quite hard to find is my favorite
concealer already make up forevers full
cover this is fully waterproof so you
can use this under your eyes all over
your face and it should last all day if
you're going to be like diving onto the
water it will probably come off but it's
pretty good like water resistant sweat
proof and it's really easy to travel
with because it's small I also like to
put together a little emergency kit and
I can throw this in my beach bag or in
my swimming pool bag wherever I'm going
for the day and it has a few little
essentials in here let me just open it
up I don't know where the zip bag is
from you can get them from John Louis or
Muji or anywhere like that I have a
little bite and sting relief cream in
case you're going somewhere with
mosquitoes because it's you receipts of
moisturizing mad so the
is an essential have deodorant because
you don't want to be smelly when you're
in your bikini this one's for Mitchum
and it's 48-hour it's a cream one so
it's kind of water-resistant I have some
carrots refreshing wipes for hand face
and body I think if you're a bit Sun
creamy and it's sweaty maybe a bit sandy
it's nice to just have some wipes if you
need to kind of clean things up anywhere
I always have tissues because everyone
needs to choose a hand sanitizer because
if you are kind of eating by the pool
having lunch on the beach and I don't
know you're not near a tap I always like
to keep hand sanitizer on me this one is
from the body shop it's their pink
grapefruit hand cleanse gel this smells
so good
seriously oh it's so zesty and delicious
I really love this hand sanitizer
I also randomly have a wound cleansing
wipe I'm so that like mummy type that
has wound cleansing wipes but very small
just in case they fall over and cut mini
and then the most important hairband and
lots of kirby grips and because my hair
gets frizzy and I need these grips to
keep all the frizzy bits at bay even
though it doesn't actually keep them at
bay but it keeps things looking a little
bit more tidy so those are my beauty
essentials for a kind of beach and
swimming pool holiday hopefully it helps
you kind of tick some things off the
list if you're still packing for your
holiday if you are going away I hope you
have a really lovely time and I hope you
