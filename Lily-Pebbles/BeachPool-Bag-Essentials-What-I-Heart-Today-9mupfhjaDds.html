pool and beach bag essentials I'm not
going on a proper summer holiday this
year but I thought in case any of you
guys are this would really help you out
so I'm just gonna show you what I would
take with me if I work by a pool or a
beach which I'm not I'm in my garden but
it's sunny so that's good I've got this
nice big colorful bag here and I was
actually sent 'no Swit some beauty
products and it's from Primark but I
just thought was really nice so I
thought I'd use it I haven't really got
a preference for beach bags I just kind
of use whatever I really have it's a
good little cheap one from Primark in
its pretty with colorful strengths so
first I'll show you all the boring bits
and of course you're gonna need a
flip-flops my favourite ones are the
ones from Hollister and I have had these
for years
seriously years these ones are really
soft and really comfy I've got them
soaking wet in Thailand and they've
survived and I love it I also like to
take a caftan or just a beach cover-up
with me because I'm not really one to
walk around in my bikini I find it a bit
awkward so I have this one I bought last
year from Topshop and they probably
don't have any more but they've Topshop
always have really nice ones or Henny's
or Primark everywhere has them this is
just one it has little sleeves and I
quite like it because it's quite like a
low V on the front it's quite flattering
with a beanie and then it goes in at the
waist and goes to kind of mid thigh it's
just really loose you can see the bikini
around underneath it's not hot but he's
got this pretty kind of orange and
purple tie-dye effect and I love this I
wore in Thailand and was really happy
with it and I'm excited to wear it again
I love to have magazines with me to read
by the pool
panini nel and some of my favorites and
Allure magazine whatever I really have
on me whatever I pick up in the airport
on the way to my holiday the towel of
course I like to take my own towels on
holiday you never really know good to
have a good beach towel and then you
don't have to worry about kind of
finding one when you're there and of
course a bikini this one is from lots of
Spencer's and big boobed girls out there
and lots of Spencer's do really good
bikinis I find it impossible to buy
bikinis I am NOT a perfect size my boobs
in my waist completely different and the
ones that I think suit me the best from
M&amp;amp;S I don't buy anything else at home an
expert they do really good bikinis so we
I also like to take one of these kind of
Wired hair bands because it's fabric but
it's got wire inside my hair as you guys
know it's very
kirlyam frizzes so when I'm on the beach
or by the pool it's curly it's not
straight and when it dries out it can go
very frizzy with frizzy bits all over
the place so if I'm gonna tie my hair up
I like to have one of these so I can
just kind of go like this this is gonna
look awful but just tie it like that and
it kind of looks cute and it clips over
frizzy bits at bay
sorry ice cream van just drove down my
road as I was saying I don't really know
where you could buy these I think I got
mine from Camden Market I also have to
have my sunglasses I'm a real squinter
probably squinting now and it's not even
Sun I have the ray-ban Wayfarers I
really love them I never take them off
lovelies okay so now onto the beauty
stuff and I don't like to sunbathe with
the face of makeup on when I'm on the
beach or by the pool I just look rough
and except that I look rough but there
are some kind of essential beauty bits I
like to have on me and I don't want to
look completely horrific so although I
don't wear a full face of makeup there
are a few bits I like to take with me to
the pool on the beach of course you need
Sun cream I am just such a Sun cream
person it really annoys me when people
don't wear some cream or they wear like
a factor 5 oil or something this one is
from soul tan I think so 10 Sun cream is
really good they specialize in it I've
never had any problems with it I think
it rubs into the skin really well and
yeah I like it
I actually don't normally go for the
ones with the sprays I have a spray this
time but these can break so I prefer the
kind of lotion once instead I saw this
the other day and thought they look
quite interesting it's the protect and
tan
so it's SPF 30 which is high uva all of
that stuff but it says it also supports
the skin's natural tanning it says it's
formulated with an innovative ingredient
that helps stimulate your body's natural
tanning production no idea if that's
true or not but it sounds pretty cool
and you're getting SPF 30 anyway so even
if the tanning but doesn't work you're
still protected and yeah it really likes
soul time I mean this little clear bag I
like to keep all my beauty bits this
vibe with the little airplane on is
really cute it's from the clear bag
store which is an online
so I keep everything in there so it's
not flying around in my bag and I just
grab it if I need anything I'm just
gonna pull stuff out so there's no
particular order the first thing is the
label M protein spray and this is a
little travel size and this is good
because it protects your hair it's got
like UV protection so if you have
colored hair this will protect you from
the Sun making your hair color go or
funny or making it lighter and when I
get out of the water by hair's wet and
it looks great and curly and then it
dries and it looks horrific so a spray
like this is quite good to just kind of
keep the moisture in and stop it from
going dry and frizzy and brittle and all
of that so I always have some kind of
hair products on me whether it's this or
an oil or anything like that
I have a separate SPF for my face you
don't really need one if you have normal
skin you can use your something on your
face and I do sometimes as well but it's
nice to also have kind of a face one and
I like to wear a higher SPF on my face
so I've been using the Kiehl's
ultralights daily UV defense SPF 50 and
I would use this on holiday as well
and I use a higher SPF for my face
because obviously I don't want to get
wrinkly leathery skin and your face is
just a bit more sensitive so I like to
wear on my face and this is a really
nice when it rubs in really easily and I
recommended this to me and yeah I really
like it I like to have a do jinan me
because you're in and out of the sea in
and out the pool I'm not like a smelly
person but you never know and it's nice
to have a deodorant just in case this is
the dove maximum protection one it's a
cream one and I think cream ones that
make you kind of stay dry better than
like the wet roll-on so I think this is
good but it's quite expensive at area I
also like to keep my travel sized Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
and not really to set my makeup
sometimes like if I go to the beach at
the pool I might put a bit concealer on
in the morning I don't really take it
with me but I might put some under my
eye around my nose on my chin but I like
this also is just like a refreshing
spray but if you are just using it as a
refreshing spray don't invest in urban
decay one you can get from Boots like
the avian sprays or the LA roche-posay
water sprays and they did really nice it
like a refreshing mist so I always have
something like that on my bag whether
it's this or my la roche-posay one which
I couldn't find which is why I put this
one in the video I also like to keep
wipes with me I don't use wipes to
remove my makeup I do like them as a
kind of refresher if you are on the
beach and you're going in another
you can get that kind of salty thing on
your skin I always have a shower when I
get out the sea from my hair and my skin
it's nice to have wipes as well and just
kind of over your face if you're feeling
a bit sweaty we don't need to go into it
you know why wipes are good as I said I
don't really wear makeup I do like to
keep a little bit of kind of blush or
color just in case if I have got a town
that I don't bother but if I'm still at
that kind of awkward pale stage it's
nice to have something just to put on
your cheeks to make you look alive and
less dead and I really like the Josie
Maran coconut water color cheap juillet
and I think this would be really good
I'm not sure if it's waterproof but the
textures really kind of soft and easy to
blend so you won't look like you've got
like blusher and nothing else on it
would just look like a really natural
flush and hits in this little pot it
won't kind of melt away and I just think
this is a nice small size to keep in
your beach bag similar to the wipes I
always keep a hand sanitizer on me I do
when I'm in London I do when I'm a
holiday I always have one on me and the
one I've been loving at the moment is
the cowshed cow Pat which is a horrible
name I really like this because it's
completely different to any other hand
sanitizer I've tried it feels like a
hand cream as soon as you put it on it's
just really moisturizing it doesn't feel
stripping doesn't smell of alcohol
actually smells amazing it smells like a
spa it's so nice whenever I put it on
people always comment saying like wow
what's that smell it's just really
moisturizing and a little bit more
expensive than a normal hand sanitizer
but if you use them as much as I do it's
worth invest a few more Beauty bits if
you do kind of get puffy around the eyes
I know some people when they're kind of
going in and out of water and they're on
the heat and stuff you can get kind of
puffy under here and something that I've
really enjoyed using you recently for
puffy eyes is the origins no puffery
cooling roll-on for puffy eyes
they had this in just the kind of
squeezy form but they've recently
brought one out with a nice cooling
rollerball kind of silver tip at the top
and I really like this just rolling
under your eyes and it probably quite
hard to keep cool if you're by the pool
or by the beach but the metal thing does
keep quite cool even when it's not in a
cool place I've said cool so many times
but this is really good and refreshing I
also like to use an SPF on my lips
because lips do burn quite easily even
when I don't get my lips burn I don't
really burn ever cuz I'm so obsessed
with SPF but they do get a little bit
kind of sore and
skin and your lips is really delicate so
I've been using this number seven Oh
where's the packaging we have to read
the name lip and I screen SPF 30 so I
saw this recently and thought lip ok lip
sunscreen but I sunscreen basically it's
a little windup it looks like concealer
if it comes out it's a clear product
this slightly shimmery so you can use it
on your lips it kind of looks like a
nice little bar you can also use it on
your eyelids which is actually somewhere
where I think people forget to put the
Sun cream because you don't really want
to put your lotion in your eyes in case
it goes in your eye so this is perfect
cuz you can put on your eyelid it looks
like a nice kind of light shimmery
eyeshadow you can put on your lips and
then it comes this really cute little
lipstick form so I'm really impressed
with that and it's SPF 30 and I think
I'll be using this like all the way
through the summer especially if I go
away I really hope I get to go away so
yeah really impressed with that also
this is not an essential but if you're
going somewhere nice on holiday with
your friends and you want to kind of
smell nicely or by the pool a roll-on
perfume it would be a good idea this one
is formulas soft perfume you can get
them at cult you'd see there's loads of
different scents and they are so cute
I've done a blog post so I'll link that
below they come in a little packaging
like this and you take the lid off and
it just looks like that and you can kind
of roll it up
this is Copacabana which just smells
really fresh soapy and lovely but
there's so many different scents and I
love these they last a long time you
need to put them on your wrists on your
neck anywhere you want really and
because they're kind of a waxy formula
they're probably waterproof as well so
this would be good to be sure by default
the last thing in this look bad loads of
hair clips as I was saying my hair just
goes mental it's way worse than Monica
from friends trust me way worse so I
have loads of Cary Grant iron
love a little clip and hair bands and
everything and I still look a mess but I
tried a couple more things in my bag now
I don't use this because you know I have
such difficult hair but I think a lot of
people do like this and it's son-in I
don't have you guys remember this this
just reminds you've been a teenager
because all my friends used it I was
really jealous but if you have kind of
blonde or light brown hair you can spray
this in and it's got lemon extract in it
so when the Sun goes on your hair it
makes it Vonda I know a lot of people
just put lemon in their hair as well is
it's probably not very recommended and
it might dry out your hair but if you
have like really good quality hair and
you want some blonde streaks in and you
don't want to get your hair dyed I think
this would work but I'm not recommending
it I don't use it I just think it's
quite cool and quite fun if you're going
on holiday and I got some kind of blonde
streaks in your hair I think it's my
little bag from and other stories which
I think must be waterproof because it's
called a scuba bag I think it's made out
of the same materials it's scuba diving
suit anything here I just keep my
portable phone charger my phone and my
headphones for listening to music to on
my phone I don't always keep my music on
my phone but I'll load all along before
holiday so I'd have to take an iPod
separately what else chewing gum and
that's everything that's my empty bag
that sounds like a lot of stuff but if
you're going to spend a whole day by the
beach or by the pool you don't wanna be
going back and forth to your hotel or
apartment or / you're staying so like to
have everything with me it makes the
whole thing a lot more relaxing so I
hope you found that helpful if you are
going on holiday have a lovely time I'm
very jealous and I will see you guys in
my next video bye hi today I'm going to
be talking you through my favorite
summer nail polishes first of all sorry
for any background noise it is like the
hottest day of year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
