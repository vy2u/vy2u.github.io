luxury versus budget beauty video and
that's basically just me comparing two
products one high-end ones of drugstore
high street I know the budget one isn't
necessarily cheap you'll see but they're
kind of more the high streets drugstore
products and I'm just going to compare
them and tell you my thoughts because
quite a few of them are quite similar
actually and I'll try and pick a winner
if I can so the first one is hair masks
I've got one here from Oh John which you
guys know is one of my favorite brands
for hair and this is from the damaged
reverse range and this is the
restorative hair treatment plus and it's
the plus one because it has a light to
scent to it so I think the original one
had a really horrible sin and a lot of
people complained so this is the one
with a lighter scent and it's got oton
oil in it of course it's really intense
treatment it lacy looks like this it's
like a hard bomb and you just scoop a
bit out into your hands rub it between
your hands and it tends to an oil and
then I just put it through the head when
your heads dry this before you shampoo
it so you could if you dry hair and
leave it for like 20 minutes and it's
like a really nice thick oil and this is
really good for my kind of hair just
really dry damaged hair this mask is 32
pounds it's quite pricey the budget by I
have for this one is the Charles
Worthington moisture seal intense rescue
melting balm and this you can pick up
from boots for superdrug this is such a
good hair mask I've been loving using
this it looks pretty much the same it's
different color but it's a hard bomb I
use an old lid from a product to scoop
it out so it doesn't all get in my nails
and it feels hard once you stop rubbing
your hands it turns to an oil and then
you can just easily spread it through
your dry hair this one smells really
good actually I like the smell of this
smells like a when you get your hair
done in the hairdresser's the Charles
Logan's one is only in 11 pounds so I
think this is a really good deal and I
think this one will actually work on
more hair types because the ocean on one
even though I really like it very
intense and I think if you have slightly
oily a hair or thinner hair it would
just be too heavy
whereas this one I think work on all
types of hair so I'm gonna pick the
charlesworth into one as my winner out
of the tube because I think
really good deal for 11 pounds and I
really recommend picking one of these up
so the next he put up a makeup base and
I don't actually use a lot of drugstore
high street foundations I'm not sure why
does never refined any that I love but I
have found one now you saw it my monthly
favorites and it's the Revlon nearly
naked foundation and this has SPF 20 and
the one I'm comparing it with is the
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer which
is also SPF 20 I really like the Laura
Mercier tinted moisturizer I've had this
for a long time I don't use it that
often because the shows too dark for me
but when I do I always really enjoy it
it's expensive it's around 33 pounds
depending where you buy it I like to use
my hands to rub this in I find it quite
hard to blend with a brush I'm not sure
why it doesn't really work for me so I
always use my hands and this means very
summer products maybe because the shades
t-dog for me I don't tend to wear it all
year round the Revlon nearly naked
foundation even though this is a
foundation I think it's really
comparable to the Loretto tinted
moisturizer and you know both a light to
medium coverage and kind of give a
similar finish although with the Revlon
I do like to use a buffing brush and I
find that I can use a brush with this
one but yeah I find them really similar
and I love my Laura Mercier but for 33
pounds the Rev lines about 8 899
depending where you buy it I think it
might be worth picking up this one over
this one and giving it a go first thing
what you think the Laura Mercier one
comes in a few different finishes as a
lumen 18 one and an oil-free one so
there are more option whereas the Revlon
just comes in one and they both have
quite a few shades so I think for this
one even though I love Laura Mercier I'm
going to pick Revlon as the winner
because I think this is a really good
drugstore foundation the next category
is skincare stuff and I have two masks
here they're both hydrating masks which
is what I like to use on my skin type
first one is origins drink up intensive
overnight masks which I have spoken
loads about it's kind of a huge dent in
the middle thank you so much of it and
the second one is the LA roche-posay
Hydra phrase intense mask and I haven't
spoken about this one yet
think so the origins while I quickly run
through it if you haven't seen me talk
about it already it's 20 pounds for this
mask and you basically put it on your
cleanse skin at night and you leave it
overnight and in the morning most of the
product would have something into your
skin but if there's any left you can
just wipe it in or wipe it away it
smells incredible like apricots and
peaches and it's a lovely lovely smell
this it doesn't wonder some ID hydrated
skin I absolutely love it and I'll
repurchase it again and again the large
opposed a mask is 15 pounds so it's only
5 pounds difference and it is a
drugstore high-street brand but yeah it
is quite expensive I know for like a
budget by it's not really budgets the
washing Jose is a French brand if you
don't know and it's really good there
are really great products this mask is
white it's kind of white with like a
blue tint to it's really strange Ashley
this one isn't exactly the same you
don't leave it on overnight you just
leave on for 10 minutes but after you've
had it on for 10 minutes you don't wash
it off you just rub in any this left or
just wipe off with a cotton ball pad I
found that it did leave a slight sticky
greasy residue so I kind of used a toner
to get it off afterwards then this is
really good for a quick fix if you need
some hydration in your skin and you
don't want to use an overnight mask but
personally I've further origins and this
has to be the winner for me the next two
products are for the shower and I have
another origins product I'm a little bit
obsessed and it's the origins ginger
burst body wash and the same from Glory
whipped clean and these are both really
really nice the origins ginger range I
absolutely love the scent of is the sort
of products you're only like if you like
the scent so go and have a sniff and
Origins cancer then loads of products
all the same said I just think it's
really refreshing and love using this in
the morning
oh it's not like a gel it's more like a
and it says body wash I currently
explain it but it's bit more creamy and
luxurious than a shower gel I really
really like this this is 16 pounds which
is a little bit pricey but I've only got
up to there and I've used loads so I
think it will last a really long time
the safe and very clean is 8 pounds you
can get this fun boots and Superdrug any
kind of high street drugstore place and
it's a shower of butter so it's a really
really thick cream and this bottle is
huge you get so much for your money oh
the thing that I don't love about this
is the scent is pistachio almond and
sweet vanilla a little bit too sweet for
me
hopefully they'll kind of bring out some
other sense maybe because I'd love this
if it wasn't a different smell because
it's so softening on your skin it's like
a really thick cream it leaves a soft
feeling amazing I really like soap &amp;amp;
Glory shower products so I was very
impressed with this but I don't love the
scent so I'm going to pick origins as my
winner because the ginger smell is just
incredible I absolutely love it but you
can buy two of these for the price of
one of these so maybe go and have a see
if you like the smell of this purse
because it's definitely a good budget
body final category and lip products
which is the most exciting one I think
and I have two very similar products
that have very different price tags the
first one is the Rimmel apocalypse which
was launched recently I did a whole blog
post on it so I'll link that below and
the second one is the hourglass opaque
Rouge or Rouge opaque always forget
which way ride is and these are both
kind of liquid lipstick lip lacquer the
kind of things River apocalypse $5.99
and the hourglass 23 pounds there's
absolutely huge difference here you can
see straight away that the room of
apocalypse is quite a big product and
hourglass in like a little bullet they
both have very similar though front I
think they say an applicator the Rimmel
one has like a little pool of product
inside it and their hourglass one has
quite a bendy tip which I like for
precision application the hourglass one
applies very wet that the mini you kind
of press your lips together it dries as
sets like a stain and it's kind of
impossible to budge it lasts all day and
all night I really like that about it
it's very very long-lasting I don't know
if the blog post will go up here but I
have a blog post of me wearing this
color which is icon so I'll link that
below if it's already up it's an amazing
kind of deep dark red color the remote
apocalypse goes on quite wet and it
stays wet for longer compared to the
hourglass it's got quite a glossy finish
and it does feel a little bit wet on the
lips which is something I don't love
because you kind of get your hair stuck
to your lips and they would
blows and stuff but these come in loads
of colors the rim or populist I really
like them I raved about it in my blog
already and I think these a really good
budget buy and there's amazing colors I
think my favorite Stella I think this
one stellar actually yeah this was
fellow and it's like a really bright
pinky coral color I think for this one
I'm going to pick our glass although I
think these are incredible too
definitely the price tag is amazing on
these but if you want to treat yourself
to amazing lip products I think these
are really good and there's some really
amazing colors I just like what they set
like a stain and don't move because I
hate how to reapply lipstick all the
time so if you're going to go out for a
meal this is kind of the perfect lip
product and there's a bright red as well
called Raven which is amazing so they're
those are all my luxury and budget
beauty products and I hope you liked
