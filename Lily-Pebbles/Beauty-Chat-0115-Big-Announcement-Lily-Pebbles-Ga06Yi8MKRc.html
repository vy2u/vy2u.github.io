beauty chat video I'm here with Anna
hello and we start in another year of
beauty shot videos and we actually have
a little bit of a very big exciting
announcement so watch to the end of the
video because we're going to tell you
all about it then so we're going to go
through we have I think 10 questions
again that like normal we got them from
Twitter from you guys so the first one
is what's your favorite pink MAC
lipstick okay I instantly thought of
this one it's a bit of an oldie but a
goodie Mac angel oh I see used to wear
that a lot but then it it's quite cool
it is quite cool I personally prefer to
wear it just like Pat it onto the lips
that's all blended in I wouldn't wear it
really typically I think it's one of
those colors that can be quite
frightening on the face so it just looks
good with quite simple makeup I think
we've had this question before if you
teacher I'm having a bit of a flashback
because I've picked em luster in fuchsia
I think you actually done this question
before oh well I may to these beats chat
videos you may not already know Anna's
favorite pink I'll pick up angel my
flustering
which is unlike any other lipstick shade
I have it's kind of quite a bright pink
but because it's quite warm it's quite
ready it's quite easy to wear I don't
like that yeah I think like last time I
said I must buy the yeah I didn't like
this there you go alright the next
question is once a bloggers favorite
tool but seems to have fallen off the
radar what is your view of the
Clarisonic so I got my Clarisonic
there's a Christmas present from Mark
about must be like to two or three years
ago now a long time and I used it
religiously I'd say for about a year
yeah got really into it and I do still
like it it's more just it's the effort
it's the time I do find that my skin
actually look quite good when I used it
and sometimes when my skin looks a
little bit rough now I kind of go back
to it and use it as a bit of a one-off
but in terms of using it every day I
just I'd rather be in bed watching Parks
and Rec I'm not a massive fan I never
had one eye I always like to wait for a
hike to go to pass and then after
something my mom had well known I gave
it go and also the clinic came out
recently I'm just not a big fan it feels
a bit too harsh on my skin like I first
to wash my face using my hands and
muslin cloth
it's just too I don't know I have a
sensitive skin but it just feels too
harsh for me I don't like the idea of it
really the next question is what do you
think was the most overhyped product of
2014 that just didn't meet its
expectations I had I think about this
one and actually I feel like I've
thought quite a good one I think I have
- hey the anaesthesia as well Anastasio
darling I understand correctly are you
understand via the brow is it called
dipwad
was not a fun and you know I see people
use it in videos all the time and it
looks incredible and I'm like girl you
have serious skills because on me I look
like I just drawn on my brows with a
really thick paint I couldn't get it to
work and I kind of don't have the
attention span for it brow is all the
way yeah mine is the benefit push-up
liner oh yes see I like that yeah until
Lily said she needs to try this one
forward one and I was like oh man this
tomforde one blows out I've never liked
it oh my god the high pitch is that high
pitch I think it is good in terms of the
applicator if you're like me and you're
really pants are doing the whole like
lying
I think he's gift that but if you're
like idiom you quite the hardest they're
not fiddly and then the whole things
that flicked up rather oh my eye line
was just falling off my eye and also
benefit loved a hyper product I know I
love that bow benefit as well but it was
immediately hyped
oh my better over the world sorry how do
you color match drugstore foundations
and concealers and which is the best for
combo skin I actually do find it quite
difficult but a few tips color match
wise I think is to try and identify the
shade of your skin before you go in so I
mean by that is like whether you're pink
toned or yellow tone or neutral because
I always know to look for like the
neutral 30s like I just know that that's
my see I always need to go for like that
ivories
yeah I know that like foundations go put
orange on me so stay away from the pinky
things like kind of identify the
undertone
your skin if you can and also I think
when you do try it on I always try it
like my chin downs my neck and then I go
outside the daylight and look out there
because everything looks different when
you're in boots and Superdrug like yes
daily light is definitely a big factor
but also say go online and have a google
of swatches I sometimes just like to see
how like the N 1 and n 2 and 3 compared
almost from those pictures if they're
good enough pictures I can kind of tell
ya what I need to go for so I'd say do a
bit of like prep before you go and have
a look make up Valley is amazing for
reviews as well also I just thought when
you I haven't thought before but if you
have a foundation like there's a perfect
color match for you take a little song
but with you and you can compare it on
your hand first you need various genius
favorite okay this is my favorite
question favorite brush - Apple liquid
foundation gotta love a good iPhone time
favorite brush for applying liquid
foundation okay I have two one high end
one low end kind of the Bobbi Brown full
coverage face brush and the Real
Techniques buffing brush both round very
similar and it's a buff in my foundation
I was never a fan of the traditional
foundation brushes like yeah I know what
was on the bottle I just use my hands
until I discovered these I never went
for this like the Real Techniques
buffing brush changed foundation brush
it did before that is all about those
ones that you just used to like paint on
in your skin and this you like go like
this in certain circles and it really
gets into the skin
I - Bobbi Brown will cover his face
brush I like this one like the name
suggests for more like the full coverage
look I think that because it's quite
like small and quite dense you can
really blend things in really well make
it look very natural even if it's quite
thick full coverage finish if I'm doing
something a bit more sheer ago for the
louise you're on ly 34 brush which is
basically like a big I just think that
don't worry that would make me put too
much foundation on cuz it's so big on
here I thought even with this I end up
with my foundation around my hairline
think if you had a like a full coverage
foundation it probably would because it
shares things out but with something
like it should not like to give me an
aqua I don't think there's anything
better than this to put it on it's
almost like putting it on with your
hands but just I like kind of hate
myself
why is your favorite round brush they're
nice and fluffy my light looks like if I
move my just stays in position I washed
mine yesterday
there you go wash your brushes okay what
makeup item makes you cringe and other
people wear it wrong there's no way I'm
arching this without sounding like a
massive bitches but we don't mean sorry
over the cementery I thought it was
straight away because I feel like I see
this quite a lot of people and I just I
don't know say don't I'm not I'm walking
no I don't believe in it though yeah the
highlighter because I think a lot of
people think oh I'm gonna get it with
the highlighter you really just meant to
kind of put up the tops of cheekbones
some people put it quite like all over
there and I think if you put it too low
down you just get really shiny cheeks
I think you're right I hadn't thought of
that and when it reflects off the light
I can't really see when you're putting
on your lip oh hi nice and then you go
to a bar and you're like that girl makes
you look sweaty but you're not each this
rightly so makes you look a bit like
you're from another planet yeah my one
would have to be like the orange ring
all right anyone else either but I kind
of I remember I'm like the matron the
Maybelline Dream matte mousse names I
don't use that like the color
pure sand or big line you don't feel
like it's fine that happens that often
anymore but if it doesn't take too much
my idea always have to do the neck
because I'm quite like naturally Palin I
like something a bit more focused on my
face but just how do I prevent my
eyelashes dropping after apply mascara
if that makes any sense
does make sense quite commonly a problem
I think I have that problem so about my
eyelashes they're quite long but they're
like this they're going like downwards
naturally and a horse like a horse or an
earthen like they're just like boom and
I put mascara on it v mascara that
people really loved and raved about and
it always look good kind of immediately
and then like 10 minute later be like
that I found the key is in a really good
pair of eyelash curlers something like
the sharing mirror ones are just
incredible and then a waterproof mascara
it's
to do with the formula being global
basis I think and it just holds occult
so much better to say now i only use
waterproof mascara and i don't have that
problem
it's annoying kisses so most people's
cars are really annoying to take off in
the yeah but I I actually need to invest
in a good book because recently my
eyelashes have not been as curly as they
used to be or not long they're just
doing that weight and none of my
favorite mascaras are like you for me
even the King bleep on a Tarte one
they're all just like bit rubbish at the
moment so it means I blame the lashes
and it's a trial okay what eyes shadow
could you not live without and why and
favorite hand lotion for the winter
sneaky two questions all that means is
Nikki I'm intrigued by what you're it's
a really plain one I don't even wear
everyday but I feel like if I could I
get I feel like if I didn't have it I
would just go oh every time I went to
reach for it okay come again yep
Mac patina in what a pic series wedding
tutorials years ago Nick did it and it's
like look I've got like a big day and
you have it's a even is it it's like a
light bronze e golden eachine that just
blends it I wear it everyone was asking
I'm wearing and it's so subtle and easy
to wear and I just love it
I remember Tommy using that in a video
like from way back when
oh it's fab repelled Bali
would you guess it I don't know maybe
not but very well the reason your I said
okay or Bali
it's con open it it kind of very
familiar anyways yours is maybe a little
bit more go small pinky
yes mine school wasn't more like olivey
yeah but it's just got that whole it's
just something on the lid it doesn't
look too much that's really good with
just mascara if ever I'm having one of
those days where I'm like I don't know
what makeup to where I would do this on
the eye because you don't need anything
else let's just do that you don't pay
anything in the crease okay top three
items from Charlotte Tilbury I need in
my life I wanted all this is a good
question because I've got both of us
love a lot of Charlotte Tilbury and it's
nice grass I don't know how I like
different things as well yeah although I
I got one of mine mixed up on the way
yeah like go on show and tell show
okay so this is the one I kind of got me
I love this but I should have picked
something else so this is the like to
wonder foundation I love this is amazing
you still good I know like you know I
mean unless I'm completely wrong but
it's a lightweight like a tinted
moisturizer it's so it's like glowy
without being glittery which is quite
rare Charlotte Tilbury she loves leg
lifter it's just the perfect amount of
glow but I think I forgot I probably
should have picked the rock and coal
liners instead because Elizabeth violet
the plumb one is literally that's more
that's even right now I wear like a lot
so like wonder foundation the film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow amazing this is the
probably the best thing I own in a
homemaker question contour and highlight
like really a mini hip pad that phrases
but anyway I've used a lot of this the
most delicious highlight server and the
matte revolution lipsticks especially
love lipid Liberty Liberty matte
lipstick ever because they don't feel
heavy or drying like most matte
lipsticks they're aluminous and they are
comfortable I went for this the
eyeshadow palette in the dolce vita
I think I'm a Libra swirl it's just a
good all-round eyeshadow palette you
could do a daytime look with it you can
do like a really fancy evening look and
the pressed pigment in it is just
beautifully I don't normally like shade
that light but that and the brown
together I really like it's really nice
that it's in Nice shape
I really like the red I like a good read
each one but I just think it's nicely
laid out and packaging is beautiful as
well Rock &amp;amp; Co a chronic liquid eye
pencil
Lily loves the violet one secondly and
this is violet and I like Marlena
midnight which is like the Navy version
it is more incredible whenever I put
them on my hand I put them on my hand
and then I go to wipe them off like
later on they're impossible to wipe off
this so seriously
long-lasting but you get bit of time to
smudge it if you want to do just that
they apply so smooth it's like yeah they
just go on so smooth you can like
sharpen it into quite a good point like
there's nothing I don't love about
I think they're incredible and then my
final thing would be a brush you're not
big fan of this line I use everyday I
just think it could be softer
it could be softer but it does pick up
put it well because it's not that soft
yeah and it's got like a nice tapered
edge it's the powder and sculpt for us I
think powder I'm spoke too much it's
incredible for contour if like me you've
got quite big face but small aggregates
have gotten tool because you can just do
like a tiny little amount and it blends
out so well I just think I can't believe
you don't have this you know this is
like I know they're like father
resistant they're supposed to be married
it's what I used to the other like at me
I might need to make a circus or garage
yes okay final question what makeup
looks you prefer on each other
Lily Donna and it's a million do you do
to me I like it when you do a really
brown smokey eye because you don't do it
that often and your eyes are so green
I'm so jealous of a green eyes items
will you yeah I think it looks really
nice hey I love it when Lily does you do
a liner with like a tiny bit of shimmer
on the eye and then you do a deep red
lip
I love Lily in a deep red lips we like a
patina with a bit of black iron or in a
document yes something like when you did
was it V no yeah he had you mixing to
you mixing a Tom Ford and a Charlotte's
who come forward we like Dahlia yeah and
it was tough it was another time for it
was a bright red tone for crimson north
yeah she loves my luscious lips okay so
we have a little bit of a big huge
announced and I'm really excited about
this we don't know how so how do we be
doing this beat show videos for I wish
