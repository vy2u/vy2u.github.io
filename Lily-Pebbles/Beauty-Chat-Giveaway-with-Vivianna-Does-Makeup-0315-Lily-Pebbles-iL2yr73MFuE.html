need it but just for the polka dot I
want that's it I just think this is a
great everyone loves this fragrance it's
just a nice rose yeah it's like bruise
it's like floral but a light floral yeah
mine would be Jo Malone would sage and
sea salt
I really really like this these loads
and sure haven't worn in ages well very
fresh
smells like seaside yeah that one it
doesn't like the seaside that smells
like you like you yeah
Jerzy through again I just wonder smells
good
Beatrice says what is your favorite
brush brand I feel like we're both gonna
say the same for this way yeah one two
okay mine so Evo's so ever however you
say it um because I'm really fast about
eye brushes and I haven't really found a
brand that does great eye brushes and
they do the best i brushes I love the
fluffy ones and that little ones for
under the eye I like flat ones and
they're really affordable
I love how they've all got on like the
same kind of like I really don't need
that many I don't know every other keen
on I'm like I never forgot about them
they do do really good brushes and I
felt like Real Techniques as well a good
yeah the drugstore ones yeah I love the
Bobby Brown yeah yeah I don't know why I
didn't even pick but I need more I feel
like I could have the whole Bobby Brown
range just as my brush collection and be
really happy with that
I'll get another share powdered one cuz
I use it for blusher but it's also good
for powder you can use even bronzer I
used it for blush tilde and really love
to play normally use a lot of powder the
eye blender is beautiful this is like my
new map t17 in the way like I feel like
the two months setting you need but this
one just takes it to the next level and
then the full coverage face brush is
great for just everyday foundation those
are the eye blender once again for
powder under the eye to go okay Macaulay
says do you have a specific playlist
album you listen to all getting ready
I picked this on god it's Blaine I know
has made most insane playlist with my
help a little bit but it was mainly your
suggestions and it's good and Lilly's
throwbacks a list and we've spoken about
it a lot because it's hilarious like
late 90s early 2000s music i'ma show you
all my friends and they listen to
in the car on the way here I've added
some new ones happy within the car
waiting for my mom the other day and I
added graduation by vitamin C you know
I've noticed a few that I don't really
know and what's the other one I added
girlfriend and think oh yeah feel like
that was that was missing yeah and but
there are some new ones on it it's so I
can be a DJ make it good I mean like
with 90 32,000 usek okay Lucy said what
are your best tips for traveling with
makeup brushes because mine always gets
squished I have a tip I don't have the
item to show because I don't actually
own it but then one of those ones that
are like a little pot with like a top
you can zip over and it's it's hard yeah
I really want one where you get them
from every Sigma UK no one really knows
about secret I think that one love
makeup uh I'm not sure if they actually
so that I'm just like a long makeup yeah
like this one I used you look lovely
today
yeah alphabet bags it's just long and I
can fit my big brushes tie them all
together at the hair burn and they won't
fly around my tip would be to get one of
these there this one is from a spinner
of London so it's quite pricey white
company do one as well if you make put
it in a spring/summer collection it's
just like please you can use a pencil
case as well okay so the end I thought I
heard that paper in there so it doesn't
get grumpy but it's just the perfect
shape and the brush is just sitting
there and they have a little home while
they're traveling Jersey says what are
your current favorite TV shows okay so

Recreation because I watched all seven
seats seven seasons in about two months

just feel like I don't got any more time
in my life for TV shows but yeah it's my
like I like to fall asleep more would
just want hit something hard and fall
asleep yeah exactly
okay Claudia said what's the best
reliable long wearing concealer for a
12-hour working day much needed okay
I've got a suggestion what's yours
I'm intrigued to see what they're okay
to be very secretive about this little
bag I have two suggestions one under I
like I feel like this is a really good
under-eye concealer that Estee Lauder
Double Wear stay in place I use it in
extra light that is messy
is it really it's kind of creamy but
it's very long wearing it goes really
lovely under the eye if it's for
blemishes the Laura Mercier secret
camouflage because they let ain't going
anywhere
yeah I knew you were gonna pick that up
so I didn't have any good ones but not
from there I know but the blemishes is
with it yeah I picked me up forever full
cover concealer it's quite creamy it's
not like dry as the laura mercier one um
so maybe not if you have oily skin but
it's proper full cover and it lasts all
day on me another small cube okay Sandra
asked nice picks on someone to know your
answer dog breed anything you ever had a
dog know so I'm a bit I'm not sure -
yeah I'm just going by looks at this one
just anything is quite cute and fluffy
you know an answer
ah me and Mark always say that if we get
dog we would get a sausage dog and we
would cool
Jarvis I think they're quite funny he's
you like magic me involved that you can
around them like a little sausage though
I think you're gonna name like a type of
sausage yeah you hit that really cool it
yeah you gonna say your dog right I
probably should they get me as a Tibetan
Terrier really like her but she's like a
good size is that medium got soft hair
she doesn't share to make anyone
allergic and it's got very nice nature
she could give me this yeah I'm sure the
scavenger we want sort of we want to
take her out for a walk I mean is she
gone and she was just running towards us
with a hole in my mouth that is a flap
we make so yeah she's definitely a
scavenger and rich loves Huskies but
yeah a pig Lauren asked I'm going to New
York next month what essential products
should I pick up from Sephora I feel
like we're both gonna say yeah oh yeah
maybe it will exactly the same yeah
yes poor lady loves for lips on my lips
is somewhere bad cuz color yes very well
yeah yep like that one cap on the liquid
lipstick I like these because it's just
a bit more range I do yes I do me like
this for once but the color you get a
few more colors with this it looks a bit
more drawing but it's a bit more
long-lasting mm-hmm I have a lot this
one topped gifted mascara you can't kind
of get taller than okay but it's easier
to get in America and it's good give us
go and I would say this the perfect hair
day five and once I'm treatment I still
anything you can get this it and oh you
can't you can't it's great and basically
the only thing I really use it my hair
these days did I tell you our artisans
jumping petitioner than them yeah you
said it was really good yeah it's gonna
be my faves I think this is a final
question from Briana I've heard washing
your hair less makes your hair healthier
how often do you ladies wash your hair
have a great week
Thanks we have a good week dude I've had
this too but for me I've got I've got
greasy old hair it's a racially I tend
to do every other day well they this
morning is Monday and I
I wish my husband's Friday so that was
Red Bull it doesn't know oh no I did
wash it in the air but it was a bit
greasy
well I can nominate three days if I get
the old dry shampoo out see my hair's
quite dry so I like a bit of grease
second day third day has the best for me
so I wish my hair can't really remember
but I think it's probably every four or
five days I like to wait unit really
means washing I hate washing my hair is
literally my least favourite thing in
the world to do so I always wait so as I
can but dry shampoo is not really
working for me these days I keep using
it and then it looks like I've got
dandruff not my white man just like
little white bits everywhere oh good so
those are all the questions unlike me
some have a little giveaway and the
giveaway is eight goodie bucks from a
beauty chat live events that we did with
Space NK these are good goodie bags yeah

amazing if we say something yes so no
