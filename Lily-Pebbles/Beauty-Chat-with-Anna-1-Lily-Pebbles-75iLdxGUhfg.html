of our beauty chat videos I'm of course
here with Anna
hello and we've got all your questions
in front of us we picked four for my
video and then for four Anna's which
will be up next month so should we get
started yeah let's do it
so the first question is if you are
stuck on a deserted island what three
beauty products would you pick to have
with you this was hot outside and it's
hardly like school what do you think
like I've done it I've done a mix go on
you guys I have some mix as well
shall I go through all three yeah yeah
the first one went for is the Bioderma
photo dome a KN matte SPF 30 and this is
more of like a practical one I haven't
tried that do you know I think you've
quite liked it
hmm it's quite a matte finish it's kind
of one of those berry they're like SPF
beyond this is more like a practical
thing but I thought if I'm gonna be on
my land it's gonna be really hot is that
I burn I can just slap this everywhere
you don't really even if people might
never see you again yes to you I have a
complete you know reach you think then I
thought my mascara because mascara is
one of those things which I I don't wear
a lot of makeup but I do always have
must go wrong because I love it yeah and
I went for the L'Oreal for slash
telescopic waterproof one it's just
different to you this is different this
is different to the telescopic one which
I go on about all the time and I think
that one has been discontinued I think
this is sort of the replace and is is
good no but it's not it's not like awful
it is waterproof that whole Sekou has
really similar like one of those little
actually brushes and it really does like
pull your lashes up so I'm just I'm
testing out maybe I will fall in love
with you and then I went for a lip gloss
because I just think these are one of
the best things about kind of like a
very pretty lip balm I think and it's
the Clarins instant like natural effect
is I've got the shade right one
I was always an o2 girl I was yeah
absolutely more peachy want anybody's
number they are all ridiculously similar
actually like zero and I think the other
one is zero five or four there's two
pinky ones and they only be nice I mean
by this one okay so the first thing I
picked is Palma divine which is
something
Kabu TN it's like a multi-purpose bomb
always wanted to try this yeah because
it's you can maybe use it as a lip balm
on your elbows you can use of a burnt or
grazes so you can use it for like to
make yourself look nice but then if I
kind of summe man I get attacked or I
hit a rock who knows it cool it's like a
battle thingy Elizabeth Arden eight our
careers which I didn't like there's the
smell so this is - oh nice
a second thing it's also an SPF and the
one that I've been loving at the moment
is from Kiko's I said he can I think
yeah oh is the secret filter sunscreen
it's SPF 50 and it's also a primer that
won't help if you're stuck on an island
but for normal life it's really nice
finish primer I love this it kind of
comes up at yellowy I don't know if
there's any point for that but it just
feels really nice and smooth out your
skin and SPF 15 which is amazing I got
it yesterday
did you yeah yeah haven't tried it yet I
get on the back of my hand to write it
does come out strange kind of yellowy
but then it just sinks into the third
thing looser mascara I thought I try and
think if there's like one makeup product
if I had no makeup on if I had a nice
town I wouldn't need foundation
concealer I think mascara just makes you
look a bit more awake yeah it does and I
don't have like a waterproof mascara
that I'm loyal to but the one I'm using
that moment it's clinic
high and things like high-impact water
fruit yeah like it's these very natural
lashes is nothing - but then I think
you'd want at your beach anyway I really
like that one okay I see like a village
Creek from scar and I think that's quite
nice very natural I haven't found like
the one yet so I'm like I don't really
use literature scars that much but
because it's been so hot recently in
acting and it's a front good one
that's a nice question - is is it easier
to apply foundation with brush or your
fingers so I thought about this one and
I thought there isn't really an answer
there's just some foundations the better
to five your fingers and so with a brush
and also it's kind of just a personal
preference really yeah there's like you
know you're right overall assets back
yeah I own like a nice trip exactly I
thought we'd bring a couple of
foundations and which ones we use our
fingers then Libby's looking down
because she can see I really bought one
I thought we agreed to bring like and I
thought about it and I actually like
most foundations with a bit both I
really I quite like applying them with a
brush at first and then finishing off by
blending with one you know I wanted to
get a really natural finish and the one
I love Giorgio Armani you know luminous
silk is incredible and applied with the
fingers it's one of those ones I know
you sell judge always talks about when
she looks in her magnifying mirror and
she can't see it on her face and I've
always sort of wondered I don't mean not
talking about there but this yeah
totally understand you can look in like
a most magnifying magnifying mirrors and
you can't see it at all it's like skin
you just put on the skin with this but
all of my foundations I put one with a
brush Real Techniques buffing brush is
where I thought and then blend out the
fingers afterwards I like it as well
with most of my foundation to end it
with my fingers but there are some that
I've find my fingers like the wire style
of the tentacle are just yeah oh like
but especially in my Chanel advice to be
more accurate because it's quite a
watery one I always fell out with the
watery foundations if you use a brush it
kind of just soaks it all into the brush
the brush filled it all yeah yeah I like
to use my fingers for this and I would
say you don't need much so I can use my
fingers but one that I literally have to
use a brush for is my nose shape load I
love but I always tease my thing is
buffing brush it's just that you stop a
brush just amazing I know I've always
hated it before I even knew your buffing
brush is a to hate the kind of
foundation oh they like they hate ones
like why am i using this you sure this
is what you supposed to do and then like
I learned back to the glacier is it on
doesn't it often brush to really like
yeah but then even with this I kind of
end with my finger yes but I prefer this
with a brush tip question 3 is what's
your favorite Mac product of the moment
I'm Alex but ah I cried I was gonna pick
a clear paint pot yeah but I thought
you'd bring that no I didn't owe someone
for this I am really liking this because
it's been quite hot in the UK and this
is awesome but you know sometimes if you
go a bit crazy with the foundation or
powder and you really like load up in
your favor
this morning yeah point of like no
return it's very difficult to come back
from that but this I just sprayed on my
buffing brush and then just like all
over your face and it's like you never
put all that powder on it just pays I
don't know you just spray on them with a
bit like little wet face yeah to do it
on the brush and then just to go like
that and all of a sudden it's like back
to kind of Noomi Noomi yeah you go back
to like doing that really finish on the
skin there try that trick I do have that
it's Hardy for so many things people use
it's like setting generator beginning
spray mixed in with pigments but I
really like it is like when you go a bit
crazy with pompe okay so what did I
bring oh yeah if you saw my recent haul
and review video you'll know I bought
loads of Mac for us and I'm loving all
of those stuff but I thought I'd talk
about something different so I'm also
loving woodwind I saw I thought it's
gonna be 12 million McLeod she always
goes on about Club burn everywhere in
matte honey we skip hard enough stuff
but I've got wood wings here which I'm
wearing today a thing on top of
something else she's a really nice
bronzy gold any color I feel like it
works today and evening and I love it
and it's easy to blend it's just my
favorite my pleasure though pop yeah
Cotton Club I really like it and I'm
just using it loads recently the last
question which is the hardest one I
think is what's your favorite skincare
product on a budget I I feel like I'm a
bit that I'm gonna be the viewer in this
one because I'm gonna do it I haven't
really found anything amazing so I want
you guys to recommend stuff to me and
I'm gonna listen to what you're saying
okay
you know I do have something but I don't
think it really counts go for your phone
okay so it's a bit of a cheap because I
don't think you can get it in the UK and
it's not for that cheap but it's from
first aid beauty and it's the instant
oatmeal mask and it's $22 I think so
it's maybe about 15 pounds it's not too
expensive so the pattern in the middle
they do the brand here but I don't think
they do the mask and I love this when my
skin is getting bit crazy it doesn't
read or saw it's like really call me it
does go up in porridge in your face but
weird look at it she like
it feels amazing on skin you should put
on quite ten minutes and it's very nice
but doesn t count okay I've got more to
like product ranges rather than specific
products so I do have two products say
that I really liked the first one is
doing a Brennan she's a facialist and
this is the tea flower deep clean pore
purifying clay mask pick out from boots
I think it's around seven ish pounds
really and it's a huge bottle but bottom
of this is massive it would lash do you
think how many face months that time
I'll pass this around all the time and
boots and I really want to try some I've
just always been overwhelmed I don't
know what to get but I mean you want to
try see not their vitamin C range is
supposed to be really good yeah I think
this is more kind of an oily skin range
but their bitumen c1 is supposed to be
like a good but it's just one of those
like classic clay face masks but it
doesn't make your face feel really strip
like stripped and like a dry I think
you'd really like that I'm sure and I'm
trying to pretend oil at the moment and
it's moving up it smells incredible
smells like clippos how much and then
the other one is La Roche Posay and then
ethical range is really nice I
recommended it to a friend he was having
real serious issues with her skin and I
went to see her like a few months ago I
was like the skin is looking amazing
that combined with Liz oh she was using
yeah and her skin is like cleared up
looks really I love Laura Spezza I'm so
happy they like properly do like most
the products here now because yeah well
they didn't know they didn't try it yet
the newest thing in videos but that
effort wide range is really really good
people who are kind of struggling with
like oily acne prone skin and I like
this yeah Matt Richie's is that is so
nice he is really what you said to do
these things I think when you're really
oily or you think as well like or what
it can't use moisturizers yeah you think
oh no no but this is a fabulous
moisturizer for oily skin sit like
nourishes without looking too like both
decrease your skin I like that
okay I nice going look at that
yeah we're going to look out after so
those are all the four questions I hope
you enjoyed hearing some of our answers
