to do another beauty chat video and I'm
here with Anna hello of course couldn't
do a beauty chat video without Anna and
we asked you guys on Twitter to send me
loads of questions and we're going to
pick ten for this video so should we get
started let's do this
the first question comes from Connie
what are your top 3 products to carry on
a plane I went for sermon on the beauty
related shock horror because if it's
short haul which more often than not for
me it is I can't be bothered with the
whole moisturiser mini facial and you do
that a lot of a 13-hour flight if it's
really really long definitely but if not
I think you're gonna say the same here
noise cancelling headphones
noise-cancelling headphones are just the
best thing ever want to fight they look
a bit crazy shall I demonstrate though
good especially if you're a nervous
flier something to read good one Allure
magazine oh and then I feel like you may
pick the same the Lana lips and
bacterial hand cream there is a hand
cream and a nice back gel in one so
funny I mean three of those are my plain
essentials but I think all of them are
actually none of mine of the same and
that's good makes for more interesting
video it does I've got a couple of them
here the this works deep sleep stress
less rollerball I love this because the
smell is calming and it makes me a less
scared on a plane and it's Macy filling
in a little spar and I don't have become
a bit of a habit of mine on planes I
carry that one too
yeah yeah a hairband because when my
heads down I feel stressed so first
thing I do is tie my hair up but I want
to play and my third is travel sickness
pills which is very boring but I think
it's I don't even think they work I
think it's like a mental thing for me I
take one 20 minutes for the fly and it
just makes you feel less travel sick
let's see the next question comes from
Lucinda when if you have children what's
the one piece of beauty advice you'd
pass on to them I now I know straight
away it's just like I know I've got
feeling my belly what my heart's to this
question they say I'll never say don't
pluck your eyebrows
because my mom told that to me and my
older sister plucked hers to death that
she has thin eyebrows oh sorry if you're
watching this but I never did and now a
browser it and I'm glad I didn't yet my
mom never told me and ended up cutting
them off with baby scissors oh and then
she had to fill them in with black kohl
liner because that's all she had and
then when I had swimming lessons they
and they came off and all the kids law
my mother told me because in the 60s she
plucked hers really thin so she's had to
have her tattooed on so she said don't
be my mistake
the next question is from sake at sock
monster oils serums SPF moisturizer
elixir I use at least two of these at
I'm clueless as to the correct order I
think this is a little I need a lot of
people struggle with this join us I do
as well sometimes I'm doing it
completely the wrong order not cherries
is there a right right is it a post is
no way you can might print out a thing
and put it in your cupboard because that
helps me remember what order to do
things so this is how I do it cleanse
tone eye cream yerim or oil moisturizer
and SPF during the day yeah yeah I do
those name yes same for evening although
in the evening I take my eye makeup off
yeah but yeah I do exactly that the
runway everywhere said what is your
beauty and fashion guilty pleasure
beauty wise I love glitter and then I
was like a completely random but I just
love good to like Mac pigments you know
like reflex paralyzed like I really want
that I don't know when I would ever wear
it but I love a bit glitter I can't help
myself
my beauty one is face wipes I know I'm
not like them but I don't think you
should use face ups to cleanse like as
your cleanser but sometimes in the
morning and when I'm in a rush it gives
my amazing right place and then it's
fashion wise is taxi bottoms and
trainers oh yeah I mean I also train as
I've fallen in love with trainers and if
you said like this time last year would
have been like I don't even own a pair
of trainers and now I have three oh
they're just so comfortable yeah mine so
the first shoe also comfortable bunks
people hate them and in the fashion
industry they're like so lame I get care
yes so warm comfy and when it's cold in
the UK in the winter good pair black
hole
I love them I actually I've loved them I
think this winter am i investing yeah I
don't care for look like I've strike
feet I think cool though they're like
giant feet we've got big feet anyway
they're girls no Joe Joe asked what is
the one makeup trend that you wish you
could pull off that you just can't I
think for me it would be really smokey
eye makeup whenever I want they yeah
whenever I watch a pixie we tutorial and
sounds on this like amazing dramatic I'm
like I'd love to pull that off but
there's just think about my eyes I
haven't got a lot of lid space and
they're quite small and put quite a big
face
and so when I do smokey eyes I just look
a bit I don't know I thought I always
think you do wear that but nothing about
you don't know I always have to keep it
quite daytime in mine is bright colors
you know that Urban Decay electric
palette oh yeah so I tried so many
different ways to wear that and I just
don't the I can put off bright colors it
makes my features a lot darker than they
already are really dark and I find it
really hard I used to wear like bright
eyeliner under my eye and sometimes that
work yeah I struggle with bright colors
London girl one one one five ask what's
your beach makeup recommendation no
makeup or minimal makeup no makeup I
knew you're gonna say that and they make
up just SPF cousin you need to keep
reapplying the SPF anyway so you just
end up with a bit of a mess like maybe a
lip balm or like saying like the Clarins
it's like natural lip Perfector with a
bit of mascara which with mascara maybe
but for me I'm always like I always
think what I'm gonna do and then when I
actually when it comes to it and my
gonna just put the SPF on for me if I'm
worried my family then nothing just SPF
but if you're on holiday with like
friends there anyway with like 40
friends or something like I won't look
good I don't even background people's
photos I don't know and to make me feel
better so the products I would use a
concealer blusher and mascara just these
three not like loads of makeup but just
something so I don't look asleep and
really big sunglasses yeah both neat
sorry if I said your name wrong has
asked what are your top three pink nail
polishes for spring/summer you go first
because I'm gonna have to have a rummage
around in my okay my first one is my
ground we'll be so happy about
my grandmommy's thanks shout-out to amaz
ground my first thought is Topshop skip
I don't know if this is still out I
think I got this last year but it's so
nice I mean we're gonna in the spring
it's a really really nice kind of bright
pink that's not neon it's not past all
it's just the perfect like that a lot on
pink SC watermelon which is like a
darker bright pink and I love this it's
really like chic and grown-up and
sophisticated and Revlon ginger melon
which is kind of similar to skip
slightly less bright and it smells good
we've got a very similar one because
I've got se style hunter vision next to
watermelon
they're basically exactly the same love
that one basically will that one for
about two months on end this one at
butter LONDON cakehole less amazing name
looks incredible on the toes it's like
highlighter pink but in a very nice way
yeah and then SC Fiji oh that is not a
pic is pink it's slightly pink it is
like the ultimate the abbeys vote I know
who thinks this is pink that's like nude
white but it's like a baby
yeah it's very very baby baby baby baby
it's like newborn pink but it's like a
biatch to apply but I just love it I
think he was joking yes it's horrible -
goodbye love the color that you've
really sold it to me - is asked you get
the opportunity to design the next
must-have beauty device what would you
create can you let me go first because
you always think of something really
good I think it's like oh yeah I tried
so hard last I was like I've really want
because I gonna ask my mom and then Lily
weighs comes up like Spacey you made a
mood board I thought of this I could we
think of anything aside from something
that you put your hair in and then it
automatically twist it around a person
in a pineapple
and they let you just put back why don't
you kiss bad round if you summit I kind
of mess it why does the hair I did you
know it's like thick holders that hold
your shaver and they like stick onto the
back of your shirt yeah baby like that
but giant so it's sticker like a shower
and it would be like to be kind of my
hands and it would just watch you have
you so it's like salad tongs but it goes
because she can't be asked to I hate
what something and it would be really
nice message would be like I'd they're
just so it sticks on the back of your
shower and it would be great you could
do you could like shave your own for you
and then it would be like that advert
with eight that they hug it hugs you the
tea you use like oh yeah but for your
head that was my genius idea we come up
with the name it wasn't a pill a
previous hot cake where she asked what
is your oldest and most loved Beatty
item I think I misinterpreted this
question I was like licking and cuz
makeup just goes off yeah quite quickly
I couldn't think of anything that I've
had for a really really long time I've
had my friend years so grossly I I think
the only thing that I could think of was
my tweezer min tweezers but I've had
four I've got them here actually just in
case we need a visual I eat I think I've
had these you know the travel sized ones
they're cheaper than the full sized ones
in exactly the same thing um I think
I've had these for around three or four
years and they're amazing but gone you
get your 11 e mind the perfume own light
blue is the ng light blue I bought this
on a school trip when I was fifteen I
bought this um when I went on a trip to
Italy my school when I was 15 someone
was wearing in ask them what it was and
they said this and I went and bought it
as my first proper perfume purchase any
Bello it's not like celery who it does
smells like that Jonjo Shelvey
memories bear that was a good school
trip yellow it's kind of keep you don't
find you and they don't actually wear it
so it's not my most loved but it's
definitely my oldest okay gents II asked
what's your current most played song in
your play
while getting ready hmm when I get ready
I get ready to YouTube videos yeah it's
not really songs I'm like a YouTube go
on I just stick on you but if you had to
I had to you know what I downloaded off
do to Malta no let the rhythm take you
over
oh there's something much like a de
that's so wrong mine is probably the new
Ed Sheeran album X I'm obsessed are
there and especially the song of fire
love I also watch YouTube videos I'm
getting ready but if I was listening to
songs at the moment it's ed Sheeran look
you come with cool Kate see us what
products have you most recommended to
family and friends I love this question
mine was like I've mentioned already
tweezerman tweezers I think I've got a
lot of people on these including my mom
my sister my best friends now Lauren
loved them they're just fabulous than
the best I think the most common
question I get is I do any wear any
makeup I feel like it should put a bit
of like foundation on right any light
foundation so I always end up saying
Laura Mercier oh three things
moisturizer and maybe always love it
because it's kind of like a really
really light foundation it's really easy
you can use your hands so if you're not
that into makeup which I love my friends
aren't you will love this I finally make
dipti candles as well because you like
burning a candle and then people come
around and they're like oh was that I
say oh that's a good one yeah so that's
