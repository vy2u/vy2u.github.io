chat video here's Anna hello how would I
do it without her have to be here now
you're here in my background
hey I'm in like the mint green walls
this hasn't happened yet
nothing writing so we've picked five
questions for this video we did for last
time we've got five today and we went
through the last video and just picked
some of our favorites so should we get
started yeah what was the first one
first one is what are your favorite lip
colors for fall or autumn I think we
both picked quite similar ones here I
haven't seen yours yet
you go first I can like I've seen lilies
out the corner of my eye my favorite is
this one it's probably a bit of a
shocker Mac rebel nice really really
like this one because it can be really
like built up on the list quite a bold
like serious purpley kind of plummy
shade but I've got it on today and I
just put it on my finger and like dab it
in do you yeah it's my seventh day of
that one it's Leslie just like a bit of
a wash of color for like every day I
probably wouldn't wear this fully on the
lips but I just liked a little bit and
actually there's a new Rimmel shade that
is basically a dupe for this so really I
think it's good something plumb Fulham
from the waist should be new line and
it's really nice and basically looks
exactly the same
nice go my do you have one that's it
yeah I think good i picked one kind of
nude and one more autumn color the fact
the nude one is the Rimmel moisture we
knew from them they've been reformulated
them and added 10 new or J's
this is 705 let's get naked and I'm
wearing this today a cheeky and it's
just like a really nice nude bit
slightly peachy I like that yeah that's
what I like peachy lip colors so I like
this one it works and it's they're
really moisturizing and easy to wear and
very affordable so that's good am I more
like autumn e1 is one of the Clinique
chubby sticks intense and this is
grandis grape have you tried this one
now we tried that one but is it
Mightiest nourishing yeah you're gonna
be on last year this one is like a
really nice like plumbing all quite
similar to like yeah everything is like
Mac rebel yeah it's actually just like
later yeah these are just really easy to
wearing this circumvented you just might
leave one swipe next question is what
are your Holy Grail foundations
concealer and powders hello obvious
choices from me again I'm just gonna get
out of the way no one is judging our
money you know so far nation let's just
yeah okay I really like you miss one at
the moment I kind of added this in as
like an addition what it wants for there
yeah it's really nice try it it's the
boys are happy light foundation and it's
just really nice I really like it it's
quite it's more matte than ones that I
usually go for but it's still got like a
nice bit of Sheen in it and the shades
50 porcelain is basically like my exact
it's just such a good counter such a
nice color such a good color it's just
such a good color match to me so and
actually there are nice combination
together oh really
so there you go I've been liking that
and then over here is creamy concealer
by Bobbi Brown just always go back to
this one I've really been liking the
Tarte marriage Shuker 12-hour new the
one I got in New York is really nice but
this one is just ultimate and I always
go back to it and their powder I didn't
actually bring one I'm not a big powder
love but I've really been liking at the
body shop so I think it's called the
all-in-one powder which is really nice
and it doesn't like ever cake up you can
really go a bit crazy with that if I'm
filming sometimes I go like a bit woo
heavy with that but food powder not me
of how to go my foundation I didn't
really know what to pick but chanel
vitally macro is the only foundation of
every purchased so I'm guessing that
means it's Holy Grail and but I like
quite a few foundations but I really
really like this one I've talked about
before easy to use if your hands nice
and natural and just nice and compact
for light traffic and get the traveling
that sits perfectly in a makeup bag I
love the packaging my concealer is like
a combination of the Bobbi Brown
corrector I didn't love the concealer
because it creases on me the Bobbi Brown
concealer but the correct is really good
for dark circles because like a peachy
pink color and the NARS creamy and
radiant creamy
yeah I always think of the name I love
this it's so good oh good I literally
can't live without any more I always
have like a backup in case because they
sell out but I really like this really
nice I agree with you yeah and then
powder similar thing I don't really use
powder I use the hourglass ambient
lighting powders a lot oh yeah that's a
good one at that too - exactly
but if I'm going on a night out or I'm
having like a shiny day and I really
need a setting powder the ones I like
are from soap &amp;amp; Glory and I can pick
between the one heck of a blot and the
kick-ass one okay yeah sounds so lemme
say my kick off kick a kick off it's not
really the thing the one heck of a block
one is very much a translucent standard
setting powder right and the kick kick
ass yeah it's like a bit more yellowy
yeah this is really weird I'll try it
this morning to try and like figure out
a describe it try it I can't explain it
like disappears with me weird isn't it
Tigers like leathery and I really know
how to describe it it's like it's not
even there
but it's yes it's a lot softer I'm very
very choice these translucent but
they're both seven glory make out what
they like so there's a good setting
powder is going to add those thank you
the next question is what can you do to
stop makeup disappearing on a hot day or
a night out as I'd have tea tips for
this one you have about six number one
is to like use light layers like I think
sometimes you go a bit crazy because you
like got to stay on and you like layer
of what powders and this and that I
think it's good to keep like light thin
layers on the face and things like if
you know there's eyeliner that's gonna
smudge really badly like if you ever
tried Mac feline eyeliner no I end up
with it like all around my face I liquid
looking like a raccoon so I would never
wear that on a hot day anyway and then
my second tip would be primers yeah is
that what you were gonna go for us yeah
primers the main tip maybe like a primer
and there's loads of different types of
primers you kind of just to figure out
which one works best for you and there's
like kind of ones that feel like a bit
watery there's silicone base and this
one's a bit both I've actually got a few
here show just what could you do it like
because there's like these like my
favorites and I think like
Laura Mercier foundation primers like my
favorites it's just really really nice
but our glass veil is a mini travel
sized one I didn't know how to describe
this stuff it's like this wing is
doesn't have to look him in it it kind
of feels like it like very soft but yeah
like definitely is they should make it
slip to it when you put it on but it's
like a veil literally feels like the elf
a all over your face I really like I
don't think you got on with sleek super
primer they've got like a new range of
primaries as one for correcting there's
one for sallowness all these things that
the word yes I did weirdo yes right and
but I really like just the super primer
this is like a mix between like a
water-based or a nano silica and one it
kind of feels like a in between so
primers good Oh actually the quick
mention to this one this one about
beauty the sparkle trio from Laura
Geller this one's cool and it comes with
an eye an elite private on the lid and
then a first of a primer genius yeah
love that one
so primers all the way I will say that
like a good setting spray Urban Decay do
quite a few different ones but like
they're all night to one yes but it here
yeah all nighter one video this one yeah
there's loads of long and like an eye
primer as well yes master box one it's
the eye a big fan of the NARS
the chosen one to proof.proof Rome or
something this is the best one like
Urban Decay primer potion has nothing
but my own I've got like the tiniest
amount left because I've used it so much
but in film I always find an eye primer
some brands to you and they're really
thick it's almost like putting on a
cream eyeshadow or putting on your
eyeshadow but with that it's just so
thin lenses so nicely
definitely gonna pick up the full size
of this yeah it's all been on my
shopping list for a long time so ever
need to get around to it and then like
you're saying with the layers I find
using cream base products it's gonna be
different when you in your skin but
wearing cream Brita products for me last
best so cream eyeshadow cream blushes
kind of layered on top just makes it
last better I like this one as well this
book spoke to finish hydrating under eye
primer amazing like these three are
basically like if you put these on your
makeup is just gonna
nice right there yeah I'm just gonna say
in this month's Elle magazine at least
the Eldridge has a whole page in primers
amazing and it's really really helpful I
learned a lot from that page yeah I've
seen that one yeah okay the next
question is I really don't understand
I'm just reading it from down here I
really understand skincare at all could
you explain how you began looking after
your skin and give a basic skincare for
beginners but as an intense question
there was so many questions you're
asking Claire I think that was maybe the
most thumbs up one yeah last few to chat
when we did there was just so many not
know where to start with this one gone I
think if I were to really get risking
head down like oh gosh okay if I was to
start again say I'm like 18 years old 16
to 18 just getting into like proper skin
care what I did the first thing I kind
of invested in it was the lizard cleanse
and polish and I think everybody kind of
does I did the same it's just a really
easy basic like hot-cross cleanser which
means it's like a creamy cleanser you're
really struggling to get hot cleanser
you just pump it all over your skin like
a little bit of water it's really nice
and creamy and then you just use a
muslin cloth that comes with it under
kind of warm water and take off and it's
as simple as that and I think cleansing
your skin is the most important step
it's a bit revolutionary as well when
you do it for the first time you're like
oh my god faces go in your face was so
clean that's actually one of the first
things I bought as well I went to the
liselle counter and bought their starter
set yeah they go my student Penny's I
just went and bought the starter set
that's a really good place to start yeah
that's got like your cleanser your toner
and moisturizer brunette if you're kind
of doing those three steps yeah you know
that's a very good is that amazing for
me like a good cleanser and a good
moisturizer I used to use and really
moisturize a lot on oil aids imaging and
boots I think they're probably not like
the best now but it's just a good basic
it's a nice one and I really like
origins as well yes I did might have my
little face and then I think had
minorities and I kind of went in and
bought quite a lot of orange and stuff
and that just was amazing and then
moisturizers so nice they're ginseng one
so
item in this one is a really good night
one they do good channel stuff and then
from that you can always add like eye
creams in and then SPF is a good thing
to throw on yeah like every day if you
get a moisturizer with SPF you month is
that okay next question is sometimes
when buying a high-end foundation I
can't get the exact shade I always get
matched to a darker shade should i opted
for a lighter shade in that case I can't
buy both it's too expensive in brackets
so hard did you put that in brackets I
think I put that there's kind of two
topics a touched on I think in this like
yet how to find the right shade of
foundation and how to kind of buy
foundation and make sure you go home
with the right one yeah I could probably
do it like this I need to take my own
advice on this because I always there's
like a lighter in a dark when I was like
I'll get the dark one and then I get
home and I'm like oh my word I would say
in my kind of odds to first buy the
question go for the lighter one this is
always easier to kind of runs up with
like a bit of bronzer with contour or by
like these two a really good the judging
on my using the silk and the boy shot
happy light by maybe she can't get like
an exact shade get your closest one in
the high-end one and then you can always
buy a drugstore one it's the two and you
have the perfect color and a nice
combination and that's a good tip
actually I did a blog post on this so if
I can find that I'll link it below I
think you did yeah everything is I
always have such the pain with Bryan
Foundation's I get really like stressed
upset about it because people always
match me to darker shades because I've
got dark hair but doll my brows so they
just think like all you've done really
dog skin I'm actually got really kind of
pale skin so I have to kind of take it
in my hands and look at all what they're
saying so I always go to the counter
whenever I'm trying foundation I always
try they like from my face down to my
neck and then I go outside of the
shopping department to look in real
light but I don't really buy foundations
without trying them first
getting sample and I yeah and I just
think you can get a sample it can be
done by your in your pot yeah look I
have one here you can get these from
boots they're like little pots and I
think as long as you don't like March up
to the counter and be like can I have a
sample I think that you're out the right
way yeah this is the side of right okay
so don't you've ever sent me yeah cancer
alright look at the bit
so I'm browsing trying stuff on like a
normal shopping person right and then
when Isis comes up to me to say do you
need any help I'm say oh I'm just
looking I'm really interested in trying
this but I knew I really want to try it
like at home and my own environment with
my own brushes and my hands and stuff is
it any chance I could just have one pump
in this little pot no one's gonna say no
and I unless they like there does not
one pump is not gonna help them as long
as you're polite and nice and go around
it the right way and I always say like
if I like it I'll come back to this
counter to buy it yeah um that is the
way that's the way to do it with some
brands that if you shop behind they send
you like a song pull of the shade up and
shade dance you try this rubbery does
that yeah that's really good idea and
maybe Bobby Brown or need to do that
that's why yeah I think that's a really
good tip and so many places like when I
got my show my good little man again
Giorgio Armani luminous silk they
actually gave me a swamp full of it
first and they said try this on boy I
bought the big bottle but if they try
the sample before you try the big bottle
and then you can always come back and
swap your big bottle for another color
so they're always kind of willing to
help or at least worst-case scenario to
give you a makeover a definitely come
yeah if you do that if you try it on
counter make sure you try it in areas
you know foundations that it with me if
I don't like a foundation it goes funny
around my nose you know I always try it
by my nose try it here and go outside
walk around for a couple of hours and
keep looking in the mirror to see what
yeah and come back don't let them like
push you into buying it because it's an
investment and it's annoying if you go
home and you you don't like it I just
get so annoyed yeah such a waste of
money
yeah that's quite a lot of tips there
hopefully that was your question yeah so
that's all the five questions there
really hope you enjoyed it thanks for
asking all the questions and keep me
