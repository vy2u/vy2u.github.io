we're gonna filming a beachy chat video
and the ones I normally do at home today
we have a special guest and media so
yeah we're gonna do picture video we've
got five questions I think so
let's get started the first one is what
is your favorite non greasy hand cream
for winter should we go from that side
oh I just showed my mine is like a glory
hound food it's just like a good classic
cheap and cheerful and I might have fact
they all come in different sizes and
they smell good I've never tried that
alright it smells incredible I think
this is just really good stuff
I feel greasy yeah my favorites if the
kids ultimate strength hand soap and I
love this I like the really travel sized
one as well for my handbag but it's
completely non greasy kind of feel it's
unscented so it's good for like
sensitive skin and I love ever got two
tubes of this stuff my favorite is this
ESOP one I always picked that one ideal
and if also for the packaging yeah yeah
it's really cool the metal tube and it
smells really nice it smells kind of
like zesty and orange really nicely
really citrusy not greasy 6 and really
easily does the job really really nicely
so the next question is how would you
wear a dark lip in the daytime I like
this I like this question well we kind
of are merely kind of have a bit of a
like like a stern a doclet yeah I've got
a very dog lip on today and it is
daytime and I've got the NARS Velvet
Matte lip pencil in Cruella and my top
tip would be keep everything else really
simple yeah I've just got like a tiny
bit of mal shadow on and loads of
mascara and also something map I think
is also more daytime appropriate I think
a big glossy old Lynn come in sometimes
like a bit like this for daytime yeah
one of my tips would also be it's the
same to keep your eye makeup quite
simple curl your lashes
yeah I also think if you locked down
your lipstick it makes it a bit less
like in-your-face so I put a lipstick on
and then these tissues go like that
and the kind of up I'm at the sheer
plummy shades for dark lip like Mac plum
full is a really good dark shade but
it's kind of quite easy to read under
hands
my tip would be to add a bit of blush I
think sometimes in the day when you wear
a lip you kind of look a bit washed out
I don't mean out yes so just a little
blush this is just one from Wet n Wild
something that quite pinky to make you
look a bit more alive okay the next
question is how to hold a curl in your
hair and this one I'm pass it
strengthens dance because I don't know I
think I mean I like her color saying but
they're yours do be you've probably good
hair it should it holds a curl better
when it was longer I had like no I wash
my hands morning Oh mokey just say
though hairspray and this one is bad
living proof that has a really nice foot
in mass so it was very like NARS like
and this stuff is really good it's not
crispy at all okay takes away okay so
basically what I do when I'm curling my
hair if I make sure that like you
brushed your hair out first so there are
no kind of knots or tangles in it then
if you were using like a wand or a
straightener make sure that your hair is
kind of flat around the barrel if that
makes sense if your hair's like piled on
top of each other then the heat isn't
going to all of the hair so it's not
gonna heat up the whole head and you
want to make sure that like whilst your
hair is cooling down that it's in the
position you want it to be in for the
rest of the day so I'll kind of if I
can't my hair like that I'll then pin it
in that position as it cools down and
then once my hair is cool I'll take out
in that way it will hold and then before
and after I spray it with hairspray said
before I put on my towel whatever I'll
spray it with hairspray Tong it just
quite like like hairspray
Tong it and then spray it again to hold
and then pin told you
your favorite party festive nail
polishes I've massively in to my carpet
mother currently no more it's what I've
got my nails right now and I've got red
carpet-ready
bowie knives in the ready I did my thing
this one is great because it kind of
lasts so long you know when it's part of
time you like down must got to pay my
nails and then come back because this
stuff lychee stays on for like well over
a week and then I like I own runway
which is like this you know regional
type shade and the glitter I picked up
this one I think this was last year's SC
Christmas collection called leading lady
in Burgundy which I love with pink and
red sparkle I'm not if absolutely
favorite no later it's me I picked UFC's
mine because my favorite nail brand and
during Christmas festive period I just
have to go for glitter I always sit down
and trying hit my nail something really
nice a chic and ends up just glittery
mess as love glitter so I picked two
this one is beyond cozy it's like a
silvery glitter in this one's toggle to
the top which is pretty much exactly
like yours a bit bit of really maybes a
bit darker very yeah really similar yes
nice burgundy cursor and I'd love to use
it
I knew you guys have both got to choose
that I'm gonna be really different into
something totally different and this is
the Sephora formula X in love chemistry
and it's like a gold silver pinky like
I'm not even a glitter person but this
was just too pretty to not love and then
I also have one of my favorites which I
turn you guys on yeah for our one second
gel nail polish because the brush
applies like in seconds it dries in like
not even a minute like less than a
minute and this is just a really nice
party red shade this is nonetheless the
next question is what are your winter
beauty essentials okay
where shall I start I think a really
nice dewy looking fresh foundation it is
very important the winter coz I find
winter whitish is not very flattering if
it a little bit flat so she now wants to
be me
of mine like my major about driving
garden night leaving anyway by dragon
girl but then when we went to say say
okay by the last week names like you do
not need to buy how can there be any red
load of this one dance that's a really
much is so good that they are really
good so they can vote lit and then to
skincare things which I think are good
for like having a bit of like freshening
up your skin a reco is that I'm saying
it a media is a huge but this stuff is
great if transcend marine radiance
theorem which is a really nice theorems
got a bit of it's got sheer to it so I'm
going that were in the morning and then
the NV organic skincare pure a hobo oil
which is good for like moisturizing
throwing your hair putting in the bath
taking off this stuff is really good for
that so it's quite a nice for nourishing
everything that's a good little random I
just picked a couple of skincare things
because I knew these girls at bring some
other in the wind so I just love piling
on the oils that my skin gets really dry
so the two things I've been loving in
the moment at both from Sarah Chapman
one is her cleansing balm which I really
like in compared to the Emma Hardy when
I find a bit more oily which is where I
like to use in the winter and the
overnight facial which is just an
overnight oil and love this it's just so
really nice during the setup and loves
it and also a lip balm is an essential
and my favorite one is not very
glamorous but it's like what's it called
SIMEX lip protector which you can get
from boots and this is just amazing it
always helps if I have really dry lips
so you tell me on to that one it's okay
mine first of all I'm really lazy
moisturizer person like
Vanessa literally never moisturize but
I've been talking about this recently
and this is like the vasty brain goes
there that's it you're like done and
moisturize you hardly need to rob it's
really nice well that's not too sweet
it's not nice to be in chocolate in that
calm as I find just like whoa this is
quite light and nice and it stinks in
really easily however I was like
moisturizing for lazy then I have a
moisturizer this is the one I'm using at
the moment and this is the LA
roche-posay one it's just so good it's
do it's like white creamy honoring yeah
and if your skin is like dry you know
and you've got that kind of dry winter
skin it's like sleek and then it just
like saw this just completely sorts out
it's so so good and it's really not
expensive at all then my last skin care
thing is an eye cream and I've just
bought a couple here but I find that my
concealer and the winter-like creases
yeah and it settles into the lines and
it's like really horrible mainly because
my under eyes are so so dry so
definitely an eye cream I know you love
this one like that one by one and also
an esop one which is more Barbie which I
really like and then okay I'm gonna run
through this luminous elevation board a
happy light this is kind of I haven't
tried aqua this is just like a really
nice lumen it's like luminous but not
greasy
yeah ECU just gives you like a my phone
below and then a lip balm with like a
bit of color to it so this is the Korres
of cause one and it has myself pink and
then it has a little more applicator
huge yeah
other questions that you guys ask but
currently on my blog this week I'm doing
mascara week so I thought to throw a
little bonus question and ask these
lovely ladies what their all-time
favorite mascara is I'll show you mine
lily has told me off because I bought
two and tiny though that's not allowed
yeah but kind of all time favorite would
obviously be L'Oreal has got waterproof
mascara but they dont sell it anymore
and it just upsets me way too much yeah
but the Max Factor false lash effect
waterproof one is good enough
alternative but recently it's quite new
purchase where where's our first sale
yeah the waterproof one of that feeling
it yes gettin a long way Thomas comments
that they've dry out so quick I'd like
to join this card if you bought that I'd
like mine is the Max Factor false lash
effect fusion mascara volume and length
I know all the Max Factor was gone okay
always haven't they have a nice big fat
one with like really short bristles so
you can just kind of wiggle it at the
root bit of length bit of volume no
clump is it what you've got on today yes
Amelia's eyelashes it looking melodia
they're from above and I was like whoa
my favorite is the tiny high impact
extreme volume which is just the best
and it's different I'm used to like the
fiber brushes this is again a sticky why
everyone and it really grips the lashes
it's really quick and easy to use so if
