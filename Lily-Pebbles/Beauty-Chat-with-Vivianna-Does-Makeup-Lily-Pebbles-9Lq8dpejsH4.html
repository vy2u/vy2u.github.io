chat video with me and Anna hi guys
welcome back to another beauty chat
video with me and Anna we recently went
to Paris and while you are there we met
loads of you guys so we thought we'd ask
some questions our little Meetup so we
have a mix of questions from Paris and
questions from Twitter it's very
exciting mix them up a little bit do you
base your beauty purchases on blogger
recommendations or aesthetically
pleasing packaging I feel like it's a
bit of both
yeah is I do love some good packaging by
always read blogs and you watch YouTube
reviews or for buying beauty definitely
but I feel like I'm a bit of a magpie
yeah like if I see something it's was
shiny and it's all pretty and maybe it
comes in a really fancy box then
sometimes I just I just can't help
myself
the Charlotte Tilbury like the lipsticks
amazing I think just a good old Paniccia
color I knew you were gonna say that
when we were away me and Lily had that
every single day except Lily he doesn't
mean like breakfast so she kind of has
like half a bunny she says I'm done when
I have two or three like aunt Lily's
leftovers divisions are so girly like in
France they're like faux fur they're the
best yeah I have to say like the ones
here don't compare when I got a French
one but I do also like apple turnovers
it's like puff pastry with apple sauce
through middle and then like over the
top and they're really nice sugary layer
I have never tried it and then sometimes
they do them with cream in the middle
opinion they do miss finish they're like
twiddly oh it's like a really good
really big donut in a plaque like a
Great British Bake Off so I already
laughing and they were incredible and I
think that's a word that I really needed
to learn in French I don't know I can't
one of those right oh yeah
what's the one item of makeup you
dislike putting on the most easy
eyeliner every time I feel like I can't
breathe
put it on I'm like hmm what I hold my
breath going red in the face and with
passed out every time I think mine's
lipstick because I don't really like the
shape of my lips I haven't really got a
dip at Cupid's bow so it's always a real
hassle and that's why I didn't really
reapply lipstick throughout the day I
couldn't bothered okay I normally do my
full face of makeup in the morning and
I'm like I'll just leave lips they don't
need it all right I see you saying that
the Clarins instant like that's for the
effect isn't like easy Daniel uh stirred
what languages can you speak
you go first okay I have GCSEs in
Italian and French obviously English and
I got good grades in them but now that
was a very long time ago that was about
eight yes and so now I I kind of
struggle when I can vaguely understand
things in a very pigeon kind of fashion
like I really I'm not very good I can do
like Hello
I don't even know where's the toilet I
started studying Italian at GCC and I
loved it but I quit because me my
teacher really didn't know terrible I
had to say posso and dado and a bunion
but the border it's not where is the
toilet
yeah you retard e-tag can't we learn
sorry I'm late learning Italian I guess
they're like mad be worth like the
pledge yeah so I was in the GCC French
but I went to France a lot when I was
young this so I feel like when I'm there
so she the South of France I can kind of
get by but it's not very good like any
good French she was like you really good
Rose I'll just be nursing
yeah I'll have what she's um a man about
when you're going you go on holiday with
you really can't speak French I do I can
pretend to be good at friends when they
actually
name over Anna this tiny same without
mushrooms that's what she needs to know
basically it's not something you're I
can also speak have a girl can anyone
comment tell me if they know I'll have a
go this because Anna I want to learn how
to go so bad luck is like a made-up
language I don't was just a UK thing
where people girls I think girls do
because school it's like it's something
to do with like syllables I don't tell
me to say something and I'll say okay
like be chat for my favorite videos film
be forgiving each other guts of a
godmother FF game of a good self good
very good DVD you ever go super goof of
a Gilman Anna would be Abigail never go
Lily would be living in living he taught
me like the alphabet hopping up and what
they're like that I like got it and we
used to spend the whole time holiday
like I genuinely really loved it next
time we've got some pretty time yeah my
mom Spears is that I can't when I was
younger kid nasty conversation from I'll
be like I learned that when I was 16 to
do you apply concealer before or after
foundation always but I did go through
stage I hit myself in the face I do I
did use this stage on try it before and
I think it's sometimes if I want to mix
up a bit you can do if you like a thick
concealer then I'd do it first
isn't it the Kim Kardashian way to do it
before and then puts that foundation on
over the top and then does an awesome
thing is when you do it first always
finally you have to go back to consider
crashing I find that when you do it
first you have to get back to the
concealer yeah all that foundation
blending kind of rubs it off I did I
just go for the after yeah is easy if
you had to switch your wardrober for
nobody
no we can't let you try that's on your
penis obviously we're just each other
who you'll see Claire Marshall because
because I think is a really cool like
Bach tip rock chick chick vibe and that
style I really like I think mine's a
little bit of mix brought chicken I kind
of more classic but I really like the
way she dressed mine would have to be
Ealing cling from style biplane Jesus
Amida SH fashion blogger she is so cool
she just got that Scandinavian she thing
then she was like lots of denim and
monochrome and you know I'm just like
maybe she's a broker I did it I think
say sorry baby fan just text me what is
your ultimate favorite serum mine is
Sarah Chapman intense hydrating booster
is the one I'm using at the moment and
it's very lovely and hydrating and nice
have you gone through multiple ones no
whoa I've done what a whole bottle
amazing I'm on my second my one would
also be that and the other one that's
that wonderful finger which is the
overnight exfoliating booster it's like
a serum mixed with the formula of like
an exfoliating so you know I think my
skin feels so soft in the morning after
I uses it's a very gentle way of
exfoliating it just like brides are on
all night liquid silky and then in the
morning you're like using the evening
then yeah this is an evening one so this
is a morning one there you go hi my
question is
since when you know annum in Ludhiana
and since when do you know each other
and how have you been friends so this is
a question we get asked a lot I'm sure
we have answered it people think that my
cousin's oh but we're just really good
friends yeah we met to work this out
recently wonderfully I think it was like
our two year anniversary quite recently
we met at a beauty launch I think we'd
both been reading each other's blogs
already we did the same thing and we met
at a little beauty event and that's the
story so yeah we're just friends and
we've done yeah we just clicked is
they're really glad to that story I feel
like people want more of an interesting
story that's making it and then Anna
went into a building and it went on fire
so I like found a dog I mean the dog
like Ron says and saved Anna furnace
house of burning down our throat well
there we've been friends ever since
what is the perfect autumn/winter
perfume to splurge on go on I'm excited
to hear what yours I'll get it they
essentially molecule molecule one
there's I mean a splurge II you can get
like 20 27 3 + 27
that always reminds me really you always
wear that and I'm like I do love it
especially in autumn but I went for of
course a piggy smell and this is the
German language faking cassis which is
my favorite I have the big one this is
my travel once I never finished I just I
mean I loved it peak philosophers by
prefer this one I was gonna say you
memorize it the Nauticus it's just got a
different it's more like cozy yeah it's
kind of a bit more wintery on saying
yeah love it mmm I'm gonna go frigid eek
I'm not picked up the wrong one sorry
volutes hmm it's quite heavy it's quite
full on it's like a smoky or um double
if you like but it's one of those ones
that I can handle and I get quite
headachy with fragrances that this one I
can like just about
away with it's quite evening ye sexy it
was not very different on my skin it's
very different one normally go for but
in terms of like a wintry phrase like
another thing and but I call it some I
mean I'm so picky with both ends all
right I think that is all the questions
in this yeah one two three four five six
seven eight nine wish we had one for
luck we haven't got ten you know means
you ten let's make up our own question
well I'm gonna I'm gonna make up a
question for you and you make up a
question for me okay are you ready get
it like thank you
no no what is your ultimate what would
your ultimate smoothie be milkshake /
food you know my favorite milkshake is
from placeable shake away and it's a
sherbet fountain you know like they show
the fountains are the licorice in the
top yeah I don't either
no I never eat the licorice though is
they don't you connect with you and but
they put in the fizzy like sherbert into
milkshake and it's like slightly fizzy
milkshake well I try that it's a crisis
islands I think there's like shake aways
kind of all over the shop but there is
one criterion no but it's so worth
queuing up for there's always a cute
buddy Brian one but it is so it's like
slightly busy milk mmm okay hey I'm
gonna put like this okay okay this this
would be quite hard for Lily

mill like if you had final meal yeah so

dinner or breakfast or lunch to have
like what would if you had to have that
beside the main and dessert which is one
do you know like one dish in the rest of
your life what would it be
spaghetti something I think this
spaghetti with too much I don't know

polonaise or like an arrabiata yeah type
