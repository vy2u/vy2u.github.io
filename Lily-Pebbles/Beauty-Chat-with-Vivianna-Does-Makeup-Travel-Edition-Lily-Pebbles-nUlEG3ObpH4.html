beauty chat video I'm here with Anna Lou
and we're actually in the hotel room
today very snazzy but we thought we'd do
a theme for this one and we decided on
travel I think someone suggested that
maybe you're I don't like a lot of
people suggest you know that you wanted
it so we're gonna give it to you exactly
and we asked on Twitter for questions so
I've got them all here should we get
started see there okay Abby asked do you
have any products that help keep you
relaxed or calm on a flight I feel like
me Lilia kind of good people for this
question because neither of us we're not
like the worst fliers but we're also not
the most confident the fliers yeah I
know I'm not like outwardly I don't like
freaked out and scream but inside I'm
like dying of fear but wait somebody's
like it's gonna be okay
I like to have just nice like smelly
things around me it just reminds me of
being in a spa and being relaxed and
rich is cool me and I know just filming
no he's gonna walk in yeah so I'd like
to have nice funny things around me so
it reminds me of been in a spa being
relaxed the this works deep sleep stress
less I would pop up
we both literally like anything
sometimes I just like stick out my not
zero just like get up there I'm a lone
wolf I like to have like warm socks and
hand creams and purr for you yeah I'm
really annoying sitting still applies I
feel like you are gonna bring these so I
bought them noise canceling headphones
there are revelation they look
ridiculous like I'll get them for you
like this question before was I'm really
showing them know like the the engine
noise can sometimes be the thing that
like makes you feel bit now this case
you're like wow they're going really
effing box come on over there but I was
gonna say if you don't want the ones
like that because if you're sleeping
it's kind of quite annoying I have those
ones ago anyways that
holy very good okay Georgie asks what is
one travel essential you couldn't live
without I've taken the practice luigi
worldwide travel adapt basically
comforts to everything we're a UK and
why it is every time we go away together
Lily forget every time it's the one
thing I always forget it I'm going take
my travel essential MacBook Air and this
little integral thing that I got from
Amazon because the MacBook Airs don't
have memory card slots on them so I goes
into the USB and then you put your
memory card in there and this little
thing riches here now watching us so
yeah this little thing I love it can't
be without it was really cheap what was
it again I forgot what it was oh the
memory card yeah Perry says do you limit
yourself to how many lipsticks you're
allowed to bring on a trip or do you end
up with like 10 plus I feel like I do I
feel like I'm quite streamlined when it
comes to packing I would say I allowed
myself on average three I'm sorry I told
how to bring props and you've done some
yeah I did helium a bitch like please
hearing props I was like wow that guy's
organized I thought I would like pretend
we're going away three lip balm
obviously you have to have that and then
like a nude and then like a color II won
the nude I love this one the Chanel
reach cocoa in sensible sensible so see
since Eve such a silly name when you say
yeah maybe Harrison and then the NARS
satin lip pencil in you I'll see you
like bright color yeah so normally I am
NOT just wearing lip balm anyway it's
good to have options
yeah I like to take like an everyday
pink matte red I sure let me just say
those too like an everyday yeah and red
going out shade I try to at the end
always are not like throwing anything
yeah what if I want to wear blue I think
I think his name isn't I so I can't read
it I think it's in time how to not over
pack makeup so when I pack my makeup I
like to pretend I'm her
my makeup and I do it so I'm like
foundation concealer powder bronzer I
literally go through each step
no man that's what goes that's a really
good way of doing it or like packing it
a couple of days before and sort of just
doing your makeup with that makeup so
the other like a few days and then
you're like actually haven't use that
tool that can go or I miss I always end
up missing like eyelash curler yeah well
and that way you just you know what
you've missed and you know what you
don't need
yeah I always end up throwing in like
two concealers and then I do yes so
annoying okay Puri again asked what one
travel essential to you wish was made in
travel size this was a really hard
question
I kept thinking me of a droid
texturizing spray and I was like he does
company travel so I know which I know
what Shaun you're gonna say but you can
decant it I hate managing products
because then if you don't finish it it's
like wasteful Ostia renascence cleansing
gel yeah like a mini pop oh my god that
were you please do that
yeah please see that looks cute okay
that's better than white one what was
your I was gonna say just brushes in
general wait I share the bloody master
they are and then this one's another say
I know that Mac do the short handle ones
like a limited edition for Christmas but
I never the same they're never as good
so that in miniature you're getting
touched it you're on okay Sally asked
I'm traveling with her luggage only what
multitasking products would you
recommend so I can save on space
I'd recommend like color cream stick
type products I have this as an example
it wouldn't recommend this one
specifically is this from Chanel but if
you have like a brown one and a pink one
the brown one you can use for bronzer
you can use it for eyeshadow the pink
one you can use for blusher for lipstick
you can kind of just put them in
everywhere in anywhere that's very
practical yeah yeah I didn't think that
I kept thinking and I was like you know
what I would just get it all at the
airport
like with makeup I'm sorry I'm a
recommendation be here with makeup off
sleep at your makeup but for things like
toiletries has always boots at the
airport when you go through the little
security thing and you can pick up your
like deodorant and they were still keep
miniatures and toothpaste and your
shower toe if you're going away with
girlfriends me my friends do this we all
just sort of bought everything and then
shared it all whatsoever though and then
you can leave it there you probably
finish it while
I feel like proud of our tips their
tactical is in front of all tips Fran
about its grace us the most embarrassing
thing that happened to you well on
holiday
okay I would hear you on earth just like
SSK my little victimized if you bit like
no into that duplicate so much worse 13
12 year old Lily on the beach in France
with my family I know yeah and my uncle
gets up not realizing what he's about to
do to my life picks up at the top he put
his knee remember this and says whose
towels this and as he picked it up
opened it up it had period you period
that you when in use tampons I need to
size you towel you know inside times
they kind of move around in your bikini
and it was really bad
my mother's only like just week no I'm
sorry that I went away with my friends
the I enough were not showgirl when I
used to party you know this fun and we
went to this club one night and I was
very like an orange vests top with like
high-waisted black shorts because that
was all the fashion so it was always
like it wasn't a bad yeah it wasn't bad
fashion choice from an 18 year old but
when the night was finished I was little
I was just like a different color like
you knowing you sweated so much that
your top around Norwich yeah it was it's
like a dog grace like orangey brown
color because I just sweated like all
the way through I have my we got an
embarrassing picture of it some ways
let's see if I can send it Laura asked
if your luggage but stranded which item
which you most which item would you be
most upset to be without my
straighteners I don't know where they've
gone but oh my god I would go out and
I'd buy a new purse strings instantly
and we're going to LA in July I'm
considering buying like an American pair
just in case my UK like without
sweeteners I am getting this so much
that you're gonna have like an American
pair of yeah
I think but the big frizzy hair okay
mine yeah
mini little raise though yeah because
Hairy Maclary especially in your own
holiday I hate the after night shave
everyday but you do yeah well I do I
would have said that but I'm a changed
woman
my epilator I know your buddy you need
to give me a product recommendation
because I need to know I'm trying to new
okay okay Laura asked another question
if Mark and rich orange had to pack for
you
what would they pack needlessly in which
essentials would they forget
who's sitting right here okay I'm being
Richard pack lots of socks boys wear
lots of socks I could get us a periscope
so Mike a week probably wouldn't wear
them yeah more than about sucks and I
think he'd forget I think you forget
things like hair brush and hair clip
like without the clip I can't straighten
the under bit of my hair that clip very
important I reckon mark would forget to
pack comfies like you know you need
comfies you need just like some joking
buttons like a vest swap just when
you're like scratching around he oh wait
he always forgets to pack those always
and then he ends up like having to wear
my dad's comfies like that like two
sizes whatever we're going to visit my
parents like he would you know where
like he would do that for me as well
Cara asked dream holiday oh my god this
so many I feel like there's just so many
places that I still want to go to but I
feel like me and Mark really want to go
to Australia New Zealand that's all like
next big trip I reckon and I'd love to
do South Africa and Safari 101 for Lily
I guess how to keep curly frizzy hair
nice and hydrated during a beach holiday
but we can both talk about how we look
after a hair on a hot beach holiday um I
intend to just go with the flow these
days but I used to use a lot of oils and
creams on my hair when I was by the pool
because it would really dry out and Fito
or fight oh do some nice stuff for the
beach oh yeah they do like moisturizer
yeah I feel like I always get into that
thing about like pact hair oil and then
when I'm there I just end up just
wearing it when I'm on holiday I don't
want to do anything with my hair I just
want to wear a bun like all day
I wasn't quite like what chlorine does
to my hair because it kind of makes it
stay wet for love like looking wet for
longer and like a movement on frizzy
hair and then later like whether you're
on Labor Day
later all right yeah thanks okay so
those are all the questions that was a
fun one I'm good I reckon I've got a
theme for next time
shall I just like add it in now yeah
