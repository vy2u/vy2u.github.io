really well today I'm gonna be doing a
beauty dupes and drug store alternatives
video because I don't think I've
actually ever done one of these before
and the products have kind of been
piling up and I keeps thinking like well
that's kind of a dupe that's kind of a
cheap I was gonna see the blog posts on
all of them but then I thought I've
actually got enough to make a whole
video and more really so I'm gonna get
started I've got a whole kind of I keep
looking down so I've got this basket
full of products right in front of me so
I'm gonna lay them out to make easier
and then show you what I have found
because I've spent the last kind of
month or two trying to find as many
dupes as I can and trying not to talk
about the obvious ones are a few obvious
ones but things like honey chubby stick
and Revlon chubby stick or whatever
they're called I know you guys know
about those already so I've tried to
find kind of newer different ones to
talk about and I'm gonna get started
okay I'm gonna start with my most
exciting one and then if you guys
remember that Christmas Chanel released
the most beautiful limited edition
collection and in that was this
eyeshadow palette that I very naughtily
picked up and it's beautiful it has five
shades in it and it's really wearable
and I wear all the time I really like it
and that's from Chanel as I said and
recently when I was shopping in super
joy with Ana she actually popped this in
my basket and I was very grateful
because I really liked it from NYC and I
think it was something ridiculous like
$2.99 but I'm gonna pop all the prices
down below or on the screen so you guys
can compare but it looks like this oh
gosh
just like stabbed it there so this only
has four shades but as you can see
hopefully the colors are so similar
they're both brown neutral with a topi
kind of shade going on the only
difference is I think this one hasn't
got this middle shade the Chanel one
that which is the bronze glittery one
but speed honest that's the one I use
the least it's the two lighter colors
it's got a really good highlight a good
all over the lid light brown a darker
Brown and then a line of color and it's
so similar and you're probably thinking
yeah but Chanel ones probably a lot
better in quality but I actually think
the quality of this NYC palette is so
nice it's not chalky it all blends
really easily and I've been wearing this
a lot so I think that's a pretty good
deep there and this is just so cheap and
not only
that's really expensive but I don't
think you could actually get any more
because it was limited edition so still
on the subject of eyes everyone talks
about the Mac two one seven brush a lot
because it's pretty much the perfect
blending brush I have seriously about
five or six of these because I'm just
really lazy when it comes to washing my
brushes but this is so perfect for
packing on color and then blending it
out and a cheaper alternative would be
the zoeva brush this is the two-to-one
luxe soft crease and it's slightly more
domed it's not as kind of flat either
side but I'd really like this I feel
like you can pack on color quite well
and it's really good for blending it's
so soft washes really nicely I mean I
just spot watch this this morning and
normally that makes my brushes a little
bit dry but this is still really fluffy
and nice I think though ever brushes are
really great and affordable really good
dupes and although you can just get them
online which is good if you're
international it's a bit annoying if you
prefer shopping in stores like I do
but it's a really good deal just as good
as Matthew 1:7 if not better when it
comes to dupes I try to think of
alternatives and not so much copycats so
this one I don't encourage as much
because I don't love it when high street
brands like outright copy a high-end
brand but saying that not everyone can
afford the more expensive products so I
think it's only fair that cheaper ones
are on offer as well so last year dinner
if you'll remember but Illamasqua
released these nail polishes a comment
what they call them is they're like
speckle basically look like mini eggs
it's a color lots a little different
size black dots and they look like mini
eggs when you put them on their nails
and it's so cute but in a mask your nail
polishes are quite pricey and this year
models own have released their own
speckled egg collection and they pretty
much look exactly the same
I've tried them on my nails and I'd say
the inner mask oh one looks a little bit
more authentic because it's got more
different size and black dots they're
not as like black but they're pretty
much do exactly the same thing and they
look really cute especially for Easter
time and Mother's own has a line look
just like the illamasqua collection and
I think five other colors so that's a
really good one and lipstick I often
talk about is Tom Ford wild ginger it's
probably one of my most luxurious
lipsticks the packaging it's to die for
and then the color is one of those
vibrant orange Reds that I just think
so classy and beautiful I think
brunettes as well it's really suits
brunettes
so I was looking for a cheap alternative
and one that I really really like is
from Rimmel it's the one in the purple
packaging mine's covered in glitter nail
polish and this is in love with ginger
so while ginger in love with ginger
sensing a theme here the rumor one is
slightly brighter as this one but the
formula is really creamy and easy to
wear and really get the same effect the
only thing any of these dupes are
exactly the same but if you can't afford
the more expensive one or don't want to
splash out then the cheaper ones are
just as good really and so so similar so
if you want that kind of orangey red
lipstick I think this is a really good
cheap alternative as I'm sure you all
know Tanya burr released her lip gloss
and nail polish collection this year
alright so you love the lip glosses and
the nail polishes are just as good the
shade range is really nice three of my
favorites are little duck which is this
mint green penguin chick which is a kind
of nude taupe and I'm so blind and the
resin so small New York night which is a
kind of purply dark purple and I think
these three are actually perfect dupes
for three of my favorite nail polishes
so I'm going to show you which ones
which little duck which is the mint
green is pretty much an exact match to
nail zinc Haymarket a lot of people said
Essie mint candy apple but I think it's
a little bit brighter than mint candy
apple and it's just exactly the same as
nails in cane market which is what I
really really love all my nails and all
my toes it's the perfect spring/summer
color penguin chick which is completely
the most chic beautiful everyday color
is a really really great match for Marc
Jacobs and what was this called against
Delphine and I bought this when I was in
America at Sephora you can't get Marc
Jacobs in the UK so if you did want to
try this nail polish then the Tanya burr
one is really great alternative it's
ever so slightly lighter but seriously
it gives like the same effect and then
finally New York night is a really exact
dupe for Deborah Lippmann dark side of
the moon which is very expensive nail
polish really
beautiful dark chic purple really great
for parties I just think this is a
really smart color and they are exactly
the same okay now onto a
you fail this is one I wasn't gonna pop
him because I don't think it really kind
of worked out in the end but then I
thought I should actually tell you about
that so I was trying to find a jeep for
that this works deep sleep pillow spray
which is around 15 pounds so it's not
crazy expensive but for a pillow spray
it kind of is it's basically just like a
lavender caramel spray spray as your
pillow and it helps you fall asleep and
it smells so nice and I thought I'd
found a great do but got all excited
because I found this one in body shop
it's 10 pounds so it's only like 5
pounds cheaper it's not crazy different
but I thought if this is the same then
that's a really good joob and it's their
deep sleep dreamy pillow and body mist
I bought this the other day and I gave
this a test like two nights in a row I
put this on one pillow and this on the
other pillow but it's just not the same
I feel like with the this works you can
really smell the scent on your pillow
whereas with this one it smells nice
when you spray it but then it kind of
just sinks into the pillow and you can't
really smell anymore the only difference
is the body shop one is a body mist as
well as you can spray it on your skin
and that kind of helps you can smell a
nice aroma when you fall asleep so if
you are a fan of the body shop then it's
worth picking this up but if you were
going to choose between the two I'd say
splash out on five pounds more because
this one's really great so next is a
dupe that I think I've seen other people
talk about in similar videos but it's
just such a good one I couldn't not
mention it the Giorgio Armani eyes to
kill eyeshadows are really nice and I
see people talk about these that often
because they are quite expensive and
they come in little pots and then it
comes with a little presser and it's
basically a pressed pigment and these
sort of eyeshadows are really good
because you just have to touch your
brush so lightly and you get such strong
pigmentation and shimmer eyeshadow it
looks beautiful these are quite
expensive and a really great dupe that's
exactly the same if not better the
L'Oreal infallible eyeshadows and I have
the shades bronze
taupe and anvil rush which i think of
both shades from America but we have
some really good ones here in the UK as
well and the packaging is really similar
it comes with a little presser to press
style pigment and the pigmentation is so
good when I actually wore one of the
eyeshadows last week when I went to a
Charlotte Tilbury event that you would
have seen in my vlog and when the girls
trying to take my makeup off she was
like
I shudder you you Aaron it's like
impossible to get off they are really
long-lasting and they look so beautiful
and shimmery on the lid so that's my
doorbell okay and back from the doorbell
anyway as I was saying these are
beautiful and worth picking up next time
you are in boots or Superdrug so back to
lip products and why I sell are really
known for their beautiful lip products
and one of the most well-known are their
well I thought these were called glossy
stains but I think they've changed to a
Rouge pork sure or if they're different
products I'm sorry I'm not entirely sure
which one I have here because it doesn't
say anyway they're the ones that look
like this you can see the color on the
side and then they open up and they've
got this really good little flat
applicator and they apply really wet and
glossy but then they kind of set as a
stain so these are really great but they
are pricey it's why I sell it's a very
luxury brand and recently L'Oreal Paris
have released their Rouge soprano know
that's the name of the shade god I'm
really rubbish today these are cool
color riche extraordinaire and the
packaging looks like this it's got the
color on the side as well and when you
take out the applicator looks pretty
much the same now I don't know if you
all know but L'Oreal owns wire sells so
Laura Paris and wire sell all parts a
brand I don't know if they make their
products in the same Factory but it's
probably quite likely
I know these are so similar one thing I
did notice is that the L'Oreal Paris one
smell are amazing it smells like the
origins overnight mask and it kind of
smells like the why I sell lipsticks
with the pretty packaging they're very
similar I'd say that the L'Oreal one's a
bit more glossy and balmy and doesn't
stain the lips for as long whereas the
Whitesell one you get a longer lasting
stain but that's because the formula
probably is more expensive and a bit
longer lasting but they're really
similar so if you wanted to try out a
sort of glassy stained type product this
would be a good one to try first by now
you guys probably know my concealer
routine I like to use the Bobbi Brown
corrector and then a liquidy concealer
on top either the makeup forever one or
the NARS one and I always struggle to
find drugstore concealers that I like
that I don't find wrong on my skin
because I have quite dehydrated skin but
I wanted to find a do before the Bobbi
Brown
correct sir which if you don't know it
is basically a salmony color creamy
concealer that you put on your eyes and
it cancels out the darkness the kind of
purple bloomie shades that give you that
tired look and one that I think is
really similar is the soap of glory
kickass concealer this one actually
comes with a powder in the top to set it
which is a really good translucent
powder and then it comes with two shades
the green ones quite good for spots
because it will help get rid of any
redness but the pink one is the one that
I think is a good deep for the Bobbi
Brown corrector it's a really good pink
so many color so it's nice under your
eyes and it's really nicely creamy so
you can use your fingers to blend it it
is more creamy than the Bobbi Brown
corrector so I feel like it won't last
as long throughout the day and it kind
of moves around a bit if you have oily
skin this one's probably not that good
but if you have dry skin it's really
creamy and kind of moisturizing and I
think it's a really good deep and I just
think this is a really good product in
general because you get the powder as
well I have been searching high and low
for a dupe for the Estee Lauder stay on
shadow paints this is in chained and
I've had this right here now I
absolutely love it it's kind of a mousse
II textured eyeshadow and I use a brush
or a finger to apply this this one in
particular is a really nice orangey tone
like copper tone Brown and it's so
flattering I just love the formula cuz
it applies quite wet and then it just
sets and doesn't move all day and it's
just the best kind of eye shadow I think
so I've been looking for a deep and
there's just nothing like it so I've
kind of half discovered one this is a
really good deep and it's from Kiko the
only problem is they're limited edition
and every time I go into a store I try
to ask them if they're called
long-lasting eyeshadows but they only
seem to come out in the limited-edition
collections they're not kind of there
all the time so at the moment I think
they've got this collection out which I
don't know what it's called I think it's
something to do denim and in here
they've got snappy brass long lasting
eyeshadow so it comes in a pot as well
it looks very similar and it's also a
moosie consistency a slightly more
liquidy and creamy then Estee Lauder one
but it does exactly the same thing
applies wet sets and then stays in place
all day this one
color in particular is more bronzy and a
lot more metallic than as they'll order
chained but the formula is so similar
and I just wish Kiko would make these
permanent because I only seem to find
them in limited-edition collections so
if you go into Kiko or online and see
this denim collection then you can pick
up this shade snappy brass which is very
similar but I just I wish they made
permanent really for they're really good
formulas final product is a mascara and
if you guys read my website you'll know
that I'm completely absolutely in love
with clinic high impact extreme volume
mascara I think I actually did a post
called for best mascara in the world
which is quite a bold statement I
absolutely love this I've repurchase it
so many times it's the one that looks
like it has a green one before you dip
it in and it's just got a long kind of
plasticky wand and for me I've got quite
long curly eyelashes I know but a lot of
mascaras don't work on me and this one
just grips my lashes instantly and gives
them a huge lift volume everything and
then what I've really liked recently is
the top top top shot false lash mascara
full slash that's really hard to say and
I actually noticed that's quite similar
to clinic gives me a similar sort of
finish it has a plasticky wand it's not
quite as long it's a bit more kind of
rounded but this just gives so much
length and volume to my lashes it grips
them really well I don't know if I'm
making sense when I say that but you
know some mascara is you have to keep
going this whereas this one really grips
onto the lashes and makes it quite easy
I think they just put mascara in my hair
I really like this mascara I like
Topshop makeup in general but I wasn't
expecting to be so impressed with their
mascara and I think these are very
similar so maybe try this one at first
if you were interested in trying this ok
