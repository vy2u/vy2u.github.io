really good week so far today I'm gonna
be doing a little beauty haul video and
I say little it's not really that little
but compared to my usual hauls where I
kind of collect everything together and
do one big epic video this is quite
small I'm trying not to buy too much
stuff as you guys know I kind of
recently cleared out my collection I'm
trying to do an in-out system so the
more I buy the more I have to get rid of
so I'm trying not to go too crazy but I
picked up some stuff from Charlotte
Tilbury and from H&amp;amp;M beauty two very
different brands so I thought you guys
might like to see what I bought and if
you follow me on snapchat
I'm snapchat in a lot at the moment then
you might have already seen my H&amp;amp;M PT
haul but I thought I'd talk through it
properly on here for you guys just in
case also if you're not following me on
snapchat then you won't know that I'm
doing something pretty special this year
during December if you watch my vlogs
you'll know that I'm fortunate ly not
doing vlogmas this year I know a lot of
you are really upset by that I just feel
like I really want to enjoy Christmas
this year and vlogmas is tough but to
make up for it I'm going to be doing
snap --mess I've literally just made
that up I'm basically gonna be
snapchatting everyday and it's pretty
much like vlogging I'm gonna be
snapchatting my entire day every single
day I might even do it past Christmas
day all the way up to new year so make
sure you add me on snapchat my username
is just Lily pebbles if you haven't got
snapchat download it is so easy it's so
fun there's no way of monetizing
snapchat yet so I'm not making money
from this I'm purely doing it for
enjoyment purposes after you guys
because I know it'd be fun has a lot of
substitutes of vlogmas so let's get on
with the haul I've got my stuff behind
me here and I'm gonna show you what I
picked up so let's start with Charlotte
Tilbury stuff and I picked up two
lipsticks I went to the counter in
Selfridges everything was just so pretty
it was the weekend so I was in real like
shopping mode and I don't know rich left
me for like five minutes and he came
back and I had a bag and I felt really
bad so I picked up two lipsticks one is
from her was it cool I think it's like
kis si ng which is basically the
moisturizing hydrating lipsticks and I
picked up the shade called stoned rose
I'm wearing it today it's an interesting
color actually I don't really have
anything like it because it's a kind of
nude but it's quite orange a nude and I
haven't quite decided if I like it or
not
it's slightly aging on me I think the
slightly more berry nudes or mo nudes a
bit like Mac mare suit me better but
it's kind of interesting and I think
it's a nice alternative it's a really
good daytime lipstick they're so
comfortable to wear her lipsticks the
bullet is like the perfect size well
actually I thought but it's a square oh
the bullet on the matte lipsticks
difference of the kissing one I wonder
where that is anyway I thought this was
a really interesting shade and although
it's probably not my favorite from her
lipsticks I'm kind of liking it the
other lipstick is from her matte
revolution range which is per matte
lipsticks they are incredible by far the
best matte lipsticks I've tried so comfy
on the lips not at all drying but they
don't really budge and I picked up the
shade bond girl this is like a movi
Brown this is a bit like Mac Mir I'm
clearly really into those kind of
lipsticks at the moment it's very local
terminal shades I just love this shade I
think it's really sophisticated and it's
such a nice alternative to red or nude
because it's just something else and I
really like it I think I'll be wearing
this one a lot this autumn I also picked
up two I products and I've been looking
at this one for so so long and I've seen
it online I've been desperate to pick it
up it's one of her cream eyeshadows I've
got one in brown but I find it a little
bit too shimmery so I don't use it as
much as my Estee Lauder cream eyeshadow
or some other ones that I have but this
is the eyes to mesmerize in the shade
Cleopatra I don't know what made me want
this but oh my god it's like a peacock
green and I say peacock green because
it's kind of like a greeny blue it's so
so beautiful
I haven't yet tried it but I'm gonna
insert a cutaway and I cannot wait I
should really try it on my hand now so I
couldn't let you guys know these are
like a mu C cream mu C crania I said
that alright it's so crazy pigmented I
just think this would look so pretty on
the eye it's kind of got slightly brown
undertone so it's a bit like Mac Club
which is just one of my favorite
eyeshadows and I think it's a bit
beautiful for like Christmas period or
just going on a night out green suits me
because I have brown hair brown eyes and
greens really complimentary with brown
and I think to make this really wearable
you can just put like a matte brown in
the crease and under the eye oh it's
just so
it's so beautiful I cannot wait to try
this out this is literally the cream
version of Mac Club which is my favorite
eyeshadow I also picked up another
eyeshadow palette I'm really tempted by
the matte one I know that Anna recently
picked it up so I'm gonna wait power of
you before I buy it but I also always
had my eye on the golden goddess
Charlotte Tilbury does her makeup by
looks and by faces and I think I really
fit into the golden goddess look so I
knew that this one would kind of suit my
complexion it has four shades like all
her palettes and the top left one is
like a light highlight the top right one
is interesting because it's like a cool
brown and I really like that one the
bottom right is a slightly warmer
shimmer Brown and then bottom left is a
glitter this is quite similar to Dolce
Vita but it's just so so wearable I
would literally get use of every shade
in this palette I know I will maybe not
the glitter as much that's more of like
in the evening but the other three are
so good for a day look I've already worn
them and I love it such a good one for
traveling because it kind of has
everything you need I just really wanted
it and I'm glad I got it I need a tissue
from my hand okay so now the stuff I
bought from H&amp;amp;M beauty and if you guys
watch my October monkey makeup routine
you know that I've already tried out a
few bits from there I was kindly sent
some bits that I really wanted to go
into store because they have so much
stuff they looked online I was really
surprised at how much stuff they've got
in their new collection so I wanted to
go in and just have a proper look and
see for myself kind of what catches my
eye and just pick up some stuff to try -
as soon as I walked in i saw that they
had a hair range and i didn't know they
did products the hair which is really
interesting i feel like that surprises
me that they have hair stuff in their
collection i don't know why the
packaging is amazing it looks like
something you'd get in space inkay
actually looks like there is a brand as
basic a copper but it's cool it has a
very similar packaging to this it's
really interesting it looks different
but it looks high-end it really really
does and it feels high-end as well so
the first thing I got was this one it
comes in a squeezy tube and it's the
defining moment texture paste it says
pliable hold and lasting volume I love
these kind of creams that you put on
your hair after you blow-dried it or
straightened it when your hair just
feels a bit fluffy kind of just mold it
all together gives a bit of texture and
hold and gives it that kind of PC look
that I like in my hair there's one from
Kiehl's that my hairdresser used on me
that I love
and I'm gonna give a go and there's also
one from Bumble and Bumble it comes in a
brown chute that I really like so I
thought this would be similar to that
unfortunately I was really disappointed
with this how much is it $6.99 it's so
affordable the reason I was disappointed
is because it's just too tacky and
sticky literally put on your hands and
your hands it's just sticky and you've
got to wash them and it just doesn't
feel nice to put in your hair I get why
they made it like that to make it really
kind of textured but I've used other
textured creams that don't need to be
sticky and they still work so wasn't a
massive fan of the sticky goopy stuff
the next product is the hit refresh dry
conditioner it says instant softness
lightweight and hydrating so this is
like a dry conditioner so serve a dry
shampoo you can basically spray it on
dry hair just to give your hair like a
bit of shine a bit of condition and this
is great for my kind of hair which is
really dry it's a great thing to use
throughout the day if your hair is just
starting to feel a bit brittle and dry
it's kind of hard to give a really good
review on this because it's hard to tell
if it makes that much of a difference
but I mean to just say how much it was
$6.99
really affordable and I think it's it's
a good idea for how to find dry
conditioners in the UK so I was pretty
impressed by this one the next product I
got was a finishing powder and I felt
like I heard someone talk about this or
when I was talking to a channel Beauty
was someone they said oh you must try
the powder so I went straight to find
this I don't think they had a
translucent powder which is the one I
would normally go forward translucent
just means like no color because
sometimes I don't really want to add
extra coverage I just want to set my
makeup but they didn't have that so I
went for ivory which is normally the
shade that I am the packaging on they're
powered is is nice it's like a white top
with black and then a mirror inside
again it feels that means quite
plasticky but it feels quite high-end
for the price I'd add the price of this
one on it because canid they all the
makeup comes in our Sur packaging which
is really nice as well so I've used this
a couple of times now and I really like
it it's very it's like not a heavy
powder at school it's very fine I mean
it's not if you're hoping for a lot of
coverage from your powder you might not
be impressed because it is very fine but
it's nice just to set the makeup so I
always overdo it on powder which is
really frustrating so you can't really
overdo it with this one I'm gonna keep
trying it out but it's nice to have
another kind of cheap alternative when
you're looking for
powder and then I went to the eye
section and I saw that they did I
crayons I have so many like brown smudgy
eye crayons so I didn't really want to
pick up a brown I tried it on the back
of my hand in store and it seemed quite
nice so I thought gave something a bit
different and I went for this like aqua
green I thought it would be really nice
to put this all over the lid and then
put like a smoky brown in the crease
just something a little bit different
does it say the shade name Stella dim I
think that's how you pronounce it and
these are called the eye color to go
I wasn't massively impressed with these
like it's really hard to explain but the
pigment it doesn't kind of apply evenly
and I feel like once you blend it out
it's quite oh I don't know it's really
hard to tell I feel like maybe in a
brown it would be nice but for this
color
it wasn't like bold and it wasn't sure
it was just a bit like patchy I found
and I also think the tone of the kind of
minty green didn't really suit my eyes
as much so this one I probably will end
up giving away to a friend I didn't
really like it as much as I thought I
would but I'd not sure how the kind of
more Brown neutral colors are I also
picked up three single eyeshadows
because I tried the single eyeshadows
before and I know that they're great
there are so many shades it took me so
long to pick annoyingly some of the
samples are kind of dried out and it was
quite hard to test them but I kind of
know what shades suit my eyes so I went
for these three shades the first one is
called bad Chi D Dharma and this is like
a light golden shade is so so proceed
that I show is a really creamy and
buttery and so so easy to blend this is
a gorgeous shade I love it it's not as
pink is Mac all that glitters and it's
not as cool tones Mac patina it's like
the perfect light gold
to put all over your lid I really really
like this I've been loving wearing it I
also bought on Mac Brown because I do
love a matte brown eyeshadow they're so
useful to have this is in the shade
candied almond such a good name this was
slightly darker it's a bit like Mac cork
but maybe not as orange such a good
crease shade and for under the eye
literally I could wear this every day
and then the final eyeshadow that I
bought is called Sahara Dawn and this is
more of like this is the shimmer it's
more of a ready burgundy tone so it's
something a little bit different it's a
bit like Mac cranberry but not as red
Mac cranberries quite quite hard to wear
this is more
like yeah but Kiko shadow that's like
this it's like a beautiful burgundy they
blend so beautifully I can't even
explain I think you'd have to be careful
that this one because it's got quite a
bit of purple in it you don't look like
you've got a bruised eye but if you just
put a little bit in the outer corner and
blend it in with brown it's a really
nice little terminal shade really warm
and pretty you probably can't see from
there but I've just basically put all
three shadows together here and I love
this I love every single eyeshadow that
I bought I'm really glad I went for the
single eyeshadows and I would really
recommend them so those all the bits I
picked up from Charlotte Tilbury and H&amp;amp;M
Beauty let me know if you guys have
tried anything from the H&amp;amp;M range
because I'm so impressed so far and you
know always looking to try more I like
to have like personal recommendations I
hope you guys like seeing what I picked
up and I will see you on Sunday for my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
