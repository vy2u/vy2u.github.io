haul for ages I just have so much beauty
stuff that I kind of feel guilty going
on a massive spending spree but recently
there's been a few things hearing there
that have been popping up I just like oh
my god I really need that so I have been
doing a bit of shopping recently I've
been to spacing K I did a big order from
Cole Beauty I popped into boots and I
think that's all so I thought I would
just show you everything that I've
bought in the last kind of two weeks and
I know that everyone loves a good beauty
haul so I hope you guys enjoy this I'm
gonna start with let's start with
spacing kay I have made two trips to
spacing K recently one was in Brighton
and here you go this is why I picked up
in Brighton I showed you guys in my vlog
so I won't talk too much about this it
is a highlighter from Kevin o Quan I
have his candle light one and I
absolutely love it like a golden
highlight they just put on the tops of
my cheekbones it's very pretty very
similar to the Charlotte Tilbury one and
this one is starlight and it's slightly
more pink based it's so pretty it's a
bit like all that glitters Mac eye
shadow you can definitely use this as an
eyeshadow as well it's really really
flattering on the tops of the cheekbones
though I don't usually go for pinky tone
things like pink tone foundations and
all of that I stay very far away from
but for highlights it's really pretty
because it kind of looks a bit like a
blush and if you pair it with a nice
peachy blush it kind of transitions into
each other and I think it's absolutely
gorgeous so happy I got that I also got
travel-size or beige eye texturizing
spray because I haven't bought the
travel sized one in a while I'm gonna be
doing a bit of traveling soon and I
don't wanna take the huge bottle with me
I love this stuff I use it every single
day without fail I just spray it to
light the back roots of my hair and a
bit in the middle and I feel like it
gives a bit of volume it gives a bit
hold a bit of texture and it's it's
amazing I really recommend this stuff I
also this is quite hilarious I don't
know if I've told you guys before but I
hate a hype whenever one gets excited
about product I always just want to step
back and let everyone else buy it find
out whether they liked it or if they
were disappointed and sometimes I end up
getting it sometimes I don't
I'm literally two years behind on this
hype this is the hourglass ambient
lighting palette I only have one of the
ambient lighting powders I've got
diffused light and I use that to set my
makeup the reason I wasn't that
interested in this when it first came
out I'll show you it's a palette with
three shades in it because they're all
quite shimmery and highlighted and I
thought the point of
powders were to kind of use like a face
powder and I didn't want a shimmery face
so I kind of just forgot about this and
wasn't really interested but then
recently the video I did with the
Victoria on her channel which I will
link below she used this and just seeing
it in youth so close-up I was like oh my
god I really really need that and it
doesn't have the one I've already got in
it which kind of made me want it even
more because it's the three new shades
to me the one in the middle is exclusive
to this palette and that's a really nice
highlighter the one on the right is more
of a peachy toned powder and on the left
is more of a bronzey tone and I feel
like they don't shop that much on the
skin but I've used them today and I've
been trying them out and it does make a
bit of a difference in the skin it does
add that glow these powders are so fine
they don't look powdered on the scale at
all so you kind of layer them up and you
won't look powdery and they've got such
a subtle highlighted shimmer I just
think they're really really pretty and
I'm glad I got this even though it's two
years after it came out I was also on
the hunt for this NARS eyeshadow I
mentioned in my bright and vlogs that I
was looking for it they didn't have it
there I found the last one in space and
K in bonbon Street it's on that funny
road that takes you from Worcester
Street to Bond Street and it's the NARS
and Christopher cane I shadow in outer
limits this is so pretty now the reason
I wanted this is because tarty whose
channel I will link below if you don't
already watch her videos she is an
incredible makeup artist and she's so
lovely she used this in her video she
did a whole video on like peach makeup
and she used this and an Urban Decay
shadow which I will show you in a minute
because I went to buy that too and she
had it on her lids now I'm wearing it
now and I saw it on her lids and thought
this is so different to anything I have
or anything I would normally use but I'd
need that it looks incredible it's the
peachy eyeshadow with kind of pink
glitter in it I really don't tend to a
lifter much but this does have a bit of
fallout so what I tend to do is just use
my finger and just press it on which is
what I did today I don't know if you can
see it on my lids and I just put a tiny
bit in the center like Tasi recommended
and it's gorgeous I love this like oh so
nice because I feel like some glitter
shadows can just be too much too heavy
just literally going clubbing whereas
this is a pretty light summer daytime
glitter and it's amazing so she
recommended using that with this
eyeshadow from Urban Decay which I also
went to by
in House of Fraser why is open to case
so hard to find there is now a shop in
Covent Garden a standalone store which
is cool apart from that I kind of wish
it was to Stockton like Selfridges and
places anyway this is the eye shadow in
free love and she used this underneath
the glitter so this is like a peachy
eyeshadow I don't have any peach
eyeshadows I don't know why I think it's
probably a bit too close to pink that I
just get a bit of worried how it's gonna
look but I found with this if you don't
if you put it all over the lid then it
does make you look a bit sick but I used
like a soft brown I think I use naked
from the Naked palette so it's cool
Orbach the light matte Brown I use that
in the crease and then I just use this
just on the lid and I think it looks so
pretty
it's just something really different
really nice for the summer this and the
NARS eye shadow together amazing I don't
know if any of those nas shadows are
still gonna be available but try and go
on a hunt for them because it's worth it
from boots I picked up a few polishes
from the new Essie summer 15 collection
of course whenever I see a new Essie
collection I always think I don't need
any more nail polishes but there's
always some that just grab my attention
and I have to pick them up the first one
is chill Otto which is like a pastel
lime green really different really like
it it does look kind of strange on the
nails but I really like how it looks I
also got peach side babe which is a
pretty summer peach and that's what I'm
wearing on my nails now and I just think
that's really nice it's like I kind of
like orange e nails but this is a really
nice light peach there's an owl outside
my window I hope that's not being picked
up on this microphone the other one I
got is salt water happy which is such a
lily Purple's color I do not need this I
have so many shades of this color but
it's my favorite favorite color
especially on nails like a light
periwinkle blue this is so similar to
other ones I have it hasn't got any
shimmer or glitter in it which is
different from the other ones I have and
I love that so summery okay so I also
made a big order on cult beauty I
absolutely love shopping and Kolby see
they have such good brands I always look
at the new in section to see what's new
and I always seem to find something that
I want I had a few things I needed
topping up so let me just open this up I
see what's inside I can't really
remember why all
honest so the first thing I wanted to
get is Tartars daily essentials um so
this brand tuck Tata Tata Harper Tata
Harper I don't know how you pronounce it
but Caroline Horan's loves it and Ana
loves it and I trust both of their
opinion on skincare it's a brand I've
never used so I really like to get these
discovery kits called Beauty to them all
the time they're so good because then
you can try a few kind of minis from the
range and see what you like and then
decide what you want to buy the full
size of so in this kit you get cleanser
mask hydrating essence serum moisturizer
eye cream and replenishing nutrient
complex so it's pretty much everything
you need for your entire face so I'm
really excited to try out all of these
and then see if any of them become
staples in my collection this is like a
7 easy steps it says it's 100% free from
synthetics GMO fillers gluten sensitive
fragrance and it's proud to be eco sir
no animal testing and cruelty free and
all of these things so if you're into
that kind of stuff then definitely check
out this brand I'm really excited to
show these actually cult Beauty when you
finish shopping always ask if you want
some samples to try so I selected the
Askia renascence cleansing gel because I
want to give this to my sister so she
can try it and Alf H liquid gold so that
would be good for traveling ok what else
is in here
anastasi clear brow gel oh my god I've
missed this stuff I've been using the
deal one it's not as good this is by far
my favorite clear brow gel because it
doesn't go crunchy oh it doesn't make
your eyebrows kind of hurt throughout
the day and also it's not see-through so
you don't have to look at the gross
color of your clear eyebrow gel when it
is not clear anymore
I also got another ESOP parsley seed
cleansing mask I've missed this stuff I
have a repurchase oh I haven't
repurchase this and so long I've missed
it this is my go-to mask when my skin is
feeling a bit spotty or a bit just dodgy
and it sorts me out I love it
I've talked about this a lot so you guys
know but I can't recommend it enough
it's just a really nice clay mask that
dries but it doesn't hurt when you
remove it and it feels moisturizing and
it's brilliant as really as I also got
another Anastasia brow Wiz and because I
finished mine I hope this one doesn't
break my other one broke quite quickly
but I got a different shade this time
last time I got soft brunette which
works but it might be slightly dark and
this time I'm trying medium brown which
thinks a little less warm than soft
brunettes I'm a little more Ashley so I
will give it a go to be honest I don't
really have much to fill in so it
doesn't make a massive difference as
long as it's near my brow shade and
that's fine so I love this these are so
good seven glory do their archery one
but in terms of color selection
Anastasia are just so good okay I also
got the CMD sticky anchoring base coat
for some reason I have a million nail
polishes but I keep losing my base coat
or the lid keeps breaking so I thought
I'd try out a new one I've seen I think
Kate from Ghost parties M likes this one
and I trust her opinion
I love that it's called a sticky base
coat I don't know why that really
appeals to me and it's like this really
bright blue color which is cool so I
will try that and I'm sure if I like you
end up in one of my Sunday nail posts if
you don't know I post every Sunday on my
blog about nails
oh I've also got a little eat supper
sample in here as well that's all I've
got the facial paste and the rose facial
treatment and the hand balm nice Koby
tea is so good with their samples okay
then the final thing I got and this was
in the new in-page so I really wanted to
try it is from Stealer
it's the aqua glow watercolor blush so
it comes in this little box and I don't
really know anything about this but it's
a water color blush ooh
so this shade is shimmering Lotus and
it's a pink with gold shimmer by as
exciting shake well before use this is
weird I don't know what to expect
oh it's got like this funny little
filter and then yeah it's literally
liquid I'm going to try the back of my
hand it's very watery it's one of those
things that's probably gonna you have to
use a tiny amount always it will just
spread all over your face but it's a
pretty subtle like peachy color
I don't know I'm gonna have to report
back but that looks really interesting
and I like water color creams those sort
of blushes for summer because they leave
your cheeks looking like Juhi and fresh
I feel like sometimes in the summer
would you use too much powder the Sun
beams down on you and you look like a
powdery face so it's nice to use creams
and liquids in the summer because they
really just work into your skin better
okay so that everything from my beauty
haul and I hope you guys enjoyed seeing
what I bought let me know if you have
any of these things and what you think
of them and I hope you guys have had a
great Thursday I'll be back on Sunday
for another video and I think it's my
monthly favourites
I will see you guys then and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
