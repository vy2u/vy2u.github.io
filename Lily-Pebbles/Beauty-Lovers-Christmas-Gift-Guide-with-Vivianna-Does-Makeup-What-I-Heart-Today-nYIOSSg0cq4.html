I'm telling you
hi guys I'm here today with an ax from
Viviana does makeup I'm sure you know
took about all the time and she has an
amazing YouTube and now you're the one
that's gonna get my we just ran the
video on her channel and doing a
Christmas gift guide for 25 pounds and
under so this is going to be the 25
pounds of over which is like my favorite
like luxury like that's really one yeah
so yeah we're just gonna talk to them
right you go first
this is like a body one from elements
yeah not as much as I'd like to but I
have a few things really nice this is
the Duchess's I like the box I've got a
bit of everything in that it got the
frangipani money mono a body oil has
been to be amazing and the shower cream
of that the tranquil touch people you
know they're tranquil oh yeah thank you
and the tripod touch body polish and I
love love love the body oil it's so nice
it's like hard in the achieve and then
your body under water just melts it
smells incredible I think this would be
really amazing if you have like a beauty
junkie mom near auntie my mom I really
like this yeah she's gonna watch both
these videos but yet definitely just
worth it in the body oil and also the
shower creams are monthly as well so
anything that's really nice yeah I like
the presentation on that as well yeah
it's like a big box full of goodies I'm
going to talk about genes which are from
Urban Decay and it's basically the
smoked set which is there 24/7 glide-on
eye pencils which are really good
they're really
long lasting and creamy creamy and easy
as a pie and this comes in like the gray
black brown gold purple green pretty
much like every color that they do and I
think this is a really nice ass the gold
yeah the bodhi brown is really nice fit
every night if he knows when he likes
like eyeliners and if they're open to
Cape Anne I think this is just really
kind of easy to buy but still like looks
like full of thorns I would be happy
forget that like oh you know eyeliner
then that's like the most perfect size
ever yeah I think that's really nice so
yeah that's for like my makeup friend
you might be friend and not that I'm a
puppy gift
I think you've but one as well yeah from
benefit and this is that dazzle me
darling darling when if it do really
good like Christmas service as long as
that's who in here yeah and it's got a
mini Porefessional a mini some kind of
gorgeous which i think was the first
foundation I ever needs I can use this
foundation okay
it's like a creamy foundation concealer
bit of everything a little mini perfume
sample bad girl ash which was my first
ever high-end makeup artist and then
benefit hoola I was full size who knows
but also I hear that and full size and
mascara and these even just for these
little light and so the paces the other
day I went around the knees for her
boyfriend's left and made cinnamon buns
and then all this food all in like me
makeup okay so it's a really nice like
presentation box but all different types
of things including fun so they reality
to you I've also got benefit and set
because they're so good on too
they're really easy to get bored of as
well and this is upgrade to gorgeous
which is kind of smaller but similar
kind of little tasting and in the side
here is a full-size high beam and which
is like a liquid highlighter to be a
 yeah they're real scholar which is
parody very cute I have much time to see
I have tried it but why actually I
really liked not curly yeah me I think
you've got amazing like I learned in
action yeah I think that would probably
look realistic
there are mascara and a mini the
Porefessional primer and a full-sized
sugar bomb which is really cool I think
this is what kind of makes it very yes
that it's a really nice kind of that I
think everyone will actually go up it's
like a mix of highlighter and blusher
and it makes them really inviting you as
well like it's probably cheaper to buy
than those types of sets no I mean
advice make yourself things really good
yeah we've got a few like perfumey bit
yeah and the first one is Jamie Lee
fragrance I really like Lily and her
whole family
I like the biggest fan I dunno I've got
their nectarine blossom and honey I
really like that one I've got like a
mini song I really like this but we just
threw these in because they package them
up so nicely they do come in a little
box like this and they've got black bow
around it and it's just really luxury
yeah and they're not too expensive
I think getting anything from Jamie Lee
Christmas many of you are begging
handles everything and they have special
Christmas packaging I think at the
moment which has like black and silver
ribbon and yeah they're just so luxury
yeah anything
yeah we like this we'll just have to go
in both agree that's like the happy San
Giovanni termination
yes yeah all right I'll do this math yes
oh yeah they also have a Christmas
cracker which is just so cool I love ya
I made a lot of friends to posters
practice I think journaling wants all my
favorites this one includes a
pomegranate normal body and hand wash
which is like one of the I think it's
their most popular the scent actually
and an orange blossom body cream and a
lion buzzer the mandarin cologne so
that's like three really like genuine
others like yemenis in here and just
imagine like if you have the budget I
think these are really nice to have is
like gifts or the Christmas table you
know so my mom that my mom puts a little
gifts I mean they're not these but
something this would be amazing if you
might this like one little table set in
place of C at Christmas yeah I would
quite like to sit down to Christmas
dinner with that that is under the tree
like you can say industry if you have a
bigger tree than the one that's behind
the tree I just need to say if you know
something is generating fun or if you
want to introduce them into the brand so
this is a really nice way okay well I
think I'm going to talk about some more
crackers could be big what are they
going these are the Estee Lauder
Christmas crackers and it's a six and
there's meaning of like it's a lip
pencil mascara and on tonight repair
that's so good lovin that bhuvarloka
pair a lipstick a cleanser a perfume a
serum they all so much again it's just a
good idea to either like decorate the
tree with or put
maybe you've got people around Christmas
and just put the round table yeah I
think they're like a nice idea maybe if
you've got like six girlfriends to buy
for and then you don't eat your crackers
some of those people do like they have
Christmas Day with a family but
something busy like a dinner with
friends yeah yeah it is the nice lady I
like things that come in like sets with
a lot of thing because then you can just
break them up and give one of each to
like all of your friends well I wouldn't
mind giving I think the whole proper
thing is right it was that right there
yes yeah let's get back to fragrance
yeah so we're like crackers happy so
this one is from crunchy and even later
Emily and I never knew him say and it's
that evening Burroughs solid perfume so
this is nice like your mom or grandma or
it doesn't have to be I personally love
roses but I know I did so I think anyone
who likes wet it's really I mean it
comes in this really cute little pouch
which I love that I like you keep eyelet
Barnes only thing and it unzips and
inside it is like the little rose solid
perfume and you just twist it and it's
really cute and its really nice nice My
yes you're like that yeah I don't know
but it's really nice keep your hand you
like feels really like heavy and I just
nestled really sweet little skinny luck
my grandma we love boxing we've got
another solid perfume well well and I
like this one I like it really like it's
really happy it's yeah it's really
really happy it's nice it's a closely
quality brand you put in your handbag
got a cute little party to go in as well
and it just feels just so luxury I smell
this is the store didn't think I loved
it I think it's value it when it's my
total and it's thought of it I don't
think anyone could resist it's quite
fresh and like it's quite a bit but a
bit pound of you think yeah I really
like the balloons they do good solid
puffs using a few of the different
scents and I think yeah they're nice
that I've been using with the loots when
I really really like it I just think
it's a nice idea so getting someone like
a spray fragrance and I think it's nice
for somebody who already has the spray
foam is untipped EQ by them the matching
so the perfume does it feel quite proper
then you just kind of put it there in
there and it feels kind of balanced view
I think player yeah we've got one more
fragrance here as well and it's the
Burberry body and if this is recycled
hairspray so it's like good for your
handbag size ah really nice and then
it's got two of these refillable like
cartridges to put in it as well I really
like this raven Lily's not the biggest
fan
yeah but you guys know what I'm like I'm
really picky with this mouse is a pot
pourri but I think if you know something
like this then it's really nice to have
like a handbag size of your favorite
perfume on that for a few of my nights
is so nice
I really hope more brands start in bowls
yeah they were another big do one as
well I have my closest one which is
just think a nice idea because I think
there's quite a few freaking stands and
now for me I like to travel
yeah buy things and it's a good idea
thing you don't end up having to get a
big bottom of the frame which you might
not necessarily like yeah but that's on
the cool one third just throwing in the
back to do some pulpit yeah I've got
this set from bliss this is a lovely
like spar ground and this is kind of a
good very bubbly set and it's got there
raspberry champagne body butter and
while some champagne like body wash and
bubble bath which is really nice for
like someone I think you think there's
like a treat
like I think there's a really nice my
sister two young kids and it's nice of
someone like take time and have fun yeah
like it's raspberries champagnes that's
really like luxury and this comes in
like a big pump I'm not going to love
the big pump in the shop and you want to
miss that
yeah it's just really nice that yeah my
place as well so that's good one and
then another thing this is my bath time
we spoke about Road therapy associates
in my video you never give up and this
is the miniature bath and shower oil
collection this is like little minis and
they're like three million Asst it's so
good I got this for my birthday I wanted
to like every mood and the ones that I
use the most of I can see like the
stress ones yeah I get quite stressed
but it really does help I just have a
bath I mean how really now then you know
a couple of drops of this oil in and I
love support yeah support breathers
really good and then pour the lavender
and peppermint yeah whenever you've got
cold or if anyone has a cold I might
take this go have a bath with it they're
just so nice so relaxing so now you need
the tiniest there it might seem like you
get through this set in like a week if
you just need to use like a cat full you
know this very much is already strong
really strong it make like a whole home
smell of room therapy
yes and I just think it's just a nice
look the type bath you get so I like a
bit different you might not get my
speaking at this from space saying hey
yeah I think an get it from space okay
yeah oh yeah that's it we see that's
okay if you not think I add loads
against each other oh this is a travel
calendar set from neon which is so good
and we obviously lovely neon as well I
always have their candle at burning
behind me of my videos and this is
basically a set of yeah yes my getting
this yeah this has for their candles in
and so it's really people way to like
try the brand and I love you always
asking about neon candles so this is
good way if you want to just kind of go
and you don't want like a massive candle
because many Sony's make money as well
by buying before topic angles and set
and I will put my hand up and say I have
you could wait you can smell it they're
really like the organic part maybe burn
yeah they're service the ones you
mentioned in my video like we clean like
natural or when I buy in the car tears
it to an oil
oh yeah it's like melted wax which is
quite nice and it's just so nice yeah
and the final thing is something a bit
different and if you follow me on
Twitter or read my blog or something
you've probably heard me go crazy about
this magazines this is such a good it is
giving me ideas while I'm really yeah
telling you Anya is a magazine
subscription how do you know we all
subscribe to like Elle and San Juans
over here but then like you're a beauty
junkie this is just like the dream
magazine it's good alert it's an
American magazine
if this magazine education
like I would be a very happy bunny yeah
I get my subscription from newsstand
okay okay I think that's about 36 pound
for like six months so we're not the
cheapest source we have to get it
imported but it is such a good magazine
it's just a good idea for beautiful
others because it's really difficult to
get ham in this magazine in the UK so if
I can life ideas something a bit
different and it's such a good read I
was just having really liked it so much
it's registered like something a good if
you are then it's so many other
magazines and more fashion and I like
then I'm looking to the beauty pages
yeah I do that no I'm bored yeah okay
those two pages look like a furlong is
it actually tiny bit of fashion in it
but the rest of its all beauty it's such
a good magazine so it could I did feeds
and others that perhaps it's a bit a bit
unique
I mean it's a really good I was wearing
my favorite we were saying that we've
done like Christmas advice for beauty
junkies and just sunlight to videos but
there are so many other good Christmas
gift guys out there Blair from Schneider
forth um III yeah there's a real other
like men and other yes like not just BTS
she's been a really good one Lisa Elgin
is one on just BTS was incredible like I
wanted everything yeah Ruth someone is
Iranian recommends and we also last
minute remembered that Megan Isabel yeah
does really good was on her blog let's
say facto lips a facto calm which is
really good so there's some really good
ones like children as well your children
and boys and girls and everything so
this is kind of the beauty junkie edit
you know if you found the other ones
those would be a good one to look at I
will put the links below so that's all
our over 25 gifts don't forget to go and
watch the video you filmed on Anna's
channel which is with the others makeup
because it's under 25 pounds and we
didn't feel like DIY gifts as well which

and read her blog and stay high and full
