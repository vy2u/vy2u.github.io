beauty chat video with myself and Anna
know we feel like one of those talk show
this month we're going off topic again
we like to change up every now and again
instead of talking beauty we're gonna be
talking food which is basically our
favorite subject I love food doesn't
everyone love food some people love it
more than others we love it a lot
this month is a foodie chat instead and
we asked you guys last night on Twitter
to send us your questions and I picked
10 and we haven't had time to think
about them I know I didn't look them to
you like an hour ago and I haven't
really thought about them so let's ruin
it exactly first one it's from simply
Sophie and she asks a food or meal that
you can't stand for me I can't stand
mushrooms oh yeah I've tried really hard
like as I've got older there's things I
haven't liked and then I try and I'm
like oh I feel quite like it but
mushrooms I still can't get behind and
also shepherd's pie really yeah my mum
makes a good one well because she makes
a good is that using lamb almond
elements beef cuz I know like I think
we're gonna show it to pie the chef is
my cottage part yeah so what I call
shepherd's pie I think is actually
cottage pie my mom uses minced beef we
do it with B okay so you don't like even
beef still there like this let's do it
I'm not a big fan of gravy so it's like
mints and gravy no I'm gonna make you
try mine because it's basically like
Bolognese the bit left I know I know
maybe give it a go I know you frame it
ago she doesn't like mushrooms I'm like
but try this much yeah that's me what do
I not like I hate fennel I hate me with
that aniseed taste neither I like them
so I'm just about handling coriander
because I feel that when coriander's
part of a recipe really adds to the
flavour so I'm being more grown-up about
grinder but Miranda seeds and if I get
like a chunk around I'm like look it
ruins so many salads when you're in is
shopping you're like oh I'll get this
and that is crayon run there
zopi does anyone like fennel though my
mom loves fennel I know any say like
Styron ease you know you get on I'm not
that keen oh it's all about flavor
they're like the same math degree Emma
Louise our favorite comfort food I know
what you're gonna say how you say I've
said it before I'll say it again
pasta with ketchup and pompoms chicken
soup oh I love my mom's chicken both of
those those are why I would have a fight
was feeling a bit unlike not well I'd
have pasta with ketchup and parmesan and
if I was really lucky I had my mom's I
would say something past three or so
like a yeah has to bake you don't have
to show you the melted cheese on an
oyster not be found melted cheese that I
have it like really crispy like just a
little bit of cheese it's more just like
the smarter we goodness at pasta just
pasta and the best sometimes I just want
about a pass with a bit salt on it done
no butter no dry period like practically
my real it's like pasta and ketchup now
Jessica asks any suggestions for easy
healthy lunches for work oh I feel like
you're probably saying similar thing but
just like a massive salad but not
necessarily salad how you think of a
salad I made one the other night with
like Bogle wheat and basically every
vegetable I liked in it so it wasn't all
of that will go together I was like I'm
sure it will taste nice little bit
chicken in but broccoli bottom up squash
onions and then just made it really big
and then you can just like scoop it out
and take it to work for the next few
days
yeah I agree I think if I worked in an
office I'd like my friend Jemma does
this on a Sunday night she'll roast a
whole chicken and then she'll make a
huge salad like with a grain like a
bulgur wheat or quinoa salad I've got a
really good recipe for a quinoa salad
it make a big back to that and roast the
chicken and then as long as I think as
long as you've got some chicken or
salmon or protein or something in there
it will keep you full because I know
that a salad wouldn't have got me by
only see ya but if it's got that kind of
like grain and pulse and chicken I
really ask favorite place to eat in
London okay let me finally take it away
let's add grated into this as well it's
only fair favorite place in London and
Brighton
I can't contribute to the price and why
I don't know I feel like right and I
need to
I still got a bit of like digging to do
here but in London the thing I miss the
most is like the burger places because I
have ages oh just like patty and bond oh
it's the other one I like dirty burger
Biron burger anything like that just a
good burger yeah just so I don't end up
talking about the same places over and
over again because I've mentioned home
slice and paste that land before I
really like at the moment there's a
place with dish you will you listen
yeah if you have a couple of times and
it's really cool because I feel like as
British people we kind of ruined Indian
food
we got takeaways and everyone thinks
it's like a teacher at a calmer there's
so much more to it and then this place
is a really cool trendy Indian relic
place with this little like sharing
foods and it's delicious the queues are
insane yeah but also a lot of the stuffs
really spicy so if you can make sure you
say you don't like spicy cuz the long
it's really hot it's delicious I love
that place and I would still love honey
&amp;amp; Co which is like Middle Eastern food
and it's delicious also really hard to
get into but worth the wait I've got
another one to add the Aqua
along like just off of Regent Street for
sushi ridiculously expensive but like
some of the best sushi right hard no is
it the place opposite my new Liberty
yeah I think there might be it's like a
rooftop people oh they do amazing sushi
it was like a fancy sushi niculae young
asked what food did you live off at
evening
Chicago town takeaway pizza really yeah
I was obsessed because this shop near me
where we got food from which is so
poorly stocked but it basically just
sold like frozen goods
so it was all about like chips and
wedges and pizza I'm used to have these
like cards that are preloaded with four
pounds for lunch and that's what we got
like during first year during the day
and I would get walkers sensations sweet
chili
you know speech of you Chris yeah and
Pepsi Max it was no I have pets Max and
the guy I ate four C's Oh bad I know who
I'm having Michael even out I ate
horrendously at uni like horrendously
horrendously yeah I discovered creamy
pasta at uni I I never ate anything I
like to my mom hated it I remember my
flatmate made this pasta with like
Philadelphia and cream mushrooms and
bacon I became obsessed to have it every
day and I got really fat okay see it uni
like I was skimming I've been by ate the
worst day ever have I think that's
because I was like disco dancing like
every night oh yeah
I knew the food that I actually lived
off there was four heaters every night
get one of those feeds of kids yeah so
easy okay
never asked what is your favorite pizza
topping what I've been get each other's
when we go let's let's talk like
dominoes basic and then like fancy pizza
restaurant because it's very different I
feel like okay Alec Domino's yeah
pepperoni pepperoni
I do pepperoni sweet corn red onion and
then sometimes no cheese if I'm like
because sometimes they make the cheese a
bit too melty and I like cheese like a
bit crispier
as I sometimes I dunno cheese very
controversial yeah my Domino's is
pepperoni mushroom with the garlic and
herb sauce Kathy your plan fast we said
you'd go for like a shoot own rocket and
yeah yeah I think I do pretty much I
love it I love what with your boys your
lunchbox when you at school some it's a
harmless school yeah
no um Ribena lucky peanutbutter sandwich
which I loved but there was a boy in our
school that was so severely allergic to
peanuts that he couldn't be in the same
room as this every day when I had
peanuts sit in a separate room and eat
them and they sent a letter home my mom
kept forgetting and every time I open it
I do love crunch peanut butter um
pack of whoo loops brown ones oh yeah
beef and onion fruit I'm my friend
actually always a mouthful but I can't
remember I had maybe a tangerine I feel
like the nineties or a time of real
convenience mmm
so it was all about I'd have a sandwich
and we like a cheetah sandwich and then
the a packet of crisps whatever was on
offer
oops sometimes I throw it through what's
your favorite flavor
peach no I don't like pee all over the
beach do you have a front feet like to
have a fries fruits yes sometimes my mom
would freeze it in the summer
she'd freeze them so that by the time we
got to school they were all like like a
smoothie yeah and then the Sainsbury's
take on KitKat
I think they're called double take so
how does it have like a mint one
sometimes I had like the really smelly
monstermunch I was actually perfectly
yeah or like then with that pickled
onions I did love and figured onion
crisps I'm Charlie ass sorry if I
pronounced your name wrong what's one
food you always need in your kitchen I
struggled with this I don't want to you
okay one minute I'm gonna get it
this and I don't it's not really fast as
a food if I'm still in focus here this
is I don't know what it's cool watch I
write your hot chili sauce if I run out
of this stuff I like freaked out because
I put it on everything it's like a tie
you have it in like this Arbor in the
middle of the table it's a Thai spicy
chili sauce but it just makes everything
taste like Thailand and amazingness and
I love it and I put it on everything so
I can tip it up okay
you're gonna make rice they like really
boring if I'm reborn
make it I was gonna say something like
cereal I love cereal I always have to
have some kind of cereal because it's
just really good I can eat cereal any
time of the day if you haven't got
anything for dinner
cereal I'm gonna think lunch cereal
breakfast cereal
Eleni asked if you had your own lipstick
or lip gloss line what flavors do you
incorporate Olay me asked if you had
your own lipstick or lip gloss line
flavors would you incorporate I feel
like I don't want anything like too
sweet and sickly so I go for pina colada
what was a good one everyone likes pina
colada yeah and it smells that pina
coladas like refreshing but fruity and
creamy at the same time wow that was a
great answer you win yeah I think most
people do like sweet scents with
lipstick so I just try and do same
different and make it and also I'm a
savory girl so I'd do some cool flavors
like yeah I do like like bacon and maple
syrup that's sweet and pad thai I don't
know I'm in savory face this is the last
question now what kind of snack do you
buy at the cinema and this is a good
question it's been a long time since
I've gone to the cinema I went last
night and it cost me eight 15 pounds to
get sucks it's ridiculous ripoff the
last time I went was the last James Bond
film and I fell asleep
I said Mart refuses to go to cinema with
me anymore I feel like that was it the
one in Westfield and we used to have Ben
and Jerry's ice cream I might be like oh
I kind of see one flavor I have to have
two and then I have to have a topping
and have a sauce say yo come to like 15
pounds yeah and but I love toffee
popcorn mmm so you just let me just get
tough you pop good yeah I probably would
I've never been one drink like a hot dog
maybe I'd get a drink
share it with Mark I did I don't know I
have every time I I get busted at work I
get salt popcorn cuz I'm definitely a
sell popcorn person and then I have to
have bought it also because
after you've had half a thing I sell
popcorn you're like yeah a shriveled up
mouth so this will always happen and
then I always get minstrels as well
and I pull the minstrels into the salt
popcorn and mix it around so then you
get like if you just got let you go i
salty popcorn mix of sweet to minstrel
and it's just perfect combination next
time I go to the Sinestro unit mark
allows me to that is happening it is try
it
great combination easy because that's
exactly what I get every time and never
you anything different I feel when you
pick that question I was like she's just
like okay so there's all the questions
from this month's foodie chats I really
like doing food I give them less know
