piece chat video with me and Anna and
we're actually in LA at the moment which
is so exciting we're here for VidCon but
we also had our beach chat live event
last night yeah it wasn't the same oh my
god amazing it was so good I mean like
people just say lovely you really are
and it just feels so appropriate to do a
beauty chat whilst we're here so just
about having to bring tripods and
cameras with us it's so worth it so
we're gonna go through some of the
questions you guys tweet at us before we
came and I think this month we said the
theme is summer yes got 10 questions all
summer themed and the first one is from
Sophie do you have a go-to summer scent
that's always Nana winter might be are
you doing my summer scent this summer is
this one Tom Ford and really put it in a
love that well kind of obsessed I've
read reviews online that says that it
smells like toilet cleaner oh no now
I've said that do you think it now you
said that but I'm very it's like really
fresh and citrusy I love a good like
citrus scent also equally nice on men as
it isn't women that's true oh it's just
is lovely
really really really lovely fresh
summery fragrance I feel like I can't
really pick one but I'm gonna pick the
one that I chose to bring with me on
this trip which is German own blackberry
and BAE and I actually have a tiny me I
think I might finish this on this trip
which is sad really
yeah I look like Tebow looks like a fool
about yes it's sweet which is not
normally what I like but it's cuz it's
like black brewery and it has the bay oh
it's just really it's quite soapy but I
feel like it's why I believe yeah people
can actually smell it on you like
whenever my sister wears it I'm like but
also I feel like you need to mention
that you're gonna go buy another
fragrance oh gosh yeah there's not
summery I fell in love with the fresh
scent fake and apricots
oh my god it's amazing it's amazing but
it's not very summery ok the next
question is from Jana Jana
that's probably Jana probably on what is
your favorite BB cream and lily pebbles
what's the perfect bikini for the big
massive I love that you don't even like
inclusions like Anahata fried eggs and
we all know
Oh BB Creams I actually really am into
an EE as CC which is kind of ridiculous
and I know it's like the whole BB CC DD
whatever it is kind of silly but the
estee lauder revitalizing supreme CC
cream you like this as well I love that
it's beautiful it just gives like a real
warmth to the skin and a real chewiness
where is the enlightened ee cream is
like a new finds that i recently
purchased this comes in different shades
is it more recognized in which it's a
bit more of a tinted moisturizer it's
like a light medium dark I think it
comes in and it's got tiny bit more
coverage and like a load more
illumination you put it on and you're
like oh yeah look at my face you like
this I really like this CC cream I don't
really use it like a BB cream I use it
more as I can wish to Isaac yeah adds a
bit of like tan to your skin
Phoebe come I didn't bring one with me I
bought a foundation but I really liked
the Burberry what do we all do you I
like them both but duo's are one I think
you know with the pump yeah but for a
cheap one doctor yacht I still like
those ones oh yeah they get the water
keys yeah yeah forever September our
favorite thing about summer and Y

better firm a dance that would be on
mine I love that song the next question

my least favorite right now my dad is
obsessed with crooks

they've melted what they have a melt
they're like too tight on his big feet
oh dear Crocs

Oh max Costa from Dominica which was
your all-time favorite vacation my
all-time favorite that I can remember
cuz I had so many when I was younger
that I can't remember minded be a couple
years ago me and Mark went to the south
of Italy Osteen e-type way it was
incredible the food was good the weather
was great
I made friends with lena stray cats best
what were they ever I always say
Thailand and I loved the last time I
went to China I'm with rich I feel like
that's cheating so I always say that so
I think I'm gonna say this trip with me
Australia this is a great trip where are
you day 3 we haven't won tonight well I
think we'd it's cuz we're still slightly
jetlag sliced just eaten a massive
sandwich it was the best sandwich I've
ever had okay Sarah our favorite ice
cream flavor
a Moreno a morena a Medina and cherry
mmm I don't like cherry
I love oh my god it's so good when I was
like vanilla with like big cherries in
it off so good - I hate like Nutella
anything like hazelnut okay chocolatey
chop yeah I wouldn't piggy down as like
a Chuck because I don't know I don't
know chocolate but hey like it's like
lighter chocolate okay strawberry ice
cream is like wrong in the Box I just
never know Oh No I'll be so friendly
what are your favorite summer drinks
create your own and name it please corn
le just do it
mine would be some kind of lemonade of
like strawberry or raspberry and it you
know when they come is like pink making
lemonade and it'd be called like Anna's
lemonade surprise mine would be like a
war that crushed ice with watermelon and
peach I like watermelon Duff was no
peach at work
watermelon II like maybe what smelling a
mint and it would be good
pebbles punch this is no point in even
trying with you okay Barbara what's your
favorite summer food I love gazpacho
soup cold tomato see and I feel shocked
last calippo ice lollies oh my god I
just can't get enough of them and and
the bit at the end where it melts and
then you get to light it's like syrup
yeah it's like the most sweetest sickest
thing I love it naturally ask cup or
cone okay wait I think we should do this
after after three one two three Cup I
mean sometimes I'm hungry so I
appreciate the cone yeah but other times
it's messy I only like the cone when
it's like a 99 fleet from like an ice
cube and the cones you getting like
fancy ice be always like really like
biscuit even yeah it's a bit too much
like I it's just easier in a cup and
also I like to like mix my ice cream
till it melts and then let have it like
soup let me know if anyone else does
black I think lots of people tend to do
that naturally us what's the best song
screen you found for your face that
doesn't clog pores cause breakouts
there's so many
like I've done quite a few posts on this
because some creams nowadays are just
much less tackier and heavy feeling than
they used to be but the kills one is
good we both like the kills I was gonna
say I would normally link that down
below but we're in LA in LA I try to ask
young cream SPF there'll be something
there that's really good on the inside
yeah and also I'm really enjoying the
Estee Lauder day you wear one that's
like SPF 50 it's like cucumber yeah yeah
actually green it's a little bit greasy
probably good if you have a little
redness yeah it's a little bit green but
yeah I like that one a moment as I'm
using Hillary asks what do you do you
reach for say that you don't make heads
turn on public transport there's nothing
worse than holding on to the to the
handle on the tube hashtag not sponsored
by Mitchum but we're kind of crazy
Mitchum fans oh you think so
I like the stick which is like one big
thing that rolls up I don't love the
cream because it freaks me out with the
holes and I like this one but I find it
a bit too wet I have to stand there for
a little bit sometimes I kind of give it
that or like I dry them off yeah and but
the roll-on in shower fresh the shower
fresh scent is really fresh I thought
that sounds more like a perfume smell so
Mitchum the last question we knew it me
speaking that bigness it by the pool and
I did yeah kind of excited because of
the rooftop like pool that we've just
found with a shaded area which we're
gonna now edit is quite big beds like
you get in Ibiza we can just pretend
around Ibiza room anyway rambling now
