back to another beauty chat video news
Anna mm are actually in Anna's new place
which is so exciting I just got here and
it's amazing and this one we gonna be
doing a home edition we tweeted last
week saying send us your questions you
thought as we both kind of lime in the
process of movie and Anna's just moved
yeah we've talked about home stuff which
I love yeah the first question is from
bobbi and she says how would you
describe your individual style when it
comes to interior yeah I'm guessing I
think so I always say Scandinavian / New
York loft chic and we're parents you
know how you gonna decorate the flat
like New York loft Scandinavian chic and
that they look at me to like really you
see when I buy something they're like so
is that does that fit the vibe that's
what I'm going for
weather actually looks like that it
probably doesn't matter well we're quite
20 so I say yeah I completely agree with
both of those but I always like to add
comfort into everything I do because if
even if something looks great if it's
not comfortable like I can't do it so
yeah
Scandinavian with extra comfort a bit
more padding yeah okay scrt believe in
pink for baby girls and blue for baby
boys bedroom oh I like this question
personally if I was to ever have a child
I wouldn't want to find out the sex
because I'm like oh so I feel like if I
was to decorate a nursery it probably
quite neutral but afterwards even what
you know okay girl would you make
everything there in pink and a boy
everything blue I'm not sure maybe when
they were older and they want it like I
wanted a pink bedroom when I was younger
that depends what they want I feel like
I probably going what's that in the
great room yeah
I'd say no because my favorite colors
blue and I'm a girl and I was a tomboy
and I used to hate when people just
assumed with the girls love being a very
Oh type yeah I'd probably be that person
that dress is my baby girl in a blue
baby go just so people's that oh boy
thank you as well I used to have that
when I worked in the baby shows all the
way okay attach us what are your tips
for organizing things in a small bedroom
well I think I need a song because my
bedroom is the size of them it's much
smaller than my old bedroom so I'm
having to like find different ways to
store things we've got the most amazing
bed for my dreams and the bottom half of
it lifts up and there's so much storage
space underneath so I'm going to keep on
our shoes and stuff there and pop from
that I'm gonna try and hide everything
else the rest I feel like you're right
under bed storage is severely
underestimated I think you have to have
it but also if you can't fit wardrobe in
going for something practical and just
accept that wardrobes aren't really a
sexy piece of furniture they're just not
go for something that's quite high it's
got drawers rails like compartments and
you can just stuff as much as possible
in there yeah our bedroom hasn't really
got space even for a wardrobe because
the ceiling slanty so we're gonna have
to make some kind of like open wardrobe
thing I think you're clever with like
hanging space in-laws and kind of
customize it look at what you've got and
then work from there
that would be my chest okay Amy asked
what things would you say are an
essential to make a uni flat homely
without breaking the bank I feel like we
mentioned this in our university edition
muta tab which will linger yeah
month and didn't we say funky duvet
covers yeah and photos
traitors and also everyone used to get
that like kind of white fluffy rug from
Ikea cozy in your toes and you wake up
in the more you get cozy feels homey
yeah like uhm homes you like throws that
are not expensive and just put a nice
throw in your bed makes it feel a bit
cozier some good like pillows yes always
good like soft furnishings it's a great
way of updating your face and plants I
haven't got any no mean I'm really I
think greenery lectins oxygen in the
room what's the worst state your postman
has seen you in I thought in my worst
one was probably when I was and fake
tanning and do my hair so I came down in
like my old pajama shorts and fellow no
bra and I was like you know other nasty
he staged and I had my hair like clip
and curly and frizzy was like hey we
never see my place is with a bra on
no no oh it's always bra off me my face
when we did that isn't quite the place
relationship me everyday in various
different states the worst one is when I
know that they're coming by need a
shower so I'm like or do i do do i wake
the postman do I have a shower and the
times that I have a shower were the
doorbell goes and then you're like oh
god what do i do how do you dog was in
the shower
it was a boy in the old place probably
here I'm here one time I like open the
door and I had I've done I've quickly
grout the shower put towel around and
then done dressing out over the top but
because my hair was so wet he was like
oh my god so bad I was like a comedy
we're discussing this he was really nice
guy out you missing me is quite sweet
it's a pair that's have your personal
car my cons are half 8:00 in the morning
well you know I'm not off at half a mile
oh I think anyway
it's so late in the day how many shall I
just admitted that I am showers like
job-wise admitted that I'm not awake huh
faith
where's a good place to find
reasonably-priced good art prints and
illustrations come on answer this on me
I wouldn't know the answer to the Camden
Market oh wait yeah there are always
kind of new artists exciting they can't
just be like the things you see it
everywhere but I found some cool like
prints of the Beatles and Kate Martin
there's some cool places and they're
like three pounds and you can like bars
I get like Toofer Paulo okay we're
making your trip up there yeah I saw
some in all of the bonuses yeah just
pick one up for our kitchen that's like
a map of 1950s London which is kind of
cool
and that wasn't ridiculously expensive
because it came with the frame as well
oh that's good I'm like when it comes
with the frame I'm all-in
try think then your ass that we I say
like cool little markets and just like
odd little shops the bigger the place
although IKEA actually do princess I
canti good friends yeah it's almost like
pineapple one man - again said what
would you recommend for storing a
smaller makeup collection I had a really
good arts of this and it's gone guess it
wasn't Mooji then Mooji can get quite
expensive but you have a small
collection I introduced a friend of mine
just used a makeup bag reintroduces kind
of the Muji things actually I can't do
them as well yeah like two or three unit
just looks nice and this I've just
remembered my suggest there in the end
just have like so say you've got drawers
with clothing in just like dedicate the
top drawer or something and then you can
just split it up inside with Mooji stuff
like you don't have to have a dedicated
like this is where with my makeup going
just kind of incorporate into what
you've got ready thank you
thanks for the help Amy said if you can
have another blogger vlogger completely
decorate and furnish your house who
would it be
I've got two and I think we're gonna say
okay Kate from ghost pots
you've obviously obviously like I what's
up Aaron my Kate will paint do I need
where do I go for this like where would
you recommend the soap is like she's
incredibly
already read her blog and her website I
will link them below because she has
just got the best her interior's
category it's incredible
I'm sure you just second best I think
Chelsea wears would be great yeah
also Lisa Eldridge has amazing like
whenever you see pictures of her home in
like magazines and stuff it's always
incredible but yeah Chelsea wears yeah
that'd be amazing in this of us asked
where do you stand on faux flowers in
the home oh you know most the ones like
here a fake and I didn't actually
realize why it picked up faith graphs in
their before and was like what the hell
are you picking that before I was like
it greeted nice I feel like I previously
would have said no to this because it
would have reminded me of like quite an
old-fashioned teasing but they do
amazing fake flowers these days yeah I
feel like flowers I'm not so keen on
fake flowers but when it comes like
fakes like greenery
you know like green stuff like fine tell
the difference like your desks like
ivory or foot remembering to water
plants as well so all in exactly KTRS if
you have to paint your walls in one
lipstick shade what would it be lipstick
right no lipstick I'm I'm not sure about
red walls we had a few of them here when
we moved in and we like paint we rip
that wallpaper off okay so let's say
instead of the whole flat like one
statement warm Mac more March that's
always been a quite light orange is it
as a color yeah like an orangey red yes
I mean do you like a pink man or like a
Mac rebel like a deep kind of like
burgundy kind of berry colored wool yeah
got there in the end
I prefer white oh yeah are you for the
sheet minimalistic or the cozy type what
makes I'm a bit more minimalistic but
when you have it really minimal which we
have at the moment because we've been
have any furniture you realize actually
you want a bit of coziness yeah you need
a bit of like
livability fine it is Hillary size from
black and white she knows us
what's the staple color for your new
home we're doing a lot of green and
turquoise and blue like these little
seats that we're sitting on right now I
think it's a nice neutral color that
looks good in like every season I it's
really in in the moment so every way
that you go there's something that's
mini or blue or turquoise or teal that
you can pick up so our whole flat is
white and then we have like a blue
painting so I thought everything is
quite cold already so we've gone for
like warmer shades I'm thinking like a
bit of orange here and there just kind
of warm up a bit I haven't got a lot of
white blue already in there okay last
one from Zoe where is your favorite
place to shop for home we're expensive
and affordable so let me write blog post
on this oh my god I could like make a
whole video offensive when I'm wet down
like walking into a dream yes if I'm
thinking into your perfect home you're
like I want it all nah but unfortunately
it's not cheapest you know that what
IKEA is never underestimate IKEA I just
think it's great especially for basics
it's fab and also just online you can
get some really good deals like these
chairs that we've got for the kitchen my
front plates called cult Furniture
online
I've never heard but before googled
reviews and it turns out to be good so
it's kind of doing a bit of like
searching and working out where you can
get a good deal you're good at that I'm
a bit lazy a bit like IKEA West Elm
nothing
okay so those are all the questions I
hope you guys enjoyed this Home Edition
bTW shop we need to call you betta check
because it's so many other mystic color
oh yeah better a bit a little bit there
a little bit so I'll next we shall be on
