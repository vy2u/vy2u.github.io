got back from Florida yesterday morning
I had the kind of day to recover I was
pretty tired but I had to wash all my
clothes and pack and edit my vlog and
upload it which has gone up going up
tonight you would have already seen that
when you see this one if you liked it
and today I am going off on our beauty
chat live tour with Anna I'm so excited

I'm just waiting for my cab and then I'm
gonna go to Euston to meet up with Anna
I'm taking my Aspen all of London bag
with me I've been using this a lot for
traveling and it's so good it's a really
good size and its really light before
you put things in it and I like to load
mine full of laptops and notebooks so
this is turned out to be a very handy
bag
okay I'm not used to the station now
feeling a little bit queasy coz my cab
driver was very jaunty and it stunk up
smoke
so I'm just kind of sitting down taking
the travels in this bill because we have
to go on a virgin train and they are the
worst for motion sickness last time I
took one I felt really ill because it's
like a roller coaster they go so fast
we're just waiting for Chanukah Khloe
Khloe's coming with us for the first
night and then she's leaving us tomorrow
we're on our own for Dublin and Glasgow
which can help protect Elena make sure
all goes well tonight its way to Anna
and we're gonna get on the train we're
on the train I found Anna and she's
already eaten a porn crackers that was a
train out in fish really all time we're
on the train you a practice team so
we're on our way to Manchester Hammond's
this train journey back to Alice two
hours and we're gonna be there niggas be
cold but we've just supplied ourselves
with million snacks we
okay we're at the hotel in the lift we
have like half an hour maybe to get
ready and I have no makeup on so this is
gonna be interesting
I made you rushing to get ready I've
done my makeup I just put my lipstick
but look how I'm Fred of all this room
is staying at the Lowry where are we
Manchester and this room is huge and
amazing and so if you're dizzy the
bathroom is beautiful I've completely
messed up with all my stuff and over
here it is like a huge mirror and plug
feel straighteners little things that
make me happy
I've also spots the best of hot
chocolate which I'm definitely gonna
have when I get back tonight because
we're not really having dinner we
haven't got time to have dinner so what
would it be hungry and tired okay we're
ready
could we show you how I do my makeup
this time around cuz we didn't have time
I'm wearing a black whistles top and my
Topshop Jamie jeans and my boots are
from Jim and Anna's here now she's
already excited I know
yeah a bit nervous but really looking
forward to it
let's go no we've just come down to the
lobby and I think - they need there's
like a huge person like fans and
paparazzi it's the next like specialist
and Wang does like a throwing two of us
but easy chat on the side yeah I don't
know how much vlogging is gonna happen
tonight because I wouldn't have my
tremor on me and I'll be like talking to
you guys but hopefully I'll get a few
clips we're kind of trying to like talk
to you what we're gonna do we haven't
got a plan for this way to like chat to
people really yeah cabs finally here
we're ready to go I'll try and show you
that there's a my new van on the way now
the bus address book it's fancy refined
spacing hey what this is a cage one
here just finished both sessions and we
go get some food I'm seriously hungry I
haven't eaten anything since lunch I'm
so hungry but it was incredible I'll
debrief when I get back to the hotel but
it was seriously amazing ok I'm back I'm
already in my pajamas and I've taken off
my makeup and everything I probably look
ridiculous but that was amazing what a
great start the first session was so so
good I mean they were both great we were
taking questions from you guys
and we took some questions from Twitter
as well and then we just kind of mingled
around the store and chatted to as many
people as he could I think we got
everyone actually and that's why we
wanted to keep the sessions quite small
it was really nice to chat and talk
about beauty and talk about everything
random and we had such a nice time and
the team at spacing K in the Manchester
store loved it as well so what a great
start speech chat live I'm really
looking forward to tomorrow we're gonna
wake up really early and head over to
Dublin think we've got a bit of free
time in the afternoon so we'll either do
some work or have a little moocher and
Dublin and has never been before so I
think she's gonna want to take a look
around and then we've got two more
sessions tomorrow night in Dublin
I am absolutely soaked and feeling very
spaced out and jet-lagged right now but
hopefully I'll be better tomorrow
looking forward to seeing all you guys
then see you tomorrow
we're just leaving the hotel at
Manchester Airport and operations at
lobby for Anna yeah the door was open
the doors open and Anna's face just like
this and she was in the lift who that
guy Nick from The Apprentice like Alan
Sugar's little buddy Nick Nick Nick Nick
she's so excited
he's booked he copped it we had a nice
little visit to the German loan counter
I wanted some nice smelly things before
I get on a plane
and we're just sitting and I'm checking
the comments on my Disney vlog which are
all very lovely so thank you for that
and then when you get on a flight to
Dublin
today we're in Dublin and that was a
really horrendous flight all right you
guys know I'm terrified of flying and it
was a really small plane I felt like I
could feel every movement and just
didn't feel safe at all so I'll it
should I put my hood up and just kind of
like went into my shell and it was
really scary but it was only like 40
minutes long so that was fine I'm now in
our hotel and I think it's called the
Dean hotel I'll put the link below this
is a really cool hotel it's a bit like
the Ace Hotel my whole room has like
huge windows I feel like everyone
outside could see me there's this really
cool desk and a huge TV cute little
kitchen bed looks like this this is
really neat I think only open before
Christmas and bathroom it's a bit our
lights on I just put the key in but I
bought this really nice got really cool
like tiles and really cool things but
like an esop sink so excited to be here
we are starving there so we're gonna go
and get some lunch I'm just gonna
quickly dump my stuff there in Dublin
welcome happy to be here we're gonna go
find some food - great - Grafton Street
which i think where everything is it's
just right by the corner from our hotel
I just lets myself in the mirror I was
horrified so I'm trying to get over that
what's your back I was like you just
call me the space in case a bit of
browsing for tonight our faces are here
no expect that like that one of the
ladies in face
they recommended yama mori new
when we think about her walking mom and
she said it's much better so we're gonna
go there who'd be at the nudist lunch
some nice noodles
Florida I had like nothing like that so
I'm just heading back to the hotel and I
picked myself up a little roll on
Biofreeze because my back and neck is
really hurting me from last night so
I'll be rolling this over on my sore
spots and look for you or help they're
just gonna finish watching catfish which
I started to watch on the plane I've
know what's the film right but it was
just a TV show I didn't realize it was
started up in the film so I'm already
enjoying it so far I'm gonna carry on
we're just sittin on his room and chill
for a bit and then get ready for
tonight's beauty chat live whoo we had
loads of time to get ready and then
suddenly made half an hour I don't know
how that happened I guess it's cuz we
were watching catfish but I didn't even
get to finish the film and I just
quickly got ready like so quick so that
my makeup now and I got dressed I'm
wearing quite tight dress this evening
so I'm going to have to breathe in a lot
I don't know when you wear tight clothes
but it looks quite nice I want to be a
bit dressy tonight and I've got a bright
pink lip on this is the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick in Bachelorette and I'm gonna
walk over in my comfy hugs and change
into my heels when I get there because
it's a little bit of a walk but I think
I'm ready I'm just gonna pack up my bag
and then head to Anna's room and gotta
keep forgetting that we're doing Beauty
chat again tonight I need to get like
back in the mood I'm really excited but
it's so weird doing these things like
one after the other because normally you
just see like a one-off but doing like
two sessions in a row with a whole new
group of people is a really weird
experience but it's a very good
experience and I'm looking forward to
seeing how the crowd differs tonight
from last night okay we're on our way
and I put my hood up because we're like
misty weather and I feel like it's my
hair is getting frizzy this is probably
gonna flatten it though oh whatever
Anna's here excited - oh yeah we could
be the pitch pitty twins why are we not
planned no I went
my Disney hoodie I'm just never taking
off
that was so so good
especially a second session they would
cook both great but the second session
was so good it made me so excited I'm
doublin you were great thank you very
much did you have a nice evening
oh my good friend and lucky yeah that's
a good hug so thank you that was really
fun and I'm not tired as it was
yesterday so we're gonna head back to
hotel have some dinner and apparently
the restaurant on the top floor of Dean
hotel yeah that's really good and
there's a swing
yeah I'm hungry you hungry we found the
secret swings you can't really see us
but we're swinging you're going the edge
back in my room now and I'm looking
forward to taking my makeup off and get
into my pajamas and start doing some
work if I'm honest I'm gonna do my
emails and stuff but then I'm gonna have
a good night's sleep
and a bit of a lie-in smirk should be
nice but look how joy in the CV is I
mean we'll try and put it into scale
sorry for the mess oh my god that is
what I did when I was getting ready
earlier huge TV plus slightly
overwhelming it's like a bloody cinema
it's amazing so I will finish this rug
here for today but I'm gonna vlog in
tomorrow which is the last day of Arby's
chat live tour part 1 pop wait 1 see you
tomorrow morning
um well that was an interesting sleep
our hotel I think is known for being
quite loud it's on the same strip is all
like the big clubs so Anna's room was
really loud because it's the other side
of the hotel mine wasn't too bad so she
actually ended up coming to sleep in my
room and then she left pretty early this
morning she lights the way from early so
I'm quite tired
I didn't sleep but we went to bed like
one after we've done our emails and
stuff so I'm quite tired today
definitely want to have a sleep
on the plane we're gonna go get some
breakfast and then we're gonna film our
PC chat video sorry for my face by the
way
okay breakfast done now I need to get
ready for our beauty chat video and oh
my god this is the mess of my makeup I
showed you yesterday I need to tidy that
up as well but I'm gonna put it all on
my face high and do my hair okay I'm in
Anna's room and she set it all up we've
got little chairs here it's very formal
we're gonna put far from each other and
then the camera sets up here and it's
nice and bright in the room so we don't
need any sort of lights come on oh no I
need to go buy some knickers
do you want to get my dick is you gonna
buy knickers I just realized that that
clip was quite rounded and says you're
wondering why we're going to find NICUs
because I didn't bring it up with me I'm
terrible at packing apparently we're now
in M&amp;amp;S because I came back from the next
shopping and I just dropped my camera on
the floor so I really have it's not very
good if is making funny noises now and
that means it's broken but my case we're
gonna head to the airport and go to
class go boom sorry I completely forgot
to vlog we got on the plane and I fell
asleep I really needs to catch up to
them I really need to catch up so oh my
god I can't talk I really needed to
catch up on some sleep so that's what I
did
and then I woke up and we got a cab to
the hotel we're staying in a really nice
hotel in Glasgow
I can't run what's called maybe the blue
life or something like that so where we
picked up off the MA tickets the form
last time we were here it's beautiful
the bedroom is huge and then there's
like a hole so you can see into the
bathroom which is pretty cool and
there's a bath here and you can close
these if you want but I'm here alone so
I'll keep them open
I've just got ready for tonight's beach
chat live event I'm looking forward to
meeting everyone from Glasgow this is
what I'm wearing and this little crop
top is from cause I've shown it before
this loose white top is from Topshop
that I have years ago black jeans and
then I'm gonna wear my boots as well my
lipstick is Charlotte Tilbury red carpet
red but hey isn't really doing what I
wanted to do but I did just get it cut
so it's kind of looking okay and this
side has more coal on the side what is
that
we're going to come up but desperately
so I'm just gonna finish getting ready
and then I think me and Anna are gonna
head over there but early because I want
to do a little bit of shopping myself
and there's a few things I want to pick
up from space and Kay I want the by
Terry Umbra black star in the green
someone showed me that on their hand
last night and I thought wow that it's
amazing and I want the NARS audacious
lipstick in grace because another girl
was wearing that in the Manchester event
these are basically cool products that
are influenced by you guys and what else
that I want or NARS concealer cuz I've
run out okay we're at princess square
which is where it's basic k is I've
never been to this one even though we've
been to Glasgow apparently is very nice
people to see and I'm just kind of
looking there now this is a very fancy
Shopping Center I bought some bits they
had the NARS things and but they didn't
have they didn't have the green by Terri
cream shadow they only had the purple
one and so I got the powerful one but I
wanted to only get the green one one day
okay I'm back in like the stockroom and
probably shouldn't be vlogging here but
she's don't tell anyone
first sessions done it went really well
but Anna was really sick so she couldn't
come out and it got to the point where I
was like ready to go and she was like I
really can't stand up so I was like okay
I'm doing it by myself it's okay she
needs to like stay and feel better so I
did it for myself it was petrifying it's
like completely different thing when we
haven't got each other to bounce off and
I was really worried it was gonna be
boring for everyone but I think it went
okay
and the crowd is fine you come in the
crowd were really nice and thank you if
you were in that first session you were
very helpful so yeah as James you can
come out but you came out to me everyone
in the end had photos together so that
was nice and I think should be fine for
the second session she feels much better
now so thank you to those of you who are
in the Glasgow first session you were
very kind to me it was really scary
doing it by myself feeling better let's
do this round 2 so we finished party was
good part 2 you session 2 when
everyone's Anna made it out and she was
with me for the second one and it was
really nice really great to meet lots of
