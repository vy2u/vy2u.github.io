the date today the 25th of May and it's
quarter to 12:00 so I spent the morning
just sitting doing some works we've had
a bill that in here making the cupboard
I showed you guys last night when I
finished my last vlog about the awkward
space so I'll show you what we've done
we're going to have to paint it white
because it's made out of like green MDF
stuff so this is the cupboard and then
above it as some shelves for books and
folders three shelves but like for
amounts of space and then the cupboard
which just kind of flushed the wall I'm
going to put a little handle down there
it's got a big space for tripods and
lights and then space for my cameras and
techie equipment and stuff like that
it's perfect I'm so happy with it it
literally is such a good use of space
here and now we can get rid of this
thing he's also put up a shelf above our
coat rail and so he can put Rich's bags
and stuff up there
I think we've used space well which are
trying to make storage where there isn't
currently any so exciting news I think I
might end up deleting this part out of
the vlog if it doesn't happen but it's
quarter to twelve and I just got a phone
call from my mom saying I'm rushing over
to Carly's she started contractions bed
my brother-in-law is in town meeting
aces at nursery so we're trying to
figure out who's gonna pick up ASA from
school who's gonna take Carly to the
hospital but I'm pretty sure my mom is
taking her to the hospital now so I hope
she's not too much pain yet but exciting
stuff hopefully she'll have the baby
today she is desperate so for her sake I
hope she has it I'm gonna get dressed in
case I'm needed this is the thing when
there's like other kids around how to
leave them a nursery apparently she's
having contractions every three minutes
and I think she's only just got in the
car with my mom so I hope she doesn't
have a baby in my mom's car wouldn't say
my mom is the best driver all the
fastest driver and Carly's got about
half an hour drive to the hospital that
she goes to we've been waiting for ages
for the guy from Sky to come and fix our
dish because there's like a tree
interfering every time it's windy and
sky doesn't work so he's just arrived
and he's like I need to move the dish
it's gonna take it out worse so I'm like
okay I think Jojo can pick up ace from
nursery but I said I'd go and help all
the kids so as soon as he leaves I'm
gonna head over there
okay update on my sister I'm just doing
some work um they may
to the hospital my mom drops her off
apparently contractions are seven
minutes apart not three my sister Jojo
likes to exaggerate so she had
contractions that was seven minutes
apart they've made it to the hospital
been my brother and all was there
waiting for her and my mom's dropped
them off and come back home to look
after the ASA for the afternoon so she's
in hospital now in labor I guess I don't
know how long it's going to take but my
mom said she has been really brave and
working through the contractions
I'm panic eating spaghetti and ketchup
so I want to get to my sisters and this
is what we have in the flat and I'm so
hungry I've got loads of like work
things to do but I think I'm just gonna
take my laptop with me we've got a
family whatsapp groups so my
brother-in-law's keeping us updated on
that I've got the JoJo's house cuz I'm
too excited to be alone and everyone
seems to be here aces here hello funnies
here both hiding from the camera growing
up two honey's bedroom bring it so I
bought honey a doll's head for Christmas
or for her birthday
how did you give it a haircut oh pretty
pretty haircut oh you gave her hair like
me short the Radian JoJo's covers
because I'm like panic eat things I
don't know else to do I'm gonna do some
work so oh my god how you feeling I
really thought it was a girl like her
believe it's a boy cinema that was so
quick oh my god with you but he's
sitting I often say why sir laughington

I'd say that it was a girl hi

boy oh you poor the glitter on ah wah Oh
spread it around that's a nice color
that one
what's your favorite color isn't it yeah
spread spread spread you're really good
at it
and then what do you do when you fill it
all up
Wow
you see that's so flow I just found an
old photo of ASA when he was born and
the new baby we still don't know the
name of the new baby and they look
exactly the same which is so cute means
two little boys are gonna look alike
when they grow up I'm so happy that ASA
has a little brother because he's a
really like outdoorsy boyish boy and
he'll be good be good to have a brother
I think if he had a good sister just
like being off all the time and I'm just
editing video tomorrow while we're
waiting to find out if we were allowed
to go and see the baby and what to do a
nixies school he doesn't even know
anything's happening oh god baby girls
at your school every days I've worked I
missed today perfect JJ's doing coloring
in so as you do if you heart I mean this
is the wrong pen to use yeah you meant
to use ideal things but if you do half
an hour of coloring a day especially in
the evening before bed we went to sleep
really well maybe you're good at
coloring I would get better I'm going
outside the lines cuz these are kids
pens I'm just if you do half an hour but
it's meant to help you sleep that night

thinking how you let me know if it helps
