and it's about watch so much he's put 12
o'clock and I have been tanning all
morning tanning / editing at the same
time so it's been a bit of like naked
editing going on but I thought I'd show
you my tanning routine because this is
the first time this year I have tanned
because beautycon is on Saturday I
actually wasn't really I didn't didn't
me think about it who and then I saw
some people last night at the launch and
they were like oh yeah I'm just going to
buy an outfit few t-carr and I was like
huh I just thought I was gonna wear like
normal clothes and then I suddenly
thought actually I guess I do want to
look nice ish I thought I might wear
shorts oh maybe I'll just turn and get
it done now because I'm out from now
until Saturday so basically first thing
I did was exfoliated and for this I used
my epilator this sounds weird but
basically the epilate I have which is
the braun silk-épil 9 it's not scary
this is anyway it comes with another
head and this is like brush Mizpah like
the Clarisonic it doesn't spin with it
like vibrates and you can use that to
exfoliate so I did that around my knees
and around my wrists and elbows and
everywhere that needs exfoliating you
just kind of take the head off like
pressing that box then I exfoliated
everywhere I got rid of all the hair and
stuff then I clean make sure all my skin
was clean and have any product on it or
anything and for the tanning I used the
San Tropez this one which is that was a
cool self tan express this is actually
from last year so I really hope it
hasn't like gone off for anything but
you basically put it on and you can
leave on for however long you want like
an hour gives you like a light tan two
hours gives you a medium tan three hours
gives you a dark tan so I put it all
over and it dries quite quickly so you
can kind of I put on like shorts and a
t-shirt or shorts and a vest off but
like these kind of loose shorts and I
went and sat down and edited does a bit
like sticky can I have to sit on the
edge of my chair and I left on for put
on at 10:30 and a shower at 12 so like
an hour and a half so kind of medium tan
and then you have a shower and you wash
it off and you can kind of see it coming
off in the shower and then I dry myself
off and then I just moisturize and I
didn't really have any moisturizer
actually so I just use this vaseline
spray and go which is actually nice
because it's quite cooling I need to get
some proper moisturizer actually so that
is my tiny routine and then the tank
develops so I'm a little bit tanned but
it should kind of get more I don't want
to be super tired it's so what couldn't
people like Oh have you been away you're
like yeah I've been away chess and
replayed so didn't want it to be too tan
just inside take the edge off because
I'm gonna I don't know what I'm gonna
wear
I've got these shorts which I really
like but I'm not sure what top to wear
with them oh I've got this like combo
I might go shopping later with Keisha I
think I'm gonna meet her for a quick
bite of lunch and then I might look
around shops just to see what there is I
really need some black boots because I
know it sounds ridiculous but these are
like heels so I just don't wear them
when I'm gonna be standing all day or
walking and then I've got my brown Steve
Madden boots which I love for their
Brown and then these are just so
uncomfortable I thought they would break
in but they haven't they just haven't
got any comfier I don't wanna wear them
and I'm out all day everything else is
like ugh boots I just need some like
flat-ish black boots you can wear with
shorts or skirts so I might look for
some of those I bought this bag
yesterday actually from brandy melville
so I might wear that I like that I don't
know we were trialing up but now and see
what works but that is the plan then
tonight me in which I go into the
Regent's Park open air theatre which I'm
so excited about I can't remember if
I've been before or not my mom goes all
the time and loves it but it's an
open-air theatre it's beautiful I'm
really looking forward to it and we're
gonna see pizza pan which I think it's a
plane not a musical but I'm sure it will
be really magical and yeah I'm really
excited for that and it's sunny so it'll
be nice right because it's such a
summery day so I put on my German own
blackberry Bay which is such a summery
scent and I want like proper proper dewy
makeup that is my aim today I'm gonna
pop you guys there and I think for my
base I'm gonna use that I'm gonna use
this Clinique Moisture Surge face spray
and then I don't know I'm gonna go Joey
let's see I don't know he's okay Estee
Lauder CC cream Charlotte Tilbury
Foundation this nude your blush which is
beautiful
it's very orange least bit orange on me
and misty rock on my eyes it's kind of
the makeup I wanted not really that fast
today a trees do my hair now when I do
my hair I usually just sit here on the
floor my straighteners a balance in
there and I'm watching YouTube videos
and this is what I do every morning I've
straightened my hair isn't it weird but
I think I'm actually gonna wear it up
because it's kind of a hot day it's a
bit greasy I need to wash it tomorrow
before beautycon so yeah I'm gonna leave
it up I'm just picking he show up
because she's gonna come to the shops
for me to try and find an outfit and try
and find some boots and I'm gonna get
some lunch together cuz I'm so hungry
it's like 2 o'clock and I'm starving
I went Leon I think we're gonna get Leon
Leon chips
I know people's a nice country as I did
like meatball lunchbox and fries
lovely I got the goji berry juice which
is my favorite juice Millian
he's like I'm buggered and if anyone
remembers on Monday he's got measles too
today with her wet hair looks like a
beach babe in a glass of water
me onlyonly they're the best
we're at the motor design stand and I'm
trying to convince t-shirts by more the
same beach bags my favourite polish you
see your thumb it's it's
they should buy it just buying it and
she's buying a top coat we're trying
this weird one-piece clock thing just to
see I just want to see if I can wear
something like this top shop is full of
clothes for girls who are 10 years
younger they are disappointed nothing
works man it's all like really sure and
the small and not people with penis
I like the men's clothes I like that
just talking to myself turn around
Keisha wasn't there
it's nice so you can dress like a girl
he's 10 years younger like these like
and that's the skirt it's not Charles's
oh I'm just gonna look crap Abby's gonna
take care trying on these black boots
but I'm a six and a half
they don't do half sizes it's very
annoying just when strands and boots but
I have this annoying problem are over
six and a half and then in half sizes in
the UK anymore they used to when I was
teenager it's a service to bake and
succeeds you small and its really
annoying in America that you have sizes
I think
I didn't find any boots I didn't find
anything to wear I'm making keys try
this because she's a chocoholic she was
like sweet and I said this is like a
healthy version so serious thing I think
what I think oh it stinks do you not
like banana yes I like banana go on try
it
it's not gonna taste like fridge or ever
crap you know when you drink know why
after taste which is disgusting me to
strive for this is not my selling milk
it's not my kind of thing see they were
rich like sir you're rich is healthy

just not a fan of it I like Taylor Swift

one I don't like it it just I think it's
so boring and I've not enough syllables
in that chorus and I think she's just
put a lot of celebrities in the video
because she knows it's not the best song
it's a bit boring as my opinion but it's
on the a list of all the radio stations

I've never been to the Regent's Park
open air theater first of all the
setting you're literally surrounded by
trees and birds and nature and it's
completely in the middle of like the
busy part of readers park like it's
amazing the setting is incredible with
like bars and places to sit the actual
play itself so as Peter Pan but they
really incorporated like the original
story of Peter Pan was all like to do at
the war and it was really actually quite
sad especially towards the end really
sad you can start going that way for me
it was just amazing it I thought it was
really funny at times they managed to
make it sad and funny at the same time
and the way they used like the props the
way they did the crocodile and the way
they did Tinkerbell was just so clever I
really really enjoyed it to do that yeah
really I want to go back want to go
watch hook now oh yeah I wanna go home
watch okay but I will not like become a
regular like my mum always goes to the
open-air theatre when there's a new show

I really loved it it was so romantic I
mean Richard sitting there having
champagne I was like this is like the
best date I've ever been on

recommend it you're welcome you him do
it
