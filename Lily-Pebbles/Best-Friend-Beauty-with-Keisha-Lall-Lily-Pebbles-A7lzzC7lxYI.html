would spend a little bit of time with my
friend Keisha you've probably seen her
in a couple of videos before I will link
them below all the videos she's been in
she's a model I've known her my whole
life since I was 4 and she's normally
traveling around the world he's in New
York or Jamaica she's been in India
recently so she's back in London I
thought I would grab her for a quick
video so not really sure what we're
going to do spit spontaneous but I think
we're going to have a peek through her
makeup bag and talk through her skincare
routine because her skin is amazing and
just chat a bit about what it's like to
be a model behind the scenes so let's
get started
you
I'm going to talk to you about my
morning and nighttime routine you can
probably see there's a lot of deklay or
products mainly because my mom has been
a facialist for things before I was born
and she just been using this product so
that kind of like ingrained in me this
is a warning face wash just feels really
like fresh clean afterwards the water or
something makes my skin feel a bit like
dry and cracki and hard and so for that
that I use the Hydra floral moisturizer
which is very nice only like a small bit
and I've quite oily t-zone anyway with
like wiping away but this is fine so
that's the morning before shower after
shower whatever either one
then evening I always cleanse and tone
so makeup even sometimes when I come
back from a shoot I just like can't
breathe just a little bit clubs I need
to just take my makeup off and so you
just kind of put it on to put this on to
a dry face and then you wet cotton buds
cotton pads and then just take it all
off it's horrible you can see like the
black that inner fastest me and then you
use on a dry pads there toner which is
very nice and refreshing because it's
night I like to put this oil repair
cream on and also helps of broken veins
which I think I've been getting this is
nice sometimes I feel like it might be a
bit gloopy like later in the morning if
I put too much so I need to get the
right consistency but it's just like a
tiny bit on this finger and then that's
what I do
so yeah that's my skincare routine
though this is my makeup bag which I've
always travel with and these are kind of
the essentials I always have a match
I'm back Italy's first shop and then if
does not make up the mall just beauty
the cordially spritzer you suggested
this low so it was very good
very fresh I came off the plane one time
and I have to go straight to a casting
so the long looks like as well as like
fish fish fish magic hand gel has you
got to keep those hands clean traveling
on the tube and everything and then just
some hand cream which I haven't really
used too much them over from its looks
tan lucky tie down and then always Lucas
poor boy we like it it's actually
running out I know I can find it they
bring it in still they fill this in
boots now I do love this Tom Ford it's a
bit sticky and like you know that gust
of wind comes me it's just all over your
mouth but it's okay I like it kind of
just with no makeup which is kind of
from face I'm not really a red lipstick
person but I had a casting to go to and
the reference was like more rigid and
done type Rihanna style this Bare
Minerals i like very minimal was better
reinvented the name so when i go out
just to kind of I don't know like a
daily face I always do my brows I like
Kevin and Don this is a L'Oreal super
liner and just use this clear moistened
clear mascara as I imagine this mac NC
13 I think it's my color especially if
I'm getting a bit tanned or pale I think
it just suits me either way it's
lightening then if I want to be a bit
more special I'll put some bronzer on
lil you suggested this palette
and I love it I've gotten so many
compliments from it as well because it
has a nice little highlight as well and
then just the Rouge pinkie cheeks so
that's really nice this is a blusher
brush which I've been using probably
since I was 1516
she's never washed it I literally
haven't cleaned it it's probably
disgusting
maybe I just throw the brush wink at new
ones I don't advise it though of
cleaning my brushes so daunting and then
I'll probably do some contouring I think
with this Rimmel visit smoked oyster
powder blush and then if I'm getting
crazy let's go with the Maybelline Color
tattoo you again suggested this to me
and then I have actually started to do a
liner and then smudge under the eye
which worked one time this is the NARS
pencil tool tail and then dudes I think
that's about it just some coal in the
eye or on the eye this is Rimmel um and
I like to smudge it with the tip of this
boudoir one I don't we can't find this
Buchwald again but that is a really nice
fun tip to like smash it up
so today I've actually been told that I
have a casting to go to and it doesn't
always happen but the reference is
Jourdan Dunn / Rihanna and so I'm going
to try and pretty create my own take on
Jourdan Dunn and Rihanna I'm thinking of
wearing my Jordans finally I get to wear
them with a kind of long skirt with a
bit of a slip going on and a crop top
and I'm gonna accessorize it with the
baseball hat sunglasses and truly bits
mmm seeing as I have red lips which is
very cool by courier burn I'm going to
copy them with red lips
I hope you enjoyed going through my
makeup bag seeing my skincare routine
and soon McGrady forecasting so thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
