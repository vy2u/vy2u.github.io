lovely New Year for today's video I'm
gonna be talking through my 2014
favorites and I mentioned on Twitter and
in my vlog that I wasn't sure if I was
gonna do all my favorites in one or go
through like a hall of famer thing I am
gonna do a hall of fame but add in a few
extra products here and there unlike my
2013 favorites I feel like last year I
discovered so many new products I did
like a two-part video this year I think
I'd really figured out what my favorite
products are I haven't been using as
many so it was quite easy to narrow down
my favorite products so I'm going to go
through category by category like
foundation concealer bronzer and talk
you through my all-time 2014 at
favorites favorite foundation I've
picked to a summer one and a winter one
for summer it has to be the Charlotte
Tilbury light wonder this was such an
amazing discovery this year it's so easy
to apply with your hands it looks glowy
and fresh on the skin I used it all
summer absolutely love this I think
there's gonna be a lot of Charlotte
Tilbury in this video for the winter
foundation I'm going to pick Burberry
this is the fresh glow foundation and it
was in my December favorites video
beautiful easy to apply I use a brush to
apply this one again it has that glowy
finish really good coverage though and
I've been using this a lot these two
definitely my two favorite foundations
of the year so concealer it's gonna be
an obvious one a lot of these products
are going to be obvious because if you
guys watch my monthly favorites is
basically a big collection of that it
has to be the NARS creamy radiant
concealer I've gone through about five
or six of these this year seriously I
started with vanilla I'm now using
custard I probably have to go back to
vanilla but now I'm a bit more pale it's
just such an amazing concealer and never
looks cakey at all it's really easy to
apply a little doe foot applicator and
definitely went with the time favorite
concealer my favorite powder of the year
is going to be the Mac skin finish
natural in light plus this is one that
Anna recommended to me it's great I feel
like I don't need to use any other kind
of powder it's slightly yellowy
I only really use on my forehead and
down my nose but it's great for filming
it's just such an easy powder that you
can't really see it on the skin when
it's on for bronzer I think it's an
obvious one it has to be myself and Rory
solar powder bronzer I think I've gone
through two of these this one is nearly
finished
if literally half of it is falling out
it's such a great bronze it's got two
sides and matte side and a slightly
shimmery side it's not too dark it's not
too light it's great for contouring I
absolutely love this and I actually
prefer it to my nails looking you know
which is quite a shocker for my favorite
blusher I've picked the hourglass
ambient lighting blush I have two here
and one is mood exposure which looks
like this and the other one is diffused
heat which looks like this and I
absolutely love these blushes they're
really easy to apply they're not too
pigmented they're really glowy they're
kind of like a blush highlighter hybrid
I think they come in beautiful packaging
and they really add like a nice glow to
your cheeks for highlighter I'm gonna
pick the bomb mary-lou manizer this is
such an amazing highlighter you really
only need a tiny amount right to the
tops of your cheekbones and I feel like
it really catches the light and I always
get major compliments when I wear this
it has a slight kind of champagne gold
finish to it it's really creamy and yet
really easy to apply I think you can
even use your fingers for this but I
tend to use a brush for my favorite
contour of the year it's gonna be no
surprise to you it's the Charlotte
Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow this is
probably my favorite purchase of the
year it's a little set that comes to the
contour and a highlight and I use this
pretty much every day the contour isn't
too heavy at all like a nice light brown
the highlight is beautiful it's very
similar to the mary lou manizer both
really creamy and yes something I use
daily for cream eyeshadows I chose the
Vice Harry ombre a black star
I have misty rock and brown perfection
and I love these they come in stick form
so they're really easy to apply and you
can blend out with your finger
misty rock is like a pink with silver
sparkles in it and it just catches the
light and looks absolutely beautiful the
lid a brand perfection is literally the
perfect Brown you just I could just wear
this alone blender out it's a really
easy Brown eyeshadows that both really
long-lasting and definitely worth the
price tag for eyeshadow palette it was
too hard to pick just one so I have two
here one that I discovered very early on
in the year is from NARS it's the
narcissist palette I just have used this
so much this year it's got so many
amazing shades in it some beautiful
panels and purples and pinks and browns
and I think this is probably my
favorites palette the nos have ever done
but I'll show the sizes are slightly too
small but the quality of the finish and
the colors are just perfect the other
palette I love is from Charlotte Tilbury
and it's her dulcis Pizza palette this
is great if you have brown eyes actually
I think it's great if you have green
eyes too because there's a lovely kind
of ready Brown in there I love all the
shades the glitter one you just press on
with your finger and it adds such a
beautiful like little shimmer to your
eye I find myself using this a lot and
it's very similar to Tom Ford cognac
sable but I think I actually prefer this
one for my favorite eye pencil of the
year I have more Charlotte Tilbury
products it's crazy how many are in this
video but her rockin Karl eyeliners are
so beautiful they're really creamy so I
find them really easy to apply they
don't drag the lid at all the cream skin
colored one is great for the inside of
your eye to brighten and widen your eye
I absolutely love and this with violet
as a gorgeous plum there's a nice Navy
the black one is great for the inside of
your eye if you find it's quite scratchy
to do that they're just I don't
completely obsessed these eyeliners and
I have five four I pan has to be the top
forward eye defining pen this is a
double-ended liquid eyeliner I only
really use the long side though this one
and I just find this is the
incredible black liquid line and it's
lasted me a really long time I know it's
super expensive but it's definitely
worth it because especially if you find
eyeliner quite hard to apply I find this
one really easy to use it's really
long-lasting and I use this one on a
weekly basis for mascara I have two
favorites a high-end and a drugstore the
first one is from Tarte and if they
gifted mascara I've spoken about a lot
the packaging is kind of funky in this
wooden packaging but this just gives
such gorgeous long feathery lashes I
really really like it and for drugstore
I've chosen one from Max Factor this is
their masterpiece transform they both
have very different brushes this one's
more of like a fiber brush and this
one's more of a plastic one but I find
that the Max Factor brush really grips
the lash as well and it's a great
drugstore mascara that I've really
enjoyed discovering this year well my
favorite brow product of the year again
I have one high end and one drugstore
for high-end is the Anastasia brow Wiz
this is the best discovery of the year I
was using hourglass at the beginning of
the year but once I tried this I really
went off the hourglass one there's a
brush on one end and a really thin
pencil on the other it's so soft you can
really draw in the little hairs and the
same enjoyed artery one it's a great
deep the only problem is this doesn't
come in as many shades but part on that
they're pretty much exactly the same for
my favorite lip balm of the year it's
completely rounded one you guys from
Germany will love this
it's iconic we pronounce it Kaufmann
kinder cream I think this has originally
meant for babies as nappy Queen there's
like a big one that's like a nappy cream
but this lip balm has saved my life this
year every time I get really bad dry
lips I put both this on this like a
thick white cream and it completely
sorts them out it's the most amazing lip
balm I've tried after my whole like
Maybelline incident I think that was the
beginning of the year or last year this
really helped my nips to recover and I
hope I don't run out of things on a
second yeah some of the send this type
here books so thank you if that was you
I love this and I'm going to ask my
German friend
to send me some more for lipgloss it's
gonna be the Tanya burr lip glosses I
absolutely love these they come in so
many shades she's just added a loads to
the range the applicator is the perfect
size
it's creamy not too sticky I think every
lipgloss has a slight stickiness to it
because it has to all eyes over to slip
off the lips but it's got a really
beautiful formula I feel like the
brighter and darker shades actually have
good pigmentation to them unlike some
and they're really affordable you can
get them in Superdrug or feel unique and
I'm really impressed with these for
lipstick it's going to be the
Charlotte's Hill dramatic revolution
lipsticks this was such a great lords
this year and they're the most
long-lasting easy to end lipsticks easy
to apply in lipsticks that I've tried
this year the square bullet makes it
easy to apply the matte formula makes it
last and the shade range is really great
too I love lost cherry which is like a
bright pinky coral red carpet red which
is a dark red I'm wearing now sexy
sienna which is like a light coral and
love liberty which is probably my
favorite of them all it's a beautiful
dark berry full lip pencil it's going to
be the NARS and matte velvet pencils and
although these have driven me mad at
times because they are a little bit
drying they're really long-lasting and
the shade range is amazing I really love
red square and dragongirl they're a
little bit annoying because you have to
sharpen them and as I said they're a
little bit drawing but they still win
for me the formulas great and the color
range is really lovely now I wanted to
include these next product I didn't
really know where they'd fit so it made
a little category called lip lacquer and
in here I wants to include the Bourjois
Rouge Edition Velvets
I have pink paws and hot pepper and
these are just beautiful they go on
their bit like
journey lip lacquer formula they're
light and bouncy but then they set matte
and they last for a really long time I
also just love the shades the pink is so
striking and the red is beautiful
especially during the winter really
impressed with both of these especially
for the price my favorite perfume of the
year was quite hard to pick but I think
it has to be the German loan which sage
and sea salt this launched this year and
as you can see I almost use half of it I
use this throughout the whole summer and
even towards the winter as well it's
just a beautiful fresh seaside I can't
even explain it just does smell like the
seaside and the countryside it's so
fresh and probably my perfect perfume
really love this one my favorite
cleanser of the year has to be the
Bosque or na sods cleansing gel I've
already got a backup this because I
think this one's nearly finished that's
probably the only downside is that you
can't see inside the packaging but it's
a really very cleanser it's refreshing
in the morning and it's grainy evening
to you because it takes off all your
makeup it's like a gel the turns into a
bit of an oil and I'm just obsessed with
it as I said I have a backup because I'm
so nervous about coming to the end of it
my favorite skincare treatment has to be
the Sarah Chapman intense hydrating
booster this is number one out of her I
think she's got four serums this one is
great if you have dry or dehydrated skin
it really is a hydration booster you
only need a couple of drops I apply it
in the morning and in the evening I've
already gone through one of this and
I've repurchase it because I love it so
much and when I don't use it my skin
just feels really dry and tight without
it it's extremely hydrating and a
beautiful serum I talked about this in
my December favorites but for hair it's
gonna be the ocean cleansing conditioner
it's a green conditioner that also
cleanses and clarifies your hair it
leaves it feeling really clean and fresh
but also nourished and moisturized it's
perfect if you have dry kind of frizzy
hair like mine now I hope you guys are
impressed with this I managed to pick
one nail polish flavor of the year I
don't know how I did it but I kind of
just looked at my nail polish collection
and said yeah that was the one that blew
me away this year and it's by Essie of
course and it's Maximilian Strasser this
is just such a unique shade it's like a
bluey gray green and whenever I wear
what my nails people always compliment
me on it I wore it throughout the whole
summer I think you can wear it all year
round and I've kind of
now actually just looking at it but it's
a really beautiful shade that I'd
definitely recommend okay we've come to
the final category and that is tools
that I've got two favorite tools to
mention here one is the wet brush best
discovery of the year I think I
discovered at the end of 2013 but Carmon
have made it into my favorites or not I
never liked the tangle teezer I always
thought was a rubbish products didn't
get the height and then I tried the wet
brush which is slightly differing
because it has a handle it looks more
like a normal brush you wash your hair
when it's wet and this goes through
every tangle seriously even without a
detangling product is incredible and
they now have a travel version too
I also have my Bobbi Brown full coverage
face brush and this is great I do love
the Real Techniques buffing brush but
when I tried this I was fully converted
it's just such a nice soft it's got the
perfect amount of like density to it
it's great for buffing in foundation it
cleans really well and I think it was
definitely worth the investment okay so
those but all my 2014 favorites I really
hope you guys enjoyed seeing all of them
and hearing about why I love them so
much hopefully you've found a few kind
of treasures in there but I'd love to
know what your favorites are from the
years so if you want to comment down
below and let me know like two or three
of your all-time favorites from this
year I'd be really interested in hearing
so thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
