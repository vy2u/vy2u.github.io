really well before I start I just wanted
to say thank you so much to everyone who
came to mine and Ana's Naz Meetup it was
last night and I'm still buzzing from it
it was just the best thing ever
I've logged a bit so hopefully you guys
will see that on Thursday if you weren't
able to make it but hopefully we're
going to have another Meetup and
sometime in London at the end of the
month
so for today's video I'm gonna be
showing you my recent bikini and summer
clothes haul I have a couple of summer
holidays coming up I'm going to Israel
in August and France in September I also
had Malta last week and I needed some
stuff for that so I wanted to get my
summer clothes shopping in early before
I went in the sale I know that sounds
weird but I find it so hard to shop in
sales and I knew that once it all goes
on the rack I wasn't gonna find anything
so I did my summer shopping a little bit
earlier this year first of all let's
talk about bikinis because I find bikini
shopping the most stressful thing ever
and I think this is the first year ever
that I've actually successfully bought
some really nice bikinis I am in no way
in proportion so I hate it when Brian
sell bikinis as sets it just doesn't
make any sense to me I'm 12 on the
bottom and like 16 on top I've done this
years I've gone for brands that have
bikini tops in bra sizes so for me
that's a 34 double D or 32 E so I have
quite big boobs they're not ginormous
but they're definitely not small and my
boobs go like quite far out here sorry
TMI but so I can't really wear like
dainty triangle bikinis because when I
lie down they just splurge everywhere
and it's just really not very flattering
it's so hard to find bikinis that
flatter big boobs so I'm going to show
you some really good ones I found this
year and I'm really happy about these a
sauce is amazing for bikinis this is
what I've discovered they're bigger bust
range is really good because they sell
the bikini tops in bra sizes and you can
buy them like mix match different sizes
so this is the first one I got from ASOS
the bottoms look like this like tropical
print they look huge they're not huge
but I don't know I'm a twelve so the
bottoms look like this and then the top
looks like this it's gonna be very hard
to show you but I'm not gonna put it on
to show you so it's a halter neck which
I think flatters me the most because I
have quite broad shoulders so if I wear
straight straps like a bra it just
doesn't look very nice so hold the neck
that you can tie then the actual cop is
like it's got underwire so it's like a
bra and it clips at the back normally
that's quite hard because then you can't
change the size of this but because it's
bra size it fits perfectly and then what
I really like about this is it ties at
the front and then it has these two
straps that you can kind of tie down
your back it's really hard to explain
but it looks so nice on it looks really
kind of tropical and JLo like although I
definitely dived a low speaker but
that's a really nice on tomato sauce the
second one I got from a sauce is this
Aztec print and this one I took to Malta
with me and I was really happy with it
puffs from I did get kind of funny tan
lines but shouldn't be lying in the Sun
anyway so these are the bottoms nice
kind of like Aztec print and the top is
really nice and bit different again I
got it in like a bra size this one isn't
as padded it's kind of as you can see if
quite like fluffy but it's got the
underwire so it's got nice support it
clips up at the back it's also halter
neck but then it has this really nice
detail a bit like those River Island
tops that are going around at the moment
it's got this kind of detail here and
it's really pretty it's really
flattering it's got like two straps that
go around neck and I really like this
one it worked very well in Malta so I'm
looking forward to wearing this in my
summer holiday and August the next brand
i tried is sea folly which is definitely
a lot more expensive than a sauce sea
fall is a really nice brand especially
if you have bigger boobs i think if you
have slightly bigger boobs you want to
invest in good bikinis because they will
last you for years and I think it's
important to feel comfortable when
you're like on the beach by the pool
there's nothing more awkward than
feeling like your boobs gonna pop out of
your bikini anyway this is the bikini I
got from sea fully the bottoms look like
this so they're kind of stripy and kiss
aell alike and they rush at the sides at
the sides not size and I really like the
bottoms to this and then the top looks
like this this looks huge I don't know
why this one looks so big I hope it is a
16 top I'm kind of somewhere in between
a 14 and 16 but because I do have this
kind of like side bay I always like to
go a little bit bigger these ones have
padding like here so I'm gonna take that
out because I don't want any kind of
like push up going on my boobs look big
enough as it is this is a simple halter
neck it ties at the back with a really
nice big strap like this so it looks
really pretty with a big bow at the back
you can adjust the size because you can
tie it yourself it's really flattering
and I think stripes are very pretty and
bikinis so happy with this one as well
the next brand i tried is called boo
avenue i think thats
looks like this I've never been into boo
avenues shot before I went into one to
Westfield to get fitted and I was really
pleasantly surprised actually they
invited me in to have a 15 and you go
into the change room it's always but
awkward these kind of things but they
did not make it awkward at all the
change rooms are really switched and
nice and they have like all different
light settings for daytime Beach
evenings so depending on whether you're
trying on underwear bikinis you can
change the light setting they have like
a special like concierge buttons you
want to call the person to come and help
you anyway it was just a really pleasant
experience so I got a bikini from there
I actually ended up buying clothes I
bought bra and stuff as well it comes in
this nice box I'll show you the bikini I
got so it looks like this the bottoms on
goose knees filming when you have hay
fever is a nightmare
so the bottoms look like this they tie
at the sides and they have a really
pretty floral print and then the top is
also very nice again comes in like a bra
size which is really handy does up at
the back like this and then it just
looks like that and it's a halter neck
so I think that's a really pretty print
I had this nice kind of like frilly
detail here as well which I think that's
quite flattering so those are all my
bikinis and very happy with those and
finally for the first time I'm now 26
and I've just figured out how to buy
bikinis it's taking me a long time I've
just had enough of those dainty triangle
bikinis you have to have smaller boobs
and as much as I would love to wear this
bando ones they look terrible when you
have big boobs so very jealous of girls
that can wear those but I'm glad I found
some nice bikinis that I'm happy with so
now let's move on to the summer clothes
parts of this haul and first thing I
need to pick up some new pair of
flip-flops because I've had the same
flip-flops for about five years now I
always buy the same ones I don't really
like the Brazilian ones I can't I never
know how to pronounce it have our
honours or something like that
I find them quite uncomfortable I think
I'm in the minority there but the ones
that I find the most comfortable are
from Hollister I had a great pair for
years that I wanted to buy another one
they look like this they're 15 pounds
which isn't that bad I don't think they
last forever I wanted to get a white
pair but then I saw the mint blue and
you guys know I love mint blue I'm
literally have like blue nails and blue
cushions and everything's mint blue in
my life so I'm really happy with these I
wore them in Malta they're so comfy they
never ever rub
they're lightweight and waterproof I
think and you
I really love these so I think the
majority of this stuff is from Topshop I
went into Topshop went a bit wild I hang
out with my mom and she is a bigger
enabler than I am so she made me buy
everything I blame her
the first thing I bought with these
shorts they are white and they kind of
look lacy but they've got a little
pineapple prints on them in white and
then they have this nice little detail
the bottom and I really love these
they're probably not as high-waisted as
I would like that I don't in there
they're the most flattering shorts ever
but when you buy the pool just to put
them over a bikini I think they're
pretty and they will do the trick to
cover me up when I need it so I think
these are sub ones are probably only
we're on holiday not when I'm in London
but they will come in handy when I am on
holiday I also bought some denim shorts
weeks ago I really wanted to get some
old Levi's and I was gonna go to Camden
Market to do it but I just didn't find
the time so I ended up going to Topshop
and I tried on quite a few but these are
the only ones that really suited me
they're called the Hallie and I got them
in a size 12 so they're slightly high
waisted and then ripped which I like and
they're slightly folded up I like
because they're not too short at the
back they kind of cover your bum enough
but they're quite fitted at the waist
and they're just really flattering I
wore this in my motive log so you would
have seen them already and I've got
loads of use out of these already just
in London so I'm sure I'll wear them a
lot on holiday as well I like our denim
short so you can kind of make them look
City where if you wear like a t-shirt or
a shirt but you can also wear them on
holiday with like a bikini keeping on
the denim theme I also bought a denim
place e which you also would have seen
in my motovlog I love this it's bit
silly and I was arming and hiring
weather together because I think I look
really young in it but it's really good
when you're by the pool going to the
beach I think it's just kind of like
button-up it's easy to wear I think it's
quite flattering because the waistband
slightly high-waisted and it's got cute
little shorts and I just think it's
going to come in handy on holiday and
it's sort of thing I will put away at
the end of every summer and then I think
I'll get out next summer as well my
battery thing is flashing and making me
feel really panicky this next thing is
from Topshop and it's a kimono and it
was definitely an unnecessary purchase
it was too expensive and I didn't need
it but I tried it on and I kind of fell
in love and then my mom said it was
really nice as well and I thought would
be nice for that MTV Festival which I
did wear it too in the end although it
was quite warm it's basically the sheer
come
no and it's got a floral print and it's
quite long and it's just so nice and
light and floaty and airy and I really
like this kind of festival sheet look in
the summer and I think this looks
actually more expensive than it is
although I still think it was over price
but Topshop is very overpriced I just
really like this and I think it looks
cool with the denim shorts and I could
probably wear out with jeans as well
when it starts to get cooler in
September but so I'm happy I got this
even though it was a bit expensive
the last thing from Topshop is a skirt
and this is actually for my best
friend's was not for her wedding it's
like a pre wedding ceremony thing so you
have to be quite smart but not kind of
wedding small and I wanted to wear a
skirt and top so I got this skirt it has
an elasticated black waistband and then
it's white and it's kind of got these
pleats and it comes to just below the
knee it's the sort of ceremony we have
to kind of cover your shoulders and
knees so I thought this was really
suitable and it looks really flattering
on and kind of pretty in summary as well
but still kind of conservative and you
know not too leggy so I really like this
and to go with a skirt I bought this
crop top but it's not so cropped you
can't see my stomach it because the
skirts high-waisted they don't they kind
of overlap this is from River Island and
I absolutely love the print I've been
wearing this with jeans and shorts and I
think it looks really nice with the
skirt it looks like it looks like
bananas but it's not it's just kind of
yellow stripe pattern it's slightly
longer than your average crop top and
your t-shirt arms and I really like it
it's really kind of loose and airy for
the summer so you don't get too hot and
I think I'll be able to wear this in
Israel as well in the evenings and so
I'm very happy with this purchase as
well and I think they look really nice
together I also wanted to get a couple
of desktops as well because I'm a soft
person who gets very hot when I'm on
holiday I'm not good at keeping cool I
get very hot and sweaty and it all gets
a bit much so I wanted to get some vest
tops for when I just need my arms to be
free the first one I actually got from
All Saints which is a shop I never shop
in because it's just too expensive for
me but I saw they had a sale on and I
went everything was like 50% off so I
ended up getting one of these vest tops
because I think I will be able to wear
this all year round because in the
winter I can wear like a leather jacket
on top or a shirt and in the summer I
can wear it by itself it just feels like
this it's plain grey it's a really nice
soft material and it's quite long
it's hard to explain the shoulders are
kind of ruched a bit and I just think
it's really flattering shape I'm really
happy I got this but if you wanted a
cheaper alternative I also found some
nice best stops in H&amp;amp;M this one is a
nice mint blue one again it's a similar
sort of cut I think these this sort of
cut can be quite flattering sometimes
but I also think it's quite nice it's
got quite a low cotton side so you can
wear like a pretty bar underneath and
see through it oh it's quite long this
is just a really good one to wear of
denim shorts when you're by the pool I
think this is what I wore in Malta and
it's just really handy I gotta wear it
all around the house as well and these
are cheap from H&amp;amp;M so that's everything
from my bikini and summer clothes haul I
hope you enjoyed seeing everything below
