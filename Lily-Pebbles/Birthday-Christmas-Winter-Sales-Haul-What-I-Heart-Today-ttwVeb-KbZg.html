whole video and a Christmas haul video
I've had so many comments about it and I
wasn't going to do one because I
Jennifer Christmas I've said before we
do Secret Santa in my family so we'll
pick a name out of a hat and we have a
30 pound budget to buy for that person
so I only have I mean actually did get a
stocking in the end and rich book mere
presence so I have a few things to show
you for Christmas so that's not really
enough for a video on its own but then I
have some stuff for my birthday so I
thought combine them and then I have
some stuff that I bought in the
christmas sales so I thought I'd funders
in this video as well so it's kind of a
massive haul of everything and please
don't think that I'm showing off a tool
I'm just doing this video because you
guys requested it and just kind of going
to show you what I got but i'm not
showing off and i don't think it's
excessive I mean it's going to see luck
a lot all put together but Christmas we
definitely didn't go all out this year
we bought very kind of small nice
presents so I'm going to start my
birthday because that was at the
beginning of december and I've got some
really nice stuff this year I don't
really ever get kind of beauty stuff
because I think my friends and family
think I've either got everything or I'm
quite picky so it's quite hard to buy
beauty stuff for me so they normally
kind of get me some other bits and the
first thing was from my sister also how
about everything in here can't really
remember everything I try to look around
my bedroom and stuff for things but if
any of you guys are watching this
friends and family people and i haven't
mentioned your presence knocks I don't
like it but I probably just forgotten oh
so this is my sister and it's a scarf
from Topshop it's gray and white and its
knitted it's quite thin for a knitted
scarf but it's really long and it's got
kind of tassels at the end and and I
really like it actually like it needs a
scarf but a bit smarter because it's not
massive and chunky and its really soft
and that's from Topshop so I really like
that I liked all the presents I go
actually my friend Deb's who's the only
person who i really trust to buy me
clothes because
is just amazing at like styling and
actually I think I'm going to do a video
with her soon about fashion so watch out
for that one but she got me this JW
Anderson jump earthmiss what the design
is called and it's from Topshop and it's
a burgundy and white striped jumper and
I really like this you can wear it kind
of over shirts or on its own and it's
really nice like good quality material
debs is mom bought me the scarf which
I've worn in a video already i
absolutely love it it's really nice and
long and it's got this kind of blue and
brown print on it a bit of animal print
a bit of something else oh I actually
don't know where this is fun because
there wasn't a label on it so I can't
tell you where it's fun but I really
really like it my oldest sister Carly
bought me a subscription to Allure
magazine which I love I asked for this
and after Anna mentioned in our gift
guide I was like why am I not subscribed
to another magazine so I'm really
excited i only had one issue so far
which it's a December issue I think yeah
so i'm waiting for the january when to
come very excited i loved this one so
that was a really good present and
really glad i asked for them my friends
Keisha and Jenny bought me Keisha's been
living in New York so she bought me a
set from fresh I threw away the box but
came in a really nice box and in this
and I love fresh I've spoken about them
before in there was the soy face
cleanser um and the berry lip balm I've
got the original brown sugar 1 this is
the berry one was tinted and let me show
you it's like a nice kind of berry
plummy color which is just that my
streets and also a sugar lip polish
which I've already got but it's always
good to have another one these are
amazing lip scrubs Jeremih from jay's
maquillage what were present which was
so so sweet and she bought me this
really nice mug and its form it's by Bob
Ryan think that's his name and he's our
kind of it illustrator and it says
believe in people and it's nice kind of
lie look at orange illustration and
really cute and I'm so happy I have my
own little mug in the house and I
everyone knows whenever i have t it
always has to be in this mug i love is
like the perfect size i know that's
waiting say but i'm weird with mugs and
it's the perfect mug she also bought
made she's so generous she said
have to buy me a prison this is very
geeky but we both like to kick out by
things like this creating DSLR video
from snapshots to great shots so it's
just kind of like a how-to book or like
making videos and with a DSLR camera
which is what I do as you guys know that
was really nice of her she knows I'm
always asking her questions about making
videos and taking photos so it should
probably like here just read this
yourself the boys keeping them that's
really nice of that though my auntie
bought me this own diary which says
Paris portrait / city and it's got this
girl with balloons and a nice picture on
the back and it opens like this it's
2013 calendar and it's just really nice
it has like loads of nice photos of
Paris on one side and then a week on the
other side and I think that's really
nice to keep on my desk I really like
that actually I don't know where that's
from I'll try and find out from her and
put it in the bar below as you guys know
I've mentioned it before my mom and dad
bought me an iPad this is an ipad 3 I
was so excited about this my mom got her
friends pick up in America so it was
quite a bit cheaper than it is here I
don't think she wouldn't got otherwise
she worked quite a lot of money off for
buying in America and they got Lily
pebbles and kind of his so-called like
written on the back however Apple
normally do it and my friends JK never
bought me this kate spade case which
they knew i wanted and and they also got
some America so that's good everyone
kind of saved a little money by getting
wings for America but it's really nice
bright orange with pink inside and it
just says kate spade with a little gold
spade there and i really like this they
fit perfectly i might get one of those
cases as well to go on it just because
if I'm flying it's nice to have a little
stand but I've tried it and when you put
the magnetic case on this it does also
fit in here so that's perfect okay so I
think that's everything for birthday I'm
going to go on to Christmas now I did
get stuck in this year I told my mom not
to do stocking for me but I think she
can't help herself and i'm the youngest
so she's still like clinging onto it but
i did rich a stocking this year so
I think next year we're going to do each
other's stockings it makes a bit more
sense now I'm 25 and first thing I got
my stocking obviously dairy milk
chocolate probably this is still full I
think I just forgot about it but this
will be demolished very quickly i'm sure
and i love dairy milk chocolate and i
always get some chocolate in my stocking
and santa definitely went all out an HSN
this year i think there's a definite
definite theme there's a nice socks
which to name some like floral print
socks this kind of plain white or cream
scarf is just like a nice listed scarf
that's also from H&amp;amp;M and this jumper
which is make sure them and i really
like this it's kind of like an old
grandpa jumper but i like it it's cream
with like a red Christmasy print and
then buttons down the front it's really
thick and cozy and that's only thing for
my stocking there might have been some
other bits in it I can't really remember
but think that was the main stuff and
then proper Christmas presents may
enrich last minute sided to each other
kristef essence we weren't going to do
it but then because we doing secret
santa sometimes it's a bit like oh you
get one present so we said let's do
presents for each other anyway and I did
his sake and then push sanel aftershave
in there so that's kind of my present
for him and me and which went to
bicester village like the week before
Christmas and Vista village is like a
discounted village wolf discount stores
em in Oxford and we went into the white
company and I've been wanting some
really nice color cozy lounge ref ages
and he bought this for me and it's a
really nice grey wool cardigan it's got
two pockets like on the front and it's
just really Reese off on the white
company it was fifty percent off which
is so good because it would have been
very expensive otherwise it was a really
good deal and it's just so soft and cozy
and I love wearing this in the evenings
before i go to bed for my secret santa
present my brother and all picked me
ryan and he bought me he obviously I
think he I think my sister might have
helped him because I don't think he
would if he asked Peterson's own sorry
Ryan oh but this is really nice jumper
from H&amp;amp;M and with a really nice kind of
snowflake christmas eve print and its
really soft so that was like my main
Christmas present and i really like that
and
oh it's also got me with the jumper
because I knew about the jumper so I
think he wanted to get me something that
was something I didn't know about this
route this really nice all akili and
notepad which I really like he knows I
love stationery and this is just like a
lined notepad with the kind of classic
orla kiely print on the front which is
really nice Rich's mom also bought my
Christmas present which is very nice and
this was actually one of the best
presents i got this year definitely she
bought me a ken home home home I don't
know her surname a cookbook simple
Teicher clue me in which again to
thailand at the end of january and so
and I love Thai food so this is a really
nice cookbook and then to go along with
that she bought for me and rich a
voucher for cookery lessons watch me and
rich and rubbish like cooking we really
are and this is that the Atelier chef
place I think a face it is this a gift
voucher it comes like this and you can
put you can do like macaroons making or
burgers or there's all these simplistic
pic form you can see like baking or
normal cooking and it comes in this cute
little envelope and I'm really excited
last about the year and you can pick
which cookery course you want to do and
she gone from rich as well so you can do
it together so that was a very
thoughtful present and very much needed
as well me and rich a bit rubbish at
cooking I'm the youngest so that's my
excuse that dunno what his excuses so
now on the stuff that I bought in the
sale I wasn't planning on buying
anything in the sale I normally hate
sale shopping because everything is just
a mess and it's normally all the
leftover stuff that no one wanted a boy
when it was full price but I found a few
good things actually this year I didn't
even realize I was looking first thing
is this scarf from gap I got this from
the men's section it's just a red tartan
really soft scarf with a little kind of
tassels at the end and I really like
this just kind of wearing it like that
not wrapped around and it's very like
Paddington Bear no it's not Paddington
is that other bear Rupert the bear might
as we have reaper the bear I really like
this girl factually I also got the
candle and
ecology that I've already mentioned in
my candle videos if you want to see that
our length candle video below another
scarf I've got a bit scarf crazy I've
worn this in a video already this is
from oliver bonas which is a really nice
shot I I really like going into and this
is just like gray it's got a little
black birds on it and I like that it's
quite big but it's not kind of woolly so
I'll be able to wear it into the summer
as well which is nice and I really like
scoffs like this so I'm glad I got that
oh I don't remember how much any of
these things were but they must have
been quite heavily discounted because
they're really shopping sales in a sale
and this John but was fifty percent off
i bought it from Urban Outfitters it's
from the sparkle and fade line and it's
got its kind of dark grey speckled
sleeves and then lighter gray and it's
really long and so you can kind of wear
out leggings as well as really cozy and
I bought this for 20 pounds it was
originally 40 so it's fifty percent off
but there were loads in this install and
Urban Outfitters they just keep reducing
the price until everything's gone so I'd
go back and check this might be cheaper
now I know my sister's doing that and
this is really cozy I'm really glad I
got that and then some duty bits i
bought in a Cell I looked at all the
websites Paris for unique beauty base
space and K like all of them and I was a
bit disappointed specially spacing k
actually I couldn't find anything i
liked and everyone I seem to find stuff
but I looked at those like nothing good
maybe I just come for missed it and but
from Beauty bay mmm just remember where
a boy every do from yeah I got three
things of beauty babe i paid a pound
extra to get a deluxe sample with my
order because I thought that might be
interested so I got and I got joico
violet shampoo which is for people who
dye their hair blonde I do a bit but I
don't need purple because I don't really
want it to be bright blonde so I'm going
to probably give this to someone but
that's a really good sound poor thing to
get for like a pound I want the nude
miracle mask which I've heard quite a
lot about I know Kate from ghost parties
like this and i have used this once
already comes in like the classic nude
packaging this is only really expensive
I think there's twenty percent of new
products so I got a little bit with this
count on there and it's kind of like you
put on for five
minutes which is the quickest mask i own
and it's very thin but it made my skin
very soft I don't know haven't used it
enough to really be able to talk about
every news at once so I'm going to try
it out properly and then probably do a
review on my blog or it might end up in
a favorites video if I like it I also
got another mask you know i love my
masks and this is the first awt instant
oatmeal Mars which I've heard Fleur and
Ingrid I think talk about and I didn't
know you get it here i'll try to look
for it when i was in America but
couldn't find it it's one of those
muscle I've always wanted a child I can
never really find it it says new so
maybe it's new to the UK but this is
just a 10-minute quick mask and it
literally feels like putting porridge on
your face I've used it once and it's
really thick and like porridge e but
it's really calming and it says for
sensitive skin and it feels like it's
for sensitive skin it's very gentle and
it feels nice it's not gonna I don't
think it's going to be like a miracle
worker I think when my skin's could have
plane up and feels a bit saw then this
would be really good for it so I'm good
keep trying this out lady now how I get
on with it and then I also bought
something from steeler a couple of weeks
ago at Selfridges and I was I wanted to
buy a kitten eye shadow I was debating
over the kitten eye shadow or the pits &amp;amp;
Paint Pot and I went with the pain put
in the end and instantly regretted it
when I got home and can I've tried it
but more it's too kind of gritty for me
and and chunky and I just I didn't
really like it i was really annoyed that
spent like 13 pounds on it or whatever
is so I saw that stila was in the sale
at Beauty bay and the kitten eye shadow
was six pounds maybe or maybe eight
pounds so I picked up because I really
wanted it off the hole selfridges
shenanigans and it's just a single
eyeshadow and kitten is one of their
most famous shade so I'm sure you've all
seen it but it's kind of like a
champagne II peachy color and reading us
I don't need it I'm sure I've got other
eyeshadows in palak this color but
Ingrid and missglamorazzi always uses it
and it looks really nice on her so I
really want to try it and then the last
thing I got from feel unique is from
veto or fighter never know how
say that and it's the repairing serum
for damaged lengths and ends and from
weakened and damaged hair and I wrote on
Twitter last week kind of tips for split
ends because I've really spent and I
think ninety percent of people who
replied said cut them off they're
selling the solution but that's our
option if I cut off my splendor would be
that short maybe which is just
ridiculous than it would never work and
so I need to actually try and help them
I've really splendid it's just because I
share to my hair all the time oh they
actually look all right kind of today
but some days they just look so frizzy
and dry so only if you're always trying
this it's literally specifically the
damaged ends and it's a serum so I
haven't tried this yet I'm really
looking forward so giving it a go and
seen what it's like and that's
everything I think so not kind of loads
of Christmas stuff I got really nice
stuff my birthday and football few bits
from ourselves so I hope you liked
seeing all of that let me know in
comments below what your favorite
present that you received this year is I
love kind of hearing what people got and
I want to hear what the best thing you
got this year was so thanks for watching
and see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
