on the lovely birthday gifts I received
this year so I've never done a video
like this before and I don't want you
guys to think I'm showing off at all but
the reason I wanted to do one is because
this year I specifically asked my
friends and family not to buy me
anything I knew they wouldn't listen but
there really wasn't anything that I
needed or specifically wanted so what
actually happened was they ended up
having to be quite creative and think
outside the box
and I think I got the best presents this
year that I've ever got so I really
wanted to show you and I thought it
might be good as well if you have any
kind of last-minute Christmas shopping
you need to do you might find some ideas
in here so keep watching I'm just gonna
run through so the first thing I got was
from rich and it's this Kate Spade iPad
Mini case I bought myself an iPad Mini a
couple of weeks ago and really needed a
case for it I'd looked everywhere I
really didn't like the sleeves because I
feel like when you take the iPad out
it's a bit scary and you could drop it
and it's not very safe so I wanted one
like this which is more of a book it's
padded with this nice black and white
Apple print on both sides and then it
opens up like this like a book and it's
got this like magnetic bit it was easy
to take out if you want to it's got
spaces for where you need to charge I
might change the volume and I love this
I got it from Selfridges when they were
having the Kate Spade pop-up shop I
haven't really been able to find this
online but I'm going to keep looking and
if I can find it I'll put it in the
description bar below but I really love
this it's got little Kate Spade sign
here and yeah I'm really happy with this
so you gave this to me a couple weeks
before my birthday so I could use my
iPad Mini so on my birthday he just got
me little extra little treat which is
this a Nutella book and I actually put
this on my men's gift guide on my blog
but he didn't know so it's quite a funny
coincidence oh and it's 30 best recipes
using the teller and there's some really
amazing recipes in here I just love
Nutella I love hazelnuts so I'm going to
be eating a lot of Nutella this
Christmas the next present I got was
from Anna and her boyfriend Mark and
they actually gave the same presence of
rich on his birthday a few before but
kept it a surprise until my birthday the
night
December for the big reveal for what we
both got for our birthday and in the end
they gave us this little card inside for
tickets to see the Book of Mormon in
April with Anna and mark and me and rich
and I'm so excited I've been desperate
to see it I love going to the theatre
loved musicals and my mom has seen it
says amazing so we're all going to go
there and April together and I just love
that such an amazing present I literally
like squeals I was so excited so media
came around a few days before my
birthday and brought with her a
three-tiered red velvet cake from
hummingbird cafe that said happy
birthday Lily on top
I was literally blown away the most
amazing present the cake was huge it
lasted about six days I'd say with like
all my family coming around and eating
it it was amazing seriously like one
slice because it's three-tiered was just
gigantic and it was delicious
thank you to media for cake my friend
Gemma probably got me my favorite
present this year and it's something so
different but so it's so me and I can't
remember where she got it phone but I'll
find out and put the link below it's
this canvas frame and it has a giant L
on it and in the L it's made up of loads
of different words that she thinks kind
of represent me or remind her of me so
it says like friends taking pictures
laughing lemon drizzle cake family iPad
blogging pasta music makeup YouTube
there's like all these funny words I
love looking at it it makes me laugh so
much and I just think she chose like the
nicest color she just says gray and
white which is riding me and I'm gonna
hang this up in my office and I really
really like it and I just think that's
such a cool present and you can pick all
the different words and kind of do
whatever you want with it so that is an
amazing present I'm gonna hang that up
so my older sister Carly got me two
gifts the first one is from Urban
Outfitters and it's the chalkboard mug
and I think this is a really nice I hear
little mugs made up chalk board and they
comes with some chocolate top so you can
like write Lily's tea or whatever you
like on it and that's quite up my street
you know like things like that and then
the second gift she got meat was from I
think it's Gilley Hicks I used to call
it Ginny Hanks but then I'm sure someone
corrected me in the store which is kind
of part of Abercrombie and Hollister and
I don't really love uncommon Hollister
anymore but I really like this because
they do really good pajamas and she
bought me a new pair of pajama costumes
and they're nice and festive and red and
checked and really soft and I think
she's got them in like a large minion
because the sizes are really small
they're so soft that I can't wait to
wear these this winter I needed some new
pajamas because my dog keeps eating mine
my other sister Jojo got me it's such an
amazing present from the white company
and they're these really really cute
slippers they're kind of knitted with
really soft like faux fur inside they're
the softest things ever and they come in
all different sizes so she got me a six
which is my size they fit perfectly then
like this slippers that come in one size
and they never really fit I love this
I've been wearing of every evening to
keep my feet warm because my house gets
really cold and everyone needs zippers
during winter so these are really weak I
have recently become a bit obsessed with
cashmere it's so cold in the UK and
Kashmir it's the best way for keeping
warm because keeps you warm on your the
cold when you go inside don't get all
hot like you do with some kind of
materials so my grandma got me an
amazing puzzle she got me some cashmere
gloves for masters fences and they're
just plain black which is perfect for my
kind of style they'll go with everything
and they're so so soft I've been wearing
them maybe keeping my hands very warm
and then she obviously spoke to my mom
and they plan some kind of watch
together because my mom got me Foreman
jigsaw which is the shop haven't been in
for a very long time but she liked it
she got me a black cashmere scarf for my
mom and dad you know mom's always buys
presents this is so so nice it's not too
long it's not too short it's kind of
quite thin which I like because it makes
it look a bit more more kind of smart
and it goes really well with the coats
that I have and it's just feels so
amazing I love cashmere and so now I
have cashmere scarf and gloves and
because they're plain black I think
they'll last a really long time really
kind of classic my aunty bought me a few
nice bits the first things which I think
are really cute this coaster which says
L and a little keyring that says oil
they both look like Scrabble pieces and
to go with that she bought me it's like
collection on vintage postcards which I
think it's really cool and she knows me
quite well I'll kind of stick this on
the wall or make a little book out of
them I think they're really cute to you
so that's all the presents for my family
friends I've got a few vouchers as well
which I did ask for because I never
really know
to buy and I'm always looking to buy new
clothes so if ouch is a good thing but
there's one more thing that I actually
bought for myself as a birthday present
I know it's so naughty but I've been
saving for a long time and I actually
got this in the Black Friday sale on
Bloomingdale's from America so they
added on taxes and it made it bit more
expensive but I got kind of 20% discount
as well and this is a Rebecca Minkoff
bag very exciting
I've seen these circulating YouTube for
years but I was never really that into
the minimax I think they're called it's
a bit too busy for me then I saw Esther
day talk about her mini moto I think
it's called and I really liked it
they're quite hard to find in the UK
Selfridges do you recommend cuff but
they don't do many of the kind of
classic basic styles so I ended up
having to look on some websites in
America and I ended up getting this one
which is a bit like s-phase but it's
without the padding it's just plain
black leather and I love it I really
wanted a small bag I haven't got any
small bags or my bags are kind of quite
big tote bags so it's got a handle that
goes over the shoulder and then it looks
like this it's really tough leather
definitely lasting because it's quite
plain and basic I think it will last me
a long time as well has this little gold
detail with the class but you just undo
and then it's all like nice and magnetic
and it's got this print on the inside
and and it's got a front section it's
got like a magnetic clasp and then two
sections in there and I really like it
it's actually smaller than I thought it
would be but I like that because it
forces me to kind of not take so much
crap out with me when I walk around so
I've been using this for parties in the
evening but also during the day it's
really really versatile and I love it
and you know we will work hard so I
can't mitri ourselves on offer
I think it's allowed I love this so I'm
very happy with all my presence from
this year again I hope you didn't think
I was showing off but I think there's
some really good ideas in there and I'm
just so grateful we've got such amazing
stuff this year and I got some flowers
sent to me and I'm a very very lucky
girl
so I hope you guys are enjoying the
Christmasy period so far I'm feeling so
Christmassy we've done our tree and it's
just looking so nice and love it thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye hi today I'm
here with these two lovely
