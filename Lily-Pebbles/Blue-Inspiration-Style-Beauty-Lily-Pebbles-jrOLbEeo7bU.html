feel like i have taken inspiration from
people's videos but I can't for the life
of me remember who i know that tar tee
did a peach makeup video and I felt like
s stay a while back may have done a
video like this based around a color I'm
really sorry i can't remember who did
what but the reason i wanted to do this
video's because i went on a little
shopping spree last week you saw in my
vlog when i got the blood test done that
I went to Topshop and I bought loads of
stuff and I tweeted because for some
reason everything was blue I'm obviously
having a bit of a blue moment like a
blue and white moment so I thought why
not make a video all about my favorite
blue things a bit of a blue inspiration
video so let's start by talking about
nails and then I will move on to clothes
and then finish with a bit of makeup
I've always loved blue nails that's by
far my favorite color on nails I think
it's my favorite color in general blues
definitely my favorite color I'm just
kind of not sure I should be saying that
because me and my whole family are
Arsenal fans so you don't really want to
be saying your favorite colors blue but
it is especially on nails so I try to
pick three of my favorites I don't know
if these are my all time favorites or
just my current favorites but I've got
them here the one I'm wearing on my
nails now as you can see here is like a
royal bright blue a bit like nails inc
Baker Street but I think it's a bit
nicer and it's more affordable it's the
barry m gelly nail paint in damson and i
love this this sort of blue is obviously
very in at the moment because this is
what i was seen all over Topshop and
lots of other stores as well it's so
pretty and just really different and I
really like it I don't know why blue is
my favorite shade for nails because it's
the opposite to natural is literally you
would never have blue nails not like
Pink's or corals I don't know I've
always loved it so I really like that
shade I also really like the Revlon
Colorstay gel MV in full house I had a
manicure with this couple of weeks ago
just forwards France and it lasted
really well I love the color stage lmv
formula I think it's great and the top
coat is nice as well this is like a
really bright turquoise turquoise or
turquoise I always say it wrong I don't
know i think it's turquoise i don't know
but i really like this color i think
these two colors together a very nice as
well if you
want to do like one on your ring finger
I think that looks really nice together
I think I once did a nail post on my
blog where I did like ombre a blue so I
started dark and then she went lighter
and lighter and lighter and that looks
really cool final nail polish is from
Topshop and this is blue rinse this is
quite a new ones that should still be in
stores this is like a soft pastel blue
with a slight purpley lilac hint this is
probably my favorite type of blue I
really like it and the topshop nail
polishes are great they're just five
pounds and a really good quality okay so
now onto clouds as i said i went into
topshop I don't know why all of these
things are from Topshop I'm not even
that in Topshop anymore because I feel
like I don't sue half the stuff in there
but I did find some good stuff lost am i
winning so I just wanted to show you I
won't really try show you on camera
because you had to see so i'll insert
some cutaways of me wearing the clothes
first thing is a denim jacket and denim
jackets are back in who love the 90's I
was looking for the perfect denim
jackets and I think I've mentioned this
in a video already so I won't talk about
it for long but it's from Topshop the
Levi's ones are a bit too oversized for
me this is somewhere in the middle I did
get it in a size 14 though I'm normally
a 12 so I got it a bit bigger because I
like to wear it with like dainty dresses
and skirts big oversized them jacket or
with black jeans and I think it looks
really cool it's so comfy and a great
item to have in the summer the next
thing is a dress and I know that you
guys are going to say this is not
flattering on my body shape so just
don't say it because it first of all it
looks very different in real life than
it does on camera but also it's loose
and comfortable and I really like it and
I think it's nice to the summer so it's
just strappy sleeves with quite a low V
in the front and the back in it it just
hangs loose and it's slightly kind of
creepy material feeling and I think this
bright electric blue color is so nice
especially when you have a tan it's a
nice pop of color when you wear a lot of
black and wire for like blue is a great
color to add into your current wardrobe
and I love the relaxed feel of this
dress I feel like it's quite chic and
would be nice in a summer's evening I
think it'd be nice for a wedding too but
a lot of weddings I go seal quite casual
so it depends how smart is i also got
quite a few of the new topshop strappy
tops as well I got one in black and
white and blue and this is the blue one
it's quite similar to the dress but bit
brighter blue and it's made of this like
soft hanging material that's really nice
these are so flattering I think they're
slightly longer on the back than they
are on the front they're really nice to
wear the shorts andwith
jeans and denim shorts and I feel like
I'm going to get such good use out of
these tops I definitely wanna go back
because there's like a powdery blue one
I really wanted but they didn't have my
size they only had size 8 it had about a
hundred size eights which is just the
weirdest thing ever so yeah I really
really like these I don't normally like
getting my arms out I don't know why but
in the summer it's just so hot I can't
be wearing t-shirts so I love these
strappy tops and then the final clothing
item is a skirt and I never wear skirts
I don't know why they're just so girly
and I feel like when you sit down you're
worried about people seeing your
knickers and I'm much more of like a
jeans or shorts kind of person but I
really like this I thought it'd be good
for LA it's kind of scuba material which
is a bit funny but I absolutely love the
print it's like white with blue flowers
on it and the bottom is really
interesting as well because it kind of
goes in a slant with this like extra
white bit at the bottom and I think it's
really interesting and different you can
wear it quite high waisted and I like to
wear a white strappy top on top you can
tuck things in but I don't really think
it suits my body shape so I like to wear
like a strappy top on top of it and you
can just wear it with sandals as well
because it's quite a summary skirt you
don't have to wear it with heels I
really really like this is really
different for my wardrobe ok so now a
few makeup pieces you're probably
thinking what blue makeup are you going
to show us but there is some blue makeup
and I'm into it first thing is mascara
and blue mascara again is quite another
like 90s trend I used to wear blue hair
mascara which is just ridiculous but
they're a couple of brands that have
some good blue mascara zout I think long
calm and chanel have as well but spike
expensive and I feel like for something
like a blue mascara that you're not
going to wear all the time there's no
point spending a lot of money on it
saying that though one of these is quite
pricey it's the benefit they're real
mascara they've just bought out a load
of new shades they've also done that
with their eyeliners as well I'm not a
massive fan of the original they're real
mascara but I feel like when you're
doing a color it doesn't have to be the
best mascara ever because the way I wear
blue mascara is I apply my normal
mascara first black and then while it's
still wet I just do the tips in blue I
feel like when you do your whole lashes
blue it just looks a bit alien like so
that's how I like to do it and I've
enjoyed using both of these this one is
from Kiko this is the one I would
recommend because it is more affordable
the brush is a lot bigger though so it
can be a bit Messier let me take them
both out so I can compare cuz I think
they're slightly different blues yeah
the benefit one is a bit more like a
royal blue whereas the key code
bit more of a baby blue so i prefer the
color of the benefit one but i prefer
the price tag on the keycode one but i
think it's a bit of fun try it out
you'll either love it or you hate it you
can also just put it a little bit on the
bottom lashes which is just something a
bit different and I think it's really
fun blue eyeliner is also a thing I've
already spoken about this Kiko eyeshadow
stick so many times I love it number 31
it's an eyeshadow stick but i like to
use it as an eyeliner i like to wear
underneath my lashline just blend it out
you could also wear on top but i prefer
underneath and it's a gorgeous kind of
purply blue it looks so nice of brown
eyes I get so many compliments when I
wear it and again just something really
nice and different i also have a blue
liquid eyeliner I feel like quite a few
brands now do colored liquid eyeliners
this is the one that I have it's from
Aiko and I like this one because it's in
the shade marine and it's like a aqua
marine blue so it's not just navy which
is a bit similar to black it's not
bright blue that's a bit kind of crazy
it's just somewhere in between a second
inky blue and I think it's really
flattering the actual eyeliner is really
easy to use and really easy to apply the
only thing I would say those it does dry
out quite quickly it's already starting
to dry out a little bit which is a bit
annoying but I haven't really used it
for a while to be fair so I really like
the color and the application of this
one okay so that's everything from my
blue inspiration video i hope you liked
in it wasn't too random but let me know
if you're into the color blue whether
it's in your clothes your makeup on your
nails i'm really going through quite a
serious blue phase at the moment i'll
see you guys in my next video and thanks
so much for watching bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
