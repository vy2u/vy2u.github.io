so Monday I stayed at home and had a
full day at home working yesterday I was
out all day at meetings and today I'm
going to Paris I feel so so lucky me and
Anna are going to Paris with Chanel I
think it's gonna be the most amazing
trip but just going for like this
afternoon and tomorrow and then my
coming home tomorrow night we're gonna
go and have our makeup done and we're
going to go visit Coco Chanel's
apartment you're gonna have dinner at
the hotel and then tomorrow we're having
lunch at one of my favorite restaurants
in Paris cafe Marly I hope you guys
don't think I'm showing off but a lot of
you tweeted saying that you wanted me to
vlog my trip to Paris so I am doing that
for you guys and also I want to keep it
as a memory it'd be nice to watch back
I've just finished packing it's still
quite early in the morning but I'm gonna
head to the petrol station and meet up
with Anna
okay we're in the hotel we're in hotel
cost it's absolutely incredible walked
in and I've got like a mean like waiting
room in my own room and when you go
through here look how beautiful amazing
and bathroom and bathrobe we'll have a
beam in here
well it's huge like a ball this is so
nice I'm so excited we basically spent
the whole journey on New Year's off
talking about Coco Chanel and her
incredible stories because I think this
makes me a new lipstick range coming out
soon and each lipstick is that named
after all her friends and like people
that she loved I'm sure I will learn
more about it that's how you guys first
it was a really nice joking chatting and
I feel so lucky to be here it's really
amazing so I think we're just gonna dump
our stuff get kind of spruced up and
then we're gonna head out for a little
wander around and we're gonna get our
makeup done and then we're gonna go to
Coco Chanel's apartment which isn't it
to be amazing it's like it's not open to
the public you have to be invited but
everything's like camp the same as when
she was there so I'm really excited
about Anna's just popped into my room
and always comes to my room I feel like
that really sums up our relationship
she's always ready first but I quite
like it manager know always whoo-hoo
sometimes you can be pretty ordinary
yes so I'm trying really hard to be like
a better person be more like Anna so it
like we got to my hotel but like I'm
gonna unpack
whoever I go to home how the drama's are
like laid out by her bed check this out
check this out pajamas so we're gonna go
get some food because it's now like
quarter to two needs to be ready by half
three to head out and we haven't really
eaten so we've both got salad and chips
in our mind and I think I'm just gonna
go upstairs because the restaurant in
this hotel is amazing so yeah let's go
get some food and I'm wearing by the way
the lipstick is I was just talking about
they left the seminar room and I'm
wearing Adrienne which is really nice
nude
it was taking lots of photos in Coco
Chanel's apartment this is insane like
this hurtful dining room table is just a
bit mental
it was literate mentally this is the
chair we just sat in this chair this is
the actual chair from this photo hip hip
and I just recreated the poem you know
why misprint just it's so quiet I'll
give you the Grand Tour now
what the hell that was the most insane
thing I've ever done
I feel like I couldn't like when I got
there I just wanted to like listen and
explore so I don't know how much of our
actually filmed but we basically went to
Coco Chanel's apartment and it's in the
Chanel house
so above the apartment is Karl
Lagerfeld's office like he was up there
at the time and then above him a hundred
people that work for Chanel and we
walked up the staircase with the mirrors
I've seen in hundreds of photos of Coco
Chanel and books and films and then we
went had a little tour of the apartment
and it was quite different to how I
expected very eclectic and like still
luxurious but I think I was just
expecting something completely
monochrome but it was really interesting
and hearing the stories of how all the
little details everything that she
designed had a meaning if there was a
star on it had a meaning if it had a
lion it fit you know all to do with her
lover's and educate I feel like I can't
relay the stories that we were told they
were just so amazing I was just in awe
like listening to these stories and
having a look around so much history
there it was amazing and now we're back
at the hotel I'm just gonna like take
all in I want to sit and like have a
think about it and look through my
photos and then we're gonna have some
dinner work together downstairs it was a
really special day like something I feel
like I'm gonna remember forever
I really want a Chanel bag now like I
feel like I can justify it because of
the hearing the stories of like the
detail wow it's just I'm completely
blown away feeling happy right now okay
we go out for dinner I am wearing the
cocoa shade which I can't see from my
bedroom what shade is I think it's kind
of like an orange you read the lipsticks
are really really moisturizing and you
like them so far my favorite still
Adrian I'm back in my room after a
delicious dinner and I'm just gonna fall
asleep because I'm very tired but I've
had such an amazing day and tomorrow
will continue the fun in Paris
see you then morning guys so dinner last
night was really yummy we just ate
downstairs in the restaurant I had Tom
Yum seabass which is quite different for
me I'm pretty sure I swallowed a fish
bone I'm so paranoid about swallowing
bones I don't know why and I'm sure I
swallowed a little one I just hate that
feeling when you can like feel a little
bone Perrineau meant to eat bread it's
the best thing to do and it kind of
soaks it all up and pushes it down kind
of freaked me out but apart from that
was a really lovely meal
I'm just kind of do my makeup minute
some breakfast and this is the makeup I
bought with me I thought I'll show you
Charlotte Tilbury foundation urban decay
concealer oh my god new favorites
seriously I love that a couple of Mac
eye shadows and light airy shadows the
Burberry blush and my best with a couple
of lipstick options
this mini benefit roller lash mascara I
have a couple of these they're so cute
for travel powder bronzer oh my God look
at this this is a mini Chanel la beige
see if I can open it oh my gosh how cute
is that I don't know if you can see a
tiny is he gonna confess that so cute so
I'm just going to do a makeup and it's
like half a sum I get bit breakfast and
fruit salad something we're gonna meet
downstairs at 10:00
we're gonna go to Zara because on the
street where our hotel is there's the
Cesaro that's part like an edited Zara
like just a small collection of all
their best stuff which sounds amazing so
we're going to go and have a look there
look at this breakfast I filled this out
last night you know when you fill out a
thing to put on your door and I thought
be organized when you I wouldn't get up
in time so I got an orange juice that
looks like fresh orange juice little
pear shockula and a fresh peach salad on
the other sticks a good eye view faffing
all morning watching YouTube videos like
this time to go downstairs check out and
head to that Zara
today I am wearing the Edith shade which
is like a nice light pink
we did some serious damage in Zara
but I bought a two-piece that I'm not
sure if I'll ever wear it's like shorts
and I got long sleeve top really really
cool so why not follow me holiday mode
yes duh but I'm home now I'm already in
my pajamas I came home and went straight
onto my computer and now I need to
unpack I'm not sure if I'm gonna vlog
again I feel like I haven't really got
the opportunity tomorrow I'm out in town
at meetings all day and then Saturday
we're going back to Suffolk which is
where riches from for his mum's birthday
and I would vlog that but it's her
birthday it's a bit like personal I'm
not sure she's gonna want me to put a
camera in her face and then Sunday I'm
gonna be doing absolutely nothing so I
think I'm at the end the vlog here even
though I it's only been two days I swear
my whole week isn't just about going to
Paris I've done loads of other things
but just hasn't really been vlog about
so I think I'm gonna end the vlog here
unless I edit this and it's like five
minutes long and then I realize I need
to vlog another day but hopefully this
would be a good little Paris vlog for
you guys and I hope you've enjoyed it I
had such a nice time it was literally
the most amazing trip and I can't wait
to try all the lipsticks I'm definitely
gonna do a blog post on them and kind of
show you guys all my favourite shades so
look out for that it will be coming

you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
