actually the third time that I filmed
this video that's never happened to me
before but I am determined to get it up
on time no matter how much drilling is
going on or lack of Internet I think
this time is actually gonna work before
I get started I just want to talk about
the lipstick that I'm wearing because I
always get questions on what I'm wearing
whenever I can I'll try my best to link
everything below but today I'm wearing a
Mac fast play I did back to Mac will you
take six empty Mac products back and get
free lipstick in return and I love it
it's basically like a creamy version of
mer so it's really really nice so
today's video as you can see is going to
be a boots haul and I haven't had time
to just go into boots and browse and
shop for ages and it's one of my
favorite things to do
I love boots it's basically a huge drug
store here in the UK and I went to the
one in Westfield White City which is I
think one of the best ones it's huge and
I think this is actually done in two
trips there's quite a lot of stuff today
the skincare and makeup so I'll just
kind of grab what's in the bag and go
through it if you guys okay so let's
start with nails and I recently had a
huge clear out of my nail polish so
there's no excuse to buy new ones I'm
trying to see like an in/out system
because I've just got one small drawing
off my nail polish so I know that buying
these two means I should probably find
two to give to my friends and I will try
and do that first when I suppose that
that was from Essie and I think this is
part of their autumn winter 2015
collection it's called color binge I
like that name and it's like a really
bright Coralie red and I just thought
this looks really nice haven't really
got anything like it a lot of my other
ones and more they're either red or
they're orange and this is kind of
somewhere in between and then when I was
buying that I saw the SC's on a buy one
get one half price so I thought I'd have
a quick look and just see and I kept
picking this one up it's cocktail bling
and I've had this before but it's one of
those nail polishes those that went a
bit funky and I had to throw it away
like years ago and that's what I'm
wearing now on my nails I love it it's
like somewhere in between a lilac and a
grey grey could be quite hard to wear by
itself and I looks a bit like little
girly so this is somewhere between I
think it's really nice especially for
this time of year and you guys know I
love SC I also picked up a bit of
skincare there are a few brands in the
drugstore that I really do like and I
always like to try some cheap
alternatives for you guys one of the
brands I really like is super facialist
by una Brennan it always reminds me of
that film hitch
if they're goin it could like something
Brennaman and I always think of that
when I look at this this is her
probiotic micellar cleansing water I
always like to try cleansing waters to
try and find an alternative to Bioderma
which is still quite hard to find and
also just kind of get a bit bored of it
and I really like the packaging of this
one it comes it's like a little squirty
lid that's really easy to use squirt it
onto your cotton pads and it's quite
good at removing makeup I still think
I'd use an eye makeup remover for my
eyes but I like to use this either when
I'm feeling lazy in the evenings or most
mornings I like to use cleansing waters
to just have like a quick cleanse yeah I
really like this one I think I'm
definitely going to finish it up the
next thing I got is again by super
facialist by owner Brennan and this is
the anti blemish pore purifying clay
mask
I don't honest I'm not sure if I've
tried this before or not but I'm pretty
sure the packaging has changed which is
why I might got confused and picked it
up again but I try so much stuff it's
hard to remember and I feel like with
clay masks I'm not that fussy about
where the high-end or drugstore this one
to me was more like the origins clay
mask so although it feels great on the
skin and I feel like it really does like
draw out any impurities it's quite hard
to remove and I feel like I really have
to target my skin whereas the ESOP Parsi
seed mask is really gentle and easy to
remove so that's the difference I think
I would say it's worth trying if you
want to try clay mask me don't spend
loads of money it has got salicylic acid
in it and few other good ingredients I
just find it quite difficult to remove
on my skin look like a hickey because I
burnt myself and my straightness this
morning here I've never done that before
another drugstore skincare product that
I picked up is from boots botanics and
I'm not that fussy when it comes to
moisturizers I really don't really care
what brand its form I also feel like I
get most of my hydration for my serums
and oils so moisturizers just like a
last step but this one looks really good
so I picked it up it's the radiance balm
all bright and I liked it because it's
kind of pinky color so I feel like that
makes me feel like it's gonna be quite
radiant and this is quite similar so
that Oscar get up and glow I think it's
called it's not quite as pearly and
glowy but it's a really nice moisturizer
I've been using this everyday for a week
and I really like it I like how it's in
a small packaging it's not sticky it
sinks into the skin and yeah I'm
actually really surprised how much
alright
the last skincare thing I got is again
from boots botanics and it's the power
of plants hydrating eye cream I'm so
lazy when it comes to eye cream I just
it because they don't give like instant
results I get so bored of using them but
recently my like hooded eyes which are
just like genetic every one of my family
has them they're getting particularly
bad and I know that IKEA is not going to
really help that much with them but I
just feel like I should remember to pack
em kind of all the way around my eye so
I thought I'd try another one but you
know I don't think it's going to help
with the hooded eye situation this one's
a view nice day because it's creamy I
think I prefer that formula to the kind
of gel formulas the gel ones are nice
when you have puffy eyes because they're
quite refreshing but the cream ones I
really like for the evening okay so then
I picked up some makeup stuff and the
first thing I saw at the L'Oreal stand
is the true match foundation it's
changed packaging and I didn't realize
that it changed packaging so I kind of
looked at my shade actually the first
place I went didn't have it because I
think vanilla is quite a commonly-used
shade so the second place had it and I
picked one up I looked everywhere on the
counter for information on whether the
formula had changed or it just been
repackaged and I found it really
frustrating actually as a customer I
couldn't find out there was no one
working there at the stand at the time
and there was just no it said like new
L'Oreal true match foundation but it
didn't say what was new about it so for
the sake of you guys I emailed the PR to
find out but I did find it quite
frustrating that as just a normal
customer I couldn't find out that
information but just because you wanted
to know apparently this foundation has
new pigments for an even more radiant
complexion oils for a perfect blend and
improved moisture replenishment for
comfortable skin and you can really tell
the difference actually I loved this
foundation anyway but it was slightly
drying and cakey on me and this the oil
and the the kind of hydration moisture
boost that they put inside does make it
so much easier to blend and it feels way
more hydrating on my dehydrated skin I'm
wearing it today I really like it for
filming taking photos for nights out
this one has SPF 417 in it I can't
remember if the old one had SPF in it or
not I feel like it didn't but it's still
quite a low SPF which means that you can
still wear it in the evenings who uses
flash photography anyway these days I
really like this and there's loads of
shades
pick form with it which is great the new
packaging is really nice and like sleek
so I'm happy I picked that up and I was
a picked up another foundation I went to
the Smashbox band in Boots wasn't
expecting to find anything really but
there was like a newsstand and they had
I think like three new base products
maybe like a BB cream a CC cream and
this I picked this one up because it
looked the most interesting for my skin
it's the BB water SPF 30 foundation so I
was really sure what BB water meant
again I haven't like got a press release
or anything for this it says shake well
before using which I did not do that I
really like this though it comes in like
a little bottle really little bottle
actually it's cute with like a pipette
and I like to put a bit on the back of
my hand I've applied this both of my
hands and a brush and they're kind of
quite similar it's a very light
foundation I feel like Anna would really
like this Anna if you're watching I
think this is right up your street one
layer of this is like a really light
nice kind of BB cream finish but without
the kind of heavy creaminess of a BB
cream because it's like a water it kind
of just sinks into the skin it is very
light though I wouldn't even say it's
like to video it's just light but you
can let it dry and then put on another
layer and that gives like a light to
medium finish so it's definitely not
full coverage I can always tell because
of my like beauty spots I can see
sometimes if a foundation like I'm
wearing today kind of covers them quite
a lot and this one really didn't and
which is fine it's just more of like a
weekend light foundation look and it's
really nice and pleasant to apply so I
was actually quite impressed that's very
different are the foundations I have I
also wanted to pick up a nail
strengthener and I actually tweeted you
guys asking for your recommendations and
Sally Hansen tweeted me back not her
personally the brand because I said that
it's so overwhelming she has like so
many different nail strengthener and a
lot of them say they do the same thing I
was looking for one that would help with
flaking so apparently miracle cure from
Sally Hansen is the best one for that so
I'm giving that a go at the moment I've
been used it once it's kind of loved my
nail polish is lasting quite well
normally it would like flaked off quite
now so hopefully it's working I don't
know why my nails are so flaky at the
moment it might be from like stress or
from moving and opening lots of boxes
but the tips just flake and split in
or makes you feel gross so I'm gonna be
using this as often as I can
I also picked up this this is at the
checkout desk pay bit you know one of
those like last-minute like oh that
looks interesting it's from a brand with
town organic and it's the Tanner raised
ultimate exfoliated glove and the reason
I thought this is interesting because it
says it can be used to remove tan so if
you're like two three days on after
turning and you've got like patchy bits
you can use this to exfoliate and remove
the tan you can use to prepare your skin
and exfoliate before tanning and you can
also use it before hair removal so
before I appellate it's really good to
exfoliate just in case there's any um
what they could ingrown hairs or
anything like that they're like under
the skin so I thought that'd look quite
interesting I don't know how long this
lasts for before it gets gross I think
there's anyone in there I don't know but
it's what I think I fancy trying a
couple more things to go I always like
to try clear brow gels I still lately
I've found the perfect one I do like the
one from blink I would love to just make
my own because I swear I'm like an
expert in clear brow gel for me it's an
essential I use them every single day
even then it doesn't work I've just got
like those kind of eyebrows that don't
really stay in place but I wanted to try
this one from L'Oreal Paris
it's the brow artist plumper this is a
weird one because normally I find that
brow gels make my eyebrows crispy or too
wet this kind of has the opposite
problem I do like that it's got a small
brush and it's on a long one because
normally a small brush means a small
wand and a long wand means a huge brush
so that's a good combination by finally
there you don't get any product on it
like there's nothing unless I picked up
a dodgy one I feel like it's just not
quite wet enough when I'm applying it I
feel like nothing's really coming out it
kind of does hold my brows in place but
not for very long so I'm not really
impressed with that it feels like a bit
of waste of money and then the final
thing I got is really hard to find this
um I went to the maybelline stand and
I'm pretty sure these in you doesn't
have the name on the lipstick I think
it's called like hydrating mapped so the
idea is a range of matte lipsticks that
aren't drying they're actually really
hydrating on the lips and there was a
shade that I loved the look of good
something wine I can really deep wine
red but they didn't have any I didn't
have any in the jaws they didn't have
any anywhere so that's obviously the
most popular shade and then there were
two other Reds like a bright red and a
darker red so I picked up the dark
red which is 965 siren in scarlet and I
haven't tried this year as enough time
but it looks like a gorgeous like matte
red I haven't worn red lipstick in ages
but I'm really looking forward to trying
this hopefully I won't get an allergic
reaction because I think it was
Maybelline I had quite bad experience
with a couple years ago we'll see I
still kind of want to try it but this
looks really nice and I love the idea of
a hydrating matte lipstick so I think
that's everything apart from toothpaste
and cotton buds which really isn't that
interesting I hope you guys like seen
inside my shopping bag where I picked it
up on Sunday I'm pretty sure I'm doing a
tour of my skincare kind of bathroom
cabinet so I haven't filmed it yet but
hopefully that's happening so if you
want to come back on Sunday 9:30 a.m. UK
time that will be up and then on the
weekend we're getting on you poppies so
I'll definitely be vlogging that which
will be going up on Tuesday hope you
guys have a really great weekend and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
