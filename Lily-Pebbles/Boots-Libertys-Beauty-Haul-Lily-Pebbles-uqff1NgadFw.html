hall yeah I know I do feel guilty but
the evening before our meetup I had a
bit of time to spare so I popped in to
the Liberty Beauty Hall which by the way
if you haven't been to in London is one
of the nicest places to shop for Beauty
ever and I also went into boots so I did
a little bit of damage and I asked you
guys on Twitter if you wanted to see a
haul and you will said yes so here it is
I have a big bag here and I'm just gonna
go through the stuff it's actually not
that much I don't think for me but
there's some interesting stuff so I
thought I would show you I'm just gonna
grab the first thing I see and the first
thing is from the sanctuary spa and I've
talked about the clay mask before with
the thermal detox 5-minute mask and I
saw a ver little stand in Boots it's so
cool they have samples of pretty much
every product it's either a sachet like
this or a mini bottle and I think that's
so good of a brand because it's really
good for traveling and it's really good
if you want to try a product out first
before buying the full size so I picked
up the moisture boosting masks is their
ultimate moisture boost to revive
thirsty skin for a glowing finish I love
a bit of kind of moisture boosting
product I have quite dry dehydrated skin
so really looking forth trying this and
it's got quite a decent amount product
in it um how much has it got 15
milliliters it says I reckon as a few
uses in there if I can try and not lose
the sachet so looking forward to trying
out a new mask and if I like it I'll buy
the full size I also picked up from
models own this kind of four-way nail
buffer I'm obsessed with the Sephora
ones every time someone goes to America
it's normally a media I say please can
you bring one back for me because I
never get to go and they're so good
there's like a file side a buff of I
don't know what the other ones do shine
smooth they're so handy I find them much
easier to use the normal nail files so I
saw this one and I thought I would pick
it up just in case it's a Jeep so I'm
gonna give it a good go and let you guys
know if it's just as good as 4:01 than
great so much easier to get hold of
these are also really good to keep in
your handbag so I'm looking forward to
try now I've spoken about the yes to
range and the grapefruit face lights
before I really liked those they're
brightening and I saw these this is this
is the yes to blueberries says age
refresh cleansing facial
so these are more for cleansing it says
it's got Apple and lemon peel to cleanse
and moisturize all in one so I'm looking
forward to trying these I know face
wipes are the best things ever but I
still want to try some because if I find
nice ones then why not I'm probably more
likely to use these in the morning and I
wouldn't use these to take my makeup off
just this maybe like one step the first
step or yeah probably the first step of
my cleansing routine so I'll let you
guys know how I got on with these if I
like them they'll probably pop up in
another video now that we're getting
into the warmer summer months I wanted
to pick up a waterproof mascara I don't
usually wear waterproof mascara because
I don't have two normal mascaras last
fine on me they keep the curl
everything's fine but when I'm kind of
swimming near the beach sweaty then I
normally go for something waterproof so
the one I'm going to try is Max Factor
false lash effect waterproof I like Max
Factor mascaras they're really nice and
so I'm gonna give this a go and let you
guys know let me look at the brush I
haven't actually seen it well you know
something opens a bit too easily
suddenly panicking and this is the
tester oh gosh I hope not
how do I know anyway hopefully I don't
get conjunctivitis the brush looks
really nice and huge which I like a huge
brush so I will let you know how I get
on with that and hopefully I won't get
any kind of eye disease from using the
tester it doesn't say tester on it hmm
I also picked up a couple of eyeliners
I've recently really got back into black
liquid eyeliners I don't know why where
this came from but as you can see I'm
wearing a black liquid eyeliner now and
I've just really been enjoying doing a
flick I've been using the Tom Ford
eyeliner a lot it's amazing it's double
ended and it's really kind of firm and
so easy to use but it's very expensive
so I've been looking at alternatives
first one i picked up is from Stila and
it's to stay all night
I think it's Estee that always talks
about this and I love steel as a brand I
feel like I have tried this back in the
day Steve has been around forever my
mum's a big fan but I haven't tried it
recently so I thought I would pick it up
I think it was around 10 pounds and this
is the one I'm actually wearing today so
I have tried this I tried it this
morning I really like it it's very kind
of jet black but I find that the tip is
quite bendy so although it's good when
you're doing the main part of the eye
for right at the flick I find it quite
hard to get like
precise flick with the tomfool drum
because it's so firm and doesn't move
it's just like using a felt-tip pen but
as this one does move a little bit so
it's slightly hard to get such precise
flick but I do think it's very good
especially for the main part of the eye
so I'll definitely keep using this and I
really like it I also picked up from
Maybelline the lasting drama black shock
gel liner and I wanted to get this
because this looks like a dupe for the
new benefit they're real eyeliner which
I did a review of I will link it below
and it seems like I am the only blogger
who did it like it I don't know why we
didn't get on with it I found that the
formula really flaked off me I found it
really hard to apply wasn't a fan at all
but I do like gel eyeliner used to use
the Bobbi Brown one in a pot with a
brush so I wanted to try this it's a
similar thing it's got this like funny
nib I need to take this redspot and then
the product comes out and it looks
exactly the same so I will let you know
if I prefer this one if it's just this
rubbish this as a benefit one or
whatever I'll end up I probably end up
doing a review on my blog so look out
for that so then I went into Liberty
just to have a little bit of a mooch and
they actually had a sale on and
everything was just displayed so
beautifully and it's so nice in there
they have like a really cool section
with all like weird new quirky stuff so
I really enjoyed looking at last session
then that's where I found two of these
things the first one is called the
original goat milk brushed shampoo and
it looks like this it's really weird
they had a goat milk one and they had a
vegan one but this is the one that the
sales assistant said she prefers so I
got this one
was 16 pounds so it wasn't too cheap but
it wasn't too crazy it's basically a
solid brush cleaner so it looks like
this smells like lavender
I love lavender and you basically get it
get your brush wet and you swirl it
around them here and it cleans your
brush now I said to the girl I don't
understand because she knew this gets
all brown and muggy and dirty but she
said you can just rinse it under the tap
and then it goes back to being clean
again so really looking forward to
trying these I know Anna likes solid
brush cleaners I've never tried one
before I either use the Mac one for spot
cleaning or the dr. Bronner magic soap
for like a deep clean so I'm not sure
this is gives it like a deep cleaner
spot clean I'm gonna give it a go this
also will end up in a video or a blog
post I'm sure but the smell is really
nice
I like the idea that it's like goat milk
makes it sound like the brushes are
gonna be really soft when they're clean
I also picked up these which really
remind me of Pixie woo I feel like
they've been talking about these for
years and I had been watching Peru since
like the beginning so I saw these and I
was like yes I need to try them finally
they are the shadow shields and these
are eight pounds and how many do you get
in here I feel like it's not that many I
think eight pounds is probably quite
expensive I reckon these are a lot
cheaper in America but they're basically
genius idea you can use a tissue or
cotton wool but I really like the idea
of these there are little shields that
you peel off the back and you stick them
under your eye like that and it catches
any eyeshadow that might fall down so I
wouldn't use these all the time but if
I'm doing a really smoky eye or a
glittery shimmery eyes something where
the eyeshadows gonna fool down to my
cheek then I'd pop these here and they
stick up like that and they catch all
the shadow so clever because when you do
drop eyeshadow there it is a nightmare
to clear up you end up blending your
concealer and foundation in and you end
up just looking like you've got really
dark circles so these are really good
idea they just sit there they catch all
the eye shadow and you don't have to
hold something because if you do hold a
tissue you have to hold it and do this
but these were just stick so you have
both hands-free to blend and hold and do
whatever you want so they come in this
nice packet I would probably keep these
for special occasions a really cute
little packet the final product was in
the sales section this went from 24
pounds down to 16 down to 7 so I got a
pretty good deal I'd say it's from a
brand called der mink and this is a
brand especially for tattoos which I
thought was quite interesting because
you never really see kind of lists of
stuff in Beauty halls it's normally just
in the tattoo shops or they tell you to
use like bepanthen which is like nappy
cream my tattoos over the healing phase
now so I know that I can kind of use
anything it's fine I think when you
first get a tattoo just use what your
tattooist the cool tattoo is yeah use
what they recommend but now it's healed
like in kind of experiment with some
other stuff and this is basically a
tattoo protection cream with SPF 15 so
they had like a healing cream but this
is more an SPF so even when the tattoos
healed and the scab is gone I want to
protect it especially now it's summer
and it's sunny a lot and putting on
normal Sun cream or body moisturizer
might not be the best
thing for it this is like a SPF body
moisturizer specifically for tattoos is
that the tattoo protection cream der
mangas specially formulated for tattoo
daily protection non-sticky it's also
formulated without perfume or parabens
so really looking forward to trying this
if we've really good over the summer
comes in this cute little bottle I'll
probably keep it by my bed probably not
great for traveling maybe I'll do count
some when I go away but yeah that was
really interesting and what a bargain at
7 pounds down from 24 so that's
everything from my quick beauty haul I
hope you enjoyed seeing everything that
I picked up let me know if you guys have
tried any of these products on what you
think of them especially the Maybelline
eyeliner I'm very intrigued by this
I hope it's amazing that would be so
good if the cheaper version is actually
better than the expensive version I love
when that happens
so I'll see you guys on Thursday for my
weekly vlog and I hope you have a really
great week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
