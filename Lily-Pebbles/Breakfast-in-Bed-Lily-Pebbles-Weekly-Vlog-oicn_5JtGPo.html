only spoke to you yesterday
um it's the next day but technically is
the next vlog because it's the next week
so it feels weird vlogging before I've
even pop up my last vlog that goes up
tomorrow but anyway I thought I would
vlog today I'm actually home most of the
day um later on and I am going to get
laser and then I'm going out for dinner
with my friends tonight but I will tell
you more about that later
I need breakfast well so sorry about
this giant spot that's just appeared on
my head it's very annoying okay the
first thing I needs to do today is write
a to-do list for the day on my desk
these are new I think from collection
and they're like nude palettes there's a
gray one and there's two part of New
Deal's I think this one's more shimmery
and brown and golden this one's slightly
more kind of cool toned they're like The
Naked basics I mean these are go today
and maybe write posts than them if I
like them okay I better take some photos
and I actually don't need my studio
lights because of well it's amazing
sunshine it's just like bursting through
my window sometimes what I do when I
don't want to get anything on my
precious white cardboard thing I use
just blank piece of paper
I put parts in there and then we take a
photo of the Clarys lip oil that I'm
obsessed with fans do a blog post or a
few other things as well yeah see this
is why I use paper damnit it's just like
wasted all this product so annoying
the only fit is just write some posts
and stuff so I might leave a little bit
but then I'm gonna do my makeup and try
new makeup cause often what I do when I
will get thinner tonight but I haven't
really got any like important plans so
I'm going to try some new makeup out cuz
there's no risk if it looks terrible
doesn't matter and I share for this new
nose foundation to try which is there
all day luminous weightless foundation
either shaped PG which I don't think
will be the right shade for me but I'm
gonna try that out today and looking for
it's trying that now I'm gonna paint my
nails because models only have these new
nail polishes which are like liquid
metal I think and I'm gonna give them a
go and see what they look like oh I
think these chatline are sold out
Glasgow sold out within like an hour you
Scottish people and crazy like maybe
people don't go too close okay that up
but I don't know it's sold out within an
hour I'm so shocked to me I know
messaging each other and now it's one
o'clock and I think they're all pretty
much sold out now we've got two sessions
in each store a few people have said
they're sad we're not going to Edinburgh
Belfast a new car so I've seen a lot of
tweets from those faces so we will bear
that in mind if we do this again you
obviously couldn't go everywhere but oh
my god this is crazy today it's going
mad I just can't get any ain't done cuz
I'm just looking at all the tweets from
all of you guys I'm so excited also lets
people are coming on their birthday
that's really exciting I need to eat
something I don't know I think that I
think is anything in fridge I'm really
kind of willing to go out there so you
have to just rustle something up okay
for lunch I'm having celery and carrot
sticks and this is like a basil
mayonnaise a garlicky pesto sauce thing
I'm definitely still gonna be hungry
after this but this is what I'm gonna
have for now to keep me going and then
I'll find something else at like 4
o'clock we're going through my makeup
now we use a new nose foundation and I'm
going to use this eyeshadow palette from
collection which is also new give this a
go and as I said earlier I'm just going
to try lots of new makeup and then I
haven't told you I'm go after dinner
with friends for one of my knees
resolutions we as like a group of six of
us we all made a resolution together to
try a different cuisine every month we
love eating out I'm sure you guys know
by now from watching my blogs that I
love
eating out that's just our thing we
don't have parties we don't really go to
bars we eat out that is our way of
socializing and I love eating out I love
trying new places and new food so we've
written a list of like one new cuisine
for every month of this year 2015 and
January is Ethiopian I don't think any
of us have tried Ethiopian food before
or maybe the VA for an SJ tried it once
in Amsterdam so we are going to an
Ethiopian restaurant tonight I'm really
looking forward to great company and
catching up with friends but also trying
new food so I'll let you know how it is
I'm gonna get ready there okay I'm ready
but I can't decide what lipstick to wear
I might wear nothing because I'm just
seeing friends and eating dinner anyway
I don't have an opinion on the
foundation yet because my skin is a
funny texture from laser so it doesn't
feel normal
but the eyeshadow palette I really like
so looking forward to writing a blog
post on this one marinas cause top again
over loose vest top and jeans just comfy
although these shrunk in the wash that
art item which is home afternoon called
good evening excited for Ethiopian food
you know so close to me right now they'd
have to get down how's work yes good I
just thought I just saw it about Beauty
chat live going on tour like rock stars
I'm groupie rich was gonna come to
Dublin cuz he's never been and I wanted
to take him to the Jameson and Guinness
Factory
cuz I've been there and I loved it but
now he can't come because of work but
I'm gonna take Anna to the Guinness
Factory and make her drink a pint of
Guinness because it tastes so much
better when you're actually in Ireland
it doesn't doesn't travel well and it's
a really good view from the top where
you go all the way up top and then you
get a free glass of Guinness and it
tastes good I don't even like Guinness
Jameson whiskey wait we're gonna have to
do this before be chat though might be
bit who might be drunk for these chat
life excuse my ignorance but I don't
know what Ethiopian food is do you know
I imagined it to be like slightly kind
of like Moroccan II like Africa me food
but we'd like like sauces and bread yeah
I reckon it'd be quite
all right I know I'm excited I'm so
hungry I kind of purposely haven't
researched yeah me too I haven't I
wanted to see what they offer me too so
we're nearly there
and I will show you the food when we get
your hands it's like funny textured
bunny bread yummy like
okay so we're just leaving the
restaurant now and then just as we were
leaving the really nice girl that was
serving us all night the waitress said
that she reads my blog we had a little
photo together and it was so nice and so
it'd be nice to meet her but we had such
a good time I'm really glad we're doing
this New Year's resolution okay we're
gonna try some really good we would like
a list of what we're gonna eat every
month Ethiopian food was really good it
was really quite so easy at times but I
liked it did you like it yeah I loved
them
it was like really like a soft flavor
yeah we all wasn't sure about the bread
but they're not when you have bread
we're there it's a sour yeah this
complements it yeah it really does and I
need the bread on his own yeah we had
like fresh mint tea next month is next
month is Mongolian know that we don't
have to go oh yeah next month it's
Afghan I think we have a place in mind

spotting of the week I've just woken up

we're gonna prepare for beauty chat live
I think we see Anna again on Tuesday
because we've got a few meetings but
then Wednesday I'm off to Florida

got any time between Florida and the
tour so we're gonna kind of prep now and
just decide like how it's gonna go and
like a few special things that we might
do I'm gonna stop my makeup look at this
bathroom
oh it's amazing and the floor is heated
heated floor literally best thing ever
I failed to get ready with me video in
here last night and that's not going up

a bit ahead because we're going away but
I think it came out alright obviously

with how the filming went it such a
beautiful bath it was quite narrow
though so I have to have my camera here
and finding mirror here so I had to like
tiptoe and hopefully it came out all
right well I'm such an idiot
I mean 8th of March I just looked at my
diary I mean 8th of February I did
wonder why I was because I kept telling
another my videos gonna make the March I
think that's really far ahead what's
wrong with me

juice she is mad I'm gonna get a fresh
orange tea and I'm gonna get the English
which is that full English breakfast
