a weekly vlog today that's actually
gonna be uploaded on Thursday this week
because today's video it's pretty
special I was invited to the Burberry
Fashion Show at London Fashion Week this
year which is so exciting for me it's
tomorrow but when you watch this it
would have already been yesterday so
right now it's Sunday and this morning I
went to Burger HQ to have a sneak peek
of the makeup look that they're gonna be
wearing on the catwalk tomorrow for me
Fashion Week is all about the beauty and
the makeup so it was really exciting to
be able to go and meet Wendy Rowe
herself which is insane and she have
talked us through the makeup look that's
gonna be part of their autumn winter
catwalk so let's rewind to this morning
when I went off to Burberry HQ right I'm
ready I just need to grab some breakfast
then I'm gonna head to Burberry HQ I'm
very excited but I'm a bit nervous it's
Sunday so I don't really want to dress
up but I'm making some pretty important
people today so I want to look nice I'm
gonna put on like a nice lipstick I
think and then I'm gonna get Burberry HQ
and I'm so excited to meet Wendy row and
see all the makeup this is a pretty
exciting Sunday I'd say my friend Ruth
from and model recommends it's going to
be there as all today I'm really excited
to see her and her baby BOM so cute that
she is having a little baby play so I'm
here and really early but it looks
incredible so I'm gonna go in Reed's
here and she bought plus one when we got
in the room there was only about six of
us they were bloodless from Asia and
America and I was myself and Ruth and we
sat there kind of in awe of Wendy while
she talked through the makeup look which
they only decided about an hour before
she showed us on this beautiful model
how the makeup look was gonna look and
how she created it and it was just
amazing to be able to watch her work and
she is a fantastic makeup artist she
also tried it out on me and color
matched me with the right foundation and
I can't believe she did my makeup it was
very exciting and then I came back here
okay I makeup free I'm ready so yes as
you can see I am wearing the makeup I
came home and I wanted to recreate the
look for you guys to show you how it's
done
it is a pretty world will look actually
most makeup for Fashion Week is kind of
crazy catwalk but I think this one's
definitely wearable if not adaptable to
like an everyday look or an evening look
so I'm gonna talk you through the makeup
look that Wendy created there's a few
changes here and there but I'll talk you
through it step by step
the theme she was working with is
patchwork prints and patterns because
that's what the collection for
autumn/winter / Burberry is the clothes
are luxurious but also wearable and
effortless and she wanted the makeup to
reflect that she wanted a really worn in
lived-in makeup look so the first
product she used is the golden radiance
this is like a tinted primer it just
warms up the face a little bit it feels
really nice and fresh on the skin and
although it looks quite scary and dark
it really doesn't come out that dark
it's very easy to spread with your hands
feels great on the skin and just add
that little bit of warmth so when do you
like most makeup artists did the eyes
first because then it gives you time to
kind of clean up before you perfect the
skin
she started with the effortless Kohl
eyeliner in black and I'm pretty scared
of black eyeliner but she made it very
unscary so she started by just lining
the upper lashline pretty close to the
lashes actually and as she went along
she was blending with both a brush and
her finger I think will you blown with
the brush it's easier to make less of a
mess but I really like the effect when
you use your finger really smudges that
out and makes it kind of less intense
and more smudgy she also took the
eyeliner underneath the eye and she said
not to be too afraid of kind of going to
thick under the eye that's what really
gives it that lived-in look and it's so
so pretty once you blend out keep
blending with your finger in your brush
it does take a while to get there but
when you do it looks really cool so
Burberry have some new cream eyeshadows
coming out around April May and that's
what Wendy used for this look she used a
sort of black and grey Korean shadow
along with her was a source of beige
color that these products are so so
brand new and they have so few they
needed to save them all for the show so
unfortunately I can use all for this
look so instead when Dee showed me a
pretty cool trick Ashley that I think
you could use for quite a few different
colors she said to mix together their
nude radiance which if you have a home
any sort of moisturizer or radiant
primer you can use that and mix it with
just a black powder eyeshadow this is
one of their powder eyeshadows it's just
the black one so I put both both on the
back of my hand and just mix them
together using my finger and I actually
think that's a really cool way of making
a cream eyeshadow you can do over any
color I'm pretty sure you can use any
sorts of moisturizing product and then I
just started smudging that straight onto
the lid
so Wendy used a cream shadow but the
effect is very similar this version that
I'm doing is slightly
or share but you just keep building up
as much as you want with your finger you
can also use a flat brush and keep
smudging it in and then I like to blend
the edges out with a clean finger or a
clean brush this whole look is very easy
to use your hands and fingers actually
which I really like you want the black
to be quite intense but not kind of
opaque still really smudged out and
wearable wendy is the sort of mink cream
eyeshadow shade just in the crease just
to blend out the edges the next step
that Wendy did but she used a green
eyeliner and she used this in the
waterline I thought this is really cool
because I've mentioned before that I
can't really wear black liner in my
waterline because it makes my eyes just
go too small and she said wearing a
green is still a kind of smoky eye
option without it being too intense like
a black so I thought this was really
cool unfortunately I don't have a green
eyeliner with me but instead I used
their car key i shadow which is just a
green powder shadow and I just smudged
some of that under the lash line and it
gives that sort of green tint mixed in
with the black and I think it's really
nice she said she used green because it
suits pretty much all eye colors it's a
really complementary color and it's
perfect for some winter ok so now onto
mascara and I also thought this is
pretty interesting how she did the
mascara I feel like I learned so much
just been with her for like half an hour
with the mascara she didn't cut apply it
like you would a normal mascara she just
took the brush and pressed it onto the
roots of the lashes
she didn't stroke it all the way through
to the ends she just pressed it onto the
roots and I thought that was a pretty
cool trick as well she also pressed it
onto the bottom lashes and it still
gives kind of natural lashes she didn't
want long lashes you could kind of see
when you open your eyes because she
didn't want it to distract from what was
on the lid and I think this looks really
nice obviously you probably need quite
long curly lashes to do this if you're
doing it at home you can apply your
mascara just like you usually would okay
so the eyes are pretty much done and
along the way or at the end you can
clean up using a cotton bud if these
things are pretty handy just wipe a long
where you need to go but nothing's gonna
look perfect until you do the skin so
don't worry too much about that when we
started with concealing and highlighting
before she did the foundation so I'm
gonna copy what she did because I'm
trying to recreate the look the first
concealer she used is number three rosy
beige and this is a really quite pinky
apricot toned concealer which means it's
perfect for any dark circles so I just
apply it in the inner part under my eye
and
on the outer part the pink tone to it
really cancel out any blues and purples
that you tend to find under your eye if
you have dark circles it's really
brightening concealer so you can either
blend out your fingers or with a brush
it's very easy to blend either way and
then using the number two concealer she
use this as a highlight slash concealer
so on the tops of cheekbones down the
nose Cupid's bow chin around the nose
anywhere you want to highlight or
conceal and just blend that out it's so
easy to blend
I used to brush you can use your fingers
as well it's a really nice concealer
I've actually never tried Burberry
concealers and I was really impressed
with these okay so now it's a foundation
and Wendie hardly used any foundation I
mean the model really didn't need any
but for this look she said just apply it
where you need it and not all over she's
the fresh glow foundation which I
already have in beige it's one of my
favorite foundations that I've spoken
about a lot and I just applied a really
sheer amount the foundation just where I
needed it actually I'm glad I did that
because I always put too much on and I
really don't need it so I just applied
it where I do need it and kind of buffed
it out and it makes the skin look so
nice I really love this foundation I
usually leave lipstick to last but I'm
gonna copy Wendy she did lipstick next
Burberry have a whole range of nude
lipsticks coming out to in March and
they say that there's a nude for
everyone including darker skin tones
this one is shade number one and I think
this is one they're gonna use on most of
the models it's very very nude pretty
nude for me but I just applied one coat
and then dabbed in with my finger these
lipsticks are pretty versatile one coats
quite sheer two is more buildable and
you can really make it quite opaque if
you want to so I just dug down to the
lips just to nude them out a bit and
then next up she did blusher this shade
is called earthy blush and in the pan
it really looks quite pale and I didn't
think this was gonna do anything but she
contoured with this so I gave it a go
and actually it gives a really nice
contour it shows up darker on the skin
than it looks in the pan and it's a
really pretty neutral blush it it's not
too pink it's great for those days where
you don't want pink blush if you do need
some kind of definition I really really
like this blush actually and I think it
would be great for paler skin tones as
well she use this as a contour the
cheekbones but also down the nose and
under the chin as well to finish up if
you need it Wendy use a blotting powder
she said the most important place to use
this is around the nose no
to be showing you their and slightly in
the middle of the browse so if you do
get shiny then blotting powder is your
last step so that's the makeup look for
the Burberry autumn/winter 15 show and I
hope I did Wendy proud I did my best I
actually think it's a really nice look
I've wanted to try a kind of deep smoky
eye like this for a long time and she
really made it much easier for me to
understand how to create it I am so
excited for the robery show tomorrow I'm
sure I'm going to be tweeting and
instagramming so if you haven't yet seen
that go check out my accounts I will
link them down below and I hope you guys
found this interesting let me know what
you think of the finished look be nice
it was my first attempt thank you so
much for watching I'll see you guys on
