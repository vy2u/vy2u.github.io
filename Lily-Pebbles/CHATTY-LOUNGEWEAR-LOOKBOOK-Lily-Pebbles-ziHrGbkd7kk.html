loungewear my love for pretty much any
comfy clothes so I thought in today's
video I would show you some of my
favorite loungewear pieces as well as
pajamas slippers robes and I've got some
throws to show you as well my wardrobe
space is quite limited so I haven't got
that much I would love to just buy all
the loungewear but I think rich would
kill me so I'm also gonna link down in
the description box some other pieces
that I found online that I think you
guys might like but wait in my bedroom
right now and I thought I would show you
into my loungewear draw I've recently
tidied it up it was a little bit messy
so if you come over here I'll show you
into my drawer these are the white
company cashmere socks and I'm so
obsessed I have them in the dark gray
the light gray and the cream as well I
pretty much asked for these every
birthday and Christmas they're around 35
pounds but they are so worth it their
bed socks so I either wear them around
the house but I put my slippers on to
try and like stop them from getting
holes in them or I wear them in bed and
they're so cozy and so comfy I
absolutely love them so those are an
absolute must for me the loungewear
outfit they tend to wear when I'm
working from home which slightly is
slightly less pajama II is normally my
Topshop tracksuit bottoms I got this
last year but I'll try and link
something similar down below because I
love these they're dark grey and kind of
specially but they're really warm they
have this kind of like furry inside and
I like tracksuit bottoms that are
elasticated on the ankle they're not as
flattering like I would probably
wouldn't wear these out the house but
they feel cozier that way and they
didn't drag on the floor so I really
really like these and I normally wear
these with some kind of cozy jumper this
is one of mine and Anna's jumpers if
they're not sold out yet I will link
them down below
I love the hashtag no makeup day one I
love them both you guys have probably
seen our announcement video if you
haven't I will link it up here but it's
so so cozy really nice and warm inside
and quite fitted so I love wearing these
two together when I am working from home
I also recently found these in next and
I'm so happy with this purchase probably
the most comfy Landreth ever bought
I think next do really good pajamas
loungewear robes slippers this is a set
so it's a top and bottoms it's a really
nice light gray I don't know what it's
made out of actually I'll link it down
below but it's so comfy I like this
because it's kind of weighted I don't if
you can see but the way it kind of falls
onto your skin makes it really
comfortable again it's elasticated at
the bottom so I like to wear this on the
top as well which is just kind of a
simple jumper style I like to wear this
in the evening when I'm around the house
I'm making dinner I'm watching TV
because I quite like changing into
pajamas before getting into bed so it's
not the same clothes you've been wearing
all evening so this is my favorite
lounging around the house outfit I'm so
obsessed with this combo I think it's
absolutely amazing and now I have a
couple of pajamas to show you this one
is actually also from next I got this
last year but they do have a newer
version on the website now which has
gold stars and navy blue stars on it
this is just gray with white stars and I
really like pajama tops they're just
long-sleeve tops and kind of buttons to
match I find them the comfiest the ones
that have buttons down the front I think
they look really cool but I don't find
them as comfy so these are really really
comfortable I'll link the new ones that
they do now in the description box and
then the pajamas that I'm absolutely
loving at the moment from the white
company these are so soft they're softer
than those from next obviously they're
more expensive I love the white company
for pajamas and loungewear this is just
a stripy set so it's got long bottoms
and then a long-sleeve top it's got a
few buttons at the top and a pocket but
nothing uncomfortable is so soft and
comfortable to wear I absolutely love
this set so I've been wearing that a lot
recently so there's some of my current
favorite loungewear pajama pieces and
now I'm going to show you some slippers
I recently found a reason you went to
Primark to have a look at the slippers
they have because I love the ones from
the white company but they are really
expensive and I don't tend to keep my
slippers every year I like to get new
slippers every year so I went to Primark
and they had some really really good
ones the first ones I found are these
they're cream and brown they're kind of
a standard slipper shape and a so
conflict company and they're so comfy I
really really like these that kind of
knitted they looked like something you'd
get from the white company really soft
and cozy and then these ones I've been
wearing these the most I really loved
them I've never had slippers this style
before but they're so easy to just slip
on when I
home I take my shoes off and I slip
these on and I've been wearing them
non-stop since I got them these would be
my favorite out of the two gray and
white they look really expensive but
they weren't they're from Primark and I
think they're great so now I'm going to
take you into my bathroom and show you
the two dressing gowns I have and the
ones that I would recommend to you so in
the bathroom sorry about the lights but
these are my two dressing gowns that I
wear and I absolutely love them this
one's from the white company and I got
this as a birthday gift last year they
are expensive so it's definitely worth
putting on your like wishlist or
birthday gift list it's so cozy and I
got it in the dark gray because then you
know you don't get makeup marks and
stuff all over it it's got a really big
hood which I love and it's really long
as well I hate dressing as that short
this white one is from matzo Spence's
it's from that water craft range which
is much more affordable and I would
definitely recommend it the inside is
toweling so it's good if you if you wear
it like when you come out the shower and
the outside is really soft this one
actually has LP on it my initials which
is so cool so I love wearing that one
both are really nice and long
big cuffs and hooded too one of my
favorite ways to keep cozy in the winter
is with nice throws on the sofa so let
me take you into the lounge and I'll
show you some of my favorite throws so
this is where I keep all my throws in
this copper basket here which I got from
home and pantry and I have a few
different throws in here some are from
West Elm I think they do really nice
throws they're a little bit more
expensive but worth investing in because
they last well they wash well and they
really do keep you warm I love to
snuggle in a throw on the sofa when I'm
watching TV I also have this one from
Asus which I know everyone has at the
moment it's one of them mermaid throws
this is kind of a grayish brown color
it's so cute because you can actually
get inside it which is so nice and it
looks like you've got like a knitted
mermaid tail which is just so sweet they
come in so many different colors this
would be a really good Christmas gift as
well I also have one Annette from H&amp;amp;M
home it's quite an old one now but they
always have new throws and they're
really affordable and really nice
quality as well so definitely recommend
hmmm home if you want to pick up some
throws so that's everything for this
video as I said I will link all the
items mentioned in the description box
below and I also put some alternatives
and other things I've seen online that I
