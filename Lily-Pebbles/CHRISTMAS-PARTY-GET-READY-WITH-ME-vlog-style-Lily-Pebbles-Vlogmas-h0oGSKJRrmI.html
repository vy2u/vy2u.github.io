of December it's now 4:30 and I have
logged all day because I've been doing
work and I went to my mum's and I sorted
out my post and I just fancied kind of
having a day off vlogging but I still
wanted to upload something for you guys
and tonight I'm actually going to a
Christmas party I'm going to Tania and
Jim's Christmas party and I'm really
excited because last year me and rich
missed it we had to cancel last minute
because I had like vlogmas flew I don't
know if you remember from last year I
actually forgot but rich reminded me cuz
I was like what was the party like last
year and he said we didn't go because
you've got ill so I'm really looking
forward to it because their summer party
was really fun and it's just nice to
like catch up with everyone and see
people in like a nonworking environment
I'm really looking forward to it so I am
gonna be getting ready for the party I
don't know how much I'm gonna vlog when
I'm there but I thought I would show you
guys like me getting ready doing my
makeup I need to do my nails and my hair
and get dressed I still at this point
have no idea what I'm wearing so I'm not
really doing my makeup in any kind of
particular way to match my outfit I
don't think people are that observant
anyway but I want to do something quite
nice of my eyes because I can't wear
anything on my lips which is so sad
because Christmas time all I want to do
is wear a red lip but it's just not
worth it I end up looking like Miranda
sings because my lips would be so sore
so I hope you guys like this kind of
vlog style get ready with me I'm just
gonna chat to you while I do my makeup
um I am gonna start with a primer I put
moisturizing stuff on this morning but
it's been a while so this is the Too
Faced hangover primer which is like my
most hydrating one I'm just gonna put
that on just before I do my foundation
I never thought that I would be true for
my foundation I'm gonna use the
Illamasqua skin base I love this
foundation for when I want something
that's slightly more full coverage my
skin's a bit funny at the moment a
little bit kind of spotty for me also
the lighter is so bad it just gets dark
so early here at the moment I'm using a
quite wet Real Techniques complexion
sponge I'm gonna pop that into the skin
in my little world you are Bo I wear the
shade
5:02 which is maybe a little bit yellow
for me but it all kind of blends in
that's fine
oh you still
beautiful as you are you just don't know
how far in this world I'll be
the color that it's showing on my camera
is so different to real life
they look really yellow in the camera
I'm hoping that the camera isn't a
better reflection because it's brighter
and the camera than it is in real life
also sorry that we're in my kitchen
right now but this is the only place
where I can sit at a table I'm now going
to use the Urban Decay Naked concealer
under my eyes around my nose and on my
chin
you are
harmless desire and then I always like
to go over a little bit more just here
and on the outer corners and then I use
a brush to Pat it really lightly just
have it in I'm not going to use any
powder because I need all the glow that
I can get we're gonna go in next with my
bronzer these are all pretty much the
same products that I always use this is
the Too Faced milk chocolate bronzer and
this is a different brush that i
normally use it's the matte one to nine
you wrote your name
I can't really see but I think that's
enough of that I'm also gonna add a bit
of NAS beat Russia
it's a really little bit of blush there
and then for the special part I'm going
to use my Becca champagne pop
highlighter I don't always use this one
anymore because it is quite intense and
it's not great for the daytime but for a
Christmas party
it's definitely i'm using the morphe and
501 which is like a perfect highlighter
brush I'm just putting it not to why are
you not feeling down
for my brows I'm using the benefits
precisely my brow pencil I use the shade
for
and then I'm using some brow gel to set
them in place feet for my eyes I want to
go
bronze with a little bit of glitter so I
think I'm going to use quite a warm
brown like sable and then a little bit
wood Winx which is like a really kind of
luxurious shimmery brown and then I
think on top I'm going to burn a little
bit of urban decay diamond dog media
introduce this to me years ago and
there's a gorgeous like taupe with the
silver sparkles and then black liquid
eyeliner which I really hope I don't
mess up just because that would just
mess everything up because you have to
do that once in the bathroom very close
up to the mirror okay so let me start
with a base color for my face color I'm
going to use Mac sable so I want it to
be quite a warm warm I look even though
the silk swab
that way
Philby leave
okay so now on top of that I'm going to
use a little bit of wood wings from Mac
I absolutely love this eye shadow
and placing it quite gently cuz I don't
wanna like disrupt the color underneath
too much
okay now I am going to use urban decay
diamond dog you see how amazing the
color of this eye shadow is it's so so
pretty so I'm going to take a flat
eyeshadow brush for this I really hope
it doesn't go everywhere I'm gonna pack
it onto the brush and then I'm gonna tap
it off on kitchen towel ooh I might end
up with glitter on my face and then I'm
gonna pass it on
it's gonna take a fluffy brush and blend
out the edges a little bit I think
that's really pretty I don't know if you
can see what the lids look like but I
think it's nice it's kind of subtle
right now I want to add some black
liquid eyeliner here this I'm going to
use the Tom Ford one I haven't worn
black liquid liner in so long
I hope I can apply it alright but I
definitely can't do it here I need to
have both hands which means I need to
have a mirror on the wall I will be back
okay liquid eyeliner is done I'm going
to use a bit of a scar I've been loving
this one from Marc Jacobs recently I
love Charlotte silly legend rule ashes
but I've actually ran out so I can't use
that
and then I'm also gonna use some of the
chemi bottom lash mascara again because
I'm not wearing lipstick I need to make
more of my eyes okay makeup done I'm
gonna go look in a normal mirror
probably top up my bronze or something
because the light in here so bad and
then I didn't go to do my nails my nail
polish of choice and I is se soulmates
which is like a really dark plum e
burgundy very wintry um so I'm just
gonna quickly kind of prep my nails put
on a Sally Hansen base coat put on this
and then put on my Seche vite top rope
while I wait for my nails completely dry
I really like how they've come out then
I'm gonna write Tonya and Jim a little
Christmas card this is from a company
called old English company they have
some really nice stuff I was just about
to try on couple of dresses and I put
this one on is the first one I tried on
and I actually think I'll wear this I
quite like it this is a dress from last
year maybe even the era before I haven't
worn it this year yet it was from ASOS
and it's just like a t-shirt dress so
it's comfortable because it's not really
tight but I can eat and get drunk and
all with that and I also like that it's
kind of got long sleeves you know
sometimes you're just not in the mood to
like wear something really tight and
like loads of skin out I think it's a
bit too formal to wear something like
that to like a house party but because
this is like t-shirt style and it's
still like a little bit fitted kind of
like it's got the sparkle for the
Christmas party I'll wear it with like
heeled boots I think this is perfect I'm
not sure what I'm going to do with my
hair but I think I might kind of use
straighteners to curl it and then maybe
plat a couple of pieces back so it's not
all just down you guys don't need to see
me straighten my hair and curl it you
kind of know the deal so I'm going to
speed this up but yeah basically going
to use my straightness to straighten my
hair just like because it needs I know
that the head kind of drops more when
you straighten at first but my hair
needs to be straight before it's curled
alloys it's just like curled pieces of
frizzy hair so it needs to be smoothed
out and then I'm gonna put the curls in
and then I'll try and do some kind of
like half up thing not really sure you
guys know I'm terrible at her this is
all nice and clean from yesterday but
let folks basically I better do anything
to it now like is it like this seriously
it smells so good though what shampoo do
they use at harshest of
I'm gonna speed things up let me pause
my music I've just been having a little
dog okay I've curled my hair or like
waves they're always it's weird at first
and then it's okay
I'm going to use the Kiehl's cream with
silk groom which is the best stuff ever
I just put a little bit in my hand rub
it and then just run it through my hair
and it kind of binds it all together
she's a bit of moisture gives it a bit
of hold but then I also like to use a
bit of the semi sumo from Bumble and
Bumble my god I've just made finish this
stuff I've been using for years I
basically put a bit on my fingers and
then I just like play with the ends of
my hair and it's like a wax and I just
think it looks more like PC and cool so
now I don't really know what to do with
my hair I think I should I think I
should maybe like flats bits and kind of
do it like that I'm gonna try and do it
I'm really bad so I'm gonna attempt it
and see you in a minute
to spend this
ok I'm done and that's basically the
hairstyle for people who are chase it
doing hair
I liked on to fake Platts and then I
kind of put them up into a half ponytail
can you see can you see does the trick
it's fine
I look like me I feel comfortable rich
is back from work and we're gonna make
some gin and tonic it's a bit of a pre
drink going on or well done you got lime
yeah alright what do we need gin
Beefeater Gordon's look at us using our
bar cart we need like special gin and
tonic glasses you everyone by the way
guys I was just listening to Bruno
Mars's new album I love Bruno Mars I
think he has an amazing voice I love how
funky students are a lot of the ones on
this album are quite like old school
they're Miami like boys to men because
they are like it's like the mystic
sasalles whatever the whole thing is
just about giving women naked really
makes me think differently of him but I
like the songs just not the lyrics hey
rich is chopping a lime talk us through
it so you're squeezing the line wait so
you're doing the glass and you're
squeezing it and then you're plunk in it
yeah why is that a juice wrong okay no
gin shop yeah
three amigos no I told no because mom
has filled the freezer with Christmas
canapes but it's all full of Christmas
canapes but she ran out of room it's all
right it's all right
we could about the tonic in the fridge
is this just plain tonic because you can
get like flavored ones that makes the
gin and tonic really good
I had like a grape tonic once I was the
gin grape
gin grape grape gin and elderflower
tonic weekend personal mix right what
makes that the elderflower cordial which
my stomach muscles are killing me today
for the gym okay this will help ease the
pain

bar cart they've got loads of straws
