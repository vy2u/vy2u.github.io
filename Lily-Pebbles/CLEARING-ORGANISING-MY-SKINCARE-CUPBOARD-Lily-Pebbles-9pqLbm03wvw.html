today I'm going to be doing a video
where I clear out my skincare cupboard
clear out my bathroom shelves basically
I'm in full-on clear out mode of just on
my wardrobe think it specific like such
a sunny day and I'm going away next week
so I needed to do my wardrobe anyways
I'm just in the mood for clearing out
and every now and again mean which goes
through our cupboards in the bathroom
because I obviously get sent so many
products that I get a bit overloaded
with stuff and I like to keep it as
simple as I can as always a few products
on the go that I'm trying but I like to
have my staples there anyway it's become
a bit of a mess so I'm going to clear
through it I don't know how much stuff
I'm going to actually get rid of I think
mainly obviously about organizing I take
everything out and the kinetic back in
in a better order but there might be
some things along the way that I can
talk to you guys about and like give you
mini reviews if I'm getting rid of it
I'll tell you why and talk you to some
of my favorite skincare products so I
will bring you into my bathroom which is
here and we can go through the cupboards
together I was going to make this like a
fancy swishy videos but I think it's
just so much easier to do its log style
and I hope you guys don't mind I'm sure
you don't so let's get on with this
because I feel like this could be a
really long video okay so let's go into
the bathroom and as I told you guys
before this cabinet is from Ikea when we
first got the flap that wasn't much
storage so I want to get a big cabinet
with lots of space inside on the left
hand side I'm probably not going to do
this today because it's basically I've
got like some Isolators up there this is
all travel stuff and like some cream
that I'll probably keep all of that
these two shelves are all for rich and
then I've got like a cotton wool eye
makeup remover so I don't think I'm
going to do the left side but we can do
this side which is where all of my
skincare is so sorry need you both angry
to see me in a reflection by the way but
that's what it's like when you want a
mirrored cabinet at the top I've got so
much foot stuff and then I've got these
old backups
up here so like spare products that I
know I already love those are all kind
of face masks makeup remover wipe and
then it's a bit of a free-for-all it did
have some order originally but it's all
just got a bit messed up so I think the
first thing I'm going to do is take
everything off the shelf put it in a big
bag go into another room sort through it
and then come back in and put it
back on the shelves in some kind of
order sorry that the light is so rubbish
in my bathroom we had no windows no
natural light in here so I'm just going
to look a bit orange here that emptied
everything and whilst I have them bare
like this because it's not often I'm
going to give them a good clean because
they're a little bit sticky giving it
some glass clean and just wipe these
down okay the first three things that
are kind of the biggest in the cupboard
are my glycolic acids so I've got a
giant long-term pixie that has my name
on it
I love the pixie glow tonic and
deafening and keep that but this is also
a pixie glow tonic and although it's in
a really cool bottle it I just don't
really use it because this one so much
needs you in a pump so I'm going to give
this one to a friend that would pretty
appreciate it and then this is the one
from the ordinary which I'm also really
enjoyed so I'm just going to keep both
of these for now okay I just told
everything out the bag and I've moved
you guys over here let's start with
cleansers and I've got my oscar
renascence cleanse which I love so I'm
definitely gonna keep that and then I've
got four kind of travel sizes this feels
really extreme although they're not that
big to store and I bought them it was in
a sale online they're like five times
each I'm just going to keep them because
I know I'm always going to love this
cleanser I've got the Liz Earle cleanse
and polish on-the-go and then I've got
two backups which I think it's quite
extreme especially as I get sent needs
quite often so I'm going to give one to
a friend and just keep one backup
because I don't think I'm going to need
to back off I've got the Caroline
hyerin's pixie double cleanse which I
really really like and I've got a backup
of that as well
I'm going to keep those and I've got a
clinic take the day off
this is good when I'm wearing like lots
of makeup so I like to keep that this is
a kind of new cleanser for me it's the
lowest pose a makeup remover micellar
water gel very different to any other
formula I have I think when I eventually
get my hands on a glossier one it might
replace this but for now as this is
different to the others I'm going to
keep it this is the very superseded
cleansing oil and I'm going to give this
away because I'm not massively into oil
cleansers it
just a little bit too messy for me I
prefer like a gel to oil formula like
the Ostia one and then obviously my
Clarins instant eye makeup remover I've
got quite a few of these dotted around
and lots of backups but I always always
use it my favorite makeup remover so
definitely keeping that there's all the
cleansers I've got some oils here so
I'll talk to these of you I've got the
Sarah Chapman morning facial and
overnight facial I'm definitely going to
give away the morning facial because I
don't tend to use oils in the morning
anymore and then I don't know what to do
like I quite like the overnight facial
actually I loved it and I've used it for
years I'm not really using it much at
the moment but I'm not sure if that's
just because of the warmer weather think
I'm going to keep this I've got so many
other oils though so I definitely need
to get rid of some others this one is
the super mu use glow radiance oil it
looks like something I haven't even got
around to trying yet so I'm going to
pass that on this is a long fun kite
press or keeper so if you say and it's
almost finished like no in the bin and
now I've got a giant one from that same
brand Beauty LX of one which I don't
tend to use because I think this one's a
little bit too heavy for me this is new
from the ordinary it's the organic
cold-pressed rosehip seed oil I'm really
enjoying this I'm going to keep that one
with the Sarah Chapman this is the Liz L
super skin concentrate for nights I do
really like this I'm not sure whether to
keep it or not though because how many
oils is one person need hmm I've also
got the LMS super food oil which I like
but it's almost finished so I think I'll
get rid of that one maybe I'll keep the
little one instead okay and in the last
two oils the very super seed facial oil
and give that away because I don't love
it as much as the others and then this
is the Sunday Riley lunar sleeping night
oil I think I'm also going to give this
away because I just haven't used it in
ages which I think this is the blue one
yeah I find it it just I don't like this
blue I find it a little bit messy so I'm
going to keep those three oils I think
so now I've got the lost rose a Sarah
zinc here and I really like that I don't
use it that often but I've only got one
so I'm just going to keep it this is all
my stuff from Margaret dabs which is a
really nice brand if you like foot
creams and things like that I would give
them these and kept them thinking that I
would give myself a pedicure
sometime but I just don't I'm just never
going to be that person who gives myself
a pedicure so I go ahead an exfoliating
foot moves
the foot cream there's like a spray at
serum I've even got one of those like
shaver things which I've never used so
I'm going to get all of these away and
then here I've got some face white
I don't read tend to say such that often
mainly for getting stains out of my
clothes but it's good to have them
especially if I might try and be to
products and stuff I've got sa little
ones and Clinique ones but two of these
ESPYs clinic ones are amazing so I'm
just going to keep these because it more
anyway I think I'll give these if they
know the ones away this is my huge pile
of God knows what I've had these for so
long so I think I need to be brutal
because I always keep these these are
like this these Estee Lauder I'm off
always think me thinking I'll use them
on a plane and I do sometimes but I have
so many I don't know if you know go
through them all can you check these are
all the same so I've got a box of Estee
Lauder I mask and then I've got the skin
Iceland ones although these are firming
eye gels I don't hide the firming one so
deafening any of those away more Estee
Lauder let me put these in the box and
then they're all in one place and I keep
finding more there stays order I think
it makes sense to me to just keep the
Estee Lauder ones because they're in a
box and then the others give away its
got like elements I'm our skin Iceland
what are these girl and and a nested
order face mask I'm going to get all the
other way because I just don't use them
it's such a way to purchase sitting in
my cottage
okay moisturizes this is the ginseng
moisturizer from origin but it's really
like this I feel like now I'm nearly 30
it doesn't quite do enough for me so I
think I'm going to give this away
I don't think rich music you've got a
couple of origins moisturiz already like
this is one from Liz Earle which I like
but again I find it just a bit too
simple for me at the moment
so I'm going to pass this one on as well
I'm loving this I'm loving this it's a
cat Berkey vitamin C intensive face
cream this is moisturizer I'm using the
most at the moment really really loving
it morning and night mainly in the
evening and then this is the skin seed
circles redness neutralizer I was
recommended this in my skin consultation
because apparently I've got red skin
even though you can't really see it is
red so this helped with that I just
don't find it that enjoyable to you they
don't like the smell or the texture find
it quite hard to spread around my face
so I feel like I should keep this
because it's going to help with the
redness but I don't love using it so I
might just give it another go see how I
feel this is the Estee Lauder wakeup
balm which I was using another morning
moisturizer for so long I really like it
but I've realized that it's not
moisturizing enough as that but what I'm
going to do is add it to my makeup
collection and use it more as a primer
because it's so nice and glowy this is
new from the ordinary if the natural
moisturizing factor H a I'm not under
the censure on this I don't think it's
my favorite I mentioned I did a blog
post on the ordinary oh yeah I mentioned
to you guys in my may favorites I'll go
do a video on this by ended up doing a
blog post so go check that out I'll put
in the description box if you haven't
seen it this is probably my least
favorite thing that I've tried it's just
a bit too basic for me I think I'm gonna
get that way just realize that's quite
good one to travel with because that is
going to be way too big maybe I'll keep
this for traveling this is the pixie
glow shinde jus it's quite nice
not my saying I think I'm going to pass
this on and then I've got this one which
is from environment it's it's called
classroom gel which I'm sure is meant
for something else I don't know I've got
recommend this I don't recommend this
when I had a Sarah Chapman facial is to
help without pollution and stuff but I
never end up using it because it's just
like really scary and I don't understand
it so I'm going to take a picture send
its Caroline hire in to ask her if I
should be using this or not and see what
she says and then I've got a couple of
SPS this is the Prevage
city smart m and this is tinted if I
remember correctly it's SPF 50 and it
tinted so I guess that's quite good when
you're on holiday but when it comes to
SPS there's just like a few brands I
really trust and washing today is one of
them and I use this every morning it's
the Anthelios XL 50 plus I don't know
maybe I tried it I've tried this in a
while so maybe I try this tomorrow and
see if the tin actually does anything
then it might be good once where like
when I'm on holiday and I don't want to
wear this foundation I think I'm going
to keep both for now and see but this
one is definitely a favor of mine I have
so many like serums and sauce first time
to wash pave and this is the reader m'q
ah it's a retinoid cream and I really it
works on my skin but I've also recently
been using the ordinary advanced
retinoid 2% this will makes my face peel
the logical is a1 makes my face peel
which I don't love and like peel in a
really weird way that usually like you
haven't washed
whereas I really like this one so I
think
I'm going to give away the rush birthday
one and just carry on with the ordinary
one this is the beta L gel erotic deep
hydration serum I love this but it's so
expensive I'm going to finish it up and
then from now on instead I'm going to
use the ordinary hyaluronic acid because
this is such a great deep for this
they're so similar and this is like
eight pounds or something crazy this is
a pixie overnight glow serum it's
exfoliating gels I've got a few of these
I've got but I share a Chapman overnight
foliate Singh serum maybe that's it I'm
supposed to I think I'll keep the pixie
one and give away the Sarah Chapman one
this is the lost purse a reader m'q c10
it's a really good anti-aging serum
health of wrinkles firming lines all of
that so I'm enjoying using that in the
morning occasionally there's a Sarah
Chapman intense hydrating booster which
I used to love but now I'm really
enjoying the ordinary hyaluronic acid so
I'm going to use that one instead and
I'll give the Sur Chapman away I'm
actually getting rid of quite a lot of
stuff this is impressive I have two
Estee Lauder advanced night repair these
are such an old favor of mine I don't
tend to use them that much anymore but I
know if someone were to talk about them
I'd get FOMO I think this one's really
full whereas this one's not so maybe
I'll just keep the full one I don't need
to this is from the ordinary it's the
Azalea acid suspension this is a
brightening formula I'm still car
testing this out quite new to me so
haven't quite decided yet our keeper for
now then I've got a few kite forest
products moonlight catalysts which
actually has I've got the pixie don't
think I need both clearing serum which
actually is quite good when I spot see
something I'll keep that antioxidant jus
which I did love but I just don't in to
you that much anymore out of a reaction
to it which made me scared even though I
actually haven't reacted to it but you
know when you kind of fall out of love
with products I still think this is a
really good brand but I don't think it's
something I would repurchase and there's
just other things that I'm enjoying at
the moment so I don't think I'll keep
the moonlight moonlight catalyst or the
anti oxygen jus and then I also have a
backup of the antioxidant juice so I'm
going to give that way as well got a
couple of products and keels here the
midnight recovery concentrate was just
as an old favorite I like to keep it in
case and the daily reviving concentrate
I hadn't really got around to trying
this yet and then should I put so many
things to try I think so
would enjoy that more than me from the
ordinary the looper side solutions this
is a brightening vitamin C serum that
I'm enjoying the moment to quite a lot
of serums to keep but I like to switch
those off every now and again so I don't
mind having quite a few got three eye
creams here and I know I'm going to keep
out the three the event physio lift one
because I've been using this recently
and really really enjoying it I'm going
to give away my dolphin gel cream and my
Estee Lauder one really like this I'll
order one I think I'm enjoying the event
one more I think it does a bit more for
me got some tanning products here this I
am loving it's new from Charlotte
Tilbury the overnight bronze &amp;amp; Glow mask
love that my absolute favorite Clarins
liquid bonds self-tanning and I'm
definitely going to keep that I've also
got a backup of that what backup
makeup remover as well while still on
backup I've got some Sarah Chapman
products which I'm going to give away
this is the intense hydrating booster
this is the ultra recovery booster
actually which I haven't tried yet so I
think I'll keep that back to tanning we
deliver onto self-tanning serum someone
recommended this to me and they always
look so tanned it just gets really
grubby but this is a brand new one so
maybe I'll keep it as it's not summer
yet so I don't know if I want to use it
or not
okay I've got some masks here I have the
ESOP parsley seed mask which is just one
of my absolute favorites definitely
keeping that the origins drink up
intensive mask which I feel like doesn't
do much for me anymore but it's such an
old favorite and the smell is so
nostalgic that I want to keep it and
I've got the Charlotte Tilbury goddess
skin clay mask I know a lot of people
love I find it a bit too heavy and when
I take off I could just feel too much on
my skin afterwards so I'm going to give
that one away and then I've got this
brush that I use to apply the masks with
I have the fresh sugar lip polish which
I love this is from coke press it's the
glow refining mask
I don't use this so I'm going to get
that way and then I've also got
something from Peter Thomas Roth which
is the peeling gel again don't really
like this there's a lot of products from
Peter Thomas Roth but I don't seem to
get always and they kind of keep my skin
is too sensitive for the brand or
something like that so I'm going to give
that one away I've got the little eye
bright which I just like to have on hand
and it's a nice soothing product when my
eyes are feeling a little bit sore and
then I've got the Sarah Chapman
overnight lip concentrate which I
it when you get on with you guys know I
react really easily to lip products so
I'm going to give that one away and then
yeah I think all I've got here is on
ravit skirt queen of Hungary mist which
I really like of a faithless so
definitely keeping that oh my god I have
a desert
okay so I've gone through the entire bag
of products and I think I've done really
well I probably got rid of 1/3 maybe
everything in the bag of the keep and
then all of this stuff I am going to
give away so let's go back into the
bathroom and I will put them all back
into the Shelf in some kind of order and
hopefully it will stay that way it
wasn't really an easy way for me to film
myself putting everything back on the
shelf without someone here helping me so
I'm going to kind of just put them on
figure it out and then show you guys
what I've done guys look how much better
this is it looks like there's loads
because of mirrors but there's so much
less stuff in here now so working for
the box so I'm going to show you I've
got the cleansers I use the most
Oscar renascence cleanser and a large
purse a one with the little behind it
and then I've kind of put it in order of
how I use the products I've got my eye
cream here and my morning serum and then
I've got the two ordinary products here
because I'm using as at the moment is my
birthday Cal behind because I only use
that up I then got em a few moisturizers
here and actually spread them out a bit
bring that one forward and then I've got
a couple of SPS on this shelf I've got
my eye right my sprays and then I've got
a couple of masks and a brush and then
up here I've got tanning products other
cleansers I don't use as often and then
kind of evening products actually if you
know what I'm going to switch these
around a moment right this makes more
sense to me to have my masks there and
then on this second shelf I've got like
my evening products so I've got three
oils the one I use the most of the front
I've got the pixie overnight low serum
and the ordinary retinoid with the
clearings there and behind cuz I use
that as often the Kiehl's put up behind
and then the ordinary brightening
formula and the front and Estee Lauder
advanced might occur in the back and
then up here I've got all my spares
despair eye makeup removers their pixie
cleansers fell off you cleanse us by
turning and starless old makeup wipes
eye gel and then I haven't put anything
on the tops because I can't reach it
so anything off there's not really going
to get used anyway look how great that
look
I'm really happy with that I'm going to
put my pink glow tonic here next to my
lip exfoliator that was actually really
quick and painless and I've still got
time now to go and see my nephew it's a
first birthday today so I need to buy an
present and then go and see him and I'm
glad I've just got that done I hopefully
this has inspired you guys to have a bit
of a clear-out because it does make you
feel great and it's my favorite thing to
do this time of year now I feel like we
can actually enjoy my products and look
forward to using them in the morning and
in the evening so thank you guys so much
for watching if you have any questions
or comments please leave them below this
video as I said I did a blog post on the
ordinary skincare range so I will link
that in the description box below and I
think that's everything for now if you
haven't seen my last video I will link
it here along with a button if you'd
like to click to subscribe I will see
