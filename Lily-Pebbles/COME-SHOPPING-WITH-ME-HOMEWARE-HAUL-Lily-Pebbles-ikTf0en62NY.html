it's gonna be another home related video
and I'm so happy because that is just
where my head is at at the moment home
renovation home interiors home decor so
when HomeSense got in touch to say they
wanted to work with me on this video I
was so excited because I'm a massive fan
of home sent there's one really near me
and I've been going for so many years
and if you don't already know what
HomeSense is it's part of the TK maxx
family and it's known for its big brands
and its unique finds it's a home wear
store but there's new stock all the time
so every time you go back you find
completely different things
and so many bargains you can save up to
60% more than anywhere else and so I
love just popping in whenever I can
to see what's new in store because you
just never know what bargain you're
going to be up to get home cents
actually celebrating their 10 year
anniversary this year which is crazy so
to celebrate that I'm working with them
on this cool video I went in had a
little mooch around and picked up ten of
my favorite finds to show you guys get
it ten because the ten year anniversary
it's absolutely one of my favorite
places to shop for home wear so I'm very
very excited to be doing this video if
you've never been and you're not sure
where your nearest homestead store is
there are a 50 around the country I
think so I'll put a link in the
description box below if you want to
check out where your nearest store is
okay so this morning I went in and I
worked for a little shop and it was so
fun and I've logged it so I'm gonna
insert the footage now so you can see
what it looks like in store right I'm
just in the car waiting for Millie to
get to the station she's gonna come with
because one I feel like I'm gonna need
help like filming and shopping and
carrying bags but also I'm so indecisive
I think it really helps to have someone
there to be like are these yellow
cushions insane and then she can tell me
what she thinks yeah but a trolley and I
think we should just do aisle by aisle I
don't want to miss out on anything when
you first come in they've got this like
curation selection it'll come back to
this but we just start with Gardens
we're gonna have to do our whole garden
up so I should probably start thinking
ahead they've got these massive like
baskets which i think is so cool because
you can put plants in them they've got
pots on the inside I will come back to
get these but our garden is ready
they've got all these different kind of
outdoor planters and pots some of them
could definitely be used indoors what
lots of really nice gray ones lots of
palm print going on the outdoor cushions
I wish we had like outdoor seating in
our garden this is really nice
this is like a bench cover here and down
here is the section I was very much
looking forward to
they have like fake plants which i think
are amazing especially in rooms that are
dark and don't get much like some very
good ones where like the fern there's so
many I'm gonna pick us out also there's
flowers so I think I'm gonna have a look
get some of these that good for the home
also really good for me to use there's
like photo props a tip I got from Kate
from mad about the house is if you're
gonna buy faux plants go for the ones
that naturally look quite plasticky
anyway things like this I think they
look really good often what they do in
here as well as like categorize things
by color which i think makes it really
easy to shop around
I just keep gravitating towards really
nice like gray concrete pots and vases
okay so let's have a look at this middle
section I think at the moment it's very
India inspired really pretty tablecloths
and then in this middle section is where
they put most of the furniture and I
love the furniture they do at home sense
already spotted something over here
which I just think is such a bargain let
me show you this chair is so cute I love
the shape of it I think it would look so
nice in the corner of a bedroom they
also do really good like hallway tables
that would be really nice an entryway
this one as well I really like that in
this section over here they've got some
really cool like side tables and poof's
and beanbag I really like these like mix
of kind of oak wood and steel lots to
pick from so I think I might actually
get a side table finally okay now to the
cushion pillow and throw section which
is huge put them all down here and
they've got rows and rows of cushions
and rows as well I'm loving the amount
of palm print going on here also I'm so
gutted we haven't got our garden
furniture sorted yet because these would
look so nice and kind of tempted to get
them and just put them in storage until
we need them also got some really great
lighting options and like these things I
think it looks so nice is hanging
pendant in a hallway oh also I spotted
this earlier look how nice this desk is
it's like mid-century style there's like
the gold legs
drawers two drawers either side and a
space in the middle I love that okay
this is where they keep the
like doormats and we've still got the
ones from the previous owners of our
house and it's just like fallen upon us
really tatty
a lot of them have like funny things
written on them like this one just says
go away which I'm so tempted vibe I
don't think Richard want it I think it's
really funny there we're now up stairs
which is where they have all the kitchen
staff and like cutlery in glasses and
mugs and bedding as well they've also
got like all baking trays you could
possibly ever need what is that
spoon shaped that so you can make like
chocolate spoons you've got a massive
section with wicker baskets which I
think I'm really nice by the fireplace
to put all your throws and stuff in and
the moment we're keeping our throws in
this like tiny little like copper wire
basket and they just overflow so I think
getting a big one of these a big good
idea also just as a heads up guys they
have really cool like cosmetic beauty
organization like things for your
lipsticks and stuff which these are
always really hard to find so definitely
a good place to come for that okay I
think I'm done I found some really good
bits so I'm gonna head downstairs and
hey at the chill but when I get home I
will show you guys everything that I
picked up it's a very full car right now
okay so now it's time for me to show you
my ten HomeSense finds from this
morning's haul and it looks really good
stuff I'm kind of surrounded by all so
let me just grab some things the first
things I knew I wanted with some fake
plants I've got some eucalyptus in the
hallway but I got it during Christmas
and it's got this like fake snow on it
and every time I walk past it I just
think it's so outdated so I got a couple
of sprigs of this like faux eucalyptus
which I just think looks so real I love
the color of it it's not like too green
I love eucalyptus so much because it
reminds me of my wedding bouquet so got
two of these the RRP I'm gonna tell you
anything that has the RRP on it which is
like the original price I will let you
know so I can tell you why I saved on it
so the original price was 339 and
HomeSense selling these for 199 so I've
got a couple of those by the way I was
genuinely blown away by how much this
all came to I thought it was going to be
way more so I was just really happy yeah
these are really cute and I thought I
could just pop them in a little VARs in
the hallway
second thing is a mat for our front door
because we still have the word from the
previous owners as I said and it's just
so scuffed up it's like torn and the
corner it's just really horrible so I
got this one there were so many to
choose from
this was $7.99 and it's got spots on it
and it says hello and I like it because
this kind of looks like the handwriting
that I use in my videos I love anything
polkadot at the moment this is also
really like sturdy one so I'm really
happy with that I think rich is really
gonna like that as well okay the next
thing I got from the kitchen section was
some Tupperware and I have needed some
for so long and I just kept putting off
buying any but I went for these ones
which first so I really like the blue
color of it but the mainly I like is
that they're glass bottom so it's glass
and awesome and then it's just a plastic
lid that clips on and these are so good
because you can meal prep like if you're
going to cook on a Sunday and I can make
lunches throughout throughout the week
or if we just make too much dinner every
one with the leftovers in here and I
find that they freeze really well they
can go in the fridge and it's just nicer
than plastic I think I went for two that
are this size it's kind of like the
medium and then I went for two of the
small ones as well these are more like
lunch size these are more dinner size
and I'm so happy with those I would
literally turn the corner to the top
where section and I was like yes I
forgot that I needed Tupperware but
would it tell you the price the big one
was $6.99 and the small one was $5.99 ok
the next thing is for this big wicker
basket I really wanted something to put
all my throws in because we have so many
I love a throw I love just putting it on
when I'm sitting on the sofa and getting
really cozy and homestead's had some
really nice throws as well but I'm
pretty sure if I bought one rich would
kill me so instead I bought something
very practical something to store all
our throws in I liked this one because
it wasn't too kind of warm
oranjee brown it's a bit of a kind of
gray color and it's gonna go really well
with our new floor I think it's got two
handles it's quite sturdy quite deep but
not too wide and we can just put all of
our throws in there
he looks so nice it by the fireplace
this was 1499 which is such a good value
okay the fifth item I'm just gonna grab
what's closest to me the lovely lady of
the till bubble wrap everything for me
which is really nice I wanted a new VARs
and this was very accurately this is
just a plain one I actually really like
that it's very light because we store
our visors above the kitchen and it's so
hard to like reach them if they're heavy
so I love that it's light I wanted one
that had quite a wide opening because
when you get a bunch of flowers
sometimes it's quite hard a lot of ours
have really small openings so I knew I
went to wrong with the wide opening I
like by cutting the stems and having
quite short flowers and I thought this
was a bit of an interesting shape sorry
that's clean you can't really see but
kind of goes in a bit at the top this
was only $9.99 and I think that's going
to come in really really handy you could
probably use this as a terrarium as well
and put some really nice colored stones
and succulents and stuff in there and
again I just love how lightweight it is
okay the sick I sent our have these
bowls and I just saw these and got so
excited they're definitely more of a
summary item I feel like summer party or
barbecues these would be perfect they're
gold on the outside and then a palm
print on the inside how cool is that I
think for nuts and crisps and like
little picky bits and olives these would
be perfect again very lightweight
perfect for like garden parties these
were $7.99 each and they had a lot of
palm print stuff in which I am just a
massive fan of so I'll definitely be
going back there when it is summer and I
need garden stuff still on the bold
thing we got some more bombs I just saw
these and thought oh my god these look
so luxury and it's so expensive and
lovely it's something you'd buy from
gorgeous like ceramics store and they're
only $4.99 each I can't believe it
there's beautiful great bowls I love
that they're kind of jaggedy if you can
kind of see they're not smooth and
rather edge I love that look so much and
I think they're the perfect size for
like pasta or like a curry anything like
that I love bowls that are wide
like really small bowls so I just got
two of these because I thought me and
rich normally just mean rich like having
dinner together and I just think they
are beautiful really nice and heavy
$4.99 like proper proper nice Bowl and
so two up to that point okay next up oh
this one's a bit heavy let me just take
the bubble wrap off I think you can kind
of guess what it is again from the faux
plant section this is so heavy
look how gorgeous this is I just loved
the gray I'm really into that kind of
concrete look at the moment smooth at
the bottom lines at the top and then
it's got a little bit of stones inside
but you can't really see then it's got
this really tool plan which I just think
it's really nice in like a corner of a
room or something like that or in my
office I haven't decided where this is
gonna go but it's so nice it would make
a good play door stop can you use plants
as a doorstop
probably not I'm just so impressed with
their like faux client sections
yeah I'm looking forward to styling that
in the room this was 1999 I've kind of
lost count at this point but I'm pretty
sure this is number nine I got two of
these massive pots
let me quickly pick up and show you and
then I can put it down and actually talk
to you about it looks like this and I
got two of them look how huge it is this
was oh my godness mercury this was
originally 21 pounds reduced to $14.99 I
love these look I feel like they'd be
really great in the garden you could
grow like cherry tomatoes and stuff in
there like filler Solan you know have
like a big plant but they can definitely
be used indoors as well that's why I
like them so I'm not sure yes I'm gonna
use them indoors or outdoors but I got
two so I thought it'd be nice for like
symmetry because if we do use them in
garden maybe like one on each side but
again that kind of gray concrete look I
absolutely love it and I found that the
garden section and just fell in love
with them straight away so massive
bargain on those two and then the final
thing I can't really show you it's like
behind me here if I'm gonna do a cutaway
I went to the section where all the side
tables were as you saw in the vlog and I
just thought this one that I chose was
so interesting because it's got the
section at the top where you can put
like a lamp and a coaster and your mug
and whatever bits you want on there
plant maybe but then it's also got the
section
below for magazines and I thought this
would be so nice it'd be practical it
looks good in our home because of the
wood and the kind of metal but it would
also look really nice to style it up so
I'm excited to have a play with that and
kind of style it I'll probably take it
Instagram to show you guys I am so happy
with that find I think it's so cool let
me just check the price at this one so
that was the most expensive thing that I
bought at $79.99 but I think it's
totally worth the investment and it
would be so much more expensive
elsewhere so those are my 10 HomeSense
finds and I really hope you guys enjoyed
this home wear haul please let me know
what your favorite item out of all the
10 things I bought are I would love to
