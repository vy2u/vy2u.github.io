Tuesday and I'm in Miami I am so happy
to be here I'm still in my pajamas I've
just on my hair and makeup but I am
still in my pajamas I am means Miami
since 2011 when I came here with my
family and so I'm so happy to be back
and kind of see a different side to it
now I'm a little bit more grown-up
I'm here with space and K and IG k and
the girls I'm here with our Kate Susie
and ceci I will link all of their
channels down below in the description
box I actually got here yesterday
afternoon we flew early Monday morning
and I said goodbye to rich I like
quarter 7 in the morning and then we
pretty much flew the whole day it was a
really long flight but actually the
flight was fine we were very lucky to
fly a business class which is amazing
and makes flying especially with someone
that scared to fly and it makes flying
so much better so the flight was fine
and we got here and we kind of showered
and changed and then just had an
afternoon of chillin went out for dinner
so I thought I would probably start the
vlog today because today and tomorrow is
when all the good stuff happens I'm just
waiting for breakfast to arrive I've got
breakfast in bed today hence where I've
stayed in my pajamas and we've got so
much fun stuff planned let me quickly
give you a tour of my hotel room and
then I'm gonna tell you everything that
we're gonna be getting up to we are
staying at the Mondrian Hotel which is
so beautiful this room is massive it's
like a proper suite right on the water
it's so beautiful so let me show you
I'll start from the entrance the whole
room is really bright and airy there's
this really nice little like kitchen
area here with a dining table and then
when you go straight there's this lounge
I mean how ridiculous huge sofa it's so
nice cuz we're all like chillin together
last night before we went out and little
areas to get ready there's a balcony and
if I come back here is the bathroom it
looks like this everything is fully
stocked like look at the shower
I'll show you guys those products in a
minute and then the bedroom it's through
here massive bed very comfortable had a
very good night's sleep in that last
night and yeah let me show you the view
outside the first thing I looked
when I came yesterday let me take you
outside nice and fresh this morning
so like down here is the swimming pool
this is the hotel and then look at this
view of the water and like Harper and oh
well it's so pretty look at that water
wow there's people swimming okay so let
me tell you a bit about why I'm actually
here because I said I'm here with
spacing KB you guys know that as a UK
brands you're probably thinking why are
you in Miami
spacing hey is actually launching igk
hair care in their stores from the first
efef it's available for pre-order now
but I think by the time this video goes
up it's gonna be available for you guys
to shop so I'll add the link down in the
description box but I'm so excited
because I love idk hair I discovered it
last year I think you guys would have
heard me talk about their dry shampoo
which I love also this one which is the
beach club texture spray this is great
as well I just love I think every
product I've tried for them I've pretty
much loved it's such a cool like young
funky brands I think it's really great
this facing kr taking them on and you
guys know I'm a massive fan of spacing k
I always have been like since you guys
have been watching my youtube channel
I've always loved space and K but even
before then when you didn't know me yet
I was shopping at Space NK my mom
introduced me to it a quite young age
because it's her favorite place to shop
too so that's like where I go for beauty
and I love it it's such a peaceful
enjoyable lovely shopping experience
everyone in space okay is always so
helpful and they just have the brands
that I want and like and I know I can go
there for kind of haircare skincare
makeup and just be sorted so I was very
excited when they invited me on this
trip I feel so honored I love working
with brands that I really really love
and have loved for years the whole thing
about space and K is that they traveled
the world to discover new brands so
they've brought us out here to Miami to
introduce us to igk a brand they are
bringing to the UK because they think
it's great and it really is so I can't
wait we're gonna be going to the salon
today to learn about the brand and get
our hair done
hence what my hair's looking so rubbish
I just think you haven't been able to
get your hands on IG k yet you're gonna
be so happy to get it
the UK because it's such a great brand I
love like all the cool names of the
products and they'll show you actually
because they left some products in my
room so I can show you what I've got
quite a few of them I've never tried
before so I'm really looking forward to
it so I just love meeting like founders
of brands and this brand looks like it
has some really cool founders I think
it's three guys three or four they
basically look like a band and they're
very cool so it's gonna be such a good
trip we've got the Sun on today and
we've got lunch we into the Arts
District my mum said is a really cool
area in Miami they were going on a yacht
tomorrow we've got a picnic or something
maybe like bowling night the itinerary
is packed I can show you actually they
left the itinerary on my bed let me
introduce you to a couple of the
products because they left so many in my
room first of all can we just
acknowledge that I have personalised
pillows how cool is that so when we got
here we had the itinerary all written
out which is very exciting this is like
their little thing no gluten no parabens
no sulfates no animal cruelty no boring
hair ever that's a little note these
were something I was so excited about I
didn't even know these exists so that's
these are charcoal dry shampoo hair
blotting tissues so they're little
individual tissues you can keep in your
handbag to like just blot the greasy
parts of your scalp
I mean genius and these are right at my
street these are the no frizz smoothing
hair wipes I mean you guys know you can
pretty much see now I always have like
frizzy roots so these are definitely
gonna come in handy I think that's just
such a clever idea got a comb and a
brush this I tried last night it's the
mistress hydrating hair balm it smells
like heaven it's like gorgeous coconut
really nice smoothing balm tried that
one already this is the rich-kid coconut
oil gel I don't think I've tried that
yet so I'm definitely a speak to them
today about which products right for me
this is the cool time they all have such
cool names and I love how they all have
different prints it's not just like one
of the same packaging I think that's a
genius this is a styling a primer that's
the texturizing spray that I've spoken
about before intern is a flexible
hairspray
everyone loves a hairspray down and out
is a dirty spray so I don't know exactly
how that differentiates from the texture
spray but I reckon it's like a bit more
intense and then let me take you into
the shower because there was some more
in here there is a shampoo conditioner
this is the hot girls hydrating range
perfect for my type of hair this is the
Loki cleansing wallnuts scalp scrub so
it's really good if you get a dry scalp
give it a bit of cleanse and this is the
expensive Alma oil high shine topcoat I
haven't tried that and it sounds great
also this shower is like very on brand I
have to say I'm just so happy to be here
and feeling very lucky as if they're
waiting for my breakfast to arrive I
ordered french toast and I'm gonna have
my breakfast and then I think we are
meeting downstairs to head out for the
day I'm not sure what to wear yet the
weather here is confusing it's like warm
but you can still wear jeans I don't
know so breakfast has arrived
orange juice oh we've got another igk
product this is our itinerary and then I
went for a french toast look how good
that looks here let me show you what I'm
wearing today hopefully I'll look better
once my hair is actually done and this
top is new from hmm it's a little bit
like big in places but I kind of like
it's got these like fluted sleeves and
it ties up so I can only really wear it
with like high-waisted thing so I'm
wearing my denim shorts and Topshop belt
and my Gucci loafers we're gonna be
having a picnic so we're gonna be
sitting on the floor so I thought shorts
were a good idea
so you come to the Design District em to
the idk felons first thing we're doing
today looking very cool in there that's
Kate Suzy's in here so idk actually
stands the initials on the founders
surname and you've got the two brothers
here who are their eyes
like before
pretty cough I'm just gonna get
I just said Mike waves maybe
what is that
we
done and I'm so lucky I got Frank one of
the founders to do my hair and he did an
incredible blow-dry and he felled my
hair
I'm really happy with it the salad is so
cool opponent Iran come here all the
time you're gonna get a photo my life
before and after now okay nice hair did
you enjoy it
ah she looks so good like coconut it's
not so good
see if he's got lizard
you come to this would win with wounds
which is a really cool kind of like pick
sneaky lunch area oh my God look so cool
guys look at this no like personal
picnic thing this is so cute
we're just having a little wonder around
the arts district there's so many like
like all the rules here painted graffiti
sub critical sort of taking photos
Instagram just got back to the hotel
feeling a little bit tired like this is
normally the time of day of my
jet-lagged kicks in a little bit but I
think we're gonna go sit down by the
pool we've got a bit of free time and
because we're looking a bit tired we
thought a little sit down by the pool
would be good I'm just wearing my igk
dressing-gown because I'm gonna put on
my swimsuit this I actually got from
next I really loved it let me show you
polka dot swimming costume the back
actually goes down a little low but I
normally don't like having my back out
but I will for this because I really
like it's got a little bit of padding in
it which is nice I normally can't wear
some customers that come in like set
sizes but I got this in a twelve and it
seems to fit alright I did fit in a ten
as well but I don't like them when
they're too tight so I'm gonna put this
on now and head down to the pool to see
everyone else here we got a little spot
by the pool i jus want to show you guys
I'm wearing this dress from a
reclamation Reformation was Isaiah
affirmation and there's no that's
realization far oh god no idea we're
married and this bag is from next fully
stocked ass with some cooler I love this
the Pina Colada one is so good
hula suncream queen of hungry miss it's
like you knew we got some frozen good
sorry to interrupt your chat Cheers
we had such a lovely time just sitting
by the pool I don't remember the last
time I sat by a pool and just like felt
the Sun on me just like felt the warmth
it was really really nice and we were
all just rested and catching up oh my
god I'm really well with all the girls
I'm here with so that was great it's
nice to just like soak up your
surroundings sometimes we spend a lot of
time taking photos but then every now
and again we want agreed you just need
to like stop taking photos and just sit
and like appreciate where you are so we
did that and then I came back to the
room I had a shower and I freshened up
my hair is still very much intact I love
it I actually love my hair you know when
you feel good in your hair
it just it feels like really good
quality I think there was the rich kid
stuff that he used when it was wet and
then again when it was dry it gave it
like a nice weight I'm just so happy
with it oh my god I wish he could do my
hair all the time he is in London next
week maybe I should try and track him
down so I've got ready I'm actually just
wearing my whistles t-shirt tonight and
jeans I'm gonna wear Blazers it's like
it will look kind of semi smart casual I
think tomorrow night is more of a dressy
night so I'm gonna save my dressier
outfit till then I'm just standing by
the window because there's the most
amazing sunset I mean seriously look how
gorgeous that is so I'm just gonna
finish getting ready and pull the things
I need in my handbag and then go meet
the other girls this is what I'm wearing
tonight
my whistles t-shirt Topshop blazer
Topshop jeans and Gucci loafers and
Chanel handbag and haven't actually worn
this outfit before but I really like it
I mean it's a shame that the only mirror
is in my bathroom so yes to see my
toilet but you get the idea we are
heading to a restaurant tonight tonight
with comodo don't like an Asian fusion
meant to be very nice apparently celeb
hangout so I hope today the best of
brownies in Miami that would be great
we finish dinner
I'm back in my hotel room but I'm gonna
vlog again tomorrow so I will see you
guys then
good morning guys I'm just about to head
downstairs we are having facials we're
having hydrating coconut milk facials to
launch to coincide with the launch of
cotton wool products called thirsty girl
coconut milk leave-in conditioner so
they're launching a new leave-in
conditioner and giving us coconut milk
facials to go with those so we're gonna
be hairy facials and some breakfast
downstairs and then I think we're coming
back getting ready and going on a yacht
not gonna lie I'm very nervous I get
really seasick but I've got this thing
where I feel like you can't just give up
and never do something again I think if
you grow up like your taste buds change
and maybe you can grow out of being
seasick I just feel like I need to give
it a go I asked and I don't think it's
the sort of thing where we're going out
to sea anchoring and then just rocking
phages I think we're like going places
and getting off so I'm gonna give it a
go I really hope I don't get seasick
because I will just ruin it for everyone
else and ruin the rest of the trip for
myself as well I probably won't be able
to go out tonight if I get seasick so
I'm really hoping that I'm okay I don't
wanna miss out I think it's gonna be
really beautiful so I'm gonna give that
a go wearing the realisation part dress
again I think I said it was from
Reformation yesterday I'm getting very
confused I actually had this really nice
dress from next that I was gonna wear it
looks like this it's red and stripy but
I kind of didn't take into account the
whole like swimming costume thing
and it looked kind of ridiculous because
it's an off the shoulder dress so I'm
wearing this again he had gotten to you
a road and we're going for a facial with
a brand I've never had
my skin is looking lovely so this is the
product that the facial was inspired by
it's the coconut milk leave-in
conditioner 24-hour frizz control I
swear all these products are like made
for my hair I'm so excited to use this
one as well you've come down to one of
these cabanas they're cooled in the
hotel by the pool and there's all this
amazing breakfast stuff laid out oh
definitely want some of that fruit
Christmas baby pictures probably seek
its gonna shaded it's like an IG k
hangout
we're moving guys this is Star Island
where all the stars live
we're turning the dough friends and
freak it out
goes around but he didn't call
we've just arrived this restaurant could
see spice and we're gonna go in for an
early dinner
there were all
watching great bravery
I'm breathing
we had such a fun time on the boat this
afternoon I'm so glad I wasn't sick it
was really really nice and then we went
to a really gorgeous place for dinner
and it was delicious and all the girls
are gonna come to my room in a minute
because we're having some hairstylist
come and use your hair mine definitely
needs some shushing we are going out
tonight I mean guys it's called it's
9:00 I am so ready for bed I'm very
jet-lagged but we're probably going to
this really cool Club that like doesn't
open till 12:00 and I can't be the like
only uncool person and I might get photo
so I'm gonna give it a go see how long I
can stay out for we are flying home
tomorrow so I don't want to be hungover
I'm gonna try and be conscious of that
but let's see I did not bring
appropriate clubbing outfit with me
because I didn't know your clubbing so
I'm gonna try and put something together
in my head getting the hair done Kate's
had a hair done looking good and I
didn't bring anything to wear clubbing
but I'm wearing this realization part
dress which is a little bit a little bit
granny like for the clubs and these
Topshop sandals but definitely not
clubbing outfit but nicer it nice dress
I like it I'm actually gonna leave the
camera here tonight because I haven't
really got space in my handbag and I
don't think it's gonna be very blog Abul
so yeah I picked you tomorrow morning
good morning one of the girls from IgG a
hair that if I wear my hair up in a
pineapple and top of my head it will
stay in place there is no hope for my
hair but it clearly looks good oh my god
my voice I'm not hungover because I
didn't actually drink last night because
they don't want to be dehydrated for the
flight home but I am like tired hungover
anyway I'm gonna start packing I've got
the greatest showman on full volume I'm
gonna start packing I've got a
conference call in about half an hour
then I'm gonna come back to you guys and
properly end this vlog last night it was
so funny if you saw on my Instagram
stories I actually saved as a highlight
so go to my Instagram stories click on
the one that says do club it was so
funny
guys I forgot to show you these these
are the new dry shampoo I think Anna is
gonna be very excited about these
so jetlag is the original one that I I
love it's the lightest in terms of like
how kind of powdering it is the lightest
and they've got two more pretty sure
it's in this order yeah first class it's
like slightly more strength it's like a
medium strength and then direct flight
which is like a lot heavier so depending
on how you like to dry shampoo which i
think it's really clever because some
people like a really light one and some
people like one that really makes their
hair quite like dirty feeling well not
dirty you know what I mean
anyway so those are new I'm gonna pack
them away in my case and take them home
to try okay I just did my conference
call Suzy's on her way to my room then
we're gonna quickly pop out I usually
some emails that my having brunch and
then we are heading to the airport I'm
gonna end my vlog here because I'm
pretty sure it's gonna be epically long
but I've had an unbelievable time I
really have genuinely had the best time
I know sometimes in these sort of vlogs
it always looks like people are having
the best time you ever really know if
they are this actually has been an
amazing trip I just want to say thank
you so much to Space NK for bringing me
