Christmas is trying really hard not to
happen in my house or open up to so many
disasters my dad has got what I had he's
really sick in bed and we're all trying
so hard to make sure my mom doesn't get
it because when my mom gets ill she gets
labyrinthitis and it lasts for like two
weeks and she's in charge of Christmas
this year so it would literally be the
end of Christmas if she got sick and the
lights of the Christmas tree have gone
so Richards out trying to find some more
small lights but everywhere sold out
being Hugh sold out which her sold out
so he got a tree with no lights dad's
sick we're having a huge Christmas
party's today with like all my parents
friends it's a little bit of a disaster
really but I'm off bowling with Jojo and
the kids and hopefully Richard be able
to meet us day after he's got some
lights so let's just hope that Christmas
happens I've never been bowling
early in my life there we go
sexy bowling shoes
hey bowling was fun Bailey won of course
and we're now gonna head home feeling a
bit weird I think all the drama from
this morning's made me feel a bit
anxious in a weird way feel a bit like
hot and funny but really go home for
some lights on the Christmas tree and
the probably loads people are not in my
house as well when I get home
I've just realized that when you guys
watch this video it's gonna be Christmas
Eve so I hope you're all having a lovely
Christmas Eve relax and enjoy it tonight
I can't believe this Christmas Day so
soon I am going to vlog in tomorrow on
actual Christmas Eve and that would be
going up Christmas Day at 6:30 p.m. so

thoroughly enjoying smooth Christmas

the weirdest Christmas present I've ever
heard of so hopefully he'll like it

ink pasta this tastes like fish it's
just kind of rich delicious little tree
has no fat on the top keep going back to
the cranberry because which has that
lunch so it's gonna get a savory crap it
doesn't very happy about it
trying to convince them there they are
good there's no queue so it's a sign oh

setup
okay Syd go christen Oh Chris I think
I'll start a Christmas present my buddy
Chris go Jake's Christmas presents done
we're gonna head back home because I bet
the party's in full swing with you
okay so that random clip was part of the
Christmas party there was just basically
lots of singing and drinking and it was
fun when I could really vlog it but now
I'm getting ready to go out to my own
little Christmas party with my friends
that I was telling you about so I'm
getting ready we have no idea how we're
getting there because I think me and
rich both want to kind of have a drink
while we're there so trying to think
about but it's Secret Santa and I've got
a little present here so I'm not going
to say who that's for oh no wait they'll
figure that out when they see the
wrapping paper whoops
we had like a 10 pound budget each so
that we found we're gonna play games and
have like mulled wine and cozy pub time
in an attempt to combat my greasy hair
I've put on some red lipstick always
helps to detract this detractor word
detract yeah detract from my greasy hair
ready we're really late we don't have
we're getting a run bus run I think
that's the plan I'd run to the bus stop
get the bus in and run from buster
it's probably the scariest walk to pop
I've ever done oh the good nothing
whoops right there Felix I was going to
run out and grab me wait can you good
decides no kids no grabs that grab you
Thanks and then I'll be left on myself
oh no can do Christmas dance just tell
you to do something and you'll do it and
you're instantly regretted but it's
magic he does it for the vlog does it
for you guys that's how much it has how
much Christmasy music can I put a warm
blog this is another Christmassy events
I feel like Hugh the Christmas music
here may be found buried Gemma a nice
Christmas jumpers slightly too classy
for my liking
because say that your that birthday is
not even a Christmas number that's just
a patent jumper look at rich robber
nesting here they wouldn't have failed
on the Christmas jumper fun again just
patent no I don't
okay tested is bestest
I've had such a lovely evening with
friends it was so nice like cozy pop and
then we like walked get hot drink and
basically some Christmas songs on the
way which is really funny and I think
people thought we were really strange
but I'm gonna end my vlog here it's so
way to think that it's Christmas Eve
when you guys are watching this so I
really really hope you have a lovely
Christmas day tomorrow and I won't be
offended if you don't watch my last vlog
because I don't think I'll be watching
YouTube on Christmas day but if you are
then my Christmas Eve blog will be
uploaded at 6:30 p.m. on Christmas Day I
don't know if I'm up to that much
tomorrow but hopefully doing something
Christmassy preparing for the big day
I'm so excited to relax and be with
family and friends and eat lots of food
of course I'll do my big thank-yous
tomorrow vlogmas has just been insane
