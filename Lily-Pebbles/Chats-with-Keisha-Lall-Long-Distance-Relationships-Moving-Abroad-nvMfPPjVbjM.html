Keisha you guys know if you've watched
my videos before she's been in them
before and she's always on my Instagram
and Twitter and stuff I hope all the
links to Keisha below by the way you
should follow her on Instagram because
she's great but if you're wondering who
she is in relation I've known quiche
since I was four since we're both four
we met school and we've been like best
friends ever since
and I'm in New York which is where
Keisha is currently living mm-hmm so as
soon as I'm doing a video a day I
thought like why not one of the day's
itself a casual chatter video with
quiche and talk about some subjects that
I can never talk about because I don't
have them if that Marian I haven't
experienced them and those subjects are
long-distance relationships check and
living abroad for work Keisha lives in
New York which is from London and her
boyfriend lives in Jamaica yeah so I
asked you guys on Twitter to send me
some questions there are a few but I
thought I've just trapped quiche about
some of these topics that you guys might
also have food yeah you might be able to
relate to exactly so first of all tell
them what you do for a joke a so I moved
to New York for to pursue modeling I was
doing it in London but the market for me
is better out here it's just bigger
there's more opportunity more jobs going
so that was my decision to come out here
and try and get more work really so when
did you move to New York
twelve
I think 2011-2012 was when I was sussing
out I came here to scout a few agencies
and then I signed as one a year later I
think I changed cousin tree working out
and then I've been here yeah 2013 three
years yeah okay so let's talk about
living abroad first before we do
long-distance relationship okay so your
first ever like stint your first like
when you move to New York yeah how was
it how did you feel okay so when I first
came to New York it was exciting
as well as nerve-wracking it was the
same industry I had experience in the
modeling industry in London but it was a
different vibe it's just different here
in New York
different level of professionalism and
how you're perceived and so I was trying
to happen to come trying to had to come
to terms with that yeah what about like
your living arrangements how did you
figure out like where you were gonna
live no I can't remember really I knew I
when I came here the first time I was
renting through a friend in Soho like
such an amazing area but the place was
the building was a little bit older than
it had mice you know there it was a few
times I was like on the floor with the
mice it was rough then I came and a few
weeks later there was hurricane sandy
so that killed the generator in my block
so all the power was gone the phone
service is gone the gas the heat the hot
water so how did you deal with all of
this like being here alone you'd buy the
key she doesn't really know people in
New York's and what you have friends or
families three friends yeah but like
when you first came you didn't have
anyone alone with all of this so my good
friend who's also a model in London L
she hooked me up with one of her model
friends called deville so you end up
just being with other models yeah which
is fine but you kind of also want to
broaden the horizon making friends is a
bit difficult anyway so how did like
communication with home and stuff it's
always it's good with technology and
whatsapp and FaceTime it was always good
like I think I called you crying all the
time that you guys back at home and
texting and it I was homesick it
definitely was a bit of an adjustment
for six months and did you a year yeah
because I mean I get really homesick so
yeah never but Gigi gets like a routine
of when to phone people and know you had
mmm I mean everyone's schedule is so
different plus the time difference so
once I'm kind of waking up you might be
in the middle of your day when I'm in
the middle of my day you're kind of
winding down but sometimes you catch
each other or you don't
so and it sometimes days go when you
just don't catch each other yeah so that
was it's not the worst thing cause you
kind of texted and you get reply but
that real one-to-one time is a little
bit difficult to schedule do you find
that you have to like adjust because I'm
personally not like a massive talk on
the phone kind of person but you have to
make that effort with someone when you
don't live near someone but you do have
more to talk about maybe like oh this
crazy person in New York this happened
and yeah or there's different job
environment or something that happened
but also with my job it's not working
every day so you have days when you're
doing nothing or waiting for work or
waiting for a class that you're just
like do I do
so what do you do and how do you deal
with like you get lonely ever how do you
deal with a lot of loneliness but you
just have to like embrace it and find
stuff to do it though it's reading or I
did working out I love to work out and
go to the gym and that was my kind of
escape and switch off and keep me busy
as well as helping me in my career
because you kind of have to keep fit
look good whatever then I started
cooking not I'm not the best chef but I
would just start cooking instead of like
ordering in you do you pick up your
habits I think and excuse the sirens in
the background it's New York it's that
guy naked in his window how long do you
find how long did it take you to get
used to like a different city so obvious
if you're from London you know how the
chief works you know where everything is
I think it's quite good coming from
London to New York because you'd have
the subway you're similar and it's easy
to get around whereas I was recently in
Miami and I thought okay there's kind of
a market here but how would I get around
there's no real very good transport I'm
sure the bus is fine but it's not as
easy and not more not what I'm used to
like the subway yeah so it's very easy
to get around to in New York and it was
it was okay yeah I adjusted quite well
yeah and it's very if it the city is
easy it's like a grid yeah so it is it's
a good City to move to yeah and also
apart from just like the emotional side
and mentality side of living and moving
abroad there's actually like the
logistical side of it and working abroad
you can't just go somewhere and work so
yeah how can you explain like a bit
about how you you have to come in a
working visa and now whichever one you
qualify and get is sponsored by your
employee okay so your employer oh yeah
so I so the agency did all the legal
work for me and I'm now on a visa
to work in it's like follow for three
years okay and then you renew or
whatever but I'm trying to find an
apartment I had see it was I could
catch-22 I had to get an apartment how
to have a bank account let's get a bank
account that's having address ah are you
gonna have one without the other
hi what did you do in the end I think I
paid them off I never you know the
neighborhood's when I first came in so I
went to oh this is what happened so in
Sandy yeah all the power cut and
everything so I went to another friend
of her friends who lived in Midtown and
we stayed in her apartment and I ended
up moving to that apartment block like I
kind of knew it and it was busy and it
felt safe and it was okay but then I
hated it's it's like living on the
equivalent of Oxford Street so like in a
really busy shopping at first it was
Macy's straight off straight opposite it
was just too much I lived there for two
years
so why do you think that the difference
between living and like a busy place how
do you how do you think that like
affected you because that so now
Keisha's moved to somewhere that's quite
a bit more residential yeah I just think
it was a bit weird because you walk
outside there's so many people hundreds
thousands of people and then you go up
to your room when you're just alone so I
think that contrasts are just kind of
like thrown in my face and it was just a
bit like yes so much going on outside
but there's nothing going on like with
me or around me so now when she went to
my place and I was a bit grim yeah it
was just dark there's no like daylight
and I think that was a factor as well
not enjoying where I was going home to
like I didn't really make it homely I
didn't put any things on the wall so yes
so it's important to make somewhere a
feel oh yeah that's like that's a good
question like how do you make like is a
home just where your stuff is or do you
have to make it and I had some way there
so what sort of things do you have you
done or do you find that helps make
something play make a place more homely
I think if you have a good like a good
knack for it for you yeah it's a vibe I
didn't really I kind of had the
mentality about oh I'm here to work and
I'm just gonna work and my life isn't
here but in reality my life was here I
didn't really accept it yeah for two
years that's true and I remember you not
it was always like pink Keisha's
temporarily in New York then you were
always in New York it's like you're just
a holiday here so once you actually
accepted
you lived here which I'm enjoying now
yeah like seriously I mean we'll talk
about Jamaica in a minute but going back
and forth London Jamaica New York you
never really had a hub no there's now if
this is the first time I've visited he's
just since she's moved and you have a
different attitude towards their hair
okay so let's talk about long distance
relationships Keisha's boyfriend lives
in Jamaica yeah we met in Jamaica you
met in Jamaica you know how do you know
we don't have to go into detail on how
you met they went through a friend yeah
so that's quite intense like having
long-distance relationships quite
intense anyway but you also you're also
not at home yeah you're you're away from
home and he's there so you basically got
like three locations in the end so we
actually have lots of questions yes so
questions let's start with those and see
where they take us beehive 76548 said
how do you remain focused on your work
abroad when you're missing your loved
one and that's a good question because
you're you're here for work so how do
you kind of con straight on that when
you just miss your boyfriend all the
time I kind of use that as my focus as
to why I'm here I'm here to earn money
to set myself up in a certain way so
that I can be with them so that we can
be together but you just I mean I've
done the whole oh I'm gonna be like here
for six more months and then if it
doesn't work it's not gonna happen I'm
gonna be here for three more months and
then I'm gonna be with you but you just
have to keep rolling with it how long
I've been together for four years this
August okay so a long time yeah but now
I'm kind of set like I'm just here for
the year like I'm just gonna do it and
see where it goes if it goes into next
year it goes into next year do you find
I was gonna like whenever I think of a
question I'm just gonna shout out do you
tend to think and talk about the future
or just focus on what's going on now no
we always kind of every time we
reconnect we're like so what's going on
with us and also with people like this
one getting engaged and my friends
moving in with our boyfriends getting
engaged marriage you know
no pregnancies yet but everything's
happening around me so I'm a bit like oh
I want to be there and I'm not I can be
but I'm not but that is my choice that
is our choice as well yeah but that's
also something in me it's a type of
person I
I don't want to move prematurely to
Jamaica and then be resentful that I
didn't really give modeling a good shot
so you have to kind of be strong and be
true to yourself as cheesy as it sounds
because you might end up resenting it
okay yeah that's a good yeah so your
best painful as it is like it's it's
bleeping hard yeah you just have to like
use it as the took really drive you so
your situation is a bit different I
guess a lot of long-distance
relationships might be because you met
online or that person to go away for
work and I guess they could have make
that decision where they end up but
you're you're here for work your home is
London so but now I have to make my home
here
yeah so it's weird cuz I don't have a
choice it's home you have three choices
Bailey may I make a heart of myself I
could be modeling as a perfectly fine
market in London where there's family
and friends and home and home right but
no I just choose to be here it's nearer
Jamaica so me and him on the same time
difference and we might be Miami last
week and it's like I can fly there Ike
if I hear it's nearer and cheaper and
quicker but that's a good point
so how'd you were in London because
you've been in London and being with
here so how do you deal with like the
time different that's really hard
because it's like nine hours time
difference yeah I know wait nine off
like five or six six hour time
difference till one of you is always
tired or something
yeah I mean we there we go days without
speaking because we're not coordinating
well but I have you guys so I'm like
you're right okay cool yeah Brazil
appeal
yes service so it's hard when you're
somewhere where you're alone yeah
because it's so much pressure on that
person chatting to you and entertaining
you yeah
there isn't anything to fall back on mmm
but he's at home he's oh so that's
different yeah I hate him for it you
don't even know you have your family and
friends so if you do have arguments all
couples have arguments very normal
how do you deal with having an argument
and not being face-to-face horrible yeah
because how do you want to be like oh
I'm so sorry
oh my god I never like oh I'm so sorry
I'm like when you resolve today when
he's not talking about that's a like
wrench storms out so probably along this
installation it would be great for
marriage because he's such a storm our
outer and I'm like oh
it's gone off in 1/2 again yeah yeah so
how do you resolve arguments if it's
like all on the phone and stuff well if
you have you're literally imagine you're
in the middle of a huge round what
happens next
did someone hang up or how does it work
sometimes I hung up sometimes if it's by
text my tone is just like oh she's angry
text oh that's another fate our
arguments come from a place of love I
think it's more like bickering because
we miss each other yeah so you mind
ourselves at that yeah I'm just arguing
because we miss each other yeah I mean
sometimes I can't just be out of line
and just pick a fight because I Do's
yeah I think it's just bickering and
like why haven't you responded to me you
know this is out of early stages as well
he would like be reading the text and
what's that but not replying so given
the time difference and he is like when
I was in London or manian even in New
York he has his own business so he's
like working constantly and very hard
and so read the text and not reply I'm
like look are you are you in the
relationship or you're not because you
make me feel needy and no one for the
effort and I was like it's a to it like
you have to find the balance as well the
dynamics to a relationship let alone a
long-distance relationship yeah I mean
they're hard as it is throw like
thousands of miles between you so how do
you avoid that because like even a
normal life
I feel like text the tone of her voice
is so misunderstood sometimes I send a
tape I'm like all that sounds so rude
and I didn't even mean it again I know
so if you're not it right mood to read
it yeah read it in a way that won't
argue and I'm like in a bad mood that I
just don't stop yeah I mean there
anything any to avoid no I didn't get
used to each other's tone you get used
to it but you also have to take a minute
and just be like is it worth reacting
the way I was going to watch I just know
Hannah said I've been in a long-distance
relationship but every time we say bye
my heart breaks any tips to make the
distance seemed less no like it's the
worst thing thing goodbye something I've
noticed though since being in New York
with Isha is that you guys like you
don't mess
only have like one big chat a day you
kind of just called each other like
every now and again I can't call him
that's so frustrating as well my phone
doesn't call Jamaica his phone calls us
numbers free oh no how annoying is so
that's why he calls you quite high we're
just walking down the street like Ike
and Matt in my head like 7 o'clock
should sit down and have a long deep
chat but actually she's walking down the
street Broadway like hey how's a day and
I'm like this is such a strange place to
have a cat John I assume after me how do
you do that you know really yeah I guess
those are you call in the middle of a
day and just whatever well rich calls me
every day at 12:00 when he's on his
lunch break and I aren't sir and go rich
I'm working I can't talk right now I'm
so mean but yeah I guess most couples do
but I just didn't expect that from a
long distance I thought it was gonna be
like an epic hourly chat once a day it's
more just my house yeah I was telling
bill that we want each other's company
so we kind of FaceTime and would like
stream a film or a TV program together
that's so you don't have to necessarily
talk you're just there to go just there
yeah together that's really sweet thank
God for FaceTime and telling you I don't
know if it's a tip but what helps me is
kind of when I'm leaving him or we're
leaving sure they have something to look
forward to
so for yourself so when I was leaving
him for Matt oh my god Lily's coming
next week that's great that wasn't
focused on just back to being apart
again and you know maybe if it's tiny
like oh I'm gonna be a geek here Captain
America Civil War is coming out I'm
gonna go watch it
so Emily's asked reunion anxiety advice
I haven't seen my boyfriend for 14
months as he's been traveling nervous
about seeing him again oh my god that
sucks that's a long time and also I
reckon four new long-distance
relationships it can be a bit like oh is
it gonna be awkward do I look all right
and you ever had that line I did yeah
I'd like oh I used to get butterflies
like landing and then like walking out
of costumes and I just be so smiley have
so much teeth oh so I just like like
shaky a bit dry mouth I was really
nervous when I first started seeing him
and then then Suzy plays it does it go
away was it just yeah it's a bit small
oaky like I remember it being like oh
and now it's like what's up so now when
you see each other is it like a big
reunion or is it like hey not really
he's not very PDA yeah where I'm like oh
not gonna offer and what are you like
hey no I want to be like jump when you
hug kiss whatever and he's like amazing
we talked so much as well that it
doesn't feel like we have so much a
catch on it just being in each other
company like then we'll just hold hands
oh yeah just that kind of physical being
next to each other that's nice but I
think we probably gonna wrap up this
video now if you do want to follow Kisha
and her travels and modeling and
relationship and good looking bikini
photos in Jamaica which will make you
feel depressed photos on Instagram and
Twitter and snapchat I'll link them all
below and stuff and thanks for being in
