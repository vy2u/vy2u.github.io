reluctantly it's Mother's Day so we
thought that we'd do a little video
together she's never properly been in a
video with me you've been on my vlogs
but unlike most moms she's actually
really into beauty I kind of get all my
beauty loving from her and my grandma
and she's like oh I don't use much stuff
but we have so much stuff here so I
thought we should just talk through some
of her favorite products because she is
quite opinionated when it comes to what
you use didn't think I was until I saw
it all so we're just gonna go through
some of my own favorite products and by
the way my mom does have a name it's
Carol okay
not just mom though okay so we start
with hair stuff took us through the
lives in new right yeah I try it so many
hair different pair shampoos but I
really like those this is the bumble and
bumble surf shampoo and conditioner you
were looking for something new quite
recently yeah there's got these stops
your hair just kind of go flat yeah
because unlike me I can't have too much
texture in my hair because already quite
a lot of texture mom doesn't like my
products way her hair down see breezy
texture so you like gummy texture yeah
yeah need more texture thing yeah so so
she likes those and then there's a spike
I must talk about this yes
what's a coach Mickey coil something
L'Oreal or leamanczyk oil in black cumin
all in all in cream what is it okay you
put it on after you've shampooed and
conditioned and it stops it going flying
and frizzy and crazy so if the shampoo
conditioner does Drive it your hair a
little bit that kind of like adds the
moisture back in yeah that's really nice
you only need a little bit and it goes a
long way and it doesn't make your hair
heavy I really like the original mythic
oil oil on the ends of my hair I think
it's a really good range I always like
the mythical oil stuff okay one more
thing from hair and this is your
favorite ever product alright this
little machine changed my life I've got
very very wavy hair and you can go may
just have to wash it every day
because it just went flat but now I look
like I've had a blood draw and I've done
it all by myself and it's really quick
that's the best thing because I'm I like
lots of products and stuff but I'm very
lazy so I like to do it all quickly able
as I get dead bored so this takes about
10 minutes blow-dry my hair you love it
you used to go to the hairdresser like
yeah every week and then she tried this
and she doesn't have to anymore we
haven't even said what it is it is the
fabulous physique with big hair oh yeah
I've had the odd moment when it's all
got caught up but then you just reverse
them so you turn it on and the big brush
spins and you can kind of blow-dry your
own hair which makes it much easier if
you're not good at mojo I know I have
and now I'm really really look good at
blow-dry my own hair so that's so easy
it's great there you go okay so let's go
into skincare now it's probably her
biggest category of products she doesn't
use much makeup use much makeup do you
but skincare is her thing and you're
gonna recognize the Logging's products
we have very similar taste in skincare
and a lot of the brands I love her
because she told me to try them so
cleansers to cleansers here
Oscar Renaissance cleansing gel which I
recommend it to you do you like this one
yes I like both of them I like that one
when my face feels really dirty if I
like being outside and in the city
industry my face just feels dirty no
that's lovely and it's just so lovely to
use and get your makeup off but I feel
my face gets big cosmic cleaner after
that Liz Earle cleanse and polish
so my next gigs a lot of people say this
kit for like really young skin and it's
not you don't either so a lot of smell
mmm it does smell nice I know you mean
it makes the skin feel clean it's cuz
it's creamy but this is more oily no I
think also maybe cuz got eucalyptus
fresh yeah it's fresh nice and you have
another little product as well there's
all farm over here this is the gentle
face exfoliator
I've never tried this no it's nice is it
what's it like is it quite um gritty a
bit how about no it's really smooth but
it again it kind of washes oh yeah it
feels like an oatmeal exfoliator a bit
that first apt would not I've got and
it's got so it's got you my mom again it
smells like that the shower gel you
don't know what I made you Troy yes good
love Liz man oh that's really nice
actually
it makes me hang close so yeah so how
often do you throw d8 when I run a week
in my head just once a week really it's
about once every three weeks whenever
you just feel yeah yeah okay and but
this is also expecting a ting use this
morning than this is the pixie glow
tonic which I also love I use that in
the morning because I can't be bothered
to cleanse my face again it's really
good it's like exfoliating toner i video
this is well this is like the newer
packaging okay oh and then if you don't
use that well wait you've got two
servants here yes okay explain the serum
this one I've been using for ages good
jeans and I really loved it but however
little I use I find I'm just going
through it so quickly I agree and it's
so expensive and it's like Oh for three
or four weeks and I finished it again
yeah so I have an old friend we've been
friends for a long long time her name's
Michelle Rock O'Neil you know the
therapy bath salts they always go on
about she makes those yeah known for her
forever and I rang her up and because I
have facials with her and I said please
can you make me a serum and she's made
me this serum and I'm just so in love
with it that Mister good jeans has been
away for a while
so what what is it like it's like like
heaven it says it's very oily isn't it
it's chromotherapy oil so it just sinks
into your skin you doesn't fit away
that's all of it it's more like a
treatment yeah a treatment skin just
glows office smells like they remember
therapy but both wheels yeah it's just
gives you a lovely sense of well-being
every morning and night use that morning
and night I do now because I love it so
much
what's up skin do you have dry
dehydrated yeah yeah it seems me yeah we
love oils and then moisturizer I use so
Chapman we love Sarah chap me loves
Sarah Chapman and it's any problem yeah
again you don't know when you finished
it it's so annoying
it feels a bit heavier if this was Sarah
Chapman if you hold it up to the Sun
sometimes you can move in on this one in
this in the serum you can see this one
probably not it is a nine okay I cream
thank you I just got a lot of stuff for
the eye serum I even used this this is
awesome yeah I wonder I serum did you
just buy this one space okay crazy cop
Beauty so every time I make a copy to
order this you like 360 but I was on
holiday I went to the pink hotel and I
had a facial there and they use oski and
they used that oh that's what I first
used there I like this is great it's
last for ages because you needs a tiny
tiny little bit to use that morning and
night yeah I need to start using then I
used my new little roller with it as a
Jade roller which is your once again
from copy.c yeah this is amazing because
I Michelle uses it in her facials so it
stays cold this hasn't been anywhere
near a fridge it stays cold all the time
it's really good if you have like puffy
eyes isn't it in the morning put that on
and it's good for lifting the old droopy
old eyebrows
it's binding every morning okay
make up the fans makeup thing which are
that you have to mention ticket there
isn't oh it's amazing you know I never
really finished any products cuz I use
so many the hourglass ambient lighting
blush in mood exposure she's I mean the
writing's rubbed off that's not she's
useless and she's completely finished it
she just bought new one like she's hit
the bottom where it's like a grid I
thought you're meant to finish me you
are I'm really impressed the fill is a
blush I've so many blushes I never
finish brushes and so this is her fave
blush yeah I love that just put another
one yeah you can probably use a bit more
from the side you could use as an
eyeshadow you know really it's like a
nice movie naturally blush not good on
eyeshadow today all night have you got
that on today yeah oh I was impressed to
see these in your stash Charlotte will
be rock and coal eyeliners a nude one
and Barbarella Brown and so how do you
use these this is for life special I
look really tired so that get inside my
wherever it's called
like waterline was aligned oh okay that
goes in there yes that's good
it like breaks inside and I use this
when I really can't be bothered to use
any other makeup and I just put a bit of
eyeliner on in it yes couldn't you kind
of smudge it in brown suits you cheese
and brown eyeshadow as well and for your
skin
use the Albourne CC cream yeah what's
this like I've used tried so many
foundations and I hate that heavy
feeling yeah and this is this is just
goes on like oh it feels just delicious
do you use your hands to apply it yeah
it's so soft and silky oh yeah it's nice
that she's got the kind of cause--'cause
lip to it yes white silicone feeling so
you just feel like you're actually
wearing another moisturizer a bit of
cover yeah it's kind of just like it's
into my story but it's a bit more cover
than tinted moisturizer and then for
anyone's extra coverage you use the NARS
creamy radiant concealer do I recommend
this to you like you like it
thank you so much it's good isn't it
good coverage but it's still glowy he's
not doesn't give you that concealer
ewwww
yeah this doesn't feel heavy I hate
heavy do you use your fingers to blend
it or brush good no it's good to use
fingers and that's what you make my lips
message around tummy
okay we have three more things these are
more like lifestyle things is every time
well like let's just do these all about
this one okay so first of all this
shriveled up thing yeah cuz I finish it
this way I'm very good person
that's the ESOP hand cream which one is
it resurrection gorgeous so lovely so
this lives on your bedside table yes it
could buy a big one but this one goes in
my handbag and she loves a good hand
cream whenever I get any kind of hand
cream it gets stolen by her love hand
cream and perfumes she has a lot of
protein as I said you could only pick
one ultimate favorite and you guys gonna
love this because she picked diptych
Philosopher's this is in the old
packaging and but that's my favourite
perfume too you know they're never
really smell on me but everyone goes oh
you smell so nice and it must be really
nice I think I did copy you with this
you
when did you must have discovered it tea
ages ago so I'm gonna be for wandering
in it for years
yeah okay yeah so this is the thick
perfume and I definitely got my love of
fake from you
and then what's that then this is the
prints freehand or shine from ease up
ease up yes because it's a and I keep it
in my pocket and take it everywhere so
it's like a hands on it yeah but it
doesn't hasn't got any horrible stuff in
it so it doesn't dry all your hands out
yeah because the alcohol ones are
horrible they stink animate your hands
dry and last for ages honey life's
better than yeah my niece I always
put in hand sometimes and run yes keeps
it over Hamburg yeah that's a good one
actually so you don't need any water or
anything okay I think that's everything
put other products but good products a
lot of ones that we have the same but I
thought you guys might enjoy hearing
some of my mom's favorite products soon

all having a nice day with your mom's
