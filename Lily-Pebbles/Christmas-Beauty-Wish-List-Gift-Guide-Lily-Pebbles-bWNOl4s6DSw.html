we're all getting a little bit excited
for Christmas and counting down to the
big day I always find it a little bit
strange though because my birthday is
the ninth or December so I never really
get that excited about Christmas until
my birthday has come and passed and then
Christmas is the next big thing but I
know that you guys have been desperate
to see my Christmas gift guide and wish
list this year so christmas has come
early for me I've put the twinkle lights
up I've got my Christmas onesie on my
boilers broken so it really does feel
like Christmas and I'm ready to run
through some bits with you I've got
about 15 items in my gift guide this
year and it's kind of more of a wish
list because it is mainly beauty
products and products that I know you
guys are going to want to ask for this
year so i'm calling it a wish list
instead of a gift guide i've mentioned
in past videos that me and my family did
christmas presents a bit different we
don't go like crazy over-the-top we used
to when i was younger but now we're all
grown up in adults we do Secret Santa so
we will pick one name out of a hat and
spend 35 pounds on a present for that
one person so I find big crazy gift
guide videos a bit strange but I know
that everyone has a different way of
doing Christmas and different budgets so
I've tries to put a range of products in
here from cheaper to more expensive and
hopefully there's some things for you to
add to your wish list so I'm going to
start from the cheapest and work my way
up first up is this really cute little
cracker from this works this is the
breathe cracker I love this works
products you can get them a space in K
and they're just so there's such good
quality app so you love them in here is
the deep sleep body therapy so it's like
a body product you can put on it smells
like lavender and chamomile and it's
really good for people that like cozy
spa-like products and maybe those who
struggle to sleep it's just a really
cute little like stocking filler
actually I'm not going to save things
are stocking fillers or main presents
because like I said everyone has
different budgets but it just looks
really cute and the products inside is
great which is good for a cracker
normally the stuff inside a bit rubbish
OPI have loads of gift sets out for
Christmas but the one that I really like
is this one and its fairest of them all
it comes in a cute little box and it has
a mini coca-cola polar bear inside it's
a collaboration with coca-cola and it's
so cute first of all comes in a box so
it's easy to wrap priorities seriously
and with the little cute polar bear you
get a nail polish and this one is like
red and white and sparkly and it kind of
looks like it just looks like the
coca-cola christmas ad it's like snowy
and red and different to anything I've
seen before I love nail polish for any
sort of nail polish addict I think they
would love this as a gift it's 10 miles
95 and I just think it's really really
sweet I wanted to add in a booth as one
of my gift suggestions I don't know how
you said boom or boom it's kind of hard
to pronounce but it's basically a
personalization marshmallow service
really struggling to speak today they
have a pop-up currently in Selfridges
you can also get them online and it's
basically nine marshmallows in a box
with your photos on so you can upload
your Instagram photos or any photos you
like and it may seem a bit kind of
novelty but I boss if my nephew fight
for his birthday he's five he obviously
loves seeing his face of marshmallows
but my sister and her friends were like
going crazy they were so impressed with
it and I think adults actually would
love it as well you can get creative put
whatever you want on its fifteen pounds
fifty comes in a really nice box I think
it makes a kind of different nice
personalized touch for a gift okay next
up another product from this works I
don't normally put two of the same brand
and a gift guide I love this works and
they're kind of spa like cozy products
are just perfect for this time of year
and so good for a Christmas present this
is their deep sleep pillow talk they do
really good sets around Christmas and
it's a good time to try the brand if you
haven't before in here you get a pillow
spray and stress less rollable which are
two of my favorite products from the
brand the pillow spray is so nice if you
just spray it on your pear before you go
to bed and you drift off into this
really nice kind of relaxing sleep and
the rollerball I actually use on flights
come bit of a nervous flyer but it's so
nice you could put it on your wrists or
behind your ears and it just smells
delicious it's great if you're on a tube
and it smells or I just carry with me at
all times this is a really cute little
set and it's 22 pounds keep it on the
luxury spa like products and you'll see
quite a few of these in here because
there's this up for us that I really
like to get at Christmas and my mom and
my grandma and my auntie and my sisters
were all very into these sort products
so I'm kind of basing it on that this is
from aromatherapy associates and it's
their bath jewels I have all their bath
oils that I absolutely love them you
only need a tiny amount and it fills the
whole bathroom with the most amazing
scent it makes your skin feels so soft
and they're really great quality this is
one of their Christmas sets and
pull it like this and inside are three
of their most popular bath oils and
three of my favorites relax deep revive
morning and destress mind they're so
good this is a really decent size
because you really only need a few drops
so their last a really long time it's a
great way to try the brand if you
haven't before it's a great gift for
anyone who likes to take baths seriously
I can't recommend these highly enough
benefit have loads of different
Christmas steps out this year but the
one that I really like and my pick would
be this one which is their cheeky sweet
spot it looks like this you really
wouldn't have any idea this was makeup
if you looked at it for you open this up
I'll show you what's inside inside is
this which basically looks the same as
you how to cover but it's tin so you can
keep it afterwards and you open it up
like this and inside you have five
blushes one bronzer and one highlighter
it's so good 29 pound fifty which you
get so much for your money with this the
box blushes and bronzers from benefit
are so good and these have some of my
favorites in it who know which is a
great matte bronzer coralista which is a
gorgeous coral blush rockateur which is
more rosy better bambo which is quite
bright pink dandelion which is really
good for those with pale skin and sugar
bomb which I haven't tried but it's like
a mix of four high lady blushes there's
also a little Watts up highlighter in
the corner which again is one of my
favorite products and benefit I think
this is such a great set for anyone who
loves makeup if you're into benefit oh
my god I'd definitely add this to your
list I think it's so cute I have a
couple of hair tools in this gift guide
and the first one is from porn and it's
their style and go hair dryer now this
is really clever you know when you're on
holiday and you go into the hotel and
the hairdryer that they supply is always
so rubbish it literally like like blows
a tiny amount of air and especially if
you have too thick hair like me it's
just not going to work this is a travel
hair dryer so it looks like this folded
in half and you just pop that up and
that's the hair dryer is so many it's so
great it's like a proper hair dryer it's
not like a rubber seal is the one that
you kind of get in Topshop is like a
Christmas gift this is a proper hair
dryer and it's just mini and it has like
two different settings it's great it's a
born product born products are great and
it's just a mini version of a proper
hair dryer genius so good for people who
travel a lot people who have to do their
hair a lot like me and can't leave it's
dry naturally and
70 30 pounds which is so good like if
you're doing secret santa like me my
budgets 35 pounds which is hard to find
something good for that and I think this
would make a great present I'll pop the
links where you can get all these
products below in the description box
the next suggestion for a gift is
actually a phone case I think receiving
a phone case is a really nice present
because it's not the sort of thing you
really want to buy for yourself and
spend your own money on because it
doesn't really feel like the necessity
it's more like a treat yourself and you
feel a little bit guilty especially for
the more expensive ones like kate spade
i love kate spade phone cases i had one
before last Christmas I had like a pinky
one and this time I've got this one
which i bought from New York it's gold
and it's a mirror so you can use it as
mirror and it says hello sunshine I
actually got this in New York but they
might do it here as well there is a Kate
space store in Covent Garden you can get
Kate Spade phone cases in the apple
store you can get them online sometimes
self would just stock them they're kind
of scattered all over the place they're
35 pounds so they're not that cheap but
they're so good they're really good
quality they last and I always get
compliments on this especially by you
guys so I think it's really nice and I
think this cute gift comes in a cute
little box next up is a gift suggestion
I think I could suggest every year for
the next ten years it's always going to
be a great gift to buy for any occasion
they're the urban decay naked palette
these are mine there are three the naked
one The Naked 2 and then 83 make it two
naked 3 anyone who's into makeup if you
don't own one of these add it to your
wish list if you're watching this for
your girlfriend and they don't have one
of these get her one you don't need all
three they're basically suited for
different skin tones I don't know I have
all 3 i'm just a makeup addict the naked
one is kind of the all-rounder for like
anyone would like this one if you're not
sure then go for the naked one it's got
a really nice range of like bronzy tones
it's mainly warm but it's so easy to
wear quality of these shadows are just
incredible you've probably heard me
speak about these million times before
but they're so buttery and great to use
the Naked 2 is more of a cool tone
palette so it's got the topes it's got a
few goals in there as well again a
gorgeous palette they're all nice and
the naked 3 is more of like a rosy
collection of purples and plums and
Pink's very shimmery very pretty they're
all nice you just have to pick the one
suit your skin tone there are 37
each which i think is a really good
price for a Christmas present and
they're going to last for years it'd be
like the best thing you own in your
makeup collection so I think that should
be an everyone's gift guide this year I
genuinely think i could put those
pallets in my gift guide every year if
you have the Naked palette already and
you were looking for some other palettes
to add to your wish this there are a
couple from NARS i would suggest first
one isn't new they're still available
online on the nas website and i've seen
on a few different websites as well so i
wanted to recommend it it's the
narcissist eyeshadow palette it's so
nice if you're a big NARS fan and you're
like eye shadow this is a good one it's
got all these shades here a lot of kind
of cool tone and warm tone really good
quality buttery eyeshadows I find myself
reaching for this one a lot and using it
like a weekly basis I thought this would
sell out and I think it did they bought
some back and I keep seeing people tweet
me seeing their board sits there
definitely still some available online
this palette is 45 pounds its bit more
expensive than the Urban Decay one if
you're an ass fan though it's really
great if you already have that one and
you wanted something new the nos have
also brought out their virtual
domination palette this is exclusive to
spacing k this Christmas hopefully it
hasn't sold out yet they always sell out
I literally ran out to buy mine they
seem to have quite a few in stock so
maybe they're prepared this year it
looks like this it has a hard case and
it's kind of white cracked and snow
flaky it's really nice and this is a
cheek palette so it has the three
blushes one highlight and one bronzer
normally with these things there's
always kind of one shade a bit like
about but this one has all good shades
it has Miss Liberty highlighter which is
really nice and sparkly for Christmas
deepthroat blush which is my favorite
kind of pinky blush NARS Laguna which is
a really nice bronzer it's matt it's
easy to wear it suits almost anyone and
then two new exclusive blush shades
which i think is really cool especially
if your nas fan and you have a lot of
niles products and you're going to get
two new exclusive shades in this palette
it's 55 pounds you can get it a spacing
k if you're an arse fan and your blush a
fan you need this one so I recently
visited the lush spa on Kings Road and I
was really blown away I don't know what
I was expecting but it wasn't so much
better than I was expecting they do
really nice treatments downstairs in
this bar so you go into the lush store
but they actually have a spot downstairs
and they do all these amazing different
treatments one has like beetle
music playing and you get warm pajamas
and a hot water bottle so many different
treatments to pick from and you can
actually buy lush vouchers so it looks
like this and you can buy them in fives
so you can get as much as you want but
the treatment that I'm going to get with
my mom for her birthday called hard
day's night is actually 75 pounds so
that's kind of how much the treatments
are but the matches look like this they
say lush spa and I think that's a really
nice gift to someone who maybe doesn't
have time to treat themselves to a spa
treatment I'm taking my mom and I think
she's going to love it it's something a
bit different something you can open and
still look forward to going to have
later on and you can get it for as much
as you like so that's the lush voucher
now we're getting to the really
expensive stuff this is 89 pounds from
Bobbi Brown but man it is amazing this
is their travel brush set it comes in
this really cute little kind of it's
like a clutch or like a little purse
brown like leather record I'll so
luxurious you open it up with the popper
and inside you have a travel brush set
it's all like camel and gold and brown
and it just is so beautiful as part of
their Christmas gifting collection you
get a range of different brushes an
angled brush and lip brush and eyeshadow
blender a face a contour brush another
eyeshadow brush and a concealer brush I
kind of just made up what those are for
but you could probably use them for
loads of different things the quality of
this is unreal I mean I can't even
imagine getting this as a gift we don't
do gifts this expensive in my family but
if I got that as a gift wow I would be
so so happy i think if this is within
your budget is a really beautiful gift
to receive suddenly any girl who has
make up with need travel brushes are
really hard good travel brushes are hard
to come by and bobby brown brushes are
obviously really amazing quality so i
think that is a great one if it's within
your budget I have another hair tool to
recommend and this one is really special
I wouldn't normally spend like 120
pounds on a Christmas gift but if you
are then I think this one as i said is
really special it's from fabulous and
it's their curls eek retire if you've
seen these before but it's really clever
you take a bit of hair you like trap it
in it sucks it up hits it in a cool and
a roller you let go and then you
your kool it's so easy if you know
someone that doesn't like using tongs or
curling their hair or if you have really
long hair and you just don't know how to
curl it this is the answer to your
problems it is amazing I think this
would make a great Christmas gift it's
something really different and fun and
will last you years and you'll get a lot
out of it so Babel is curl secret
definitely recommend that 120 pounds
finally I want to show you what
Charlotte Tilbury has on offer for
Christmas this year because she has
loads of different Christmas gift sets
going on so I thought the best ways for
me to take you to the Charlotte Tilbury
counter and selfridges I grabbed my
vlogging camera and headed down there so
I'm going to insert a clip now of me at
the cancer so I'm at the charlotte
tilbury makeup counter in Selfridges and
I want to show you guys what they've got
on with the Christmas the CM prepare
first thing they have is the new
supermodel collection and it's a picking
you make relation with a new palette and
a new lipstick and it comes in a really
special box that has a video so when you
open it up it gives you a video and
shows you how to apply the makeup which
is genius they also have an option to
buy a look in a box so you can pick any
of them looks have all these different
makeup looked and you can buy that whole
look in a box and that also comes with
their new makeup bag which is absolutely
gorgeous and I think that's a really
good option for your boyfriend or
husband wide view because the girls at
the counter really
if you bring in a photo of your
girlfriend or wife no look what she
looks like and say which lucas's her
best which is really great they also
have another gifting option which is a
really cute little bag and you can pick
whatever bits you want to put in there

some eyeliners or even get like a little
lip you can put whatever you want in

good things to add to your wish list or

wife then maybe you found some things to
buy for her now that I'm in my onesie
