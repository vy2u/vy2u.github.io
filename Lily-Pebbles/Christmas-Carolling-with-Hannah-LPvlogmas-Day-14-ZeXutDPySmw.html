rich left at like 5:00 this morning and
woke me up so I'm feeling a bit tired
but I'm up and I've got so much filming
to do so let's get on with it
it's vlogmas day 40
I'm just exporting and uploading
yesterday's vlog I don't really fancy
chocolate yet so I think I'm gonna save
my dairy makan for this afternoon
I still haven't open my tart so everyone
I'm gonna ends up opening all in one go
and I'm gonna open my Jo Malone one so
let's look for number 14 what's in
today's Earl Grey and cucumber oh I
really like that one that one came out
with like a limited edition collection
I think it's permanent now but really
nice and fresh before I get ready I'm
gonna go around and pick out my December
favorites products because that's what
I'm gonna film today I know it's only
the 14th and that seems really early but
obviously there's that week for
Christmas where I'm not gonna be working
so I need to film it now and it's been
well over a month since I filmed my last
one because I had to put my last one
early so it's still like a month's worth
the favorites if that makes sense say
I'm gonna go gather my products now I'm
just gonna do my hair and makeup and I
decided I'd really need to get a light
that light either comes off the wall
or something that's like a natural light
it looks bright in the camera I think
it's good my arm though is actually
really high up I didn't realize but
because the windows here is behind me
when I do my makeup it's really hard to
see what I'm doing I really need like a
bright kind of daylight bulb in front of
me I have no clever way of having a
camera set up here so I could film me
doing my makeup because the table is too
low so I'm just gonna get on with it
pile on the makeup because I'm filming
and I will come straight back to you I
always find it such a struggle to vlog
when I'm filming like main channel
videos main channel I only have one
channel main videos because I just kind
of need to get into the zone and set up
and do my thing
and I forget to vlog so I will try my
best not to but I'm basically just
setting up now my lights and camera
trying to get it so I've got the
Christmas tree in the background it's
quite hard but I'm getting there I'm
just going to put the light here
everything is set up now I have a light
in front of me behind me a Christmas
tree somewhere there and all my products
Nate's me which I'm not going to show
you because I don't want to ruin it the
December favorites won't be coming till
the end of the month I'm wearing the
Charlotte Tilbury Bond girl and I
haven't done a sit-down video for a
while so let's give this a go I've just
finished the filming the talking bit the
favourites and it's really hard like
I've got definitely got a cold coming on
and I'm all bummed up and it's hard to
like talk that much I feel like I lose
breath and I lose my voice talking and
also I get so hot one of those studio
lights so I'm just gonna take a quick
break and then I'm gonna film at the
cutaways I was gonna film my 2015
favorites today but didn't know if I
have the energy if both your cutaways
for another video as well we've put the
news on because the silence is killing
me and I'm now just going to do some
cutaways of the products on my marble
table hopefully the tree in the
background just made a mid-morning snack
of hermos and pizza bread also I've been
munching away at these pickles that we
have in our fridge now I just like to
say that you can eat pickles and not be
pregnant this is not aimed at you guys
like friends of family we tell I'm like
no pickle is that are you pregnant no I
just like pickles this is a mess of
casas ways now I'm gonna edit a bit so I
can see where I'm at I've got such like
a red coldy looking face very annoying
I'm sitting on the sofa to edit my
videos I don't normally do this but I
usually use my desktop for videos but
because I'm doing vlogmas and
everything's on my laptop it's kind of
easier just to keep it all on one then
keep switching it so going through my
Christmas party look video which is
gonna be up on Sunday and editing that
I'm really sorry that's not like
perfectly beautiful get ready with me I
just I find it really hard to do main
videos to your blog list but hopefully
it's just something nice but I get
really angry when I get ill I haven't
got time for it I just pulled out our
medicine cabinet thing lemsip back
that sounds about right let's take some
of these cold and flu capsules I can't
leave a deal with this mess right now I
don't even know it stop I'm gonna
quickly tidy up so I can make myself
some lunch
I'm gonna make myself a strange kind of
lunch of Pittsburgh humus salami pon ham
pickles and olives and I'm gonna try and
get a good Instagram of it as well I
have an Instagram for a couple of days
this is my very random lunch of pickled
salami Parma ham olives pits Burton
hummus very random but it's really what
I fancy hello vlogmas friends a couple
of hours have now passed I'm still in
the same position I've eaten more
pickles and pizza bread and orange juice
trying to get the vitamin C in there and
I'm editing my December favorites video
that I filmed this morning just chugging
along it's about three o'clock now I am
going out tonight I'm going to a Carol
concert it's with the charity look good
feel better that me and Anna do some
work with and I'm taking my friend
Hannah
it was hard to say Anna and Hannah when
you have a cold I make them sound
different I'm taking Hannah after work
and I think I'll be really nice haven't
been to a Caroll concerts it's like my
school days where we used to do them
every year and I love singing I love
singing carols and churches and stuff
like that it'll feel very Christmassy

the carol concert tonight I'm exhausted
I feel rough we'll try some of these
emergency things because Anna swears by
them I didn't realize they were thinking
of to mix either drink I don't think I'm
gonna like it but let's try we've gone
for the Ziggy lemon flavor over
strawberry strawberry sounds quirks
I hate strawberry flavored things weird
observation I like real strawberry it's
not strawberry flavored stuff like
strawberry ice cream is the worst okay
oh my god this day alright like really
really really strong lemons not bad
definitely had worse I'm gonna crack out
my Uniqlo heatTech top because gets
freezing and I want to wear it under my
jumper I'm only really going out with
Hannah tonight so don't really care what
I look like and it's not it's not about
me it's about a charity Carol concert
but other than tonight normally when I
have a cold I'm really struggle to keep
the area and we know is not bread I've
tried like putting concealer and then
setting the powder but obviously when
you're blind and knows that sniffing
always goes red
no one knows any good makeup tricks for
hiding the fact you have a cold I don't
mind if I feel like crap I don't want to
look like crap up the whole time then it
makes me feel like crap let me know
you're cold makeup tips please all right
I think I'm ready to leave the house and
have some human interaction I'm gonna
meet interaction interaction I'm gonna
meet Hannah after work but I'm gonna
head into town a little bit early
because I want to go to H&amp;amp;M home our
bedroom is just feeling so cold and dull
I really want to get curtains in the New
Year but until then I feel like we need
some nice cushions and throws on our bed
rich hates the idea because he's like
what there's another bed you have to
take off every night but I think it
makes such a difference to the bedroom
so I'm gonna look in H&amp;amp;M home I need to
go to movies to get a clear plastic
wallet for Wednesday when I go away and
also I think if I stay at home any
longer I will fall asleep so I'm gonna
head out now if I was still living at
home my mom would say wrap up warm keep
your neck covered always will get even
more ill so I've wrapped my neck up I
don't have a sensible hat my hats got a
penguin on it and it's just too
ridiculous for a church Carol concert
I've got my neck all wrapped up a little
gloves in my pocket and I'm wearing ugg
boots so keeping warm people
Germantown can be very embarrassing blog
you know off the street I'm gonna head
into Muji now I wanna get the stationery
and I wanna get a clear bag yeah the guy
Muji told me that they've stopped doing
the clear plastic Airport bags which is
really weird cuz I've only ever bought
them from there so I have no idea now
where to get one I bought some other mr.
moody I'll show you both later I got
some really good stuff from H&amp;amp;M home
I'll show you and I'm home but I just
checked in the MOOC the mirror book
Muji's broken so I'm just going to go
back to Muji and change that I'm heading
down to the church now to meet Hannah I
don't think I'm gonna be able to film I
don't know I'm not really a churchgoer
but I'm assuming not even though it's
like a special event so if not I'll see
you after but I'm gonna put some
Christmas carols and catch up with
Hannah it's raining poor in his reign my
scarfs gonna get wet but I didn't vlog I
was looking around there weren't any
other youtubers so it was hard to tell
whether it was Robbie Buhl or not there
were some people taking pictures but I
felt like it was inappropriate to vlog
Hannah's here as you can see like Eskimo
it was really good though I used to be
in the choir school so I love a good
Carol it's really high oh my do you know
any of the work that Hannah it just made
me laugh - about the days of karaoke can
I can't read and like - anything and
like coordinate like that at all
so that was that funny Jonathan so
basically I was like bit behind in every
single song it is really awesome for the
people sitting next to me help me
so we're gonna head to story you now
because I think a big bowl of ramen is
just what my cold needs walking in the
rain is probably not over my cold needs
right now
the Carnaby Street Christmas lights are
beautiful we're ensuring Canada never be
affected by let's try a bursary
I'll even show you much fuller than when
we went in did you enjoy your first
experience I did I did I did very much
very much so enjoy our show you very
much so
okay I'm gonna hobble home I have no
Road my nose is so cold II I hate those
people that were going on sniffing many
people that go out when they're ill and
make it when I was ill and I am that
person what's wrong founder we both just
did that my scoffs my back I'm gonna put
my camera away Nelson I get monkey pie
hi I'm now home I'm feeling really
chesty like I feel like I could
potentially get a chest infection you
know you just feel really like wheezy
and it feels quite raw in my chest
I don't know what to do about it my
mom's away and I don't know how to do
anything about asking my mom I'm just
really bad at taking medicine I hate
taking medicine when I'm alleged
preference at I pass they had a really
nice night with Hannah the carol concert
was lovely we really enjoyed listening
to the songs and singing along
as much as I could sing we though it's
showy for dinner and I didn't blog much
because we were just chatting away I met
some really nice viewers afterwards two
sisters who were so sweet and now I'm
home and I'm gonna show you them in a
walk-off mate you know home but I need
to make myself a hot lemon and honey I
think so from H&amp;amp;M home I got 2 50 by 50
cushions whereas light which has
slightly the bigger ones I've got two 40
by 40 ones in the lounge that I can buy
covers for as well for the bed and then
two dark grey cushion covers that I
thought were really nice they're like
kind of linen nice material and then a
big throw as well I want to layer on and
maybe get another bright color to go
with it eventually from muzie I'm so
glad they don't do the clear Airport
bags anymore not really sure I'm gonna
do about that this is like a headband
when you wash your face I thought that
is nice and try that I've got a few pens
because I love a good pen made you do
great pens I got some custom bars that
come in like separate travel friendly
packaging so I camp clean my ears when I
go away and then a mirror which I
actually dropped when I bought it and
had to take it back and get another one
seven years bad luck people I'm gonna
put the cushion covers on and the throw
and make the bed
and then take my makeup off and go into
bed I'm telling you all this my
highlight of the day was seeing Hannah
and Hannah dinner and catch up with her
tomorrow
I have nothing planned ideally I want to
film New Year's Eve tutorial and my 2015
favorites but I just think feeling like
this I'm no use to anyone so I really
don't know what tomorrow holds if I feel
rough I might not log tomorrow but
follow me on Twitter at Lily pebbles
that's will keep you updated on hash tag
