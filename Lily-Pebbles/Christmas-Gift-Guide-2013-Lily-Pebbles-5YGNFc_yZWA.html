gift I spent a long time planning this
video and I've split into two categories
under 25 pounds and over 25 pounds it's
mainly aimed girls like me young girls
who are into beauty I've thrown in a few
kind of different things for maybe
younger girls and older women but yet
mainly based on beauty junkies I've
dressed up for the occasion I am wearing
my Primark I heart Santa jumper which
I'm in love with and I'm probably gonna
wear this throughout the whole of
November and December I've got a lot to
get through so I'm gonna get started I'm
not gonna go into much detail on each
gift I'm gonna list everything in the
description bar below links on where you
can buy it
prices everything so check down there
for more details so started with under
25 pounds and I'm going to go from
cheapest to more expensive there are
quite a few Beauty Christmas crackers
out there and this one is from this
worked and it's 10 pounds and it's
really really cute and small and it's
part of their deep sleep range so it's
got their deep sleep dream cream in here
which is something I really love putting
on off my shower and this is just a cute
little kind of extra stocking filler
gift for aromatherapy Associates which
is another one of my favourite brands
they have their little bail out again
this year which is a Christmas ornament
and inside is their revive morning bath
and shower oil the dead bar that showers
are incredible and this is one of the
kind of bigger sizes in here so it looks
like this and this is really nice to
give like your mom or I love these oils
so I'd really like this as well and then
you can hang it on the tree and it's
really cute so I think that's a nice
little stocking filler as wakes up is a
nail kit from CRA and they have a lot of
nail kit and Christmas gift ideas and
some people may not be into like nails
but I absolutely love them so I'd love
to receive nail kits for Christmas this
one's from CRA and it's their velvet
manicure so they do all these different
kind of crazy manicures this one makes
your nails that light covered in velvet
and it's red so it's really Christmas
sealing this is 14 pounds which could be
a stocking filler I'm not going to
really kind of talk about price as much
I think everyone is so different how
much they spend
as president me and my family do Secret
Santa so we all buy one kind of nice
present rather than lots of maybe not so
nice everyone's different I think this
is a really nice little kit to get for
Christmas next up is a kit from soap &amp;amp;
Glory another brand that has so many
Christmas gift ideas and this is the one
that I picked for this year and it's I'm
your manicure it comes in this little
kind of clear thing you can keep in your
bathroom and inside included is a hand
food which is a really nice hand cream
dry hand scrub Moisture gloves buff and
shine nail file and a bottle of their
pink soda nail polish and a cuticle
stick so that's really nice if someone's
kind of just getting into doing their
nails or they like to give themselves
manicures and that's 14 pounds which i
think is a really good deal more nails I
guess all the nail stuff seems to be in
the under 25 pounds category this one's
from butter LONDON it's 15 pounds for a
duo of two very Christmassy nail polish
shades there's one which is like a deep
dark maroon red and one which is a clear
glitter topcoat and I think these are
both really nice nail polishes and it's
a really cute little duo and if you
haven't tried it off the London before
this is a nice coming introduction to
the Brian I have an eyeliner set in the
over 25 pound category so I thought I'd
throw one into the under as well and
this is from Anastasia which is one of
my favorite brand they do really good
quality makeup and you can buy them on
cult Beauty is 16,000 it's there I covet
sets and it comes with one two three
four five six seven eyeliners they've
got like a nice green kind of deep
maroon Brown like really wearable shades
and they're really soft and really
pigmented and easy to use and I think
this is a really good set especially
just for 16 pounds this is one I threw
in last minute it's 17 pound 50 and it's
from Skylar
Iceland which isn't a brand I've tried
it much but Amelia from Liana BC loves
this brand and this is their skin
hangover emergency relief kit for face
and eyes and I think this is really good
for Christmas because obviously there's
lots of Christmas parties and drinking
and news eve parties and it's basically
a skin that hangover kit which is a very
clever idea I think it's got all the
kind of skin care products you need to
help your skin when you have a hangover
this one I picked on the Selfridges and
I'll
excited because it's a brand you can't
really find in the UK and it's a OS and
if you would have seen any kind of
American beauty gurus talking about this
brand there the lip balms that come in
little circles and you open them in half
and just rub them on your lips and
they're really cute and I saw this and
Selfridges and it's they're kind of like
snowflakes there's three in here only 16
pounds and you get sweet mint
pomegranate raspberry and vanilla bean
flavors and I that's really cute you
probably can't see but it's got
snowflakes on the packaging then if it
have so many Christmas gift sets out if
you like benefit or nose and the legs
benefit go there and have a look because
there's so many different ones I've
picked out two one for my under 25 cats
beating off my over and the one for the
under is that love at first sign and I
think this would be nice for maybe
younger girls my boyfriend's younger
sister would love this she's probably
going to get this for Christmas and it
comes with six lip glosses and their lip
gloss is a really nice and really
pigmented and sound easy to wear and
they've got a nice little selection of
pinks and purples in here and I think
they just look so nice benefit package
up the gift sets so nice it's something
you'd really enjoy opening and giving so
another ciate set here and this one is
20 pounds it's a bit more expensive in
this because it's their caviar manicure
luxe kit and this is one of their caviar
sets but it's kind of with a twist they
normally have different color beads but
this one is rose gold and it looks
amazing I am desperate to try this I
think this would be so nice to wear on
Christmas so many of you gonna give
presents before Christmas Day everyone
has different traditions then this would
be nice one give just before maybe
Christmas Eve so they could do their
nails for Christmas Day and I think they
look really amazing I am a huge fan of
neon as you know and so as my mom cause
she'll probably be getting the Christmas
present from neon because she loves the
brand so I went to see what Christmas
gifts that they're doing this year and I
fell in love with this one which is the
perfect night in a farthing collection
and I love neon candles I love neon bath
oils everything like that and this one
it comes in a nice box and has two of
their products inside it has a candle
and tranquility organic off foam I just
think that's such a nice set open for
your mom your grandma I think it
slightly older women because it is that
soft brand it smells like a spa I mean
I'd love it but who knows I'm quite
for my age I think that was twenty-two
pounds okay the next one is one that I
am giving myself for Christmas this year
and I found this in Urban Outfitters and
it was just like yes that is perfect and
it's the photo album and it says a photo
a day your year in photos I've obviously
been having like an amazing year with my
blog in YouTube and doing all these
exciting things that who knows where
I'll be in the future I think I'm gonna
want to look back and share my kids
about my blogging days so I wanted to
kind of make a memory book of all the
stuff that I'm doing anyway
and this is perfect you just take a
photo a day basically just a photo album
with 365 slots and a day in a bit -
right next to the photo and I think it's
such a good idea I'm gonna kind of set
myself a challenge to take a photo every
day and kind of like at the end of every
month I'll print them off and put them
in here and I think it'll be really nice
to look back on so I think this is a
really cool gift to give someone has to
be the right sort of person you know
well actually want to do this kind of
thing but this is about 25 pounds and
yeah yeah Urban Outfitters I'll put all
the links below I love it and it's mint
green which is my favorite color
more from nails I did not realize how
many nail things are in this video but
this is one of my favorites in the whole
video and it's relating to me and as
their grooming essentials kit so it
looks like this it just looks so nice
and expensive it's actually only 1450
and in here you get a hand and nail
cream they're kind of glass nail file
which is the best for your nails it
doesn't ruin it as a tool and a kind of
cuticle pusher and you know we'll kind
of nail grooming essentials that you
need in here and I just think it's
really cute and really good stocking
filler again so here's a little world
card I thought I would throw in a couple
of my own ideas I'm one for kind of
making my own presents ish I really
enjoy doing it so one thing I suggest is
getting a big roll of cellophane because
I think cellophane can make any present
look good cellophane and ribbon so lush
as you probably all know bring our
Christmas collections every year and I
love all their bath bombs and bath melts
and they're really Christmassy and look
amazing so something you could do is go
and pick out some of your favorites and
from last you can do as many as you like
you can make it as expensive or cheap as
you like and wrap itself
with a ribbon and that could be your
present and I think it's really nice and
personal that you've picked them out
last dude Christmas sets but I like
doing it this way so I've done one here
and I put in the kind of Christmas house
the little bath bomb that looks like a
snowman the little melting snowman and
the star beep around at the bar I've
wrapped it all up in this with a bow and
I think that's a really nice idea I
think people appreciate that you've
taken the time to pick out the presents
that you think they'd like and it's lush
bath bombs everyone loves lush bath
bombs so now moving on to the over 25
pound gifts and I'm gonna start with
another eyeliner set that I mentioned
earlier
this one's from urban decay and it's 26
pounds and it's their black market 24/7
glide on eye pencil set and if you
haven't tried there 24/7 eye pencils
before they're amazing they're so
pigmented and creamy and they really do
last kind of all day and all night
this is a nice selection they've got
quite a few different sets but I like
this one because they're all kind of
dark wintry dark greens dark purple
start blues blacks etc so these are
really nice to wear in the winter and if
you know someone who loves Urban Decay I
think they'd really love this another
second benefit this one it's 2950 and
it's groovy kind of love this one comes
in like a massolit container and inside
it is a mini Porefessional primer a
Benetint blusher for eyeshadows and
their real mascara so it's huge
it'll show you actually so I think
that's really impressive and really nice
to keep but you can probably take this
out when you're done and use this as a
Tim I think whoever you give it to it
really appreciate it as well so I showed
you that this works Christmas cracker
but if you wanted to get something a
little bit more luxury from this works
this kit 29 pounds and it's amazing it's
their sleeping partners kit so it comes
in this really cute colorful box and if
you haven't tried this works I promise
you it's worth it amazing and in here is
two of their sleeping products so the
deep sleep nights oil which I actually
haven't tried but it sounds incredible
and a deep sleep pillow spray which is
so good you spray on your pillow and it
helps to sleep smells or lavender E and
spa-like and delicious it's really nice
for people
you know enjoy for taking baths in the
evening or someone who struggles to
sleep this is a really kind of
thoughtful present Laura Mercier also
have quite a few Christmas kits out this
year they have one eyeshadow palette
that just looks amazing full of all the
most amazing brown shades so definitely
go check that but they also have their
color to go kits which come in these
small little boxes and they mostly have
two levels top layer and in the top is a
lip gloss and for eyeshadows these are
really nice neutral shades like a pale
highlight
taupey purpley colors and a brown and in
the bottom there are two blushes and
it's the same lip gloss that was at the
top and I think that's a really nice
cute kit really good for traveling hello
and I say it's one of the nicest makeup
brands so it's a really nice luxury
present to buy someone I mentioned the
aroma therapy associates little bell but
if you really like the brand and wants
to get someone something a bit more from
the brand they always do their miniature
bath or shower or collections I bought
about four of these me and my mom always
share them because they come with every
single oil and if you want to try out
all the different oils from the range
this is the best way to do it they look
like that and they say what they all are
and what they do they come with like a
little instruction leaflet and oh my god
I can just smell them now they're
amazing they literally just send you to
sleep you have the best baths using
these oils and they last for quite a
while they may look small be only me
like one or two drops per bath so that's
a really nice present to give someone
and that's it's 32 power ok moving it up
a notch in terms of price and Joey
Malone is the place to go for Christmas
presents if it's in your budget they
just have the best stuff and their theme
this year is baby blue with stripes like
this so this is one that I got and this
year they're doing free engraving on any
Christmas candles you buy so I'm going
to open this and show you I think that's
one really nice touch if you're going to
kind of splash out and get someone an
expensive candle it's nice that you can
engrave their name of the way this year
they're doing it you can lick this
candle I think which is really nice I
got one of their pomegranate and Oise
which is their kind of classic scent and
they have it all year round but it's
very kind of Christmasy and on the top
they wrote lily pebbles which is really
cute and I'm really I just love that
these are really nice to touch too
gentle to pay extra for it which is
really nice and you buy someone a lovely
luxurious candle this size cost
39 pounds really work that they both
really clean and smell amazing and just
fill the room with a sense
so here's probably the showstopper of
this whole video and I'm sure you're
waiting for this because every year I
look forward to this and I got one last
year it's the sea otter advent calendar
is 42 pounds and it's a bit of a funny
one because it's an advent calendar you
need to give it to someone or receive it
before the 1st of December so it can
either be a present you're going to give
someone in advance or just if you want
to treat someone my mom bought this for
me and my sisters last year's just like
an extra little gift thing and if you're
thinking what the hell is a CRA advic
calendar I thought a different kinds of
hot chocolate in them a lot of brands do
Beauty advent calendars never and
they're such a good idea so this one
opens up like this and it's obviously
got 24 doors and in each store is a mini
nail polish so this is literally my
dream for people who are into nails it's
amazing it just looks really nice it's
properly like heavy like there's nail
polish in there and I just think it's so
exciting
they'll say on the back what nail
polishes are in there but I actually
don't want to look because I'm probably
gonna open this one this year so if you
want to spend a bit more get someone a
really nice treat before Christmas
season starts then this is there you
might have to be quick I'll put a link
to where you can buy a below but they do
tend to sell out so I've already written
a blog post about this and I really hope
it hasn't sold out I'm going to put the
links below if it hasn't and it's the
Naz guy board down I think that's how
you pronounce it
and one nightstand cheek palette it's
basically exclusive spacing kay good I'm
rambling it's cuz I'm so excited about
this palette it's 45 pounds but it's
actually a really good deal for what you
get inside you get six shades so you get
a bronzer or highlight and four blushes
and they're already nice they have deep
throat an orgasm in there which is like
their two best-selling blushes and it's
just a beautiful palette that's really
good for traveling if this has sold out
I'm not sure I put the link if it hasn't
then knives do so many really nice
palette they've got one with Selfridges
at the moment called blue livery push a
bit more and they always bring out nice
palettes so any kind of noise power I
think would
lovely Christmas present more Christmas
crackers and origins have Christmas
crackers out this year origins one of my
favorite brands especially for skincare
so you can buy six crackers for 45
pounds in it a little bit like this
really cute and I know my mum that's to
get crackers like this for the table I
think she used to do list of presents
anyway on everyone's like seats so it's
nice to have a cracker that has like a
real present as well because then you
get best of both so origins prep is
really good idea 45 pounds to 6 the next
thing is from Jo Malone again and this
is their pomegranate in our collection
and I know people are really loyal to
the pomegranate know our scent
so if you know someone it is this would
do perfect then it's got the stripes
that Jo Malone is doing this year inside
you gets the pomegranate Nora body and
hand wash the Cologne itself in the 30
mil and the body cream and that's proper
luxury gifts that it costs 66 pounds so
it is expensive I know people do go all
out of Christmas I wouldn't spend six
this expands that a Christmas present
but I know a lot of people that do so if
you do and you know someone who loves
generally this would be perfect okay my
final thing is my other wildcard I did
one for the under 25 so this is for the
over and I think it'd be really nice if
you know a makeup lovers put together
your own like chubby collection so I put
in here some of the Revlon lip balms
some of the bourgeois ones and the
Clinique so they're all the kind of
different chubby sticks and wrapped up
in the cellophane with a ribbon and you
could do this with anything you can make
your own collection of your favorite
drugstore makeup or the same with
high-end you can literally do anything
but I think that's kind of quite a sweet
idea and again you put quite a lot of
thought into it what shades would see
that so that's everything for my 2013
Christmas gift guide there were a lot of
products in there sorry about that
as I said they will all be just below
with links and details and prices and
everything like that but hopefully this
has helped you think about what you want
to buy people and maybe what you want to
put on your list yourself I'm so excited
for Christmas
I'm literally I don't wanna take this
Christmas drop off I even had these
actually I didn't wear these in the end
but got these from Primark they're
pretty cute I'm really looking forward
to Christmas but it's my birthday first
that's more exciting and then I can be
excited for Christmas so thank you guys
for watching this video and I'll see
or next week bye hi today is going to be
my everyday makeup tutorial and this is
pretty much how I wear my makeup most
days so keep watching if you want to see
how I do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
