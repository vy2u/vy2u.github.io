of my face but I've been applying and
removing lipstick all morning cuz I've
been practicing my makeup tutorial that
I'm gonna film today so as I told you
today and tonight is my work Christmas
party and Anna's coming over here I
think about 12:00 or 1:00 and then we're
gonna head over there for the afternoon
and evening because I'm staying in a
hotel and the setting will be nice and
it would be spacious and it'll be good
light I'm gonna take this opportunity to
film and I tweeted last night asking you
guys if you'd prefer the Christmas party
get ready with me or New Year's Eve
tutorial so Anna I think most of you
said New Year's Eve but there was very
mixed so I decided what I'm gonna do is
it's kind of like both because I am
getting ready for my Christmas party
tonight I'm gonna film it but it's also
gonna be an easy makeup tutorial it's
gonna go up before New Year's Eve so
that's kind of confusing but I hope it
works and I really hope you guys like it
because I know a lot of people comment
on my tutorials saying they all look the
same because they're not really
tutorials they're more just what I like
to wear hopefully this one's slightly
different and hopefully filming all goes
okay because you never know it can go
perfectly or if you all go wrong I'm
gonna take my camera and tripod and
lighting with me like the full shebang I
think we've got a two hour gap between
the afternoon meeting and the party
tonight everyone else is probably gonna
enjoy the hotel spa but I know Anna's
planning on filming - so we'll both be
like working in those two hours would it
be good to get a video filmed and done
so I've just spent the morning packing
up my little case here but also just to
show you guys last night I use that
nails ink the nail polish with the
little stars and I really wasn't very
impressed and came out looking like this
way let me focus there you go so it
looks okay but it took so long to get
the individual stars on there because
the stars are kind of in a topcoat
formula it doesn't actually go on I
could find I took a just to try and get
each star there now they're on their
very kind of bulky and they keep
catching on things and I'm just not
impressed at all I think it needs to be
more like smaller stars they're just
easier to spread it over the nail
they're too chunky I just didn't think
it worked I mean looks alright now it's
on but it was a pain to get on I'm gonna
head downstairs to have a bit of lunch
before Anna comes I just took my brace
out and I can already like visibly see
my bottom teeth straightened just since
putting that new brace in like
day ago these two normally crossed over
and they're really hurting a dentist did
say that I love them because obviously I
want my 9th brace and they haven't moved
that much he said a lot of the movement
happens towards the end because first
they're just trying to move the back
teeth and that the end needs kind of
slot into place that's quite exciting I
makes me want to wear them even more
when I can actually see them moving
still got some solid left from yesterday
it's so huge it just keeps going so I'm
gonna have some of this for lunch I
haven't had my husband calendar yet and
rich is having his working from home
while you have bed hair really key for
just tonight oh yeah forgot what you're
doing tonight she's gonna come meet us
at the Christmas party tonight but just
the dinner and drinks not for like the
daytime bit Anna's here now and I love
my salad in her Tupperware for her I
thought she'd be hungry she drove from
12:00 to 1:00 I think about these things
so we're now gonna try and fit all this
stuff light tripod suitcase in the back
around his car and then we're gonna head
to the hotel I'm excited we got it all
in okay so Anna apparently is actually
Santa Claus and disguise this is her
boot
we know we're near but it's in like the
countryside so the postcode sound apps
it's like you're here and we're by tree
just don't find it oh oh yeah every
random
we're here and it's pretty nice sunny
day and it's so countryside II now we
just have to try and get all the stuff
in to the lobby we've got this let me
see however that was really hard I had
scary and his stuff because she was
really struggling but I'm in the room
wow this is beautiful it's like the
biggest spacious Airy room first thing I
notice obviously look at the mirror so
gonna use that for filming also a
beautiful view outside so conscious ID
oh my gosh I mean I always said I miss
working in office but my Christmas
parties were never this kid before oh
look
have a lovely stay at the Grove hotel oh
that's so nice I've never been to the
great hotel before I think they know
like someone who's got married here once
we just saw someone downstairs having
like at all because they obviously want
to get married here I mean it's
beautiful it's in the most amazing like
countryside grounds we haven't had a
look around yet we're gonna go do that
now I just wanted to dump my stuff I had
like all my lights and stuff and tripods
to carry but I'm just gonna leave this
here the whole afternoon we're gonna
spend having like a bit of a team
meeting and I catch up and like
everything we've done for the year and I
probably won't vlog that I mean I
definitely won't blog that because it's
all kind of business he stuff but then
we're gonna have to our break I'm gonna
film and get ready and then tonight the
party and dinner and really looking
forward to it so I think I'm gonna go
find Anna's she's just down the hallway
oh my god it's had to come back to get
my camera look at the bathroom oh my god
there's like a proper free-standing bath
and a shower in a mirror and another
mirror this is amazing oh and it's
really echoey but you wanted a macaroon
but the first one I picked up was coffee
and the second one was lemon I don't
like either of those rich is gonna mind
two of them two of them have been
half-eaten you know what that's gonna be
Rose so are you idiots chocolate okay
I'm gonna have the rose and leave the
chocolate for him well like I've got a
farm outside my bedroom oh that's
dinosaur mom lady doing great ready to
go yeah let's go far we have no idea
where we're going but let's just walk
cool ways a really long confusing I've
already forgotten my room number so you
know my key so I'm just give
and my key to the Karthik she's my mommy
so we're just going for a little wonder
we actually when we got here there was
no one here but then we just went to
reception everyone's now checking in so
definitely place Oh such pretty Gardens
look big fit sorry I flew in my face
dandy it is very nice I was testing at
the public biscuits they asked me out
take a bite you've got be that person
there's a little gingerbread village I'm
sorry if you guys follow anyone else
that's also Hicks I think will of Love's
gonna be the same like look at the tree
village sorry whoever gets them look up
first wins a ladder just discussing
sneezing we were saying you know when
you have like a slight bit of cold
it needs meat you don't really want to
because you never know it could be one
of those sneezes we're like a disaster
of sneeze never trust the sea so I like
said that happen to me once as a
teenager so now I sneeze like really bad
for you so you don't like let it all out
but you don't want to happy like that
snotty person so let me know if you guys
sneeze like openly like achoo or you
like go I normally do sniffling
like either lion I quite like a big
serve you but you should never trust
yeah I once got sent out of mask lasting
several years because I only to do it oh
my sneeze used to be like chow in the
whole class first two laughter and I got
sent out the door I was like being like
cloudy okay we're on our way to the
meeting so there would be some music
montage clips now or just anything you
finished the meeting with such keen
beans over here they're like food and
drink we're just so excited to like get
to the meeting early as he didn't before
anyone comes oh my god those do look
good
Nick on first reactions it's like a it's
like when SP T first impression on
texted oh wait I missed ya oh my god
they're so good why we saw fresh sugary
okay so the meetings done and now we're
gonna go film and I'm so not in the mood
I kind of wish I could just chill out
do it yeah goddess whatever may come up
star game but I'm gonna feel my knees
make up stir like I told you guys so
hopefully it'll come out alright the
rains lovely vo and then I think that
might be the kitchen you sure that's the
kitchen
trying you back to our rooms here I'm
back in my room I'm just trying to
figure out where to film I think the
lighting is actually better in the
bathroom even though I bought a light
with me it's just to kind of a nicer
setting so I'm gonna maybe try and find
a way to put the camera here so that you
can see my face in the mirror there but
then you can close up the makeup I don't
know I'm really torn I'm not sure what
to do
maybe I'll film with this is the
background let me just get my camera out
and have a look okay I think this is
what I'm gonna go for camera tripod
little table stool mirror so kind of has
the sink in the background it's not
gonna be that fancy but it's kind of a
close-up of my face anyway I think
that's the best way to do it if it's a
tutorial rather than a get ready with me
so I'm going to charge my vlogging
camera now and say goodbye to you guys
for a little bit while I film cuz I
can't vlog and boom at the same time but
I'll update you in a minute you know
I've just finished doing my makeup I'm
really not happy with how it went I mean
the makeups fine but the filming it's
really hard to explain but it's really
hard to get a good setup where I can
show the makeup properly get the right
lighting I've had to change the settings
because I normally film in daylight mode
but it's to orange so you can't actually
see the colors but then auto sometimes
really unflattering and horrible I
managed to get that all right but then I
don't think my face was framed properly
and some of the lipstick parts might not
have come out well ah I'm not happy with
it at all I don't already scrap the
video or not I think I might do it all
just in case because I might get home
put on the computer and it was fine I
don't know if I'm just being
perfectionist or not but it's not as
pretty as I want it to be hmm I think
I'm gonna continue I'm gonna do all the
close-ups of the products which is the
bit that actually takes the longest
funnily enough and then get ready get
dressed and film a bit of that I'm gonna
keep going but not feeling it this video
might get scrapped I'm not sure okay I
just went to film like half my close-ups
and I've decided I'm scrapping the video
I just like made the decision now now my
head's telling me that I can't do it I
can't carry on tabs quite a lot in case
you wondered I often not that often but
it's hard when you're not in your own
environment like it's nice to be in a
really nice hotel bathroom but it's a
different setting to what I normally do
and things aren't it's just not good
enough I only like to put videos out
that I'm really proud of
obviously because then if I was to get
like negative comments on it and I
agreed I would just be like yeah I agree
is rubbish so I want to feel proud of it
so yeah I'm gonna scrap that video I
need you to do my makeup anyway so
that's done it's just quite annoying I
could have been like having fun with
everyone else but it's it's hard five
now so you've still got a couple of
hours so I might go we gotta get hour
and a half might go find someone else
just pack up all my stuff bit annoying
that means I've got to find time to film
this video at another day but yeah it
just hasn't been copy it hasn't come out
like I wanted it to and I'm just I'm
just gonna give up now
okay side is probably a good idea to
actually get ready and do my hair so I'm
gonna do that now okay I'm going to go
to Anna's room and I think she's
finished filming okay I went to Anna's
and came back but I forgot to vlog I'm
just taking a quick incident in insulin
an Instagram snap of my lipstick of
choice which is the bourgeois velvet
pink pong whatever it's good and it's
kind of what the Instagram looks like I
haven't really taken it cuz Anna rung
the doorbell
blue gran is wearing da da she is my
gold bauble oh you're kind of out of
focus
oh you're back in she's much he's the
gold bobble and I'm the Navy balm all
together we're gonna take this okay I
mustn't forget my secrets under present
here it is proud of my rapping I know
where's yours oh we've got the same
paper low well okay just so you guys
know me and I'll do 20 things like have
the same paper or rescue thing it's not
a purpose you know like 15 yards they're
friends we found each other they say
like you wanting to seek a dress yeah
we're just it's just happens okay I
think yeah I think they are a semi
sidekick it just you know beats will
it's un same outfit we have the same
magnitude our bags are pretty much the
same look Whistler's black handbag this
is black clutch you know it's just none
of those friendships yeah right we just
got hold of the boys and finally they're
downstairs at reception so we're just
gonna hang out here waitin to come up
then I want to go down to the like
pre-drinks bit so it'd be nicer than
hanging around a room okay we're gonna
do outfit of the evening because I
haven't done like outfit of the day
thing dreams long but I was watching
everyone else's and they always show
with o arian and I never did
