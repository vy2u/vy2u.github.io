I'm just waiting for Lucy and Georgia to
arrive and then we're all going to make
the three-hour car journey together
which should be fun nice and probably
quite boring as well I need to get
myself some food before I get going
put a bagel in the toaster I'm like
force-feeding myself because I'm not
hungry at all and he'd find day eight
this is so exciting having a proper
advent calendar
- yay something round and chocolatey hmm
I'm turning up like a complete weirdo
with a bag of shoes because I just want
to go somewhere that I don't know I
never know what kind of like shoes I
might need we're doing like activities
today and then tonight's quite smart so
I've just bought like three pairs of
shoes whoops but I'm driving so I can
just keep them all in my car and wheel
it right well ease I'm gonna take my new
Woodleigh hat which I'm excited about I
think it's gonna be such a nice
Christmas party I was it now I work for
myself and I don't have like proper
colleagues I could have missed out on a
Christmas party for quite a few years so
it's so nice to have like a gleam
Christmas party with all that kind of
youtubers and everyone that works at
gleam it's just it's really nice to have
something to look forward to okay Lucy
and Georgia are now here hello and we're
gonna set off on our little mini
roadtrip of what I was going on a coach
together but with far cooler going in my
car and it's meant to take part in like
three hours so you might be stopped for
tea on the way I've never been here
before and I'm very excited looks
beautiful it's been raining a lot on the
way but a little bit sunshine so we're
hoping the Sun comes out
it's so pretty here I think the coach
with everyone in hasn't arrived yet so
we're going to sit and have a cup of tea
look we're just waiting to go outside
and start all the activities I mean it's
not like you clay pigeon shooting and
slick way it's done should be good and
Caroline Caroline hanging with the happy
Christmas elves teams
very windy but if you hear me really fun
we won we snatched it was like 11 1688
today at quadbiking time my helmet over
my
I'm in my room and it's like seriously
epic Lucy's joined me because I've got a
little bottle of champagne and I thought
I'd share it look at this I mean this
just looks like a living room no whoa my
bed's there someone at the door do I
have to close the curtains or people see
me naked
champagne oh it's really good champagne
I just had some lovely champagne with
Lucy and Anna and I'm gonna attempt a
film a video before I do I'll quickly
show you my room so we're at place
called chutes and again it's incredible
when you walk into the room there's it's
like long corridor and this is what the
bedroom looks like amazing huge bed with
a huge lounge beautiful and back here is
like I mean I've never there's like a
whole like changing area with wardrobes
and full-length mirrors and then a huge
bath a beautiful bathroom the biggest
shower ever that goes all the way in
there and then like the toilet is
separate in there it's the most
incredible hotel room so so beautiful
I'm ready and I think I managed to film
a small video I hope it comes out well
otherwise it's a bit of a waste but I
got ready anyway I'll show you what my
so this is the Topshop dress it's got
long lazy sleeves and then it's got like
a slight cut out but I think too risque
and like this lace overlay I quite like
it I don't know it's either either you
guys are gonna love it or hate it I
think some of you will think it's quite
like too salty which I guess it is but
I'm not wearing out I'm just wearing it
in hotel and I quite like it I think
it's quite Christmas party this the
light shining down on me is making this
bit look a lot better but actually
close-up it's quite like Lacey you can't
really see anything and I'm wearing my
new bag with it of course I'm gonna like
wear this to death and I'm wearing my
junit boots as well so I think if it's
very nice my makeup and hair I kind of
showed you in the video so I won't tell
you now but pretty standard stuff really
not too dissimilar to what I was wearing
on the weekend to both weddings and my
little Kate Spade necklace what she's
going in I'm just waiting for Anna and
then we're gonna go and have pre drink
so they've on us
so we're in the toilet
Chris I know get Chris Chris star Chris
dark some radio want to see Jane I just
went to repress nineties pop music music
well if you want to DJ we're looking for
the DJ or so you give it to us i DJ we
like myself may honor the grannies we've
taken off our shoes already and all the
others alike already a grande but I'm
not breaking it to either I'm 28 in like
an hour
a de while I was in the toilet came up
with a game plan
Justin Timberlake senorita we we used to
look online to Spain
we had such a fun time dancing and I've
just accidentally invited everyone back
to my room for pyjamas empty basically
because I want to get into my pyjamas to
have a cup of tea and I don't want to be
alone because not tired yet some
birthday so I didn't bring my cake I
said fall behind I had a few people in
my room for a cup of tea and they've all
left now and I just had such a nice
night it's technically my birthday now
because it's 2:00 in the morning and I
couldn't think of a better way to start
my birthday it's a shame that I very
rich here but it was so nice we were
just dancing and I mean the best night
it was such a good Christmas party so I
mean like positive people with like
really inspiring stuff everyone do
really cool things so exciting I'm
technically 28 now but I will vlog
tomorrow when it's probably my birthday
and I'll see you guys then highlight of
my day was I mean just the Christmas
party and dancing away and everything I
did today really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
