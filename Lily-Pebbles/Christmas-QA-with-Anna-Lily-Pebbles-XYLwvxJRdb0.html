that way I'll be back
yeah bummer no I don't know any of the
rest that one no no no mmmm Merry
Christmas
ah my favorite is I like um you better
watch out you better not Santa Claus is
coming to town
I mean that me it's Christmas Eve it's
festive is I never have to say it the
new XIV song auld lang syne
so neighs I mean I don't know what is
amazing some probably drunken what I'm
hearing every yeah every time it comes
up I'm like it was thrown out where they
sing when she's in the shower
sorry le cans cold outside Alisha asked
do you do Boxing Day sales
no we kind of talked about this in the
ads video last week the beauty chat no
not really
I haven't around yes yes like if I
haven't had any plans with family and
like friends like oh do you wanna go to
the but somedays - like yeah right then
but I wouldn't no no no
online maybe maybe in person they how
they said do us at my Koziol Christmas
Day or do you get dressed up mmm in
between like a cozy but maybe like each
other dress yeah I have a three step
outfit on Christmas Day pajamas like
nice pajamas in the morning and then I
always like to wear it like you said
like some coke jumper dress and tights
it's the only nostalgic thing I remember
as a kid like running around my house
and I sleeping around my tights cousins
excited yeah I was always wearing like
some cabbage Iraq yeah I love how are
you tight sand a dress because it makes
you feel like a kid but then after lunch
straight to my onesie we all get to
answer your posters jumper because
you're so full these one play game yeah
and I want to be comfy by that point I'm
trying to stay really still because I'm
a jingles the next question is also
Hannah do you prefer receiving presents
or giving them kissing yeah it sounds
cheesy but I actually hate opening
presents I find it so embarrassing
everyone's watching and no matter even
if I genuinely like it I feel like my
reactions always fake I as well like
when I buy presents I want to get them
sup here immediately so this year I've
left it quite late because I am
otherwise I'm like oh I just want to
give you your presents because I like
them I feel like my mom's really good at
buying presents I've kind of inherited
that gene yeah I like really I hate
never just buys on the president's sake
of it birthdays or whatever I have to
really thinking outside they'd really
want make it resourceful because like I
love giving freely and see in her face
Holly said do you open stocking or tree
presents first and by the way I think
it's hilarious I didn't know what tree
present was till I met rich and his
family has a tree present I got two
other trees
I've never called I knew what she meant
Cherie friends I feel like we had three
presents one year it's not supposed to
be under the tree
oh no tree present they were actually in
the tree oh I have a history of
chocolates hang in the change here we
had chocolates but like one year my
auntie put us like a little pen and it
was wrapped up and put in that room we
got to open those on Christmas Eve I
don't know maybe that year we were just
like
overexcited if you're like waiting
ourselves with press okay so for the
sake of this question let's say stalking
and like person yes wait another always
sucking first last year my mom said that
me my sister were too old for stocking
and I was beyond devastated because I
feel like it's my favorite part of the
whole like this morning like Easter
certainly anyway moment us there open
Allah all our own stocking presents and
they were always the same like Lily was
saying in my video how they were all
shape the same nothing like a find the
squishy rectangle or my open it now they
used to come at the end of our stocking
video that was nice and then my older
sister Carly who'd like have three
behind it that she's saved the end but
then we do big presents and we wait as
well and we watch every single person
open those because I didn't know some
families just open them all at the same
time yeah whereas we like we sit there
and like this as yours yeah and then we
all sit there and we what yeah and then
one like suppose you can't like see
we're from God
yeah it's a very long process we do it
quite weird damn thing I didn't realize
it was weird until okay so we do
stocking in the morning but we don't do
like main process till after lunch which
some people I think when you're kid
you're like oh desperate you want to
like yeah but now it's because after
lunch it gets a bit depressing and like
try and get pausing like you got have
lifts the mood we had to wait so I like
at least breakfast we asked that
question for about wiseman yeah Karen
said what some of your favorite wintery
Christmas films but ones that people may
not have seen or heard of I had asked
this and I've completely forgotten I
feel like I need to put a disclaimer out
there that I don't really watch a lot of
films and I've barely watched any
Christmas films and so I don't know any
that anyone wouldn't know oh no it's
just maybe not like obvious ones love
actually is my favorite I just I just
love it I'm like I'm a Hugh Grant it's
so dreamy yeah and I always cry I think
he's like the last half an hour I just
cry like consistently for that last half
an hour it's just so doing is so good
and then obviously elf because it's just
the best girl that was ever made I've
forgotten my answer I have such a bad
hair this is it if it comes to me I'll
put it there
Oh Oh a rabbit in the night note for
Christmas okay Tim but all those one
scare me yeah it's quite scary but I
like it I love the music in that and me
and my friend Hannah used to always
watch I'll be home for Christmas which
is cheesy rubbish terrible film of all
time you know when you find a really
crappy film and you get addicted we
watch it like all the time you know all
the words like laughs but the hilarious
bits are so not funny it's terrible what
is your best childhood Christmas memory
in favorite gift you received as a child
every you should've thought this through
before mm-hmm one Christmas we all went
to my grandma's everyone like aunties
uncles cousins we all went and there was
like a really long table that had to go
diagonally across the room so that it
could fit everyone on I had
conjunctivitis that's probably about
like that you know just like did anybody
make oakley's I don't I feel like they
were like think way back
oh thanks once so lots of pictures of me
like with my sunglass so it was a great
Christian so everyone really cute it's
very quickly with the Sun rising off and
I'm like I just remember every year me
and my sisters used to do like a show
actually they used to do shows yeah I
seven and ten years older than me so
they used to just show them I remember
it was that first year that I could join
then I was like so excited I learned all
the words so we all stood there together
and son close your eyes
darling I've got a video in let's do
this thing you like that same one I said
do you feel me team in this like English
it is subtle but in my hair me I would
all like there were no smiles we just
look so bored it's so funny we used to
do that me of my sister but we didn't
really have many talents aside from like
recorder would that be like that we did
program the diesel programmers oh yeah
poor parents if you say like oh my god
how long is this gonna go I got waiting
for the shows now my nieces nephews
about old I feel like they can do a show
yeah it should give me a lot of frozen
there I reckon we didn't answer the bit
about our favourite get friends even
received
I don't remember probably one of those
gadgets he's spiky light up thing from
the 90s one year and my sister got a toy
kitchen for her birthday this is not a
Christmas present
yeah it was my favorite present like
even that was my sister's birthday other
than the toy kitchen is great but I did
have a toy post office that like folded
out and had different sides to it and
you could post letters into it and maybe
the bad things like that
Oh mostly love like 10 yo works in a
shop and stuff or anything Lego or
Barbie oh one year I got a Barbie
Corvette and my sister got a Barbie Jeep
