mind only guys it's look must stay for
and I'm not very early I'm in
Hammersmith and I just went to grab some
fruit salads because I didn't eat
anything and then on the train I feel a
little bit woozy because I had an empty
stomach
I'm off for a meeting and then I'm gonna
meet my mom off to listen go to
Westfield actually have a wet to face
that's how much it's raining outside
Emma's here hello what are you doing for
the rest of the day I'm going to a yoga
class oh I don't know I've never done it
before what yoga no I'm intrigued I mean
she's like home husband hey I'm now
gonna get back on the tube and head to
Westfield where I am meeting my mum so
the meeting went really well me and Anna
are working on some kind of semi
collaborative videos for January but
we've got so much happening over
Christmas so she's going away that we're
gonna have to get it all sorted like
this week
I'm now heading into Westfield to go
first field had the ice rink
fancy
it's 11:00 a.m. on Thursday and it's so
quiet and most of it's ridiculously
close
first thing I need is Christmas present
wrapping equipment this is the wrapping
theme I'm going for the brown paper with
the red and white string
America means Willis finally comes PJ
and it came to London just in time for
me to grow out of it and really not be
found anymore
just got the frozen songs out my head
and then we went into the Disney Store
and they were playing and so now I'd
won't let it go back to my head
now into my favorite store
I'm not in a bit of a rest and touching
up with my emails for all my mouth gets
in them so I'm just a boy I could've
ended
my feet are small Christmas shopping and
it's getting quite dark now it's
actually the proper dark I'm gonna head
home and a new season work I need to
schedule vlogmas day three
yesterday's which you should have seen
by now it's all getting very confusing
for me and I think I'm gonna arrange the
lounge ready for my birthday because
tomorrow morning do something really
exciting with my sisters and my friend
Jemma so you'll see that in tomorrow's
vlog I haven't got much time tomorrow
because when I come back I'm gonna be
doing lots of cooking and prepped for
the party so I think tonight I might try
and get the room ready okay this is
gonna be my setup for the next hour
laptop notepad headphones pencil burn a
harddrive charger phone I'm gonna sit
and edit this vlog so far I've already
got into my onesie I just it's too cold
and wintery so I'm going to edit this
video I don't know how long it's gonna
take me but I'm gonna do this and then I
think it should be home but I need to
sort out that room while I edit I'm
watching friends on mute I don't need
the sound because I know all the words
Loki's home from work why what did I do
rich got back is it worth the car and I
went oh crap I go to the station this
morning and then I forgot because mom
drove home from Westfield so the car is
at the station it's probably really
lonely and cold I feel sorry for poor
Lenny
my car's good Lenny in case one my car
yeah you do your coat still on there
everything has to dress to the outside
world look I'm in a onesie not propria
oh you're circled we help me organize
the room tonight oh he said maybe cuz
I'm vlogging when I just asked a minute
ago he said no I'm just writing a blog
post for these amazing dairy-free
rookies are called in they're like
brownies and cookies and I'm gonna be
making these tomorrow in the vlog but
I've also got a blog post coming up
they're amazing
okay we're gonna sort out this room for
my birthday right
unnecessary okay so what we're gonna do
is have a table up over here we need to
like get rid of all the kids toys and
table over there rich and then we'll
move the sofa I don't know
no we're gonna put a table there for the
food let's do let's put the table up and
see how if we can hide all the toys
under the table feeling really stressed
now because the plan was to have
everyone kind of sitting on the floor
and eating's I thought that might be
more relaxed and if you're sitting at
the table then you're kind of stuck
talking to the person opposite you but
then I just realized it might be quite I
mean I don't mind sitting on the floor
eating but looking at rich as a guy it's
a bit awkward and you can't really put
your food on your lap but now if I put
table up I don't have enough chairs for
16 people I'm stressing and I have no
one to help me because this is what boys
do they just sit on their phone I mean
you said Maya I need your help I'm
stressing out and rich is sitting there
and being like the most annoying boy
with stupid suggestions
okay we've come up with a plan we're
going to bring the coffee tables from
the other lounge in here they're like
low tables but like what Rick was
suggesting annoyingly so that some
people can eat on there if they feel
uncomfortable some people can sit on the
floor still be casual I'm happy with
that so we're just gonna clear the room
now let's see if these twinkle lights
work
Christmasy do not have to get my own
Christmas tree to offer to my birthday
target dies instead
just put this table up and oh my gosh
the arguments in come in a lot of
trouble because it was we didn't realize
it comes apart in like four different
pieces and it's pretty much taken us
about four to five minutes to put it
back together after taking it apart so
whoops for the look slice you can have
all the food on there that look nice
okay so I'm just putting all the cutlery
and glass out ready
the kids use this room to play in so I
can't really set everything up yeah I
can put some of it out just so I know
what I've got we're just watching I'm a
celebrity get me out here which is
probably the favorite program in the
house at the moment I love it and just
reading through all your comments from
vlogmas day three just wanted to say
thank you very much they're really nice
