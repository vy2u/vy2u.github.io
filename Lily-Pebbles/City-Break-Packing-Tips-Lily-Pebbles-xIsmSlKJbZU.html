really well so I am off to Milan Italy
today and I am so excited and I thought
what better time to give you guys a
video on tips for how to pack for a city
break as I'm sure you know by now if
you've been watching my videos for a
while I am a super organized person so
I've always been very organized when it
comes to packing I learned from my mom
and when we used to go on family
holidays I remember it was like a whole
day thing we used to have zip bags with
each of our names written on Lily's
underwear jojo's bikinis it was like a
real organized thing recently I've been
going on more kind of shorter trips and
I think it's like a different way of
packing for a short trip you really
can't over pack so you have to be even
more strict so for today's video I'm
going to give you some tips I've learned
on the way for how to pack for a city
break so let's start with hand luggage
and this bag is from H&amp;amp;M it's really
great because it's really sturdy has
long handles and you don't feel like
it's going to break if you pack it full
of stuff so let's take a look at what's
inside
this is actually a waterproof person
forever 21 but I thought it would work
well for my passport
this is a new one for me and it's much
smaller than one I used to have I picked
it up on Amazon these headphones are
great because they fold up so they're
really good for traveling and they're
also noise canceling so if you're also a
nervous flyer like me it's great because
it blocks out the plane noise this clip
bag is from Muji and I always use these
for travel aids inside I keep a face
mist lip balm hand sanitizer hand cream
perfume travel sickness pills hair bag
chewing gum and my stress less rollable
sniff when I'm nervous so that's
everything packed inside as you can see
it's still quite spacious if you're
planning on traveling with a lot of
camera equipment I recommend taking this
Amazon camera backpack it's so great and
has so much space inside there's a zip
on the front if you need to keep your
passport or any personal items and
there's also a main compartment at the
front where you can keep your laptop or
iPad on the side there's space for a
tripod and then inside the main
compartment there's so much room for
your big SLR camera and so many lenses
as well
these bits are secured by velcro so you
can actually move them around and make
as much space as you need on the inside
there are two zips where you can keep
any leads memory cards spare batteries I
think this is a really great bag and it
was really affordable so now let's go
onto the suitcase this one is from Muji
it's the 60 litre one but they also do a
smaller cabin size case as well they're
really hard wearing but they're much
lighter than they look it has some
really nice details as well like the
ziplock so your case doesn't open by
itself and you can lock it if you want
to secure it let's just face there I
love how these cases roll around on all
fours is just endless entertainment and
so quick if you're rushing on the
airport
so let's take a look inside there is so
much space in this sixty liter case
there are two zip compartments on the
top which I really like because if you
want to just go out to see where stuff
is you can throw it in there and then
the main department is really spacious
and then behind the two zips
there is a whole zip section that opens
out so you can really fit so much in
here so let's talk about traveling with
jewelry
I bought this jewelry round from Amazon
it's from a brand called Dulwich and not
only is it really pretty and mint green
but it is so handy it has a zip
compartment at the top one in the middle
and then it has a space at the bottom
four rims this is really clever because
these bits clip off and you can just
slide your rings on and they're on
display they're safe they're not going
to get damaged and they look really
pretty
in this top compartment it goes all the
way down the back of the case so you can
just pull your long necklaces in there
and then it was still fold up easily if
you're traveling with delicate necklaces
I'd recommend wrapping them in a bit of
tissue like this because then they won't
get tangled with each other and you make
sure to keep them safe
so now on to toiletries and I like to
use clear bags my toiletries so that I
can see where everything is and grab it
quickly this one is from the clear bag
store calm and this one is from John
Lewis use this opportunity to take any
miniatures you have or samples lying
around your bathroom not only do they
look cute but there's so much easier to
pack also a traveling mirror is a good
idea this one is from Muji and a fold-up
toothbrush because it takes up so much
less space and I think it's much more
hygienic if you need to do catch any of
your products Muji is the place to go
they have every size bottle you could
ever imagine so now on to makeup this
makeup bag is from Lulu Guinness and I
love it because it opens up into two
sections which are both clear so you can
see inside and you know I love clear
things
I take with a palette instead of lots of
single eyeshadows take with a multi-use
mascara that will do your top and bottom
lashes take only two lip products B
strips one for day one for night a
blusher that maybe you don't need a
brush for and multi-use products like
this foundation stick which could also
be used as a concealer be sensible when
it comes to packaging don't take with
your glass foundations take with the
tubes and the travel-friendly
foundations instead when it comes to
packing my brushes I've never really
found a brush rod that works for me so I
use this Aspen all of London makeup bag
and it's the perfect size for my brushes
I just pop them inside and they will
stay in one place
for electricals I've always used these
bags I have no idea where I got them
from I've had them for years so I just
throw any kind of camera charges or
phone charges or any spare needs in
there I will try to find a link
something similar below when it comes to
packing your clothes I'd recommend
writing a list of the items you're
taking not only will it help you in your
packing and deciding what to take you
can throw it in your suitcase as a
reminder of what you have with you when
you're there I always used to use these
zip bags to pack but then I saw Ingrid
from missglamorazzi video she introduced
me to these amazing Eagle Creek packing
cubes I picked mine up from pop sports
world in the UK but you can also find
them online and similar things in Muji
they're really great because they keep
everything in separate containers so if
you need to grab the t-shirts or for you
to grab your dresses it's just so easy I
don't tend to unpack on quick city
breaks so it's much easier to have
things in different sections this one's
great because it has one side where you
can put any kind of underwear or bikies
in and then it has another side where
you can put them in once they're dirty
this is a smaller one which I would use
for pyjamas or underwear or bikinis
here's a standard big one which I would
use the tops
and then this one is the best it's the
envelope it comes with a hard thing you
can fold your clothes around or you can
just place them on top and it keeps any
top so you don't want to crease it keeps
them all neat and it's really good for
our delicate dresses and tops so hope
you guys enjoyed that that hopefully you
got some tips for next time you go on a
quick trip let me know if you have any
other tips that I didn't mention I would
love to hear them in the comments below
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
