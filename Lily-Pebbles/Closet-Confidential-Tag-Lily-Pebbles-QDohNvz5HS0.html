closet confidential tag so this tag
video was created by Fleur for flood
force and she kindly tagged me in it so
I was really excited because I really
liked the questions and I don't really
do fashion videos that often so I
thought this is a good opportunity so
I've got the questions on my phone here
and the first one is what is the oldest
item in your wardrobe the first thing I
thought of when I saw this question with
these jeans from H&amp;amp;M and I can't
remember exactly when I got them but I'm
pretty sure I was in my teens and I
think it was when it was called pennies
and more it says that was cool I always
call it Henny's and I think that's
because that's what it was originally
called anyway I didn't know that this
they're kind of slate-gray they haven't
got any pockets on the front or back
which I usually think was really weird
but I wear long tops it doesn't really
matter but what I love about them is
this detailing on the knee they've kind
of got like knee pads in them and
they're skinny fit and I've had these
forever and every time I clear out my
wardrobe I always kind of want to hold
on to these I think it's just because of
the detail on them near never really
found it anything else like it they're
kind of coming back into fashion now but
before then I never saw themselves
always like I want to keep these in case
and they're just really they fit really
nicely they're like skinny fit and yeah
I really like the knee padding so I've
just kept these seriously since I've
been here like 17 or something the next
question is what is the newest item in
your wardrobe and apart from my Rebecca
Minkoff bag which I showed in one of my
last videos it's probably this coat from
whistles I had some I saw scotches and
whistles is sold on a sauce which is
amazing because a CIL's obviously
discounts so I picked up this Parker
from whistles I don't really have a coat
like this my coats are all quite smart
so I wanted like a weekend coat and
something that would keep me warm
because it's freezing in the UK so this
is like a car key Green it's really
thick and it's got this big coat with
faux fur around it I love it it's so
warm and it just looks really cool I
think if you wear like skinny black
jeans a lot I quite like the oversized
look I originally got it in 12 and it
was huge for me which is normally my
size so I had to send it back and get
the 10 instead but I really like this
it's very like hard wearing I think it
will last a long time and I do love
whistles next is what is the most
expensive item in your
and I think I would have to be my
Michael Kors sell my bag this is the
medium size it's the first kind of
designer bag I ever purchased and I
actually got my friends again it for me
from New York so it was a little bit
cheaper it was kind of nearly 300 pounds
I think in the UK it's 315 it's just not
crazy bad for a designer bag it's a
really nice size it fits a lot in for
kind of everyday use but it's still
quite small it's structured it kind of
sits up by itself which I like and it's
got Conan's handy so you can hold it
like that and yeah I really like it I
got it Navy which I was very happy with
my choice of maybe and I like next is
what is the cheapest item in your
wardrobe and kind of most regularly worn
and it would have to be my best top from
H&amp;amp;M I have so many of these they just
kind of look like this really basic vest
tops but I wear these every single day
without fail and most of the ones I have
a black bright got some gray ones
recently I when I first stops under my
clothes every single day kind of keeps
me warm makes me feel like secure like
if my top flies up I know the vest tops
gonna be there I dunno it's just like a
habit of wearing vests tops every single
day seriously so I go through these very
quickly and I have loads and I think
they're like $2.99 or 399 which is
pretty good I think the next question is
what is the biggest bargain in your
wardrobe and I've literally spent like a
week try think of the answer for this
one but I'm terrible I don't shop in
sales unless there's something really
specific that I want I hate shopping in
sales I feel like all my favourite
stores get so messy and the clothes are
everywhere and it just kind of takes all
the joy out of shopping so I'm not a
very good bargain hunter I'm afraid so I
was going to kind of leave this question
blank but I found something that's kind
of cheating it's not really for my
wardrobe but it's these Lulu Guinness
makeup bags and might have kind of the
wit big wash bag and then the makeup bag
that opens up like this and I got this
both from Vista vintage which is like a
discount village and they were both felt
like 50% off which is really good and it
was really cheap for new Guinness but
that's a major cheat there sorry I just
couldn't think of anything I really
can't remember the last thing I bought
in a sale and really bad at sale
shopping next is what was the biggest
waste of money from your wardrobe and
this is so easy to answer these shoes
from All Saints I'll show you what they
look like this is what they look like
now I bought these to wear to my sis
his wedding which was kind of a few
years ago now I think and I remember
trying the one with my mom and being
like wow they're so cool we look like
the cool younger sister yeah I love
these they've got like a cool detail on
the heel every chunky and the nude color
makes them kind of wedding appropriate I
think there were 150 pounds which is a
bit mental but at the time I was like
it's my sister's wedding and really
important day it's fine got home kind of
wore them a bit more around the house
tried them on my dress and realized I
just can't walk in them I'm so bad at
walking in heels and I looked ridiculous
oh it's really heavy footed and clumpy
and they just weren't as nice as they
were in store it turns out All Saints
don't do refunds so I couldn't take the
back and it was a bit of a disaster and
Cara Moore why I couldn't exchange them
there was a reason at the time but yeah
I've never ever worn these not once
which it's just pains me because I never
ever spend like over 100 pounds of shoes
ever so yeah I haven't sold them all I
really should sell them on eBay or
something but the idea that I I sped 150
pounds in them and probably I could sell
them for like 20 really upsets me um so
they've just been sitting in my wardrobe
and they have not been worn once and it
just is ridiculous and I'm very upset
about the whole situation the final
question is what are your three favorite
things from your wardrobe at the moment
and the first one you would have seen
anyway in my beauty chat video and it's
this necklace font whistles maybe you
can see if I put it here it's got three
triangles it's gold and it's really
simple and whistles jewelry really isn't
that expensive I think this was 25
pounds and it's really pretty and just
Christmassy and I really really like it
and I think they sell this on a sauce so
I'll link it below I've also been loving
this dress from River Island and I
actually bought this to wear to my
Nana's keels meet up and I really like
it it's got leather detailing on the
shoulders black short sleeves and on the
back it's just plain black kind of
cotton on the front it's got this
knitted a look and it's really nice it's
also got a couple of zip details at the
bottom it's like a t-shirt dress which
is the shape that I like to wear because
I wear like tights and then everything
else quite loose which I really like
so it's also got a zipper at the back I
just really think this is so pretty came
in quite a few different prints and I'm
really happy with it it's kind of coming
use for a lot of engagement parties and
Christmas parties that I've had
recently so I've been loving that and
river islands do some good dresses I
think I've also been loving another
thing from whistles and it's this
cashmere jumper it's actually called the
Lily jumper which you know it's just
meant to be but I really like it it's
just plain grey it's so so soft keeps me
really warm it's just a very kind of
plain but it looks so nice with jeans
and it's got kind of a nice detail on
the back with this line going down the
middle a jewel if you want a schmooze
you need to kind of get it dry-cleaned
which there's a bit of a pain this is
definitely jus a good wash but I've been
wearing it so much recently and I just
love it
I'm gonna cheat but one more thing in
here because I can't do a video about my
wardrobe and not mention my Topshop new
jeans they are the best
skinny jeans ever I used to wear tops up
Jamie's butt they stretch really easily
if they become really baggy and the
leaves are just so good they're much
thinner and stretchy and they're really
really skinny fit I recently made my mom
start wearing them and she loves them
now as well if you need some good skinny
jeans I've definitely recommend the
Topshop leaves I have them in every
color and I think I have two black pairs
they're so good one thing I would say
though is they've recently redesigned
them so they don't roll up at the bottom
and they're actually come up a bit
shorter I bought a 32 leg and they were
too short so I had to go back and get
there to fall so that's everything from
my closet confidential tag thanks Fleur
for tagging me and I'm gonna put a list
below in the description bar of people
who I'd like to see do this video I hope
you enjoyed taking a peek inside my
wardrobe and thanks so much for watching
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
