the morning my hair is really frizzy but
like the old flogger today just because
I haven't vlogged like a day at home for
a while
I'm just gonna go make my breakfast
because I soaked some oats last night so
I can make me sleep Anna's coming over
at like lunchtime so we can film our
beauty chat together okay so my porridge
oats have been in milk overnight and I'm
gonna add in some yogurts apples which
are there and maple syrup the vlogs are
distracted by the sleeve Booker's new
video but I just added in mind apples
and bit of maple syrup and a bit of
honey mix it all together kind of looks
like mush but it tastes absolutely sheis
and it's not dry rabbit food like dried
music it can be it's all like kind of
like a yogurt but much better I'll put
the recipe for this in the description
bar below
okay I've done my hair and makeup ready
to film but Anna's just messaged me and
she's really stuck in traffic so I'm
hoping that she'll get here at all but
hopefully in time for us to film for
gets dark and there's just gold boy home
I'm gonna have some lunch haven't eaten
and I'm gonna put on one of these
temporary tattoos models own tattoos and
they're like gold and I just think it
might be fun to try a temporary tattoo
this tattoo is such a throwback because
it's so itchy and it reminds me but when
I was little I used to feel like cartoon
tattoos on I just want to like rip my
arm off is so it's more itchy than when
you get a real tattoo and it starts
scabbing it gets itchy this is seriously
Ichi I also haven't put it on straight I
would make the worst tattoo artist ever
I forgot to tell you guys that we went
out last night for our New Year's Eve
resolution dinner you know we do
different cuisine every month we did
Mongolian we went to a place called
Prince of Wales pub there's so hard to
find Mongolian restaurants in London I
think if you if you recommended that one
it came up on Google you went there
it was a right it was quite fun I have a
tiny bit of a stomach cramp today
because ate noodles now unlike have a
bit of a thing with like wheat noodles
so go struggling today with stomach
cramps but it was still interesting to
try a new cosy next month is Cuban so if
any of you guys have any recommendations
for Cuban place in London at let us know
Anna's here now know we've been catching
up for about an hour just let's just sit
in the kitchen game touch nut powder for
filming we finished filming and we've
been chatting again in the kitchen and
we're now booking twice to LA before the
end of July which is so exciting and
we're kind of good VidCon we're not
really sure we're gonna be out there at
the same time hopefully doing lots of
fun stuff
it's like 6 o'clock now I forgot to say
that Anna left at like 4 HOF or maybe
when I've just been editing since then
so I'm getting on with some work I think
rich is put on dinner it was very kind
of him because he knows that I can't
pretty much work this early I think I
haven't chicken thighs
tonight which should be yummy
I'm gonna go see for it just done this
right how long do you think left rich Oh
kale you taking the stems off the kale
right chaos out burnt it a little bit
that bit might be a bit bit sir alright
so this is how we make our chicken
thighs we just bang banging in a tray
bong a military chicken thighs sweet
potato tomatoes onions garlic it looks a
bit smudged but it tastes good it's a
lot of chicken thighs rich there's only
two of my lunch we can't have lunch eat
my dinner and I'll see you on tomorrow's
out meetings all day so rent flog but
don't eat all the sweet corn I'm going
to Birmingham on Wednesday with Anna
haven't driven there for a long time so
we'll see your Wednesday morning guys I
don't know I've started filming halfway
through do my foundation probably stupid
time stop vlogging but basically I've
logged Monday and Wednesday and then
when I went to edit it was like 14
minutes long so uh-oh done I don't
really need to vlog on the weekend it's
long enough but oh my god it was so
boring
on Wednesday Anna and I went to Berlin
to do a talk and I decided to vlog it
but when I watched it back it was so
boring
I finished blending this in it was so
boring is basically to me saying we're
going here we're going there room now so
I'm just gonna insert like a summary of
what happened on Wednesday so you can
see now morning it's Wednesday today and
today Anna and I are going to Birmingham
to do a little talk at my old uni Anna's
here you ready for Anna and lilies fund
out I'm really ready and burn you I
bought popcorn in case we get hungry I
know we're stuck in traffic
okay I did not do my research the m6
motorway is closed what's meant to be
like easiest journey ever from my house
to Birmingham was like two hours
straight it's now turned into a bit of a
mentor like we're like nearly a
Leicester I don't even know where we are
we're in traffic so let's hope you don't
miss our talk we're literally not moving
like it's a sort of shaft work where
we're not moving at all except for
everyone next they're going to Leicester
jealous
okay we're in Bamiyan was so so late
there okay so we did our little talk
thing and I went fine it was very quick
and Hannah's here yeah okay so that's
basically what happened you didn't miss
much so I'm actually gonna vlog today
instead I'm just doing my makeup it's
Sunday so my hair is up and it's greasy
but I might actually be filming a video
today because I want to do this month's
monthly favorites with rich if I can but
today is the only time we can film so I
might have to do a monthly favorites
video with my hair greasy and tied up
which is a shame I really hate my hairs
to be up and greasy like this but I'm
not a morning hair washing person I
don't have anyone what's the hair in the
morning I have to do it in the evening
so I will be doing tonight that's my
Sunday night routine I'll be using my
bumble and bumble Sunday shampoo that
I'm loving I'm gonna get my blogging
book now and get together all my monthly
favorites
just in case we end up filming but also
today we are in Sunday lunch with my
sister and brother-in-law they are
coming over to make lovely lamb I think
and actually it's perfect timing because
Jamie Oliver I saw I saw this in fawn
for Louise vlogs if you don't know who
from fellow here's operas link below is
a daily vlogger and I love watching his
videos he met up with Jamie Oliver who
is running a campaign in a moment to
encourage or to get learning about food
into the UK school curriculum I think
he's been doing this for quite a long
time but it's kind of officially this
year I think is in May and it's
something I feel really really
passionate about I'm not involved in the
campaign in any way but I really wanted
to tell you guys about it because I was
lucky enough to grow up in a family my
mum's a really good cook and we very
healthy and I've always known about
vegetables and healthy food but a lot of
families of children are like that and I
think is definitely important to have
learning about food as part of the UK
school curriculum and because my sister
Carly and my brother not been are coming
over today with my nephew ASA
he is the best example of a kid who has
been exposed to all types of food his
whole life Carly embedded massive like
foodies that we all are my family but
ASA literally is everything heat seafood
he's like he's nearly three he seafood
he loves chilli and spicy sauces he'll
eat absolutely everything so he's gonna
come over today and he likes to really
he likes to be quite hands-on when they
cook and he's gonna help them
prep the lamb so I thought would be
quite funny to film him doing his little
cooking thing and or linking quite
nicely with Jamie Oliver's campaign so
I'm going to put all the information for
Jamie Oliver's campaign in the
description bar below there's a petition
that you can sign up to and there's ways
you can share it on your social media
and there's like a whole big day thing I
don't know I'm gonna do a research and
put it all below but definitely
interesting something I feel quite
passionate about so spread the word I'm
wearing dungarees today they are so
comfortable I would definitely recommend
them I don't care for like a massive
child they are so so so comfy and
there's a little pocket here for my
vlogging camera which is handy Carleen
been an ASA here now and we're gonna
make some lunch
they said what we're gonna get picked
from the garden rosemarie know Jesus
saying he knows that rosary yep give me
your paw and then pick off the green
bits my hands smell smell it it smell
nice know that we can't eat that's an
olive tree you pick some of these you
can make a hole you wanna take this
knife and push it in ready and I'm gonna
give you some garlic to put you number

ASA and Carly and Ben are heading out to
go for a walk because the lamb takes
four hours to cook I told you he's so
cute so into cooking he's literally like
a mini Jamie Oliver's hilarious I'm not
gonna film a video with rich riches oh
my god I have my family at my hair like
this
I finished filming my favorites video
with rich how was it I was good felt
like I mumbled a lot well it's good I
was the same to rich I'm really like
that he feels comfortable like talking
about beauty products and not being like
embarrassed because he's a guy who's not
gay and likes Beauty I think it's really
good and he was saying like yeah why not
he likes being fussy about his products
and I think it's really cool so you
talked about beauty and non beauty and
its kind of little snippet of what
you're gonna get on some day maybe I'm
not sure what's going on but we now have
to go and do some food shopping and if
you bits and bobs rich just go into
Hamburg this week for work just be sad
for four to four or five days and he
