be talking through my December favorites
I didn't do a favorites video last month
because everything was all up in the air
after my month off in October and I had
all the book stuff going on and I think
it's like the first time ever that I
missed favorites but I just thought I
would leave it until December and do one
big old favorites now so I've got beauty
I've got home and I've got style so
let's start with the beauty stuff and
the first one is proper random because
it's a hand soap by anything I've ever
loved a hand wash so much I do love my
ESOP one but this is from super duper
and it's the super juicy passion fruit
hand wash I thought this was great
through for so long until I actually
read it but I'm not even joking we use
this when we I saved it until we were
moving and then as soon as we came into
this house I put it in the kitchen and I
remember using it on my moving day oh my
god I've never smart anything so strong
and delicious in my whole life like
every time I wash my hands this just
makes me happy and everyone comments on
it when they use it it's so great if you
love like a zingy fresh fruity scent
which I do like in a hand wash because
it makes me feel clean this is amazing I
really love it sorry if the light goes
in and out by the way I'm just using my
vlogging camera and natural light but I
prefer it the next product is from
therapy which is brand I love from
Michelle Walker and Neil this is the
slumber pillow spray I didn't know that
she did pillow sprays I think cult
Beauty sent this to me and oh my god I
love it I think there's a few different
ones actually this one smells one minute
it just smells like beautiful essential
oils it smells like the best Bath you've
ever had in your life
and it's quite different actually to
that this works wrong which I do love
it's my favorite one but they're quite
different which makes me feel like I can
have one of each and it's in a really
nice glass bottle that looks really
pretty on your bedside table I don't
know I'd like to say it's been helping
me sleep I actually think I've been
sleeping so well in this new house I'm
not sure why I actually really don't
even like our bedroom but I'm sleeping
really well maybe it's quieter or maybe
the blackout blinds I don't really know
but maybe this is helping to I've fallen
back in love with the laura mercier
radiance primer and this is because a
friend of mine who's not at all like in
this world says that she uses it every
day and I thought god I used to love
that years ago
I know I have one just like in one of my
drawers somewhere so I kind of got it
out started using it and I'm using it
everyday and it's so nice to give a
really nice glow to your skin like under
your foundation you can definitely just
wear this alone as well but I still
think this is one of the best like
radiance primers that there is and I
love that it comes in a tube so I've
been using that every day for the last
like two months I wasn't sure if I'd
mention this anyway yet because I'm
completely obsessed with it I think I
just mentioned on Instagram stories it's
by Terry blusher
it's her compact expert jewel powder in
number Seven's some desire and this is
the only blusher I've been using for the
past two to three months it's got this
slightly brownie kind of pink around the
edge and then a more corally pink in the
middle
I just swirl them together and I feel
like it gives me kind of obvious blush
which I like because my blush is always
the first thing that disappears off my
face throughout the day so this one
really lasts and I think it gives a
really nice kind of fresh rosy glow it
goes really well with my bronzer as well
and it's got such a nice pigment to it
it's really great quality I'm just
loving by terry products in general at
the moment I'm still obsessed with the
concealer which I think I mentioned in
the last favorites video that I did two
more Beauty bits and they're both
candles first one is the over rose
candle in Val Korea now this one
obviously hasn't been lit but I have - I
bought one for myself and then Anna
bought this for me as part like I'm
moving in present she actually bought me
a really really nice moving in present
with all different things anyway this is
one of them she's like I'm so sorry I've
just seen when you took me up to your
bedroom you've already got one I was
like don't be sorry this is my favorite
candle ever it's so I can't remember
what's in I always forget but I think
it's fake and peach which is a really
unique combination and it's just such a
gorgeous fresh uplifting scent I also
love the kind of matte pink packaging
and the actual wax itself is pink I got
mine from Suzanne but I'm pretty sure
over Rose is its own brands you can buy
in other places I'll try and link it
down below that these candles are
incredible and then another candle I
couldn't not mention this I pretty much
finished this last night there's a tiny
bit left but this is the spacing cage
shimmering spice I get it every year I
don't even like cinnamon or clove or
anything like that but for some reason
this candle
love it just reminds me of festive
Christmas shenanigans it's so good and
really kind of fills the room with a
Christmassy scent and I really liked the
Sears packaging everyone's going very
colorful this year Joe Malone Space NK
okay so that's all the beauty stuff done
now on to style I've been obsessed with
this next jumper that I'm wearing now
I've got it in a cream it's got these
little kind of baubles on it's really
soft and cozy sometimes I find when you
buy jumpers from a slightly more
affordable brand the quality isn't as
good but I find with next the quality is
so great these jumpers are really soft
especially I also have it in the red
which I really love it's just so festive
I really like the subtle kind of
Christmasy bauble type thing but it's
not obvious it's just subtle it's like a
subtle Christmas jumper and you have
been wearing them like around the house
when I go out it's just an easy thing to
throw on top of a t-shirt so cozy
comfortable also it's not too long and
it's not too cropped it just kind of
sits at the perfect place just above my
jeans also I've just been so obsessed
with this I did a job with the white
company and I wasn't expecting to get
anything but at the end of the job I was
wearing this jumper for the photo and
she said or would you like to keep the
jumper I was like oh my gosh yes please
I would love to keep this it is a
Kashmir I just love cashmere cashmere
white company jumper white with this
like Breton stripe I love stripes and
I've never had a Kashmir stripes jumper
I'm not sure this is something I would
have bought on my own just because it's
quite a splurge so I'm really really
grateful that they gave this to me I
need to buy one of those cashmere homes
because I find that some of my cashmere
jumpers are going a little bit bubbly
and I think white company sells one and
you kind of like brush over the bubbles
and it kind of shaved as them off maybe
I really need to look into that or so
I'm pretty sure Ana did a blog post on
like how to look after your cashmere I
need to I need to read that I've just
remembered that I've left one of my
favorites upstairs in my bedroom and I'm
feeling super lazy and I can't be
bothered to go upstairs I have been
obsessed with my Suzanne leather bucket
bag so obsessed that I'm genuinely
considering buying it in black because I
want one that goes with every outfit
because the one I have is Navy which I
really really like it's a real leather
bucket bag so it's quite like stiff
because it's leather but it's the
perfect size for what I want to go out
and take all my stuff including my
Fujifilm XT
to camera which I love to take out for
like Instagram photos and stuff so it's
the perfect size I don't have many
hammocks that fit a camera in it like a
big camera I think it looks really smart
it's really comfortable to wear either
crossbody or just on your shoulder and I
really really love it I'm just obsessed
Susanna in general everything they do I
missed out on the voiture I really want
one of their boys shirts okay home stuff
we haven't bought that much stuff for
the home yet I'm gonna do a video in the
new year on our kind of house renovation
plans and everything will become very
clear then but we've been getting lots
of like Ikea bits just for in the
meantime but some things I've really
been enjoying and first of which are
these Aldi lamps which I'm gonna insert
like a video clip of I saw them on
mother of daughters Instagram and Erica
Davies everyone seems to be talking
about them and for good reason because
they are 20 pounds they've got this like
amazing marble base and then it's like
the kind of metal steel whatever kind of
fit it's really hard to explain and it's
like exposed lightbulb and it comes with
the bulb so the table laps 20 powers and
then they've got a floor lamp version
for 30 pounds which is just such a
bargain you can get exactly the same
thing in other companies for like 150
pounds so our so excited Rachel there's
ordered some straightaway they come in
black or rose gold they were sold out of
the rose gold which I wanted to fill my
bedroom so I got another black I really
like them my sister's got one everyone's
getting them they are so great so really
happy with that purchase also my IKEA
plant basket I went I cleared to get
some other bits obviously got a plant
while sells there and then I saw that
they have this like plant basket which
is really untrained at the moment it's
really affordable it's lined inside so
that if it gets water in it it doesn't
kind of seep through the basket and I
just think it looks really expensive and
really nice I'm really happy with that
purchase as well and then finally this
hmm bars which I just saw when I was in
H&amp;amp;M home did some other bits that I
thought that looks really expensive as
well I really love the color it's like
the same color as my nails I love the
texture on it it's kind of that like
artichoke trend and it's also the
perfect size I like to kind of cut the
stems off flowers so they're quite short
and then put them in a small VARs I
think that looks really nice and kind of
compact
sometimes a big flight floral
arrangement I think is a bit much so I
really love the kind of small
all over medium-sized bars and everyone
Durst and the ones where they've got a
really tiny opening I'm like what can
you even put in that this one's got a
really decent opening at the top so you
can put like a whole bunch of flowers in
I had yellow tulips in and it worked
really nicely with the blue so that is
everything for my December favorites
last favourites of the year which is
crazy but I mean I'm very excited for
2018 I've got my book launch if you
haven't yet seen my book announcement

stuff coming up and lots of house
related things I really hope that we get
to do the house up in 2018 that's gonna
