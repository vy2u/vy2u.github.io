you how to create a simple photo all
this is something really nice and simple
to put above a desk or in your bedroom
the first thing you want to do is lay
out all the photos that you want to put
up this is a good way to get an idea of
the different shapes and sizes that you
have
I got mine from a range of places I have
some photo booth photos some greeting
cards some photos I printed at home and
some prints I got from Camden Market
so the first thing I'm going to do is
make templates and this is a good way of
working out where on the wall you want
to place your pictures without having to
ruin the pictures at all in the process
I'm just going to outline the photos
onto black paper with pencil and then
cut them out so you have the same shape
as the picture
and then I'm just gonna do this but all
of the other pictures
I then label them so I know which
pictures which when I'm putting them up
on my wall
to keep the pictures in place I'm just
going to be using some blue tack
so then all you have to do is put them
up on your wall and you can keep moving
them around and playing with the shapes
and sizes until you're happy with the
layouts for this one I'm just gonna hang
it on a nail so once you're happy with
the layout take a step back and make
sure you're happy with how it looked and
I'm gonna be using washi tape what you
tape is great because you can take it on
and off without ruining your wallpaper
at all so I'm just going to put some
small strips around the edges of the
photo and then place it where the black
card was
I personally like using bright colored
washi tape so I'm using a coral and a
turquoise and I think if it's really
nice but you can get washi tape in so
many different colors
I went for a bit of a monochrome black
and white look but you can of course
make it as colorful as you like
so that's it I told you it was simple
but I think it's a really nice way to
personalize a blank corner of your room
I hope you like the short video and
maybe you can do something similar
yourself at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
