you a little tour of my dressing table
or Beauty desk whatever you like to call
it I've got this one from Ikea it's
called the IKEA mom dressing table and
it's just a really easy one it's not
necessarily the one I wanted to have
forever but at the moment spending a lot
of money on a dressing table is just not
a priority for me with all the house
stuff going on so this one's perfect
it's a good size it's got a really big
drawer underneath so although it's not
the most stylish of dressing tables it's
very practical and there are some really
good IKEA hacks online actually on how
to make this look a little bit cooler
for me I'm just happy with the kind of
plain white style for now so I haven't
done a video like this in a while and I
didn't really ever think I was going to
again it's not necessarily my style
anymore but I've had a massive downsize
in my beauty stash and I thought it
would make an interesting video to show
you my beauty desk slash entire makeup
collection because back in the day and I
think when I write a blog post about
this but back in the day I used to
collect so much makeup it was a mix of
being obsessed with it but also getting
sent a lot of products because of my job
naturally I get sent a lot of new
launches and some launches can include
like 200 lipsticks and as lovely as it
is over the years it's been quite
difficult to manage because I don't like
wasting products so its mix of giving
stuff to friends doing charity sales and
keeping stuff back from me and I ended
up just having this huge collection of
makeup sitting in my Urban Outfitters
drawers that are in my office I'd have
it all organized under lips face and
like it was all labeled and it looked
great but what I found since moving into
my new place is that I was never going
and using those products in the other
room I just wanted to use the stuff that
was in front of me when I'm getting
ready on my desk and the idea of just
having makeup sitting in those drawers
going out of day getting really gross
I just hate hoarding I hate having
things just for the sake of having them
and I thought other people could
actually use them and it seems like such
a waste so I had a massive downsize in
my collection I thought if I haven't
used it in the last six months it's
moving into the house then why do I need
it at all and now my collection all fits
into this dressing table I still think
there's a lot of makeup to have for like
a normal person but compared to the like
youtuber videos that you see that I used
to make myself I think I actually
have quite a small collection now so I
wanted to show you guys like the
products I use every day and everything
else and how I kind of organize it and
store it in this desk right before we
get started just wanted to quickly say
this shirt I'm wearing is from Lily and
Lionel and I absolutely love it
I'm gonna bring you guys closer and then
let's take a look at what's on top of
the dressing table first on top of the
desk I have this little perspex
container from Muji so the top flips
open and then there are two drawers and
this is the stuff I like to use daily I
don't want to keep opening the straw
because it's like a little bit dodgy so
I like to just be able to grab the
things that I wear most days when I'm
not feeling like experimental so in here
I've got the glossier SPF the Becca
backlight priming filter the Charlotte
Tilbury flawless filter the it cosmetics
CC cream Mac hush cream highlighter this
which is new from Kiehl's it's the glow
of formula skin hydrates that are really
enjoying that by terry blusher new
chanel bronzer and the new Chanel tinted
moisturizer so often when I'm trying new
things I'll put them in my daily stash
and then I like bring things in and out
something's like never change and then
other things if I'm trying them out I'll
put them in there and then in the second
drawer I've got my NARS concealer and
bare minerals concealer my lush pose a
lip balm hourglass brow gel Mac Brown
eyeliner benefit brow pencil and then
two mascaras this is the benefit BADgal
bang and the L'Oreal paradise again with
mascara czar like switch them out so
I'll use I'll have like two on the go
and then once they're finished or if I
don't like them I'll get rid of them and
put a new one in here to use daily this
is a new chanel eyeshadow palette that
I'm trying out and wearing today it's
really pretty and then the usual two
that are kind of always in here on my
Mac quad which have like four of my
favorite eyeshadow is in there and the
Urban Decay Naked petit heats palette
I'm not going to go through and like
actually show each product and like talk
about what it's like in the name and the
color and stuff because we will be here
forever so if there's anything that I've
liked particularly mentioned I'll put it
down below if you guys have seen me talk
about a product and you're not sure what
it is just leave me a comment and I'll
try to get back to you but I probably
spoken about all these products before
anyway so just to the right of the
is this little trait from West Elm which
is really cute and then I always keep
one
Beautyblender on there this one's damp
because I used it this morning so that's
normally the one I have on the go I'm
like a little bit lazy I'd say I use
these like two days in a row before
washing them but you know my face is
clean so then I have this mirror it's
really nice it's brass I got this for my
30th birthday from my sister it's from
Rockettes and George which is a website
I really love and that just sits nicely
on there and then here this is actually
just a sample of our kitchen worktop
from Caesarstone i thought that would be
nice to rest a few things on so this is
a Joe Malone candle it's the pomegranate
Noir isn't my favorite scent but it's
quite nice for a kind of room like this
glossier you perfume which is perfume I
work I've almost finished that I really
love it this is the Tatra luminous dewy
skin mist which is a really nice kind of
post makeup mist and then this is just a
perfume that I trying to use up because
it's the germ alone which sage and Cecil
and there's only a tiny bit left so I
put it out there the rest of my perfumes
are down in the bathroom but these are
just like the two I'm wearing at the
moment then over here I've got this
which is from Anthropologie and it's
actually a plant pot which I've filled
with rice and when I first did this
people were so worried they like you're
gonna get ants I have not got any ants
or anything it's not a hot country so
it's absolutely fine to use dry rice
it's quite a lot of brushes but I do
kind of use them all there's a mix of
Real Techniques Mac so ever this is my
made compost which normally lives in my
lounge but whilst I'm here I'm using it
as a little dressing table stool and
then let me show you guys what's in the
drawer so it's pulls out really smoothly
only comes out halfway there is an IKEA
hack if you want to make it come out
further but I've filled this to the max
so I don't want the whole thing to
topple over but this is my entire makeup
collection this is everything I own I
hope it inspires other youtubers to
downsize their collection because I'm
pretty impressed with myself going from
how much I had before to just this but
as I said it's still a lot of makeup for
the usual person so I'm going to talk
you through everything from left to
right and I hope you don't mind this
kind of loggy style but I thought it
would be better for you guys on the left
hand side I keep my straighteners which
other ghd's and my kind of daily hair
products I've got the wet brush there
I've got a rich kid from igk which is
why I put on my hair once straighten it
and I've also got idk dry shampoo there
as well and then in this little bit I've
got kind of hair bounds hair clips
tweezers sharpeners and nail clippers
moving on just to the right of that I've
got some foundations these are all the
foundations I have alpha Charlotte
Tilbury fancy Armani NARS and then on
this side is more kind of lighter tinted
moisturizers or primers I've got Bobby
Brown primer fresh charlotte tilbury
Estee Lauder CC cream makeup for ever
and Laura Mercier behind that this
doesn't really fit very well but I've
basically got just an urban decay
palette and a zoeva palette they get
fits better if I do it that way and then
moving to the right I've got lipsticks I
had so many lipsticks then I just got to
come to the realization that I can't
wear that many lipsticks anymore so I
got rid of a lot of them and these the
ones I kept got some gorgeous like
Chanel ones I mean the packaging is
lovely but also these are just really
nice lipsticks there's like a red I've
got a few shots Newberry lipsticks are
Marnie this Tanya burr one which I
really like this is called pink Coco and
then I've got Laura Mercier a few Mac
this is the femme T lip gloss the Revlon
lipstick I love and then a few different
lip liners there as well these are
mascara is probably what I have the most
of just because I want to try every
mascara I get sent because you don't
really know like you can't say all that
mascara is not for me all Moscato has
seemed to work on me so I tend to try
things and like I said I either put it
in my daily stash or I give it get rid
of it you can't reshare mascaras so I've
got a mix of L'Oreal like fairy drops
Lancome quite a few bad I need to get
through and then I've got a couple of
Gracia highlighters there couldn't
decide which ones keep so I kept them
both in the end this little tub by the
way these containers are from Muji
they're really handy these are all cream
eyeshadows there's a couple of eyeliners
in there as well like a nude one a brown
one one liquid eyeliner because I really
don't wear liquid eyeliner that much
anymore there's no point having loads
and then a couple of cream eyeshadows as
they Lord a Mac and a single shadow from
Burberry
this is where I keep my kind of blushes
and bronzers which is definitely what I
have the most of I always have
been so obsessed with blush and bronzer
I've got a Charlotte Tilbury highlighter
back there and then a few different
highlighters hourglass Becca her cream
on and a powder one Tanya burr Tarte
blusher Bobby Brown bronzer and Nas
highlighter and these are a mix of
blushes from like Mac Bobby Brown YSL do
your that's a Charlotte Tilbury powder
to face bronzer and then this it
cosmetics palette which is like a
blusher a highlighter and a buns I
didn't want to get rid of that because
that's actually really good for travel I
also forgot to showed it in the middle
here I've got a cream blusher from
Chanel and my two glossy cream blushes
as well which I really love and then on
the end here I have a Mac highlighting
palette and my Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow on the end here
I've got all my beauty blenders which I
keep in here so I could just easily get
one out I have loads
I just realized I've been calling it
Beauty Blender but this definitely the
Real Techniques complexion sponge which
I much prefer to the Beauty Blender I've
got one Beauty Blender there I love the
shape of the Real Techniques one so I
keep those there and then these are have
spare brushes that I don't want to get
rid of because they were expensive or
some of them are really good for travel
but kind of keep those there and I've
also got some like makeup wipes back
there for my desk gets but grubby or I'm
trying to make up on my hand and I need
to get it off and then back here I've
also it's obviously not that easy to get
to but they're things I didn't use that
often like Charlotte's will be pallet
busy OTT I shadow palettes Anna stars at
highlighting it's a mini tart eyeshadow
palettes your eyeshadow kind of quad and
then my lorac Pro palette so those are
the only kind of palettes I kept in the
end obviously with my Urban Decay heat
palette which back there so those live
back there and like I said it's not the
easiest thing to get to but it's not
something I use all the time so it's
okay
so that's kind of everything and it's a
lot quicker than I thought to show you
guys and I'm trying to think what the
point of this video is I guess partly to
show that you don't need drawers and
drawers and drawers of makeup and it's
better to kind of find the things that
work for you I've really kind of nailed
down my daily edit of makeup that I like
to wear and then everything else I keep
in this little drawer here and I feel
like I can open it up and see everything
and when I'm sitting here doing my
makeup I can try new things instead of
having them kind of piled away in
drawers in a different room collecting
makeup is fun but it's not necessary and
I far more enjoy like getting use out of
the products I really like then
guilty about having all these products I
don't use so maybe let me know if you
want me to do any other kind of closer
look videos on my like daily makeup I
could do a whole video on that or I can
kind of use the products in the straw to
try a new makeup styles and like I kind
of shot my stache type thing maybe try a
new makeup looks with the products I've
already got I don't know let me know but
I wanted to show you guys my new setup
I'm really liking it I'm sort of using
this room up here which is my old
bedroom to work I've got a lot of setup
in the corner but my beech desk here I
keep my clothes in the wardrobe but then
we're sleeping downstairs in my sister's
old bedroom it's quite nice actually to
have it kind of separated like that it's
actually a really hot day today so I'm
gonna crack open that window again
before I melt let me know if you guys
enjoyed this video and thank you so much
for watching I'll see you in my next one
