why
good morning everyone today it is
Thursday I thought I would vlog because
I have quite a busy day out in town and
then I'm going out tonight and I haven't
blogged in a little while so I'm gonna
bring you guys along with me today and
I've just got up got dressed done my
hair and makeup I'm wearing a lot of
makeup especially for how hot it is
today but because I'm going straight out
tonight
I need my makeup to last and I'm just
gonna kind of top it up later tonight
I'm actually going to a ball like a
masked ball it's with Revlon and it's at
the V&amp;amp;A museum my sisters meant to be
coming with me but I'm not sure if she's
definitely coming or not because I think
her kids might be ill I haven't had an
update on that yet but I do know other
people going so I need to pack like a
dress and heels and makeup for tonight
and I think I'm gonna wear the
self-portrait dress I wore to the
wedding in France I don't know if you
guys saw that it looks like like this so
I think I might wear that it literally
looks so see-through but when you wear
it you can't really tell it's like a
proper masquerade as I said masquerade
ball tonight so I ordered me and my
sister these from Amazon they were
really cheap they're like three or four
pounds and they're kind of bendy so you
wrap them around I thought they were
pretty cool and basically wearing
pajamas today this is a playsuit that I
got in the ASA sale it's kind of
annoying cuz I'm ruining a whole video
that I'm gonna be filming soon but I've
also linked this on my website so if you
guys know but on my blog on the home
page there's a little like square that
says shop my favorites and if you go
there I'm always kind of linking to
stuff like clothes makeup that I'm
loving so this is on there and it's the
comfiest thing ever
it's like proper stretchy and it looks
like a skirt but it's it's shorts there
you go
so yeah I'm really comfy which is good
because the tube it's gonna be vile we
don't have aircon on our public
transport here because it's never really
hot but then there's always like two
days of the year where it's so so hot no
one can handle it at all
the weather it's perfect today
hmm it's warm enough to have bare legs
but it's not a boiling horse it's been
over the past couple of days actually
really really nice I'm just going to pop
into game to drop my bags off and then
I'm actually gonna go eat my cousin
because she's here for America sitting
here for a week and she's in town today
so we're gonna hang out with have some
lunch open it up with Molly my cousin
and we are gonna go to nice town first
because my friend Jake dirtiest today
and he's so hard to buy for but he said
he wasn't trainers so I thought I'd get
him a batch and then you can might pick
guys look how cute this gift card is
from Nike it comes in a little mini it's
like strainer box good thing I've ever
seen come to have a look at hmmm home
haven't been owned ages and some safe
place okay we're gonna go try a place
called aji pokey sounds really dodgy
apparently is like an Asian rice bowl
vegetable type thing this looks so good
I got rice and kimchi and a tuna and all
different kinds of things from ginger
okay that lunch place is really good the
rice is a little bit undercooked but it
was just so yummy and the tuna was
really good and now I'm gonna pop to all
states because Carly wants me to see if
they have some stress in sales tryna
find a dress to wear for my wedding but
she's still breastfeeding so it's quite
hard to find something that she was
comfortable in and is practical so
All Saints and see if we can find this
one dress they had left in stock return
ok I've left my cousin's now they've
gone shopping and I've got a few
meetings this afternoon I'm so thirsty
so I'm going to get a juice and crush I
got the pineapple passion I think is
which is fresh banana fresh pineapple
and a bit of pineapple juice as well
it's very refreshing
I'm just at the gleam office and I've
been going through my peer box and the
lovely guys from Liberty sent me like a
whole bag of stuff so I thought I would
show you what they sent me
and also kathleenlights sent me some of
her color Pop Collaboration so quickly
show you guys what's in my peer box
jouer sent me some blushes and bronzers
and they are so nice these are the two
bronze shades this one's a bit more like
ready this one's a bit more neutral and
then this is a blusher really really
pretty
I've got this from fresh which is their
new vitamin nectar face mask and it
smells like that origins they kind of
overnight masks it smells amazing so I'm
going to try that out voter you've never
tried it but it's a super seat Remsen
oil and it says has parsley seed in it
and I love to parsley seed mask from
Aesop's I thought I'd try that and I
also really like cleansing oils this is
the facial oil to go with it Liberty
also sent me the shampoo conditioner
from the brown mermaid hair number one
and it smells good and the names really
cute so I'll probably give those ago I
love the aroma therapy associate bath
oils and this one is clear mind though
it's a collaboration with Liberty and
you guys know I I need to clear my mind
pretty often I'm quite a stressed person
so this should help the bath and shower
oil this is a candle by number 22 is
that the brush it's a wood stove scent
this is also from the Liberty let me get
it out and show you it's such a pretty
candle it looks like this oh this is um
this is the brand of Sophie Berezina who
is the beauty editor at Elle and I went
to France with her on that Chanel trip
I've just realized this is her candle
range and I really wanted to try this so
really excited about that it smells
amazing it smells like a wood fire this
is the beauty guide from Liberty that
shows like all the new stuff they've got
in I really like isn't gonna have a
little flip through and then this is the
stuff from colour-pop that
kathleenlights sent me there's like a
brown gel eyeliner this
nice and then three of these liquid
lipsticks and shades are really nice
this one's probably a little bit too
Brown for me but these both look really
really nice whoo
okay I've been having meetings all
afternoon and I'm just touching up my
makeup I did some tea and I'm now having
to top up my makeup I did iPhone quite a
lot of makeup this morning so it
shouldn't have to do much I'm just let
put it on too much concealer why am i
doing this while smoky I'm gonna come
back to you one minute so I'm just
touching up my makeup and then we are
going to the Revlon masquerade ball I
still think I'm saying that word wrong
but I'm looking forward to it I was
gonna get dressed up no but you know
what to expect really but it's at the
V&amp;amp;A museum and there's like a really
cool exhibition going on there I think
it's about like underwear throughout the
ages and this I completely imagine that

food quickly as well but I'm just gonna
do my makeup

been someone in each London but this one
right here as well as I haven't made the
ages and it's like a nice Mexican place
