friend Lana she's in London and we're
matching cuter who really didn't plan it
we met up in Oxford Street and I was
like yeah we both look yeah well she
texted me and she was like you won't
miss me because it looked like a 12 year
old child and I'm like oh my god
I did - I think we're dressed as
children today but llamas here in London
for a short while and we really wants to
get together to film if you haven't yet
check that Alana's videos go and check
out her YouTube channel I'm gonna link
it down below I love her videos it's
very like happy and positive and what
you'll feel great when you watch them
know what and we thought why she's here
we would go to boots
and do a little haul and because you
hadn't really picked up anything yeah no
not yet and I love I love shopping in
general and there's so many things that
you guys have here that we don't have in
LA so I'm not sure you have way better
stuff than we do I see I think the
opposite I think you guys have way
cooler things well we went to the boots
on Oxford Street like the Bond Street
end which i think is like the best one
and we went a little bit shopping crazy
yeah we thought we'd show you what it
picked up a little bag here yep okay
guess first there's one thing that we
both got the same oh yeah it says it's
called week week oh my god name with a
bank I don't need any more makeup bags I
have an unhealthy addiction to makeup
bags but sweet so we both got that I got
this but we was telling me that she
loves this and that whenever she travels
she takes us with her it's a deep sleep
pillow spray fall asleep faster
naturally and wake up refreshed I can't
believe they sell this works and boots
now they never used to be facing paper
and this is not like drugstore price oh
but I mean it smells amazing so I'm like
really excited to go to sleep tonight
I'm just gonna spray my pillow and I
think at all hopefully I always like
worry on the bed and then rich is like I
hate when you spray that stuff it's so
nice that I love it I don't even know
how to describe the scent because I'm
terrible at it but I guess a bit
lavender II Oh because Allah
like helps you get to sleep well pretty
sure stuff it's amazing and I will
definitely get back to you guys and let
you guys know yeah I picked up this
because I didn't I've never seen this
before I know that Real Techniques a
fallout Lowe's more like different
shapes sponges and I love the complexion
Perfector what in the orange one so this
is new it's part of their bold metals
collection which is I think like the bit
more like the fancy part of the range
and it's a marble diamond shaped sponge
what I want to use it because it's so
pretty it's going to like angle yeah
alright and then like a slant aside it
says on the back like the top could be
used for buffing and blending the larger
sites for like larger areas and there's
small sized pointed tips like in a
corner or something
it's just so Christie that I do wanna
cover in a foundation oh really cool I
love rotating stuff um okay
so next up let's see I got quite a lot
of stuff I don't want you like to attack
that I know gonna be done um so I also
got some lashes some flirt washes
because I love her lashes they're so
good and we can't get it in the u.s. and
so whenever I come here that's probably
not the best to show you I'm gonna show
you one of them um so they look like
these these are the Fleur loves I guess
I love them they're very very good and
you have amazing lashes but um but still
for like parties and stuff I feel like
okay especially in LA everyone wears
fake lashes and so whenever I don't wear
fake lashes I totally regret it when
they have pictures yeah so I feel like
once I saw everyone's amazing lashes but
I'm worried that once I start like won't
feel the same yeah I know I know I'm
just not I usually save it for like
special occasion yeah don't do another
one okay okay so I thought quite a few
things from soap &amp;amp; Glory because so big
glory is actually really difficult to
find I know that they do sell it in some
places in the US but it's very very
difficult to find so I got this which is
heal genius foot cream I've never
purchased yeah I love you
I actually forgot that I actually bought
it I ever picking it up but I don't
remember putting it inside of my car but
anyway I bought it apparently and I'm
pretty excited to use it
apparently foot creams are really good
to use um right before bed so you just
like you put it on your foot and then
you put on your sock which means you
little girls yeah and then I'm assuming
that when you wake up it feels all nice
is it like peppermint I don't know let's
see but I like foot creams that always
have them in sentence
it's not like anything it smells like
safe and glory and then I have a few
other things I have the mascara that
Lily also said it's really good it is
they're thick and fast mascara I mean
you got that one so I'm excited for that
and then I got their archery brow tint
and precision shaping pencil so it has
like a regular pencil on one end and
then it has like a brow pen on the other
end so that's really interesting and
then I got it in the blonde shade which
I'm not sure if it's gonna look too good
because I like my ever also be a little
bit dark so we'll see what see and then
and then I also got this eye liner that
Lily also a super cabin I think that's
like one of the best jobs still black
liquid yes what what is it comparable to
like um Kat Von D have you ever tried
that one yes is it good it's a bit less
like bendy okay a bit more like old
school like felt hip but a good one I'm
excited by you sneeze it all the time
until I found the Tom Ford one and now I
use that all the time it's okay I had to
get another se Maximilian Strasser but
I'm pretty sure that's it's like my
favorite nail polish fella ever and I've
actually finished the bottle I can't
believe I finished a nail polish it's
pretty much finished I can't believe
anything else out of it so I got another
one because I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
wear this on my wedding day which is
exciting I tried it out on my own nails
and toes for my Henry
and I really like this I'm like it I
like it because it's not it's like a
muted blue color exactly very greyish is
that case like a gray greeny blue turns
out I have another soap &amp;amp; Glory product
that Lily also my kitchen you can never
leave without this sounds like my
favorite ever bro yeah so it's a bronzer
let me see if I can open it but it's a
bronzer and it has two colors so it has
a lighter color and yeah that guy is
like the first time you use it that's so
cool
yeah so it has two colors and I like it
because it's definitely a light enough
shade because I'm usually pretty pale
right now I have a little bit of a town
yeah but usually a fairy tale so I might
paint a skin turns yeah what's it kind
of build up I like where like Caleb
brushes it's nice because it's not too
warm yeah and then I also since we were
on the theme of nail polishes I got
these which are from Barry M I had never
tried them I got the coconut infusion
the old paint that's why the newest oh
yeah yeah have you tried them yeah
they're nice they're meant to be like a
bit more hydrating for your nails Oh
always nice and then I also got the
jelly nail theme yeah they're like more
gel formula yeah Edgar and I like the
colours I think it's really nice it's
very summery yeah I love blue nail
polish meat you love it it's like the
most unnatural nail polish gonna ever
pile of there's my table but I mean
honestly when people wear nail polish
it's not supposed to look natural or not
clean the rest everything else I have is
just lip products so we now have NYX in
boots which is so exciting it's like it
isn't it is it
NYX no I said next all but some people
do say in my ex I don't think NEX I'm
gonna say next
cuz it's more fun to say but we now have
it in boots or just it excites you know
I also and I was like what should I get
cuz you up see notes brown way better
than I do and you recommended the butter
gloss yeah I think I have tried one of
these before a long time ago I can't
really remember but I definitely this is
creme brulee
yeah I'm really nice like pale pink yeah
and it's definitely it's not too
pigmented so it's nice yeah I like I
liked it when it was kind of easy
to wear like you don't need a mirror to
apply it yeah I usually just like slap
it on and it works so I'm going to try
that so I picked up the Kate Rimmel
lipstick I don't know if this is a new
one yeah I think they've got like a new
collection of Kate Moss shades like
they're all nude
even tried any of them yeah it's often
it looks really pretty this is number 54
rock-and-roll nude and it looks like
this I just love a new color I think
it's so pretty
the ones I tried all like really new you
does like me not for me yeah yeah so I
don't know exactly how it's gonna look
but it looks really really pretty on the
- doesn't it nice and I love the
packaging as well pink yeah like a rose
gold yeah the other lip product I got is
from think this is collection I don't
remember what brand is but I think I
think it's collection anyway the Rangers
cool deluxe
and they're just like creamy lipsticks
and I thought that was a nice like rosy
shade yeah that's a very me color so I
hope it I hope I like it I need to get
more rosy colors because I feel like I
always go for like the really like pinky
although it's pretty similar yeah this
is no bit okay see I should have gone
naughty let me know how I did so I also
got this from natural collection which I
guess is like an all-natural kind of
brand and it's a blush in a pink shade
because a lot of pink blushes I got it
in the color pink cloud yeah they love
their blushes like they're $1.99 is so I
know it's amazing it's very cute little
packaging it is really cute and it's
nice because it's like easy to its tiny
and it's just like easy to throw any
back I don't know if natural collection
is a natural brand really it would be
ridiculous Atheneum yeah maybe is I
don't know yeah if you guys know yeah is
it a natural brown don't know is it just
come with that
yeah the blushes are really nice okay my
final product is from soap &amp;amp; Glory and
it's the sexy mother pucker gloss stick
3d volume lip shine so it's like a
little crayon I kind of like lip crayons
because they're so easy just to put on
but I hope it's not too glossy I don't
like a really glossy lip but it sounds
like it's gonna be kind of moisturizing
I'm just so into my nude lipsticks at
the moment I have worn red in like a
year I love new lips yeah so easy
so yeah that's lots of lip products
apparently today I should have bought
all of it because now I'm so curious
okay I have only two more things I have
the one two three CC cream from Bourjois
I got the latest raid because as I said
before I'm usually pretty pale so since
I'm gonna be going back to the US soon
and we don't have where's wah I thought
that I know why we don't it's such a
good brand i I'm eight I get that one so
I was like I think Ana really likes that
yeah so I'm excited to try that I've
actually heard other people talking
about it I don't know if it was Lisa
yeah I think she has actually yeah I
think so yeah I think so
so I bought it I'm really excited to try
that out and then I also got a tiny
little Bioderma there was so much by
them and like all the different products
yeah
and is that you have to get the tiny one
it's so good I always say this happening
with me I feel like I'm a kind of person
that I just love small things you never
see anything like like travel-size I
always buy it like I don't need this we
don't have much trouble i stuff here

in mini like a mini gnar's Grusha
