makeup routine and this is kind of
spontaneous but I woke up this morning
thought why not put my makeup on on
camera and I think a few things have
changed it's my last one not much
there's still got my staple products
that I love but quite a few things have
changed and it's really simple makeup
it's just this literally my everyday
makeup so I hope you enjoy it I've been
really ill over the last few days so
sorry about my voice and my face and
anything ill related that you notice
that's because I've literally been in
bed for the last three days but I hope
you enjoy it and maybe find it a bit
helpful
okay so I've already done my morning
skincare routine and moisturize loads
especially because my skin is really dry
at the moment and I'm just going to
start by using this NARS primer this is
the pore refining primer
it's the oil-free one so I'm just going
to put a bit of this rolled over and
then just smooth it over my face just
creating a nice sort of blank canvas
base and it's my makeup lasts much
longer as well and today I'm going to
use my origins plant scription SPF 15
foundation because this is really
moisturizing I really like to use it
when my skin's dry just makes my skin
feel amazing and it makes it look glowy
as well this is in the color 0-2 light
neutral I just put it onto my finger and
put onto my face you could be quite
generous with this on because it's not
really a heavy it's kind of a bit more
than tinted moisturizer got alright
anyone know of this I use it so much and
then I'm going to use my stick Real
Techniques stippling brush to buff this
in and I prefer this one then the
buffing brush for foundations like this
because it doesn't sort of just push it
off it blends it in better when it's the
thinner foundation so using circular
motions could really work this into the
skin and it makes it look really
and flawless keep puffing I spend quite
a lot of time doing this I think it's
very important to have a good base we
put the rest of your makeup on so it's
worth spending a bit more time on your
foundation or tinted moisturizer
wherever you use it smells so good this
one it just feels like a skin care
product that's why I really like it
doesn't feel like a pan or loads of
makeup so just make sure it's all
blended in will over and good chin okay
I think that's blended in so that's my
base and then fo concealer the first one
I use is the Bobbi Brown corrector in
light bisque
I just repurchased this one it's a sort
of salmony pink color which is good for
under eyes dark circles which I have at
the moment really badly and because it
counteracts the dark and sort of just
neutralizes the color rather than
covering up which i really like and i
use a gemma kid number seven i think as
a concealer brush so i just take a
little bit out like that I think a lot
of people use our fingers but I just
prefer doing it like this not sure why
and then I just put some just in the
inner corner and just underneath that I
like that paint alone should be enough
and then I take my Mac two to four I
think this is yeah I'm a cutie 4 so I
just blend that in circular motions
which will it's all blended in I'm going
to take a bit more watch Lee I think
because when you get a new one
it's kind of hard it's not like warmed
up yet so it's quite hard to get not put
up down and I also had really dark
circles at the moment
and then I'm going to use this origins
concealer this is the plant scription
concealer to go alongside foundation I
also really like this as well if you use
this for ages I'll definitely buy
another one if I run out it's really
good really moisturizing I just put a
bit more of this under my eyes because I
need a bit more extra coverage there a
bit wrong my nose I've got my red nose
at the moment I mean those and then on
my chin those are places that I always
need to cover up and then again with the
same two to four brush just blended this
can see is really easy to blend like
that quick it's very moisturizing so it
doesn't cling to any dry patches if you
have dry skin it's just really nice and
again feels like skin care product it's
really hard to do your eyes like open
your mouth anyone else find that very
night and then sometimes I use a powder
at this point normally these foundations
very jewy and sometimes if I can need a
bit of powder today I won't because my
skins would you join its kind of it
likes the extra moisture but if I do
I've been using the Rimmel stay matte
powder which I really like actually on
this massive japonesque brush which is
japonesque 333 it's amazing for powder
so I use those if I use powder but today
is a no powder day at this point upper
bit of eyeshadow point Mon I'm just a
give it time to dry for I should get to
the eyeshadow but I've been using this
Creole and Kryolan and if I say it
properly I shadow primer this is better
than anyone that I normally use so I
just put a bit of that on the on my eye
and smooth it over this just makes my
eyeshadow clean better and last but as
one also quite like I think just kind of
smoothes out eyelid areas on
which I like that's done oh I left it
upstairs but I normally use the HD
browse Brown beta I don't really need it
today actually but I normally just use a
clear brow gel I just use the through my
brows I'm quite lucky I don't need to do
my brows because as you can see they are
massive so next I'm going to use a
highlighter which will just make me look
nice and glowy and I'm going to use the
D or amber
diamond it's not what it's called yeah
I'm a diamond this is the one that I
rushed out to buy when everyone said
it's being discontinued and it's not but
I'm glad I bought it I'm going to use
the Mac one 1/3 brush which is kind of a
small blusher brush and then it looks
like this so it's got kind of lighter
colors going to more kind of tan and
brown colors I think if I use these eyes
leti orange so I always stick to this
end mix the two on the end and then just
Pat it onto the tops of my cheekbones a
little bit though in nose Wow not at all
but really showing up on camera but it
gives kind of a nice glow um then I'm
going to use my all-time favorite
bronzer which is NARS Laguna which I
talked about already many times I've
literally nearly used it up Ashley okay
so I'm going to use the Real Techniques
blush brush yeah it's the blush brush
which I just think too big for blusher
for me so I use this bronzer perfect
especially if you want to do some
contouring and so I get a bit on the
brush which is a bit difficult as a big
hole in the middle and then I just start
from the line I mean I don't know how
many of you know about contouring but if
you do want to contour which means you
sort of make your face look a bit
slimmer and work into the contours of
your face you kind of work from your ear
to the edge of your mat you can kind of
see that natural line when you go to
that so I just start like that and then
I work up as well to the temples
I don't do it too drastically for a sort
of daytime makeup look because I don't
look too overdone and just put it down
as well because I don't local good line
or Franza just make sure everything is
blended I think that's the key not too
much as well you don't look orange
there's quite hostile orange I think
with NARS Laguna that's why I like her
and then for blusher today I'm going to
be using this Bobbi Brown one which is
called pink rose number 42 and this is
really nice color actually I've been
using this a lot recently it's kind of
just like a dusty pink but it's kind of
bright enough that it shows up on me
because a lot of my really pale pink
ones just don't suit me it's bright
enough that it shows on my skin but it's
not too over-the-top it's just really
subtle so I put this on this is a
japonesque 3 to 4 I love for blusher and
just put a bit on the high bits of my
cheek I sometimes put blush on the
apples of my cheek but I prefer at the
moment putting it a bit higher up not
sure why
I go through stages change my mind so
just keep building it up as much as you
want really so it depends on the day how
I'm feeling you know a long day today so
putting a bit more on so that it lasts
like that and then on to eyes I know
some people do eyes fast and then face I
think it depends if I'm doing like a
really smoky eye or something where I
think well I shall it might fall into my
face then I do eyes first but most the
time I do face first it's just kind of a
habit and so for my eyes normally for an
everyday look I go to my Inglot palette
and I use this color here which is four
to two I absolutely love this colors so
random it is like my all-time favorite
eyeshadow from Inglot and it's just a
matte Brown sort of taupey color it's
just I don't know why it just suits me
perfectly and I find it really easy to
wear every day so I use my Mac t17
trusty Mac 2 and 7
spend more of these so I just get bit of
that on two one seven and then just
apply it to my make sure you blend blend
out properly so it's not too dark and
then I got quite a nice like subtle
subtle color do you on both lids of
course that would be weird if I didn't
and then I just take a smaller brush
this is from a hardware this brand is
called this is the smudger gl4 brush and
take the same color this is just a
really basic like everyday eyeshadows
nothing crazy and just take a bit
underneath I feel like this is a step a
really common even when I do my
eyeshadow the top I always feel like I
need something underneath I'm not sure
why maybe it makes me feel like I've got
bigger eyes but I really like to
eyeshadow underneath my eyes on I've
just realised I was really annoying
clocks that tick tocks really loud I'm
gonna have to change that that's driving
me mad
what's really nice then look this clock
my Kia and we like it but it's ticking
really loudly oh got like okay so anyway
back to makeup put that underneath like
that that's pretty much my show done
really easy it's normally could go when
I'm not ill and doing everything slowly
and sometimes if I feel like I need it
I'll use a skin colored eyeliner in my
waterline this is the Rimmel scandaleyes
in nude which is a really good deep for
the Mac one I just put on actually and
that just kind of makes her eyes look a
bit more bright and awake and then
literally for the last five months I
think I've
using a brown eyeliner instead of a
black liquid liner I didn't have been I
just suddenly stopped using black liquid
liners thought like it was a bit too
much for an everyday look and now I use
brown eyeliner and this is my favorite
one it's Makeup Forever aqua eyes in the
color 2l and all the name of the caller
s just as the number on here this is
really nice it's really soft and it's
just a really nice kind of bronzy brown
so I just apply that to the top of the
lashes like that sometimes I have to
make it bit longer just keep playing
around until you think it suits your eye
shape and then do the same on the other
side the problem is I can't see out this
eye so I need to lean a bit closer and
then look straight ahead at the mirror
my mirrors here and just make sure it's
all kind of even as well sometimes
there's like some gaps you need to fill
in I just really like that I feel like
it adds definition but it's not too
over-the-top like black liquid liner
could sometimes be so it's a bit fiddly
if you be tired in the mornings and if
my mascara I'm still loving my origins
ginseng mascara which is just this huge
huge brush as you can see and I just put
this to my top lashes
I don't really bother with the scar on
my bottom lashes unless I'm going on a
night out all this is doing at camp
Ian's mean I'm near the end
as you can see I'm hardly I put in any
effort and it's making my lashes look
huge that's why I like this one
a high bothered of spending hours on my
mascara so that's my eyes that's pretty
much it actually there's one more thing
I have this on my lips just lip balm um
the reason I do these sort of briny
smokey eyes is so that I can wear a
lipstick if I want to a normally I don't
think a head like that with lipsticks I
just decide I kept two o'clock I'm when
I wear a lipstick but in the morning I
always put on a lip balm especially now
my lips and everything so drying this is
the fresh brown sugar lip treatment
which I absolutely love it's amazing and
I put that all over my lips it's really
moisturizing also it was like a little
gloss which was quite like last ages so
that's my finished look and I hope you
like seeing how I do my everyday makeup
office doesn't take that long when I'm
doing up my own on camera I do a lot
quicker but that's kind of the gist of
it so I hope you like that and please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
sort of makeup tutorials how I do my
makeup things I'm going to try and do a
few more I've done a new set up with the
mirror here so let me know if you think
was a riot of I was looking to the side
of it too much and I'd love to hear your
thoughts so thank you for watching and
