which is working from home today
excuse him over there I'm gonna open up
my advent calendars see what's in day
two
okay day two is up here oh so cute
another blackberry Bay oh my god this is
my other favorite this is a great this
is Persephone my two favorite German
perfumes in minis it's like they know me
and then Charlotte so everyone today in
the Charlotte Tilbury advent calendar is
a little mini Charlotte's magic cream
which isn't my favorite moisturizer but
it's good for putting on for your makeup
because it's like seriously hydrating
and glowy I line up my little minis here
okay so the first thing I wanted to do
today before I do my makeup and make
myself look human again
is tidy my office because I've had so
much like hen stuff in here from
planning my best friend's hen but now I
go but I feel like I can actually talk
in my office
and there's just stuff everywhere we
haven't sorted out storage yet for my
office so there's just stuff everywhere
and it's really stressing me so I'm
gonna have like a quick whiz tidy up
somehow and then I'll come back to me
I go things are looking much tidier in
here so I'm going to quickly make myself
some breakfast it's like 20 past 11:00 I
haven't eaten anything yet and then I'm
gonna do a little bit of work with what
guy come around to fix our internet or
just to make it stronger because you've
like paid for the fastest internet ever
and it's rubbish so he's gonna help us
with that and then I've just put in skip
the dentist this afternoon which is very
exciting
yeah sorry I haven't really spoken much
to the camera this morning but we'd had
the decorator in to like cover up this
damp stain on the ceiling and then in
tonight internet guy just came to make
her internet fast and that's really fast
ready for vlogmas he was like what the
hell is vlogmas yeah she said it is it
like an advent calendar where you upload
it every day so that's actually a pretty
good kiss um so I think now I'm going to
pop up to see my sister and honey for
lunch because I haven't seen them in
ages I feel like I haven't seen any of
my family in ages which is weird it's
one of those once you move out you kind
of forget anyone in your family exists
so I'm going to go for lunch with them
and I need to come and do some work I've
got the dentist this afternoon all these
things are very unloggable but I'll try
and do some clips here and there and
then tonight me in which are going on a
date night we're going to Home Slice
they just opened a new branch and we're
gonna go check it out and I'm really
looking forward to pizza I'm going to
use a little bit this by Terry Baume De
Rose in pink lip balm today because I
just want like a slight tint of color
but I don't wanna wear like a full-on
lipstick such a pretty subtle pink color
got a huge chocolate tree that's what
burnt wasn't for apparently
I forgot to vlog any of my food but I
had a chicken burger and chips and it
was really yummy
okay I'm quickly gonna pop into space
okay my mom needs to get a good jeans
and I have a look see what
just driving over to the dentist now and
I'm gonna see if he can fit a wire
because I think I've come to the end of
my braces now and so I'd have to wear it
every night forever they just put a wire
to stop my teeth going back because my
teeth always go crooked they will always
just go that way so let's see what
happens I just popped into my parents
because that really needs a little we
know to nose here you guys haven't seen
her for a while she's definitely grown
but she's still very friendly and cuddly
it always gives you a cuddle when you
walk in do you know look at that teddy
bear face she's a Tibetan Terrier so we
get questions
my parents puppy she's very sweet she
still has her mad hours but she's very
very sweet you need a boss you really
need a bath stop fooling with me I don't
like to be on camera
stop it I'm having a bad hair day I've
got the spot mmm
licky foot
I've made that classic mistake of having
lunch before going to the dentist so the
poor guys gonna have to see like what I
had for lunch in my mouth it's normally
a check-up so I'm hoping that it won't
matter I had to I feel like it my teeth
will clean and perfect it's more just a
braces checkup but I have one of these
there's Evian droplets I'm so obsessed
with these it's like a shot of water a
bit more than a shot but I'm gonna have
one of these now the in problem is once
you open the lid you can't reseal it but
it's good because it kind of forces you
to drink more water which is definitely
good for someone like me I don't drink
enough water at all
look how seriously kita is they called
Evian droplets they're quite hard to
find but they normally do them in like
petrol stations airports places where
you kind of need water on the go
okay I'm out the dentist and I finished
my braces which is exciting I'm gonna
keep wearing the top retainer when I
sleep but he actually fitted a wire to
my bottom teeth so they had to put this
like to stop my tongue from getting in
the way there so like put these like
latex over my mouth and put each tooth
in between it was so uncomfortable it's
hilarious I was like a latex face of the
teeth sticking out and I'm talking a bit
funny because I've got this wire now and
the inside of my teeth you can't really
see it so clever how it's hidden but I
feel about thirteen again like I've got
braces it's so weird but hopefully
that'll keep my bottom teeth straight so
I used a company called clear guide for
my braces and I was really happy with it
it took like eighteen months maybe but
it definitely could have been quicker if
I'd like worn them more regularly but
yeah really happy straight teeth my
family are prone for one ki baatain
teeth so they feel very straight and
then he cleaned them for me which is a
nice I think in the knee and when he get
my teeth whitened properly
apparently I was in Style magazine on
the weekend my mom kept this to me oh
there I am how to take selfie which
actually I was like the worst person for
this because I don't really plan my
selfies but anyway it's still cool to be
in a magazine I'm gonna cut it out and
put it in my book or I keep up my
cuttings I mainly do this because I
think in like 20 years time we're really
funny to read like old Beauty articles
and see how much things have changed
there you go looks very pretty in the
book I also picked up some stuff from my
mom's house I've been said and look how
cute this is
it's a Christmas bauble with a stellar
perfume inside I literally cannot handle
the cuteness of that Stella McCartney
Happy Holidays
hashtag Stella that is so cute I need to
crack that out I was right never a doubt
Stella actually I've got my mom and
sisters phoning me asking what time my
first vlogmas videos going up I swear
they're like my biggest fan girls and
that is actually going up in half an
hour
excited and nervous and all these
feelings mean which are now gonna go out
you know Homeslice me and I don't always
talk about it there's one a coffin guard
and they've opened up a new branch and
where is it Islington I think up the
street so we're gonna go there and try
it out and I'm so excited for pizza
there's quite
from hungria but I will be once this
mother pizza I'm excited to see what the
new branch looks like so we're gonna go
on a little date night now hello all
right excited for pizza
yes what are you gonna get oh yeah
you see what toppings they might have
different up into my special toppings
but this is rich is great you're right
under the spotlight is giving you a
weird face this is Richards new haircut
he went to a Turkish barber there's
really nice recommended by Rob the
groomer the groomer like a cat right now
sighs it's a bit okay I don't know if
you can see me or not but I'm going to
attempt to put on this lip liner which
is clinic intense blush lip liners did
because it won't come off when I went to
my pizza it's like a Kylie Jenner color
okay it's not up the street I got
confused this old street very different
things ones in Shoreditch so we are now
driving to Shoreditch should be fun
East London Pizza I've got to post a
letter for rich so I really exciting
days
oh god why the options we're in Hoxton
square which is really cool place to
come for restaurant is like breakfast
car fire in Red Dog saloon which they do
the man vs. food thing this is likely
loans equal restaurants so if you're
ever in the area common Thomson Square
and there's four star Bertie
Seyed shortage is so edgy it just hurts
okay we're doing a 22 inch pizza and
sharing a half-and-half
although we won't finish it one half he
put salami rocket comes on one of their
like you know basic once we're so good I
could order and then the other one we've
got pumpkin this is the bigger p7 it's a
salami rocket parmesan this is a pumpkin
oh my god
two pizzas down about a hundred to go so
you can do it all
this visa has like a pumpkin puree
instead of tomato it's so clever and so
yummy we've done half the pizza and I'm
still hungry this
I think we are defeated but we did
pretty well and hit the restless home I
am so stuffed so good I love Home Slice
they just have so basically if you don't
know about Home Slice neither do massive
22 inch pizzas that you can do half half
or you can just buy it by the slice and
they're really interesting table manners
like one of those toppings I had like
pumpkin puree with roasted broccoli just
amazing amazing toppings if you're like
really into food you'll like it
so it's delicious and I met one of the
owners called mark who was such a nice
guy all the staff they're always really
really friend of when I go good pizza
awesome yeah my blogs has gotta live and
you're leaving lovely comments oh thank
you so much everyone saying they want
pie load the day to stay and they
weren't rich as thought of the day when
he can so no pressure rich you've got to
think one thing every day we'd have to
do it yet we do it we get home and just
get home for a cup of tea and to watch
I'm a celebrity get me out of here I'm
obsessed lady see walked out today it's
a big drama okay everyone's looking at
me weird now so let's get in the car and
go home
two things one does anyone else's
boyfriend do this annoying thing after
dinner where he says you're driving I
had a pipe what if I didn't want to
drive you didn't even give me the choice
I'm just going to drink and do I want
you in God will do I want to flavor the
taste flavor
fever lazy flavor the fever definitely
go flavor in your mouth
second thing is I'm driving home oh yeah
me and which is really bad habit of what
have we got for dinner we've finished
within like half an hour
we talk we do everything was supposed to
do but we're still so quick we eat too
fast and we're really bad at date nights
so we pay for two hours parking and
we're finished off to half an hour you
should give that's my thought of the day
parking
why it's very instance this happens to
me a few times now I paid over too much
money for where I'm parking so like
we've got an hour and a half left but
they can't give the ticket to someone
else now because a little pain just
on your phone so do I get that refund
they should be looking at where you can
if you have a quick date or they know
they just time you so you start and then
you finish and then when you come back
you finish that was richest thought the
day riveting stuff okay we're just gonna
quickly pop into Sainsbury's because I
really want a Cadbury's Dairy Milk admin
calendar and I'm getting panicky that
it's all about Richard you find me one I
love them forever and ever and ever I
hope you should anyway no I won't
I won't love you otherwise I won't love
you otherwise I said I could see the
chocolates and the sweets
oh my god these are the best things ever
Jerry wants to hang on the tree
definitely in summer they have no left
none at all and this is a huge
Sainsbury's I'm absolutely gutted we're
really sad first year I've lived away
from home my mom used to always buy me
one I feel safer got to buy me one

Christmas is ruined I mean the sales is

chuckling tampons we do well by we're
now in Poundland my favorite place in
the world

calendars I really hope they do they
have no admin comes there although one
