I had an unlimited supply of these
yogurts then I would eat breakfast every
morning who is ringing me I'm having a
honey yogurt and it's gonna be delicious
I had one yesterday I'm obsessed with
these things I really struggle with
breakfast so when I find something I
like this kidneys I'd eat anything more
those crumbles I like those breakfast
table they're they're quite big I'm just
gonna sit down and do some work now I'm
probably gonna work until after lunch
and then I'm gonna go to meet Hannah I'm
you've got a fun afternoon and evening
planned I'm just gonna have my cup of
tea and my yogurt I have cleared my
email INBOX on a Monday morning this is
amazing it's raining again okay this is
what I'm gonna wear my whistles trousers
I'm probably gonna wear my Topshop shoes
even though my feet will get very cold
wet and blistery own issues I have I
don't have any like black boots this top
from Zara which normally go to the
shorts I'm wearing a little vest up
underneath because it's cold I don't
want my belly to show and I'm wearing my
stress Berry bag that I showed in
yesterday's vlog I think it looks really
nice and can wear it kind of like that
or you can wear it across like that and
it'd be nice to have a small bag during
the day actually make a nice change so
I'm gonna go have the call that I need
to be on and then I'm gonna head out to
meet Hannah in Sloane Square I think
we're gonna go to saatchi gallery
because I haven't been there for ages
it's my favorite gallery in London and
it's a nice thing to do when it's
raining the last set of doors will not
open
versus the last carriage please move
towards the front doors to leave the
Train
I'm in Stonestreet now is pretty damn
windy as soon as the Sun came out I
started sneezing I forgot my hey Peter
feel some idiots boots but I got
something for lunch a wrap for lunch as
I'm eating I'm gonna go meet Hannah and
we're gonna go while it's the sunny go
and have some pimps because there's this
like pop-up Alice in Wonderland garden
where you can have pins so that
obviously sounds amazing
saatchi gallery was really good though
some good stuff front at the moment is a
nice sentiment to the shop which I have
normally been to the shop fall in the
maze it was a good shop
we're now just gonna have a little
wander around and I forgot that it's the
Chelsea Flower Show at the moment so all
the shops have like pretty chill tea in
bloom I think it's called like things
outside did this is outside Kate Spade
oh my gosh that is amazing that looks so
cool and eyes like your pet flamingo yes
I smile and eat
this one Cinderella
we've just been wandering circus and
looking in shops and looking in Liberty
and we've just really the six o'clock
we've got an hour to the theater I mean
we'd eat dinner so we're gonna find
somewhere to eat not really sure where
actually but one night maybe somewhere
in them courtyard
you know we're wandering through kind of
so vividly area
remember Sarver again they you have far
too often we're just getting a cool site
for theater
on smack saw and mcnamar which I'm
loving at the moment and we're going to
go to this it I haven't said actually
what we're doing we're going to see
sunny afternoon which is the kinks
musical and my parents have seen it and
they said it was incredible
I don't really know that much about
kinks but I know who their songs and so
I'm excited I think it's like celeb
night and then apparently chaos with me
that's pretty exciting I'm hoping for
some minstrels that's actually one most
excited about we thought it was a five
minute walk but it's actually literally
just here
we're in the interval and we're loving
it but I'll tell you about it at the end
I've just been reading through the
comments on the videos I had a within
the comments amazing handed like oh my
gosh that was so good you guys it even
if you don't know who the Kings are if
you like music guys like the best what
comes I've ever been to a male that was
relaxed
we were like dancing at the end broke I
don't hope they bring people up on stage
you're saying I'm good mate you'll know
all the songs if you feel anything it
was amazing like dude girl you really
got me going you got it straight
oh so I love what it's like in a small
face with a spade Dave so basically it
was amazing it wasn't a fear I want to
see it again I'm really upset that I was
a teenager in the 60s and also the
costumes are made
I wearing it is just hey okay I'm gonna
go home now just gonna get angry used to
make up a five and I told him to picked
up the station I'm home and still
buzzing from such a good night a
highlight of the day was definitely that
moment when me and Hannah were jumping
up and down dancing with her hands in
the air and I just thought I haven't had
this much fun in so so long so that was
great and Rich's off its Germany again
tomorrow for the night and he's waking
up at 4:00 in the morning so so she did
like this amazing wedding gesture she
looks ridiculous and then they'd like
