week so far for today's video I'm gonna
be doing a dark lip makeup tutorial I've
been wearing this look quite a lot
recently in my videos and in my vlogs
and a lot of you have requested a
tutorial so I'm gonna do that for you
today I used to be very scared about
wearing a dark bold lip like this but I
think when you find the right color that
suits you and you make the rest of the
makeup look work with the dark lip then
it can be worn really easily and it's
really nice for this time of year in the
winter and leading up to Christmas I
think it's a really pretty look and I'm
gonna show you now how I like to do it
so the first thing I do is start with a
lip balm this one is the nukes Rev de
miel I like to put this on first because
I do my lips last and by that point I
want my lips to be moisturized and have
no dry flaky patches especially when
you're wearing a dark lip color it can
cling to the dry patches and you don't
want that to happen because it looks a
bit strange this one is great because
it's matte so your lipstick won't slip
around on top it's just really
moisturizing and one of my favorites I'm
gonna be using quite a few high-end
products in this video but I have thrown
in some cheaper alternatives where I can
and I'll show you those along the way
this product is really expensive it's
crazy I wouldn't recommend it for that
reason but it is amazing and it works so
well it's the Tom Ford illuminating
primer not only has it got really funky
packaging that like twists up like that
which is really cool but it's a really
nice glowy primer I like to put it all
over but mainly on my cheekbones and
down my nose and it really adds that
amazing glow it looks great in photos
perfect for the party season but Mac
also do a strobe cream and they do the
mini travel sizes which are actually
quite affordable it's where a primer if
I am wearing this look to a party
because then I know it will last all
evening for my foundation I'm gonna be
using the Burberry foundation that I've
pretty much used that every video
recently I know you're probably bored of
seeing it but I wanted to actually use
the products that I really use in this
video and this foundation has just been
amazing I've been using it for like two
months now I love it it's the perfect
amount of coverage it just makes my skin
look good something good about it I use
the Bobbi Brown foundation brush just to
buff it all into the skin it really
evens out my complexion it has the right
amount of coverage it's not too heavy
but it's enough that it kind of works
with the bold lip for my concealer I'm
using the No
creamy radiant concealer and I'm still
using the shade custard vanilla is still
a little bit too light for me and I like
to put this under my eyes around my nose
and on my chin and then I just blend it
out with the real techniques setting
brush which is still my favorite brush
for concealer for any blemishes and
spots and I have been getting a little
bit Raschi around my jawline I like to
use the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer this is really long-lasting
and waterproof but I also like it
because it's really creamy and hydrating
although the laura mercier secret
camouflage is great for spots it's quite
hard to work with and quite like stiff
whereas this one's really hydrating and
good if you have dry skin to set my
foundation and concealer in place I like
to use the Mac mineralize skinfinish
natural this is just a great powder I
use it with my big rmk powder brush and
it's a source of powder that you can
really go to town with and you won't
ever look like you're wearing too much
powder it doesn't show at all it just
kind of takes away any shine and sets
the makeup in place I apply it mainly
under my eyes on my forehead down my
nose and a bit around my chin although I
am gonna be contouring I also like to
use bronzer this is because most contour
shades are quite cool toned and I like
to really warm up my face especially
wearing it when I'm wearing a bold lip
because otherwise it's just too
contrasting and my face looks too pale
so for this I'm using the Revlon bronzer
bronzer which is a really great
affordable bronzer it's a bit like NARS
Laguna Ashley it's very similar and I
haven't actually got a good bonza brush
at the moment so I'm using my NARS blush
of brush and it's a little bit too dense
for bronzer so I like to take off on the
back of my hand first and then just
build it up cause it's better to have
less than more before I start contouring
and highlighting I'm gonna fill in my
brows and excuse them at the moment
they're in such a bad state they're all
over the place but I'm trying to just
grow them out because every time I get
them threaded they kind of go a bit too
over-the-top and they end up looking
thinner and thinner every time and I
really want to keep my brows quite thick
so I'm just growing them out and seeing
like their natural shape and then I'm
gonna start from there so if he's them
they are a mess but I'm gonna be using
the Anastasia brow Wiz just to fill in
the gaps there's a few gaps at the front
and at the ends I like to just brush
them through first brushing them up fill
it in and then I use the a nostalgic
clear brow gel just to set them in place
the soap employee archery is a great
deep for that massage your brows it
really is just as good they just don't
have as many shades I think there's any
shades but if you do suit the shades
then I definitely recommend picking this
up for contour and highlight I'm
obviously using my Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow I still love
this palette it's so sleek I think it's
perfect for this time of year it just
looks so Christmasy inside you have two
shades the contour and highlight I
really like to use the contour just in
my cheekbones and up onto my temples it
really defines the face there's a really
nice cool tone but not too cool and then
I like to use the creamy highlight just
on the tops of my cheekbones and this is
a really gorgeous highlight so it's very
similar to the balm mary-lou manizer so
that's been much more affordable version
if you wanted to get highlight like this
but this Kiko palettes is also really
good for sculpting and highlighting it
also has a contour shade which is split
into like a warmer tone and a cooler
tone and then it has a highlight as well
and that's much more affordable and
pretty much just as good a blush I wants
to do something really simple because
there's a lot going on with the bold
lips and the eyes but I can't use
nothing I always like to use some kind
of blush so I'm going to use this one
from hourglass it's the ambient lighting
blush in diffused heat and this is just
so gorgeous it's really subtle but has a
slight shimmer in it it's really pretty
from the drugstore I also really like
Revlon racy rose and this is a good one
I would take it off on the back of your
hand first because it's quite pigmented
but it's a really nice soft pink okay
now onto the eyes and for this I'm using
one of my favorite products at the
moment this is definitely gonna be in my
monthly favorites video it's from Tom
Ford it's one of their new cream
eyeshadows and it's in the shade spice
it really reminds me of Estee Lauder
chained which was my favorite for years
I still love it it's like a moosie
texture that has a really really long
lasting formula the way I like to apply
this is I like to take a blending brush
and I dip it in the pot a tiny bit start
with a small amount at first and I blend
it straight onto the lid I finally if
you use your fingers it gets too messy
it's much easier to use a brush so I
apply that onto the lid and then I take
a clean brush and I blend out the edges
and you just have to keep blending and
blending and blending
it's a gorgeous bronzy shade that kind
of looks a little bit plummy a little
bit oranjee it's so so pretty and I like
to take that under the eye as well it's
kind of like a one Shadow does all so
easy to use and gives such a gorgeous
effect on the lid a good drugstore
eternity for this if you can't afford
the Tom Ford one is the new Max Factor
excess shimmer in bronze it slightly
more like brownie I don't think the
colors quite as like
testing but it's a very similar formula
and a great product now I think as
eyeshadow it is so nice on its own that
you don't need an eyeliner and I
actually really like the look of like
eyeshadow and just mascara without
eyeliner on top especially when you're
wearing a bold lip I feel like it
balances it out nicely you don't really
want to do heavy eyes heavy lips at the
same time but something I do want to add
to this to make it a little bit more
kind of party season and a little bit
more special is a nice champagne
eyeliner right in the inner corner this
one is from Chanel's new collection but
you can pretty much get any champagne
eyeliner you like I'm sure makeup
forever do one or urban decay or any
kind of brand that has a lot of
different eyeliner colors this one's
from Chanel it's so gorgeous it's called
or Blanc or Blanc Blanc I can't
pronounce that I used to be good at
French not anymore and like so just use
that right in the inner corner so mainly
underneath the eye but a little bit into
the tear duct area and I think it really
brightens and opens up the eye it looks
very Christmasy and pretty because
there's no eyeliner I do like to wear
quite a lot of mascara with this look
and for the top lashes I'm going to be
using this new one from Max Factor which
is the masterpiece transform I really
like this the one is like a comb so you
can really comb the lashes from the
roots of the tips and it really kind of
spreads them out and I think it gives a
really pretty look to the lashes so I
use this all over and then for the
bottom lashes I like to use my Clinique
bottom lash mascara which I always use
with light looks like this when I want a
bit more with my eyes it really defines
the lower lashes opens up your eyes and
I can't use normal mascara on my bottom
lashes I find it gets everywhere so I
really like the cute little wand on this
it's perfect for your lower lashes now
if you want to wear a dark lip during
the day the lipstick I would recommend
is Charlotte Tilbury love Liberty this
is from her matte revolution range which
is such a good range of lipsticks I
think they're probably my favorite matte
lipsticks that I've tried they're so
long-lasting but they don't feel drying
at all if I'm really moisturizing and
they're kind of like illuminating even
though they're matte they're really
really good lipsticks beautiful
packaging of course love Liberty is kind
of like a pinky berry but it's great for
the daytime if you want to wear a dark
lip I've worn this in a couple of my
vlogs before and you guys have said that
you really like the look so this is the
one I would wear during the day but if I
was going out in the evening or this
could
in the day but it's definitely more of a
bold dark lip then the lipsticks I've
been using are from Tom Ford which are
obviously quite expensive but they're so
good they're so luxury it's something to
add to the Christmas wishlist I've been
mixing Black Dahlia and crimson or Black
Dahlia is a great one to have to mix
with other lipsticks that you have it's
a really really dark berry almost like a
dark purple so I put this on first I
like to use a lip brush so I can really
make it tidy I can layer on some
lipstick first and then apply it again
from the bullet the Real Techniques lip
brush is really great for that and
because I don't have much of a Cupid's
bow I can really draw it in take my time
and then it lasts longer as well so I
like to apply Black Dahlia first and
then on top crimson or crimson Wayas
like a dark red and you really can use
any dark red that you have this one
isn't from their matte range I don't
think I think it's just their lip color
but I like to just do it to make it a
little bit more kind of dark red and
less like dark purple Black Dahlia is
the one to invest in though because then
you can mix it with any lipsticks that
you have and it really is quite a unique
shade and it's from their new matte
range so I hope you guys enjoyed
watching this video and seeing how I get
the dark bold lip look you've been
asking about it a lot so I hope this
helped and don't forget to come back on
Sunday because I'm gonna be doing my
Christmas gift guide wishlist video
which is also very highly requested and
I'm excited to film that one so thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys on Sunday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
