morning and I thought I would just flog
today May which are kind of having like
a date day and evening we have no plans
to see anyone but each other which is
quite unusual for us specially on a
weekend who knows if it will stay like
that but we basically have tea at sketch
plant at like 4:00 o'clock so we thought
we'd do some food shopping this morning
and then head into town for a bit of
mooching before tea and then we put to
go to the cinema tonight because we have
no plans a lot of our friends are busy
and we just thought we don't really get
to go to cinema that often so we've
booked that the tumble dryer is on and
my stomach's rumbling just in case you
can hear any crazy noises in the
background I'm actually vlogging on a
new camera today because Canon very
kindly lent me the new g7 X mark 2 I
think it is look I'm pretty sure it's
the g7 X mark 2 so let me know what you
guys think of the quality I'm just kind
of trying it out to try and decide if I
want to buy it myself and see the
difference of quality and I'll talk you
guys through the difference because I
know you are interested in taking stuff
this isn't sponsored at all they just
know that I love cameras so they said I
can borrow it and have a go so this is
the original g7 X it's definitely a
little bit heavier than the new updates
pretty much looks the same the screen on
the back flips up so the screen flips up
like this so you can see yourself and
this is pretty much one of the first
like vlogging cameras or like selfie
cameras I think it was actually intended
for there are some other brands that
have ones that squeeze flip up as well
the Olympus PEN the screen flips down
which doesn't make any sense to me
because if you want to rest the camera
on the table and film stuff you can't
without seeing what you're filming so
that's why I've never invested in the
Olympus PEN as much as I would like to
you for photos I like cameras I can film
on as well so this is the original one
and I'm going to swap the memory card
over to show you this new one here so
now I'm filming on the old g7 X oh it
definitely takes a lot longer to focus
but I've heard this is a problem see now
is InFocus I've heard that's a problem
that just comes with the cameras age but
I haven't had it that long so shouldn't
really happen
I'm hoping the focus is better on the
new one I can't quite tell you about
that the first thing I notice is that
there's a rubbery grip on the front here
which is great because it means you're
less likely to drop the camera you can
really kind of grip onto that front
I can't show you because it's the wrong
hand but you know you put your hand like
that the second thing I noticed straight
away was the screen so it flips up like
the old camera does but then it also
comes out as well like this so the
reason why that is good is if you are
filming a clip say below you you can see
what you're filming because beforehand
sorry this is so like cack-handed before
hand when the screen was like this and
you were doing that you can't really see
what you're filming so that's handy to
have I definitely like that but it
definitely it makes it harder to flip
the screen up and down like before when
I flipped it down it kind of came out
and it's a it's a bit more messy but
it's worth having and I think the camera
is a little bit lighter not a lot it's
still quite a heavy camera to throw in
your handbag not gonna lie not the
lightest of cameras there's some new
settings that I kind of saw I haven't
really had a proper play around yet when
I went to recording mode there's
something that says time lapse movie
which is quite cool I definitely think
they're starting to cater to vlogs which
is quite funny so I'll give that a go
and see how it is I actually normally do
my time lapse on my phone but if I can
do it on here then that would be great
so yeah I haven't really had to play
around yet but I'm hoping what I would
like from the new one is that the focus
is better I really like the screen
update there is a wider Wi-Fi on this
camera as well I need to figure out how
to work and he pressed this button on
the side and you link up your phone so I
might see how good it is at taking
photos and see if I can users on
Instagram and that's about that I'm
gonna swap cameras back I've just left
my hair straight today and I'm not sure
if that's a good idea and all it looks a
bit well I have had every colored um
kind of doesn't it that was different if
anything a little bit darker I think
that Jason my colorist thought it was
getting a bit too light but it will
lighten in the Sun I'm going away twice
so it will light him in the Sun I just
love how subtle it is I didn't want like
a drastic you know it's really subtle I
also had it cut a little bit we kept it
I feel like I'm I need to cut that but
he kept it a little bit longer at the
front that I want to keep the length but
just tied it up the back a bit I need to
get some food I'm so hungry
thinking about foam inna Yee in a day
video but changing up a bit
so I think I'm gonna do that tomorrow
this is today's outfit I'm wearing my
Kate Spade little white jacket Kate
Spade white t-shirt saline bag I think I
could there's a bag in my snapchat and I
get confused Topshop
Jamie jeans and my Nike trainers
probably shouldn't wear trainers to
sketch but we're gonna be doing lots of
walking I want to be comfortable so I'm
sure they won't mind we're gonna head
into town now and do some little
mooching around I need to get a handle
for my new cupboard in my office I'm
gonna try get the same one that we have
in our lounge and I want to go to we
built the city which is a place um
Carnaby Street there's some really cool
prints because I want to find a print
for this wall I don't know if I want one
print yeah or like two or three or a
whole collection I'm gonna go see what
they have and see if I get inspired yeah
I need a handle for this cupboard I also
put this print here in the hallway for
now see how we feel about it but it's
quite like that I think it looks nice
please stand clear of the closing doors
you're just going to town and neither of
us are that hungry yet although we want
to have an early lunch so that we do
then have tea later but we're going to
pop down to politics see if we can find
a handle for the cupboard first I love
this show let's go and spend his money
they don't have the handle that we
already have which is so annoying and I
just assumed they would know the others
first account to like me in a platform
they I'm gonna buy this book it looks
really good for learning how to do
modern calligraphy and I'd quite like to
learn so I can do our wedding employ any
problem is you have to actually buy like
ink and they click the pen I'm gonna get
it for now and then decide that's really
cool you can like learn how to do all
the letters I think that's just a normal
pen whoo whoo cutter scissors okay if
you get out there dangerous I'm gonna
get these earrings good thing we're
gonna walk through kingly court and go
to Carnaby Street - we are the 16
certainly have some good prints at the
moment
hey they're open actually I think they
moved locations temporarily I love how
they decorate the outside their store
it's so cool let's go and see what they
got
yeah I kind of love this John Lennon
Road it's a hundred and fifty pounds not
in the frame if I may be as sore as
I love this one tree we're all London
lovers
you just heard stories really yummy I
didn't have much of the 140 I just had
some sashimi or vendor pardon and I'm
gonna put them to Mooji because I want
to find a way to steal my earrings
better and I feel like they'll probably
have something meaning at these three
jaws to use the jeweler hadn't really
thought about it before and they've got
these dividers so I can lay earrings
rings and necklaces in each drawer and
that's the plan
you're gonna go get coffee where are we
going apparently rich said it's the best
coffee and then the Department of coffee
and Social Affairs it might be good
coffee but it weights about 15 minutes
for Annie with empty in there so that
was a little bit ridiculous we're gonna
mrs. John Lewis because which is looking
for a nice light kind of linen jacket
where for a couple of summer weddings we
have and I know that Jim Chapman does
like an edit for John Lewis and rich
really likes Jim Stockwell so we're
going to go have a look and see if
there's any justice with him in there
revoltingly busy I don't really know why
we're doing this but we've got time
before teeth hurt keys Jim's edit we
found a nice jacket and John Lewis
because 175 pounds and he's only gonna
wear it twice really so you're just
coming to next and we found one every
nice fun actually and it's 75 pounds
linen I actually think you could wear
that in London ago thanks guys we just
found the body studio in Selfridges
which is like full of workout gear
they've got a Farley Under Armour oh my
god this is so exciting
we've got an hour till Artie and they
can't make it earlier so we've just come
to Grosvenor Square and we're gonna sit
on a bench relax for a bit the weather's
it's really like warm and muggy but not
really sunny but I don't mind that we're
getting to be a hot walking around town
it's very busy so let me just have a
little sit down this little area prime
years when me and Hannah once did a
picnic Meetup
leave a comment down below if you came
that me thought it was good like two or
three years ago and we didn't have
anyone to come and we turned up and
Anitha it was like a religious meeting
we gave almost living on the floor but
they were all here for us it was so fun
to walk food you know that was really
I love that
I'm wearing Mac syrup lipstick today but
then it's much Pinker than it usually
does I got a new one they don't if
they've changed the formula seems to be
quite like lilac purpley on me now
definitely it's pink but it's all like
it definitely my favorite MAC lipstick
are we are now walking sketch so it's
really nice to sit in the park actually
in did but retain although I'm feel abit
overwhelmed if I'm gonna be able to
learn how to do calligraphy but probably
spend a fortune buying the kit and then
fail but I'll try
we're gonna walk up the sketch I'm
really excited for a scone and cup of
tea here's sketch currents guess we're
in the pink room which like the
marshmallow room because you should feel
like a sitting in about how they they're
like crazy pictures all over the walls
isn't the toilet and the toilet the mat
here they're like white pods
go panting it's okay
champagne offering tea so is a gift
turns out that the Charlotte Tilbury
mystery isn't that good when you suffer
from hay fever I just dropped my eye and
now I look hyper black eye
tea was really yummy the waitress was so
so nice in there at the end we were
saying how full we are oh and she was
like at least she doesn't have to make
dinner like pointed to me and then
looked at rich was like oh does she has
to meet dinner so you love a bit of
everyday sexism I thought he'd be the
one make it better we are back home and
we're gonna quickly pop straight to the
supermarket so I can get all the things
I need for tomorrow because we are going
on a little picnic and I want to make a
salad and I haven't got any other stuff
I need doing pretty well with our shop
so far we got everything our list and we
bought bags cuz we're so good for the
environment
we just got back to flat there's
actually a mess so I need to tidy up but
I try to test out the time-lapse thing
in the supermarket and it just looked
like it was taking photos really slowly
so I ended up just filming it and then
fast-forwarding it in the Edit but I
just watched her back and I think that
actually it might have worked so the
time-lapse you just saw with all the
food going in the supermarket that was
done by filming at normal speed and
speeding up afterwards and now the
time-lapse I'm gonna do now will be the
camera time lapse so let's see how they
did
I'm just watching it back I think you
are able to speed up much faster by
doing it on the camera because I find
that when you speed it up really fast
post edits it kind of glitch is so I
can't do it too fast they normally do it
like x times 4 times 8 this one goes
super fast so this using it on the
camera would be great for like when
you're filming the streets and there's
cars and stuff and things that you want
to go really fast so yeah I'm kind of
telling myself this and not sure why I'm
telling you guys this but that was handy
come here to try this is I bought from
Muji three jaws and then three of these
and it's not ideal but there some reason
they have like nothing in stock they
said they're getting everything in in
the end of the month I thought this is
actually quite good because I could lay
necklaces down individually so they
don't get tangled I could put earrings
here rings it's better than what I've
got now for sure I just put in one of
the earrings I got from Anthropologie
now it's quite cool actually I still
can't get this earring out though which
the one I got it pierced where they just
manage to get the one out there but this
so they'd aren't so tight and they're
like balls you have to twist that's
really annoying I can't get that one out
but when I eventually do I'll change it
the curl sweet these earrings are
they're from a brown cord by Ilona and
you kind of put the ball in and you
don't see this drop bit so all we see is
that bit come out of bottom of your
earlobe
those are very pretty okay this is what
I've done so far so in this top drawer
I've got some rings at the back and then
rings at the next row and then over to
my shadow so knowing these are all
earrings and then I've got some
necklaces and some more necklaces this
is Anna saucony Jolie's new range it's
really nice to shoot me a Sagittarius
necklace which is very kind of her so
that is good I just need to like tidy up
for the rest of this these are really
good these are my Muji if you want four
rings I just found mine stacking up so
so those are good for rings now I can
hang up my bracelet on there I need to
tidy up all of this right we're gonna
walk to the cinema rich what we seen me
before we you I think it's called and it
looks really good so I'm excited for
that I'm not gonna vlog but I'll see you
guys when I'm back so see you then we're
back was that like magic probably
knocked my hair's changed the film was
so good
was so sad for like lovely really funny
more funny than it was sad I think
Emilia Clarke is the most beautiful
human in the world of decided I think
she's actually the most beautiful but
she is oh she's so nice I thought she
just played herself I can violin have
been like that in real life um really
nice it was like pretty much an all UK
cast which makes me feel proud and I
just thought it was really good I
definitely recommend seeing that film Oh
bit tired from that walk though anyway I
think I'm gonna end the vlog now I'm
gonna make rich make me a cup of tea and
go to bed
and then tomorrow it's really sunny I'm
having a picnic in Regent's Park and my
morning I'm uploading a 20 minute Q&amp;amp;A
video so if you haven't seen that yet
