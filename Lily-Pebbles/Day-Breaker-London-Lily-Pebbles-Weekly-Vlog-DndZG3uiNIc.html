Wednesday no idea what the day is I'm
not even gonna try and attempt to guess
but I ever flogged in a very long time I
haven't blogged since vlogmas
i don't think and to be honest I didn't
even realize that I hadn't flogged
there's been so many comments from you
guys saying where are your vlogs I
missed the please tell me you haven't
quit and I'm really sorry it's so nice
to hear that you guys love my vlog so
much but I hadn't even noticed that I
hadn't blogs I knew I wanted to take a
bit of a break after vlogmas but then I
just had so many other ideas for videos
that I was like filling my video
schedule full and there wasn't really a
gap for a vlog but don't worry I haven't
quit I am back I did blog a little bit
when I was in France I've just realised
that I didn't call it a vlog so maybe
people didn't realize it was a vlog but
if you haven't seen my ski vlog I will
link it below
so it's midway through the week and I
have quite a special evening tonight I
have a day of meetings and then tonight
I'm staying at Shoreditch house I'm
actually going for a clinic event but
I'm taking my best friend Hannah with as
my plus-one because tomorrow is her
birthday so I thought I would treat her
and I think it's gonna be really fun to
like stay in a hotel together during the
week and then she's gonna go to work
tomorrow I think it's gonna be really
funny so we're staying in Shoreditch
house tonight having dinner and then
tomorrow morning we're doing a thing
called a break which is this new like
exercise craze which is basically like a
sofa a sofa a sober rave so it's like a
club we don't drink you have like
smoothies and you danced exercise it's
meant to like start your day off well I
don't know you guys know I'm not a
morning person so let's see how I do at
7:00 in the morning but I'm just packing
yep this is for one night I don't know
what's wrong with me but it's basically
just like gym clothes for tomorrow
pajamas a top for tonight and a top for
tomorrow and then charges work stuff
handbag underwear jewellery and then
I've got makeup and skincare and stuff
what is hidden here oh I need to combine
those bags and then I'm taking my laptop
and I bought this book yesterday so I
want to read it on the tube
Rich's hair he's like you from home
today he hasn't been in the vlog for a
little while I'm gonna walk to the
station with my suitcase and head into
town hopefully I'm gonna get there a
little bit early for my meeting because
I need to go to Muji
to get some pens and some cups and I
need to go to boots to get to the
Bourjois healthy mix foundation because
I am no longer the same shape and the
one I have please
I am just heading to the gleam office
which along Charlotte Street I bloody
love Charlotte Street there's so many
good place to sleep right there at my
face I have a meeting with the charity
look good feel better because Adam and I
are digital ambassadors for them so have
our meetings talk about cooling projects
and events that we're hopefully going to
do with them
over the next year so just gonna head in
now
okay okay so me and Anna finished our
meeting which is here and we're gonna go
quickly is pop into the detox kitchen
but I might not feel much in there
because I might be filming for something
else that is coming up quite a while
away actually it's bigger to excited it
just popped into Muji actually Anna
found these little ring holders so I put
one as well look how clever these are
you're gonna blue in a white one I think
we're now going into boots and H&amp;amp;M home
we've got a few things I need to get go
to the hotel later I picked up the
foundation I needed from boots and I got
some pens from Muji oh so good for me to
store my sunglasses from Muji and we're
now gonna pop into West Elm who's Anna
wants to go in and I know I'm gonna end
up buying something so yeah and it's
making me go into West Elm
how dare she Anna's picked up her first
purchase I would give it away
we're giving away I'm Sarah have
practice I haven't done this in a while
what happened we went back to gleam and
then actually we just got a cab here so
I'm now at Shoreditch house I'll show
you my room in a minute but slight
problem I completely forgot that
shortage house so her house all of those
kind of hotels and places they're like
private member's clubs and we're just
here for an event but you're not allowed
to film or take photos because I think
it's just to keep the kind of privacy
and the specialness of it and there's
probably celebs and stuff that come here
so I'm not gonna have to film tonight
but I'll keep logging for now and I'll
vlog tomorrow morning but let me show
you my room I think I'm allowed to come
in and there's like all these things
that hang your coats on it's amazing and
it's all like beach themes with like
wooden panels so the bed here
clink you've left a really nice little
jumper for us and the eye cream well
this is the eye cream actually just saw
that I haven't tried it yet big balcony
out there Oh
minibar and then Oh cute little like
school desk retro school desk and then
this is the bathroom which
which houses our house always use
cowshed to stuff and they are amazing I
think Hannah's gonna literally be over
the moon when she gets here
they had Smarties in the mini bar so I
couldn't resist having had Smarties in
ages I guess we're applying to all my
emails feeding for a couple of hours and
I have seem to have eaten some Smarties
some sour harrybo and popcorn I'm just a
little bit hungry and we've got dinner
in an hour I think we do this a lot to
be fair sorry very sour yeah maybe want
them and then a KitKat 94 fingers have a
break and then pistachio well was on my
popcorn is like my pistachio equivalent
pop wasn't about fuse it much better
this bastard A's ah I win I win
I thought she got a pain in my stomach
from laughing cuz being a nerd just
randomly went off and I'm down memory
lane and all the funny it's not even all
just a few funny experiences we've been
like travelling together for years now
and I just love that two of the funniest
stories we've experienced together both
drugs-related
both tried sleeping pills for the first
time together and a flight to LA were
like God you take the first I know you
think it's a PT here and then Betsy we
know we're like in London we took Amy
like tea iced tea right sorry for my I
so sleepy and then yeah 11 hours later
wake up waking up being like oh yeah I
have pasta the other one was when we
took anti travel sickness pills didn't
realize they were drowsy and had we're
in stock we've been Copenhagen on a
Paris trip I was I think home with Ren
and we're really excited to be there but
we didn't realize that these pills a
drowsy and we were literally fall asleep
at the table both of us like this until
we got back and realized there were
really strong drowsy travel sickness
pills I feel like these stories are
probably not as funny
they're not Johnny we're just waiting
for Hannah and Mark to arrive we have
dinner in 20 minutes so I would say hi
to Hannah if she gets here but then I'm
going to put the camera away until later
okay so I'm not allowed to vlog upstairs
so I'm gonna sign up now hands on her
way up
Andrew market here it's actually a
double birthday well me because it was
your birthday at Hannah's birthday
tomorrow oh really
so I'm three drinks full of us back from
the bar and my stealer lipstick happy
wearing on I is actually peeling off and
it's really been annoying me I like this
lipstick but layering it has not been
fun tonight we had a really nice night
having drinks and dinner and catching up
with everyone there's a few celebs here
which there are lots of little probably
Alexa Chung is upstairs she's probably
the only person I actually really care
about I love her I mean I'm sad that I
can't marry her I can she does she might
not want to marry me there marry her
because I'm arranging your hands
Hannah's birthday in half an hour
but at the moment we're slightly
concerned as to why everyone's written
28 people have written happy birthday on
her Facebook already we think that she
might have the wrong birthday on
Facebook I'm sorry I can't celebrate
with you tonight which is something
which we think to have organized the
party but she pretends oh god I think
it's time for bed so we need to get a
bed because we need to be downstairs in
the lobby at 10 past 7:00 oh my god I
can't even so yeah I'm gonna go take my
makeup see you guys all right it's 6:30
in the morning I can't quite believe
them let me make one it's 6:30 in the
morning and I'm going clubbing
I'm very tired right now and I really
want to get some breakfast Azores
birthday okay we're almost ready to go
downstairs and head to the Daybreaker
event it's actually Hannah's birthday
today she's 29 very exciting and Hannah
a birthday party
Hanna and Anna are both morning people
so this is painful today around watching
jumpers are you feeling like you're
ready to arrange have no idea how I feel
you just come outside and I might go
that pattern that we would like celebs
niggas we just come out it's really
bright out here and it feels bizarre it
was dark I went in but that was mental
it's literally like being in a club but
there's like juice and porridge and
everyone's like it's all about like
happiness and well-being which I'm not
me but it was so fun dogs and I feel
I've never felt this awake at half eight
in the morning normally I'm just like
getting up an hour did you guys like it
good way to start your birthday Anna
wants to go every day I mean I think
yeah exactly I think the music was a
little bit like techno if they put in a
bit more like lyrically music it would
be amazing
so funny I mean so Hannah's just left
you both feel a bit like we're dreaming
but we're gonna go upstairs get some
breakfast
we did have breakfast I wasn't allowed
to film or take photos but I am poached
egg and avocado on toast with a side of
spinach and I had pancakes Vegas here
Anna's gone home now and I'm gonna go
upstairs to the restaurant to do some
work I put my laptop with me and note
but and then I'm gonna go meet rich
because we're actually going to design
our wedding rings today which is mega
scary I don't really know what I want
I've never really thought about it
before but we're gonna go to the same
place that we got our engagement my
engagement ring from where you can kind
of design your own thing so I think
we're gonna go do that today and then
I'm gonna go home
it's actually really nice sunny day
today and with rich now and we're going
to go to the jewelers our wedding rings
and what we want I don't really know
rich thinks he might want a Russian
wedding ring but we haven't really
thought much about it so we're gonna go
and have a chat with them I haven't
really updated you guys but I'm back at
the flat now the appointment went very
well I think we know what sort of
wedding rings we want that's a bit scary
it's a little bit real but yeah that was
fun and yeah I picked up these really
pretty daffodils actually from the
market stall man on the way back well
they haven't all opened yet but I
thought they looked nice and a little
jar so happy with those I'm also
currently keeping a food diary because I
work for myself and I work from home I
always struggle when I go food shopping
to know what to buy for lunch cuz I just
have no inspiration I never know what
I'm gonna fancy so I thought if I write
everything down that I eat it'll be
easier for me to see like oh I ate
really badly that day I could have had
this instead and then I can write up a
shopping list so that's kind of the main
reason I'm doing it so I've got it
one week honest food diary very
important and I'm not like trying to eat
healthy just for my food diary so I've
like been writing stuff down so I just
write down what I had for lunch quinoa
and chicken salad and I'm gonna pop over
to our parents now come by mom's not
very well so I'm gonna go help them out
and then tonight we're actually going to
a Mama's gun gate in Kings Cross at
Scala so looking forward to that I
haven't seen them play live but I want
now I think that's it
I'm really sorry if this vlog is boring
I haven't vlogged in ages you guys want
it I feel like they're so boring but I
know you like it no matter what I'm
vlogging about so I spent the afternoon
working and then I accidentally firstly
waking up at 6:00 a.m. is not my kind of
thing I'm so tired and it's only quarter
to eight and I'm now going out to a gig
I think people that wake up very early
in the morning possibly don't go out as
much in the evening I don't know I don't
I don't know how you wake up early and
go out in the evening that combination
doesn't make any sense to me
but anyway I'm dressed I'm wearing my
lily and lionel shirt I'm taking my
while back with me and I'm going to
Kings Cross for a gig I think I'm gonna
start vlogging here though because I'm
not feeling that anymore I'm feeling
very tired I'm gonna go and just enjoy
the gig with friends and family I hope
this hasn't been too boring I think it
was quite fun this morning I don't know
it felt very weird vlogging and trying
to get back into the swing of things but
please give this video a thumbs up if
you
didn't like it and I will try and do
more vlogs soon thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
