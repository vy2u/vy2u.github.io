video I'm going to be showing you how I
take my look from day to night it's now
currently five o'clock in the afternoon
and I'm heading out tonight with Anna I
don't have very long to get ready so I'm
just going to kind of add to what I've
already got on and I'm going to talk you
through the steps i do when i take a
look from day to night so first things
first I need to change my top okay now
that's done I'm going to talk you
through the steps number one base I
really like to make sure I have a
perfected base before eager and the
evening and towards the end of the
afternoon things are starting to fade so
I'm going to add some concealer and
powder to make things look flawless
again to concealer I like to use the
NARS radiant creamy concealer and I have
two shades vanilla and custard Vanilla's
perfect for under my eyes because it's
slightly lighter and then Custer's good
for my face sometimes it's a little bit
dark so I mix the two together it's a
really nice concealer because it's
really moisturizing so it doesn't ever
go cakey and then I just blend that out
under the eye it's really nice and
brightening as well and then take the
custard shade and just apply it to my
chin and around my nose anywhere where a
bit of redness is showing this show is
still a little bit dark for me but it'd
be perfect in the summer now I've
concealed everything I wanted to conceal
I'm going to take a powder and I'm going
to use the mac mineralize skinfinish in
light plus n i'm just going to use a
nice soft powder brush and just apply
that to set the concealer and this also
starts my skin looking too dull I just
feel like it lifts things sets in place
and makes my skin look much better so
I'm focusing on the middle part of my
face mainly and under my eyes step 2
blusher aside for concealer the first
thing that tends to fade off my skin
towards the end of the day is blusher so
I'm definitely going to be adding a
little bit more blusher to put some
color back into my cheeks for this i'm
using Revlon race eros which is a lovely
everyday pink just applying that to the
apples of my cheeks it's very like
natural pink I really like this blush
step 3 eyes I like to smoke up my eyes a
little bit more and make them slightly
darker in the evening eyeshadows my
favorite thing have all the makeup to
apply so
I'm going to be using the by Terry ombre
black star in brown perfection you can
pick this up at Space NK there are
seriously amazing cream eyeshadows they
come in a stick so they're really easy
to apply and this one I really like
because you can apply all over the lid
like a shadow or you can use it as a
liner and kind of smoke up towards the
lash line as well so I'm just going to
take this and apply it all over the lid
it's really soft and creamy so it's
really easy to blend out with a fluffy
brush so as you can see it really makes
the whole I look much smokier and I've
really loved this shade of brown I'm
also going to take it under the lash
line and then use a smaller brush just
to blend that out so of course the same
thing on the other side I can't see
quite as well out of this size so I have
to put the mirror right up to my face
and underneath the thing I love about
this is if you really press hard and put
a lot of fuss on you can make it really
really smoky if you want just a light
layer you can do that as well it does
blend out quite sheer or do it medium
like I've just done is such a versatile
lovely creamy eye shadow product but
never creases and I really recommend
this so step for hair and I'm not she
going to do much to my hair because i
put in a few waves this morning and
they're still kind of there but i don't
about you guys my hair gets quite dry
towards the end of the day so i'm going
to be using the batiste smoothing
conditioning mist and i really like this
because it's infused with argan oil so
it's really good for dry hair like mine
it just kind of makes it feel nourished
and moisturize and it's an aerosol spray
like they're dry shampoos so it doesn't
feel heavy like a serum or a cream would
I'm just going to spray a bit in the mid
to end length of my hair it makes the
head for really soft and for is free but
I also really like it because it makes
your hair feel very refreshed so if you
can't get hold of parties anywhere near
you they do actually sell it on asus
which ships worldwide so i'll put all
the links in the description bar below
step 5 lips and because I did a little
bit of a smoky eye I'm going to keep my
lips quite nude and
tonight's first of all i'm going to use
mac patisserie which is a really lovely
everyday easy to our lipsticks it's one
of their cream machine finishes so it's
very kind of light and creamy on the
lips and then on top of patisserie i'm
going to be using the mac lip gloss in
boy bait which is I think one of the
first ever Mac products I ever purchased
that I've just kept repurchase in it
because it's such a lovely nude lip
gloss I think that lip combinations
really flattering it makes you look like
you've got slightly fuller lips and it's
very easy to wear because it's not going
to kind of smudge anyway so step 6
perfume and my favorite evening perfect
combination is Stella by Stella
McCartney mixed with centric molecules
molecule 01 these are both well the
stellar one's quite like a deep dark
sent I think and then the molecule one
just I just love this and I think it
mixes well with everything so I'm just
going to put a few spritzes of this on
and then add molecule 01 on top this is
the one that everyone like stops me on
the street that asked for perfume i'm
wearing it's crazy so those are my six
steps from day to night i hope you like
seeing how i use up my look for the
evening i'm really excited to go to the
theater with anna now don't forget to
subscribe to my channel i think the
buttons there somewhere and i will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
