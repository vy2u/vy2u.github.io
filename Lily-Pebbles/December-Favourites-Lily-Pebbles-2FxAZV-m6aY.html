favorites video and I hope you all had a
really lovely relaxing Christmas it was
actually quite easy to gather my
favorites for this month because there
has been a group of products that I've
just been using
all month and absolutely loving so I'm
just going to get started and dig into
my little box of products here so first
of all let's start with nails and
there's two nail polishes I've been
loving and they're pretty much the same
at color the first one is Essie soul
mate and it's like a really dark purple
burgundy and I absolutely love wearing
this during the winter and a slightly
cheaper alternative actually it's
cheaper I don't even know anymore
because SC is now quite affordable but
Revlon and vixens also a lovely shade
they're very similar I've just been kind
of swapping between the two or month and
it looks really nice with gold glitter
accent nail as well so those two have
been a definite favourites for me this
month I've also been reunited with my
laughs that ozone Redland moisture rich
cleansing conditioner to our to find
this not all ocean counters have it but
I think the boots ones do and that's
where I found it it's basically a
cleansing conditioner so you can use it
alone but I like to use shampoo as well
because I wait quite long in between
washing my hair
but it's moisturizing and cleansing at
the same time so your hair feels like
really like clarified afterwards and all
the grease has gone but it still feels
really nourished and moisturized and I
just don't know what it is I love this
conditioner my hair always feels great
when I use it so I've never finished
this bottle I only got it recently
another one for the shower is from
rituals and this product is insane I was
telling my mom about it and my dad and
they didn't really believe me until they
used it and now they're completely
addicted as well it's from the Hermon
range from wait her mama I was in a man
and I've actually had a her mom or
Domino man when I was in Morocco it's
like a traditional ritual treatment
thing when you cover yourself in mud
this is their purifying body scrub and
there's also a shower place to go with
it but I actually further using
body scrub and it's for this incredible
eucalyptus scent this is so strong when
I use this in the shower especially if I
haven't put blocked nose or cold it
completely clears my sinuses it fills
the entire bathroom with the strongest
fresh scent it's it's really hard to
explain but it smells incredible and
it's really good if you have any kind of
cold or you're feeling a little bit
rubbish you need a little bit overcome
the body detox this is amazing I've also
nearly finished this I've been using it
every time I get a shower for scent I
have a little bit of a strange rod it's
from Joan Malone it's one of their 30
mil sense but it's blackberry and Bay
which is definitely more of a summer
scent when this first came out last year
I loved the idea of they're enough for
the whole marketing campaign and images
but I just didn't think it was quite me
I thought it was a little bit too sweet
my sister loves it for some reason like
a year later I've really got into it I
really like this it's such a strong
scent so when you spray it on you can
actually smell it on yourself all day
because most perfumes I feel like the
scent just disappears and then you can't
smell it even though other people can
but that's not really the point of a
perfume there's just something very
clean and nostalgic about the sin of
this I really do like a blackberry scent
of it and this is just it's a really
interesting one I definitely recommend
giving a spritz if you're near a germ
alone cancer might just become a little
bit addicted to it this month lick wise
I have two products I've been loving
this month this was an obvious one
because they talked about it all the
time and use it in videos all the time
so no Charlotte Tilbury oh it's lovely
Liberty which is from her Mac revolution
range these matte lipsticks are the best
I have ever tried I'm not going to work
too much because they've made the
appearing in my 2014 at favorites but
love Liberty is just a shade I would
never normally pick up when I'm at the
counter it's like a dark berry
and it's just beautiful time I wear it I
get compliments on it it really
long-lasting wants it's on the lips I
like to use a lip brush to apply it
outline and then fill in with the square
bullet that's very easy to use this has
just become one of my favorite products
to me all years
amazing lipstick the second ones from
Bourjois and I've been wearing this a
lot during my vlogmas vlogs it's their
Rouge Edition velvet in hot pepper and I
also love pink pop as well these days
even know how to describe these they're
like there's supposed to be like a matte
lipstick but I think is a bit like her
lip lacquer lip jelly feels very gentle
soft and lightweight on the lips but
it's got that sort of matte long-lasting
formula it's so easy to apply so tiny
and good to keep in your handbag and I
just love this shade with a little gravy
me and very kind of pale skin I think it
looks really pretty this month I've made
you got back into my emma hardy
cleansing balm I've been using a few
different cleanses this month kind of on
enough but this one I love using them
the evening this was a new pot actually
that started and I'm already kind of 1/3
of the way through it I just use like a
pea sized amount every night and it
takes up all my makeup including my eye
makeup it's a bomb that turns into an
oil that's very rich and nourishing that
makes my skin feel amazing I feel like a
lazy night today you really need to
moisturize if you have time because this
is so light moisturizing it just makes
my skin feel great and it's one of those
pens as I will always recommend and
always go back to okay one last beauty
products before I go onto a few random
favorites and this is the very
foundation again this isn't going to be
a surprise I use it in almost locks and
tutorials it's the fresh glow foundation
I use the shade 26 beige eye I mean I
don't think I've ever finished a
foundation before but this one is
starting to feel very light I've been
using s everyday I'm now starting to use
nice shade glow a bit more towards the
end of the month just to kind of switch
up a bit I was using this to a hold of
like second half of November and
December just a beautiful foundation
it's glowy it's easy to apply it looks
really natural on the skin but also
makes her skin look great I'm not sure
if this is out yet because I've been
getting loads of tweets people saying
they can't find it but I think the
Burberry shop in Covent Garden has it so
if you are in London maybe
there but it's amazing foundation
Stephanie worth the ridiculous price tag
so let's talk about random favorites and
I did promise you guys I show you my
scrapbook in my vlogs so that would be
at the end of this video but first of
all I want to talk to you about pasta
and if you watch my vlogs he also might
know that I was asked to eat spelt pasta
recently I was getting really bad
stomach cramps after the easy normal
pasta and it's one of my favorite meals
so I was getting really annoyed I
thought if spellcaster ago this is just
a random bradwood Bayona any spelt pasta
will do and it's just changed my life
seriously it cooks so much quicker it's
quite easy to overcook so you just be
careful but it just doesn't give me that
crown proctors I don't feel full and
horrible I just feel normal after eating
it so I am completely converted and I
eat spell test at home all the time now
I love it
I've also been loving my gray hmm beanie
hat I got this I picked up for pretty
cheap I think and I just been wearing it
throughout the winter and loving it I
love gray it's one of my favorite shades
to wear and I just think this is a
really cute easy beanie to wear and
again if you've been watching my vlogs
you'll know how much I love this hat so
finally my scrapbook here it is I
thought I would talk you through my
scrapbook a little bit and show you some
of the pages my name is resolution last
year it was to start to scrapbook for
the whole year and I've succeeded
I can't believe it's the end of the year
already I started January the 1st and
yeah pretty much finished the scrapbook
I've never done anything like
scrapbooking before but I guess I'm
quite a creative person
I just wanted somewhere to put my photos
because I take photos all the time and I
was never printing them or anything like
that I've been using something called
project life which you can get from any
kind of craft store and the reason I
like project life is because they have
these clear binders that make it really
easy to just stick the photos in I
didn't want anything that I was having
to like cut and glue and stick too much
because I knew I wouldn't do it some of
the pages are more like creative than
others some are just photos and the
beginning I was getting quite creative
like sticking things on but I'm just so
happy I think this it has so many
amazing memories in here I've had such
an incredible year and I love I can just
look through this and see all the
amazing things that I've done it's also
great for taking photos of my family and
nieces and nephews and it's really fun
I've like divided it by month and I'll
show you a few of my favorite pages now
okay on the first page I have this photo
of me and rich which is funny because I
think especially rich that's a lot
younger and that was only the beginning
of the year so as you can see it I went
for the file that has like two big
pictures for little ones and two big
ones here and in the set project life
set you can get a little cards that fit
this space on this page I've written a
little thing about how I've signed up
for a six-week ice-skating course I've
got pictures of me and rich going to
Covent Garden me and Anna feeding fill
me for daily mix and the videos that we
filmed because I want to remember like
work and stuff I've done as well and
it's my mentor Home Slice
I've got really cute photos of the kids
saying like loves apples 18 months and
his key born of Bailey when he had his
hair cut this page was Valentine's Day
and this is the card that rich bought me
that said happy Valentine's Day I hope
this card makes your high standards and
more feature in your scrapbook so I had
to cut that up and put it in here these
are some of my favorite pages this is
when I went to garner with comic relief
and Anna and had the most amazing
experience so I took some photos I was
really proud of and I wanted to put them
in scrapbook
this is like a huge spread and loads of
photos I love that one of me and Anna me
Anna and Lucy and all the kids that we
met and I printed off like a little map
to put in there and this is a big group
photo of all of us these are some photos
of when we went away for Easter and
rich I'm not going to show you all the
kind of family photos but I like to take
a lot said that well in here this is
when we went to Brighton with Anna and
Mark so I did some photos at Brighton
and ice on the pier ice on the beach and
that's one of me Anna and Mark me and
Anna are our Spacek a meet-up and me and
Anna in Malta there are a lot of photos
of me and Anna in here tiny second
birthday I also have a picture of mine
and Anna's big Lilliana picnic Meetup
and that was like a really good memory
from last year this year
this is where I'm Richard Marx did their
London to Paris bike ride and we did a
huge Paris meet up with you guys this is
when I met James Taylor who is my
lifelong idol with my sisters literally
best day of the year and this is my trip
to New York with Gemma and we met up at
Kisha these are some of my photos from
New York there was an amazing sunset so
sometimes I put things like this in it
just to make it a bit arty and these are
some photos from my birthday I haven't
quite finished yet so at this point of
filming this is where I've got up to but
as you can see this is what the pages
look like so you can just slot the
photos in there and it's really really
easy to use so hope you guys enjoyed
seeing what my December favorites have
been and as I said I've got a big 2014
favourites video coming up thanks so
