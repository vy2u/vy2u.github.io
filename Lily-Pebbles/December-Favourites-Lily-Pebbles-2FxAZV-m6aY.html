December favorites video and I hope you
all had a really lovely relaxing
Christmas it was actually quite easy to
gather my favorite for this month
because there has been a group of
products that I've just been using all
month and absolutely loving so I'm just
going to get started and dig into my
little box of products here so first of
all let's start with nails and there's
two nail polishes I've been loving and
they're pretty much the same color the
first one is SE soulmate and it's like a
really dark purple burgundy and i
absolutely love wearing this during the
winter and a slightly cheaper
alternative actually it's cheaper i
don't even know anymore because SE is
now quite affordable but revlon vixens
also a lovely shade they're very similar
i've just been kind of swapping between
the two or month and it looks really
nice with gold glitter accent nail as
well so those two have been a definite
favorites for me this month I've also
been reunited with my love that ozone
red blend moisture-rich cleansing
conditioner Tim you are to find this not
all o Shah counters habit but i think
the boots ones do and that's where I
found it it's basically a cleansing
conditioner so you can use it alone I
like to use shampoo as well because I
wait quite long in between washing my
hair but it's moisturizing and cleansing
at the same time so your hair feels like
really like clarified afterwards and all
the grease is gone but it still feels
really nourished and moisturized and I
just don't know what it is i love this
conditioner my hair always feels great
when i use it so I didn't finish this
bottle or I only got it recently another
one for the shower is from rituals and
this product is insane I was telling my
mom about it and my dad and they didn't
really believe me until they used it and
now they're completely addicted as well
it's from the Herman range and weight /
mama I was in a man and I've actually
had a her mom or Danaher man when I was
in Morocco it's like a traditional
ritual treatment thing when you cover
yourself in mud this is their purifying
body scrub and there's also a shower
place to go with it but I prefer using
body scrub and it's got this incredible
eucalyptus scent this is so strong when
I use this in the shower especially if I
haven't got blocked nose or cold it
completely clears my sinuses it fills
the entire bathroom with the strongest
fresh scent it's really hard to explain
but it smells incredible and it's really
good if you have any kind of cold or
you're feeling a little bit rubbish you
need a little bit overcome the body
detox this is amazing I've also nearly
finished this I've been using it every
time I get a shower for sent I have a
little bit of a strange right it's from
jo malone's one of their 30 mil sense
but it's blackberry and Bay which is
definitely more of a summer scent when
this first came out last year I loved
the idea of their love the whole
marketing campaign and images but I just
didn't think it was quite me I thought
it was a little bit too sweet my sister
loves it for some reason like a year
later I've really got into it I really
like this it's such a strong sense so
when you spray it on you can actually
smell it on yourself all day because
most perfumes I feel like the scent just
disappears and then you can't smell it
even though other people can but that's
not really the point of a perfume
there's just something very clean and
nostalgic about the sin of this I really
do like black bruce n of it and this is
just it's really interesting one i
definitely recommend giving a spritz if
you're near a germ alone counter I've
just become a little bit addicted to it
this month lik wise I have two products
I've been loving this month this was an
obvious one because I talk about it all
the time and use it in videos all the
time it's ovah charlotte tilbury oh it's
love Liberty which is from her Mac
revolution range these matte lipsticks
are the best i have ever tried I'm
knowledge of work too much because
they've made the appearing in my 2014
favorites but love Liberty is just a
shade I would never normally pick up
when I'm at the counter it's like a dark
berry and it's just beautiful time I
wear it I get compliments on it it
really long-lasting once it's on the
lips I like to use a lip brush to apply
the outline and then fill it in with the
square bullet that's very easy to use
and this has just become one of my
favorite products from all years
amazing lipstick the second ones from
bourgeois and I've been wearing this a
lot during my vlogmas vlogs it's their
Rouge edition velvet in hot pepper and I
also love ping-pong as well these day
even know how to describe these there
like they're supposed to be like a matte
lipstick but i think is a bit like a lip
lacquer lip jelly feels very gentle soft
and lightweight on the lips but it's got
that sort of matt long-lasting formula
it's so easy to apply so tiny and good
to keep in your handbag I just love this
shade with a little gray beanie and very
kind of pale skin I think it looks
really pretty this month I've made you
got back into my Emma harder cleansing
balm I've been using a few different
cleanses this month kind of on and off
but this one I love using them the
evening this was a new pot actually get
started and I'm already kind of third of
the way through it I just use like a pea
sized amount every night and it takes up
all my makeup including my eye makeup
it's a bomb that turns into an oil it's
very rich and nourishing it makes my
skin feel amazing I feel like a lazy
nights don't you really need to
moisturize if Jeff time because this is
so like moisturizing it just makes my
skin feel great and it's one of those
pens as I will always recommend and
always go back to okay one last beauty
products before I go on to a few random
favourites and this is the very
foundation again this isn't going to be
a surprise I use it in almost logs and
tutorials it's the fresh glow foundation
that I use the shade 26-page I I mean I
don't have ever finished a foundation
before but this one is starting to feel
very light I've been uses every day I'm
now starting to using NARS sheer glow
bit more towards the end of the month
just to kind of switch up a bit i was
using this throughout a hold of like
second half of november and december
just a beautiful foundation it's glowy
it's easy to apply it looks really
natural on the skin but also makes your
skin look great i'm not sure if this is
out yet because i've been getting loads
of tweets people saying they can't find
it but i think the burberry shop in
covent garden has it so if you are in
London maybe look there but it's an
amazing foundation definitely worth the
ridiculous price tag so let's talk about
random favourites and I did promise you
guys I'll show you my scrapbook in my
vlogs so that would be the end
video but first of all on my talk to you
about pasta and if you watched my drugs
he also might know that I've started to
eat spell its pasta recently I was
getting really bad stomach cramps rtet
normal pasta and it's one of my favorite
meals I was getting really annoyed I've
got a diff spellcaster ago this is a
just around and Brad bored by ona NE
spell festival do and it's just changed
my life seriously it cooks so much
quicker it's quite easy to overcook so
you just be careful but it just doesn't
give me that crown proctors I don't feel
full and horrible I just feel normal
after eating it so I am completely
converted and Eileen spellcaster home
all the time that I love it I've also
been loving my grey hmm Beenie hat I got
this I picked up for pretty cheap I
think and I just been wearing it
throughout the winter and loving it I
love gray it's one of my favorite shades
to worm and I just think this is a
really cute easy being me to wear and
again if you've been watching my vlogs
you'll know how much I love this hat so
finally my scrapbook here it is I
thought I would talk you through my
scrapbook a little bit and show you some
of the pages my need is resolution last
year was to start a scrapbook for the
whole year and I've succeeded I can't
believe it's the end of the year already
I started January the first and yeah
pretty much finished the scrapbook I've
never done anything like scrapbooking
before but I guess I'm quite a creative
person I just wanted somewhere to cut my
photos because I take photos all the
time and I was never printing them or
anything like that I've been using
something called Project life which you
can get from any kind of craft store and
the reason I like project life is
because they have these clear binders
that make it really easy to just slip
your photos in I didn't want anything
that I was having to like cut and glue
and stick too much less I knew I
wouldn't do it some of the pages are
more like creative than others some are
just photos at the beginning I was
getting quite creative like sticking
things on but I'm just so happy i think
this it has so many amazing memories in
here I've had such an incredible year
and I love I can just look
through this and see the amazing things
I've done it's also great for taking
photos of my family and nieces and
nephews and it's really fun I'd like
divided it by months and i'll show you a
few of my favorite pages now okay on the
first page I had this photo of me and
rich which is funny because I think
especially rich that's a lot younger and
that was only the beginning of the year
so as you can see i went for the file
that has like two big pictures for
little ones and two big ones here and in
the set project life set you can get a
little cards that fit this space on this
page I've written little thing about how
I've signed up for a six-week ice
skating course I've got pictures of me
and rich going to Covent Garden me and
Anna feeding fill me for daily mix and
the videos that we filmed because I want
to remember like work and stuff I've
done as well and it's my mentor

the kids saying like loves apples 18
months and there's Keith Warren of
Bailey when he had his hair cut this

card that rich bought me that said happy

your high standards and will feature in
your scrapbook so i had to cut that up
