in front of me behind me a Christmas
tree somewhere there and I haven't done
a sit-down video for a while so let's
give this a go hi everyone I hope you
all had a really lovely Christmas Day
it's time for my December favorites the
last favorites video of the year excuse
my voice
I'm definitely getting ill so today I'm
going to talk through my favorite
products from the month and although
last month was quite hard to pick some
this month felt a bit easier I'm really
excited about the products that I'm
talking about today first one is stellar
perfume and I have worn this for years
but I had a massive gap of not wearing
it and I recently got one sent to me in
a ball ball like a Christmas bauble and
I just fell back in love with it again
it's perfect for this time of year it's
probably the only perfume of this kind
that I like but it's sort of ones you
get in beauty hauls that aren't like
dipti called jo Malone
bit more of a traditional perfume it's
so nice it actually just really reminds
me of Anna and Gemma from James
maquillage it like takes me back two to
three years ago maybe even four or five
years ago and brings about really good
memories a couple of in a shower
products that I've been loving the first
one is from origins and I love their
ginger range
I don't even particularly like ginger
but the scent that they use in the
ginger range is so amazing this is there
ginger burst so it's a body wash I've
got the scrub as well leaking all over
me but I really like the wash for like
everyday use it's such a fresh spin it's
perfect for it's probably for a morning
shower although I use it in the evening
as well just even if you don't like
ginger go give it a sniff because it
doesn't really smell of ginger it's just
very refreshing and zingy I also
recently purchased the bumble and bumble
Sunday shampoo this is a clarifying
shampoo I had a couple of people comment
on my vlog saying Lily don't use this
every time you wash your hair it's
clarifying it'll strip it I don't wash
my hair every day like normal people I
wash my hair like every 4 or 5 days so I
do tend to use it most time on
Washington just because I feel like
normal shampoo doesn't make my hair feel
clean anymore sometimes if I feel like
I've overused it I will just use a
normal shampoo but but for me if I use
this and then a really hydrating
conditioner it's just the perfect combo
it makes my hair feel
clean I'm gonna go through the hustle of
washing there I want my hair to feel
clean afterwards and this stuff is
amazing if you use a lot of product and
you get product build-up this one will
definitely sort your hair out I recently
went to the LMS penthouse spar with my
friend Gemma and we had the most amazing
Massage and Facial I would really
recommend if you want to treat someone
to an amazing gift you get like a room
just for two people and my bed was like
filled with quartz it's like lying on a
bed of sand it was amazing but I wanted
to use some of the products that they
tried on me in the facial and one that
I've really been loving is the
pro-collagen marine cream so this is my
LMS and it's a really hydrating
moisturizer probably better just for
night but I've been using it morning and
night it smells quite fresh it's just
really really hydrating you can feel it
instantly when you put it on your skin
my skin just like drinks it up and it
absolutely loves it this time of year my
skin can get quite dry it's normally
dehydrated but it does get a little bit
dry this time of year so this has really
been sort of see now I've got a couple
of pallets that I've been loving this
month the first one is from Becca
I've been trying quite a few bits from
Becca this is the Umbra Rouge eye
palette and if it's got a special name
or if that's the name but basically it's
five eyeshadows and there are beautiful
the only one I don't really use is this
one and the others I I get such good use
out there really warm Browns this one's
beautiful slightly pink all over the lid
and that one is amazing the warm kind of
orangey Brown is great in the crease and
then the dark brown is really nice as a
liner in the outer corner of the eye the
pigmentation of these shadows is insane
like maybe a little bit too good I
always have to tap it off or put on the
back of my hand allies it's just too
much product they're so buttery soft and
it's a really great little palette
because it's not that big but talking of
big palettes you may have seen this in
one of my vlogs this is the new Naz
refillable palettes they have started
doing refillable palettes recently and
this is the large one I think this I
haven't seen how small the small one is
but it's probably much more practical
one thing I really don't like about NARS
packaging is the matte finish I know it
looks nice that this is already so
grubby and glittery and annoying I
really like how these pallets flip all
the way over it makes it so much easier
to use it's just like a proper artist
palette and I've got so many products in
here I've got some of my Mac eye shadows
in here because it's just magnetic and
then I've got NAS bronzer highlighter
for blushes for single eyeshadow
and then two of the GOI shadows as well
and I've just been loving using this all
month I don't care that it's big I've
been takin it away with me and I think
it's a really really great idea
especially if you're big nice fan just
to like collect as many products as you
like and put them into one pallet next
up is my Christmassy candle from Joe
Malone this is the roasted chestnut not
only does it look beautiful with the
green packaging but I get so many
compliments on this and people walk into
the lounge even when it's not burning
you can really smell it such a strong
scent
I've been burning it loads so you can
see how much I've used already it's just
so warm and comforting and Christmassy I
really love it we've been burning this
every single night they burn so clean
you can see there's no wax around the
edge of the candle there not at all
smoky and I love it okay I now have some
non-beauty favorites as well some kind
of clothes lifestyle things first up is
my new dressing gown or robe as some of
you guys may say if you're not from the
UK rich got this for my birthday you
might have seen in my vlogs it's from
the white company I got the it's the
75-pound one one's 50 it's slightly
thinner 175 pounds although it was 20%
off in a white company and it's really
long so it goes white adds your ankles I
got it in a medium so it's slightly big
for me and it's so cozy I did want the
white they didn't have that in stock so
I got the grey and I love it I've been
wearing it every night I used to make
fun of Anna and Mark for wearing their
dressing gals all the time but I get it
I now get it it's changed my life
I've also been absolutely loving the
brand Lilly and Lionel it is a bit
pricey but if you have the budget to
spend it's such a nice brand I think is
nice to spend money on smaller brands
and kind of get behind the smaller
upcoming brands it's such good quality
and such my stuff I seriously love
everything on their website I'm
completely lusting after the leather
jackets with really cool lining I have
this shirt from them which is a black
and white kind of floral shirt and it's
silk
all their shirts are silk and it's so
beautiful it does crease a little bit
but because of the print you can't
really tell so I've been wearing that a
lot and I love their makeup bags and
wash bags this is the one that has Lily
alone or in rose gold and it's blue it's
kind of like a galaxy rose print I
really like that it's a really good size
for makeup as well and then I have one
of their score
this is like a dark blue and gray it's
got stars on it I've been wearing this
so much it's so warm and cozy and really
stylish as well so I'm loving Lillian
Lionel and then I also recently bought
these tracksuit bottoms from Victoria
Secrets I'm not really a Victoria
Secrets fan anymore I used to be but I
really wanted some really comfy
tracksuit bottoms and these are kind of
cool as well I don't know why they just
remind me of like being at uni they've
got the fold over elastic let's say pink
on them they're gray wood like this neon
yellow and white stripe down the bottom
and then they're tight and I've just
been wearing these like every night
under my dressing gown loving loungewear
this month okay so those are all my
favorites for December sorry if I sound
really bummed up and coldy but as I said
I really hope you guys had a really
lovely Christmas it's been so fun of
logging every day thanks for all your
support and I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
