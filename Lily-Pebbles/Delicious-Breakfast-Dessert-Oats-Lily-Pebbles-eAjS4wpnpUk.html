please excuse my flat hair as you guys
know from my vlogs I've had a Brazilian
blow-dry so I'm still in those 3-4 days
where I can't tie it up wash it or
anything so feel like I'm wearing a wig
today I wanted to show you guys my
granola recipe because I mentioned in my
monthly favourites video that I am
loving this particular granola and you
guys all requested the recipe it's very
simple and basic I don't really like any
sort of dried fruit and all of those
things in it all the ones you buy in the
shops I feel like has so much stuff in
that I don't really particularly like so
I just make this one because I know that
I like it but feel free to add in any
kind of raisins or dried apricots or
anything like that that you like this
recipe was inspired by a couple of
things Liv Leah's crumbles I absolutely
love those crumbles but they do get a
bit pricey when you start buying them
like how much I was buying them
literally I want to eat them for
breakfast for dessert but it just kind
of wasn't working for me so I wanted to
make something that I could use at home
I think deliciously Ella uses this in
her crumble recipe so it's a very
similar recipe but I like to use it in a
few different ways so what you're going
to need for this recipe are some almonds
some jumbo oats some ground cinnamon
some maple syrup and some coconut oil
it's really simple just five ingredients
and the first thing I'm gonna do is
ground up my almonds and I'm gonna use
my Vitamix you can use whatever machine
you have where you can do it by your
hand I don't want them to be completely
smooth and ground I just want to break
them up a bit into smaller pieces so I
just kind of pulsed the Vitamix until I
have the right consistency and throw the
almonds into a large bowl and then I'm
gonna put in the oats with that I'm
going to put all the measurements you
need down below but I think you can just
kind of put in whatever you want it's
not like baking you don't have to be
strict with your measurements I just
kind of guesstimate now I'm gonna head
over to the hob and in my little pan I'm
gonna mix together the coconut oil the
maple syrup and the cinnamon and put on
quite a low heat just until it's all
melted together it shouldn't take very
long and then I'm just gonna pull that
into the bowl of almonds and oats and
mix that all together it sort of creates
a sticky oat consistency now my oven was
already preset at 180 in UK terms I
don't know what that is
everyone else but I'm sure you can
google it and I'm just gonna lay out the
oats onto a baking tray you can use
grease proof paper it's so hard to say
if you want but I feel like it doesn't
really make a difference I'm just going
to lay out onto the tray pretty flat and
then throw it into the oven I don't
really know exactly how long you keep it
in there for maybe around twenty to
thirty minutes but just keep checking it
make sure it's not burning you can
always turn the heat down move it around
a bit shake up the oats try to keep them
quite flat but you'll know it's ready
because it will start looking golden
crispy brown and it would smell
delicious so then when the time is up
and you're ready to take it out just
leave it to cool mix it up a bit and
what might happen is it does kind of
harden and stick together but I find if
you just get like a knife and break it
up it's nice easy get some large chunks
and some smaller chunks and then I like
to just put it into a jar it's not
really it's kind of like granola but
it's more just like oats but it tastes
delicious because it's got the maple
syrup in there which I think isn't
unhealthy at all it's like a really good
sweetener and a slight cinnamon as well
I don't even like cinnamon but I think
this works so well I use this in the
morning for breakfast sometimes I just
have a bit of skimmed milk with it and
have it like a cereal sometimes I put it
with yogurt and fruit to make it a bit
more of a granola and I'll also have it
for dessert it's really easy especially
in the Vitamix to make like a fruit
puree so you can get apples or peaches
or in season or pears and then to put
the granola on top a bit like a crumble
there's so many different ways or you
can just have as a snack sometimes I put
this is not Tupperware take it with me
and just snack on it it's so delicious
and sweet but not too sweet anyway I
told you it is very simple to do and I
hope this quick little recipe video
helps you guys please do try it out and
let me know if you do and what you think
of it because I always say like I'm not
good at cooking I don't do anything
fancy so for me I was really excited to
find something this is import I make it
every Sunday evening and it last me for
the whole week so I'm really happy as
someone who doesn't like breakfast I
finally found something that I like to
eat at breakfast thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
