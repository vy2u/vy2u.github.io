since my last full video so i think i
did quite well i haven't got loads of
stuff to show you but just a few like
bits so I thought show you what I've
bought recently and I'm just going to
get started straight away so first thing
is the rain has returned and I've been
sort of using two umbrellas what they're
both broken like I couldn't decide which
one was more broken but they're just
awful and I get so wet so I thought it's
about time engines go buy another
umbrella I hate white umbrellas stupid
waste of money but I force myself to I
thought if I'm going to you I'm going to
get pretty one so I got business cath
kidson umbrella and you can kind of see
the print just a nice little floral
print and it's one of the sort of small
ones and I do before the big umbrellas
because they're better but I can't carry
it around all the time like fo one that
will fit in my handbag so I got that
that was actually in the sale half-price
it was like 12 pounds which is all right
for an umbrella so the next year things
are from the new MLS beauty haul that I
went to recently in westfield stratford
the first just some boring cotton wool
pads and but the reason i got the rest
could they're like the bigger ones like
this and i decided it's better if i use
these for taking my makeup off because
then I wouldn't have to use as many so
um a lot some of these so got some of
these next time I'll get them from super
job or somewhere cheap but i just saw
them and thought yeah i want some of
those and the other thing from mls is
this hair turban I spoke about this in
my monthly favorites video which I don't
know if it's gone up yet or after this
but I won't talk about it again because
you can see what this strange
contraption is all about in that video
that was this is about five pounds and
the next couple of things from Topshop
are the next few things actually so the
first one is this necklace which you
would have seen in my outfit video and
my nail polish video my SC nail polish
with you and it looks like this and I
was looking for a necklace I really want
from H&amp;amp;M everywhere and I couldn't find
it and I've had urged by necklaces and I
bought some for H&amp;amp;M
returning them because I found this one
in Topshop and even there was a bit more
expensive it was like 30 pounds which is
more than i want to spend it's just
exactly what i was looking for a nice
summer good quality necklace with like
long neon colors and it just looks
really nice and i'll put a link to the
video i was wearing it so you can see
what it looks like on but yeah i really
love that and la people have been asking
me where I got it I got it an Oxford
Circus broad and recently it wasn't in
the sale so they should still have it
and I know that junior section is quite
big bear so you might have I searched
around but yes it looks like that but
I'm really happy I got that and I also
couldn't resist i love topshop nail
polish i also got a nail polish and this
is gone fishing which i was also wearing
my alpha video and i love it so the sort
of pistachio green it looks brighter on
camera than is but I really like that
color as well I think top truck nail
polish is a really good quality I also
got some trousers when it was sunny I
had the urge to buy some summer clothes
so I went into Selfridges so topshop in
Selfridges and I actually got these and
I took a photo which will be on my
weekly roundup on my blog so I'll link
to that what you can see them on there
they're sort of like tailored tapered
trousers with this kind of funny print
on them I mean I've had a few people say
to me what the hell are those trousers
normally is my brother-in-law taking the
piss and by to really like the print I
think is nice sort of floral and because
it's got sort of the black in the
background they can be smarter as well
so yeah I really like this and i also
got another piece of jewelry from H&amp;amp;M
and i bought those are things took them
back but this one I just thought I'd
keep it's a silver sort of double
bracelet and it does up with a magnet
like that and it's just kind of easy I
probably wear this one I want to like
layer up loads of bracelets and just add
this one on and it's kind of feels a bit
cheap but I think once it's are no local
rights so that was one of things I just
picked up at the till when I was queuing
i also got a oh I should have put this
with the M&amp;amp;S stuff when I went to the
M&amp;amp;S beauty haul I was looking at the
makeup
couldn't resist buy-ins blusher I know I
have too many blushes but it's just
gorgeous it's from their autograph range
and it's called coral so it's in this
nice like sleek black packaging and it
looks like this isn't that amazing it's
just an such a gorgeous coral color I'm
wearing it now and I drew airing this
like every day for a week and I love it
and also what's really weird is it last
for ages I've never really thought about
like the lasting power of a blusher I
just kind of thought it's all the same
but i've really noticed a difference in
this one at the end of the day you can
really see see i'm still wearing blusher
and normally it's kind of gone by the
end of the day so i'm loving this
blusher and i'll definitely look at the
other colors they have and it's just so
gorgeous puts on life you can kind of
see it there um yeah so pretty love it
kind of pinky peachy sorry pinkie peachy
and lovely texture I can't remember how
much this was actually I don't think it
was expensive think it was under 10
pounds and i'll try and check they have
a website so i'll link it below and the
last thing i got was from Selfridges
they're doing some kind of Cadbury's
promotion thing at the moment and I saw
these I don't know if anyone else
remembers these but these properly your
mind with my childhood there the dairy
milk miniatures so inside they have like
loads of these little mini ones I love
these noni that I love them feel like
the perfect size if you just want like a
chocolate fix but they just remind me of
being young I used to have some funny
like red postman dispenser that had
these in that used to like do something
in the chocolate would come out I don't
know but I was tweeting about it and
loads of other people's that they have
one as well so i'm not completely mad
but i just love these so i kept one of
these on my desk which is very dangerous
but at least I can control like I get
one little chocolate if I need a little
chocolate fix rather like a whole bar
and this is just so cute so I'm glad
they brought me back for like some
special promotion and that's it for my
quick little hole I hope you like seeing
what I fought and thank you for watching
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
