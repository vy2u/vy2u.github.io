of the bits that I've bought from boots
recently and which for those of you who
don't live in the UK it's are sort of
biggest drug store chain and these
aren't all things I bought all at once
there's things I bought over the last
few weeks so I've got them all in here
and I'll show you what a clock so the
first thing I got just fry went to
Morocco and is the I never know how to
save this brand his brown his booing I
don't know um I think it's French but
the Sun cream and this is the tan and
protect tie an intensifying Sun spray um
oh it does say son spray see when I
bought this I thought it was an oil and
so I bought a little Sun cream as well
like as a backup actually it comes out
as white as a song cream but it's tan
and protect so it yeah it has tan
intensifying in it which I don't really
even know that means but supposed to
make you tan better it's just in SPF 30
and I really like this it rubbed in
nicely and yeah but loads left so I'll
keep that for my next holiday and the
next thing i got was the soap and glory
super cat liquid eyeliner and this is my
favorite liquid eyeliner and I'd ran out
so I just got another one I really like
the packaging actually in little box and
this is yeah this is in carbon black and
that's what it looks like and this
doesn't normally last right along it
normally wipes off quite quickly
afterwards but it's just a sort of felt
tip liquid pen and I really like it it's
the blackest of black and it lasts all
day really easy to apply it and
definitely my favorite liquid eyeliner
and so that's some soap and glory I also
got this those are complete spontaneous
by I went in to buy a Sun cream i think
and i just saw this and it really caught
my eye and it's from dainty doll which
is nicola roberts from Girls Aloud her
makeup brand and and i think the rise
mainly for pale pale skin girls to make
up but there's quite a few things that
you can get if you
particularly pale and so this is a cream
blusher and it's in Orange County girl
and it looks like this so I don't know
how well it's going to show up in camera
but it's a sort of sorts of coral pink
but with gold flecks in it so it's
really nice and really caught my eye I
see if I can show you on my finger kind
of looks like that and i'm going to do a
blog post on this anyway and put it up
so i'll link it below when I've done it
it's really nice and so I love the color
I'm not sure how well I'm getting on
with it and I feel like it doesn't show
up that well on my skin like I was
expecting it to be in really nice coral
blusher and although the colors nice i
think i'd use it more as a highlighter
because it doesn't show up that way and
that's probably because it is for paler
skin so it kind of serves me right but
it's really nice you'd use your finger
and put it on your cheekbones and I use
this a bit on holidays well and I really
like it it's about 12 pounds so I'm yeah
I like it the next thing is this I've
wanted this ages I don't know why I
didn't get it I kind of just forgot and
I saw it yesterday and just thought I'm
gonna get it and it's the burt's bees
what's called lemon butter cuticle cream
which looks like that and I think I
haven't really got it in the past
because I've never really bothered
taking care of my cuticles I'm not
really i paint my nails a lof I don't
really look after them and I bite my
nails which is really bad but since I
got back from a rock oh my nails have
been in the worst condition they be like
p lane and my cuticles just look awful
and they're just it's disgraced so i
thought i'd get this and see how it
works it's just like it kind of looks
like a lip balm and smells really nice
it smells like sorts of lemonsweets you
get in old-fashioned sweet shops and
it's just like that so you can just rub
it and use it in your physicals I
thought it's getting really easy to keep
in my handbag and i'll probably remember
to use it so um i really like that i'm
glad i got it i'll let you know how I
get on with it and the next thing is the
hair product and this was recommended by
lily Melrose on our link her blog below
she's also recently started videos so
I'll link that below
and it's the vo5 hot oil moisture soak
elixir the main reason I wanted to get
this is for the packaging I don't know
why but i love it when there's like
clear packaging and you can see what's
inside mmm I don't know why so this is
basically they used to have like a
product that you had to heat up in a
bottle of water and use it which is
about the pain this is sort of the
shower in shower version so it's a pre
shampoo oil treatment you use this
little guide line here with arrows that
show you how your first use one of those
you wet your hair and then you use that
and you put all over your head and you
wait in the shower for like a minute
while the showers running it's all nice
and hot and then you wash it out and
shampoo conditioner and do everything
else and it's supposed to just make your
hair in much better condition um I use
this yesterday first thing is it's
impossible to stick to these guidelines
so much product comes out and before you
realize it like I've used that much
already and that was just once so this
will probably last three showers I think
which isn't that much I mean it wasn't
expensive and how much does maybe 5 99
but it's annoying to have to go keep
getting a new one um what does it smell
like smells all right supposed to be
like soap oh my god see I've just got it
everywhere this is what happens okay
sorry I just had to like clear
everything up because i spilt all
everywhere um so I've used it once and I
don't feel like it made a massive
difference to my hair I was expecting to
can't shower my hair feel really soft
because that's normally kind of what
happens at all products but I don't
really think it did anything but I mean
I'm going to use the rest and see how I
get on with it but at the moment I'm not
blown away by it um so I won't recommend
this yet but i'll let you know how I get
on with it this was a bit of a naughty
purchase um i was in westfield boots
which is like a massive one and this is
on the weekend when me and rich went on
some crazy shopping spree I don't even
know why but we just decided to go like
shopping crazy um and I saw the deal
lipsticks in Boots and I think it's
Fleur who is always so much
so I thought I'd try one out cuz I've
never got a dual lipstick before and and
I completely fell in love with this one
which is what number is this it's 353
blush and so the packaging looks like
this which is absolutely gorgeous I was
a complete idea can figure out for ages
how to open it I kept thinking you to
pull that bit but it's actually this
little bit here which is really weird
but and then it's like this and I don't
if you can kind of see the color it's
just a really nice everyday nude pink
and I absolutely love it it's really
creamy and moisturizing on the lips it
just makes my lips look slightly bigger
and I can't even explain I just
absolutely love it i think i was wearing
this in one of my last videos and i'll
try and find it in link it below but i'm
absolutely in love with this lipstick it
was ridiculously expensive it was
something like 22 pounds which is crazy
when you think about it for a lipstick
but it's definitely my favorite lipstick
I've ever bought hands down so if you're
sort of person who doesn't mind spending
23 pounds at a lipstick then i recommend
trying the deal ones and I'm seriously
impressed and I love it I wanted to get
a waterproof mascara when I was going on
holiday and because I don't wear
waterproof mascara every day here i just
don't really need to i'm fine with non
waterproof from scorers and but I
thought if I'm going to swimming and
stuffing in the heat thought I'd get one
and Anna from Viviana does makeup and
always raves about this L'Oreal
telescopic mascara and so I thought I'd
try it but all the writings robbed off
for some reason they must have like
melted in the sun it looks like this and
this really long blue bottle blue tube
and first thing is when I went to the
L'Oreal stand in Boots there was about
seven or eight different variations of
Laurel tell arielle telescopic mascara
so I was completely overwhelmed there's
actually like black carbon black dark
black I don't know how many different
blacks they can be but there was about
four um so I just picked up this one and
went for it
this is the waterproof one that's why
it's blue and anyway what did I think of
the mascara i think i was a little bit
disappointed actually the one looks like
this which is not kind of what i was
expecting it to obviously didn't do my
research there's like one of those
plasticky one's and it's really thin I i
usually use really thick mascara wands
um so I find it quite fiddly you have to
kind of really do each lash um it
definitely gives you length but it
didn't give me any volume and I think I
quite like volume I like having thicker
eyelashes and I think that my eyelashes
are already quite long so i guess it's
just isn't really right for me but if
you want longer eyelashes and i think it
actually gives quite a skull to them as
well then this is really good but if you
like thick then i wouldn't really
recommend it but um it's okay it's not
my favorite but it wasn't awful and it
definitely was waterproof it didn't run
at all so that's good and then the final
things i got i didn't actually realize
these out in the UK yet but I saw them
just on my way to work and they are the
Revlon just bitten kissable lip balm
stain such long names anyway I got these
three so these are in cherish lovesick
and honey I think they've only brought
four colors here there are a lot more in
America but they'll probably bring them
over gradually like they did with the
lip butters and so these are basically
like revlon's version of choppy sticks
the clinique chubby sticks which i
haven't actually tried my mom has one so
I'm going to try it so I can do a little
comparison on my blog but they look like
this they basically look like a big
crayon and then they wind up at the
bottom there and so this one is lovesick
which is like a bright pink
this one is cherish which is kind of a
bubblegum pink and and this one is honey
which is a more the natural pink um I'm
wearing one now I think I'm wearing well
I tried this one was at school I tried
lovesick and then change my mind and
then put honey on so it's kind of a mix
and haven't quite decided I feel about
them yet they go on quite glossy and
then they leave a stain sort of once
they go off you can see the color still
they're not glossy um I like the way you
applied them with the big crayon it's
really easy and I do like sort of finish
as well I just don't like the smell it
kind of smell like I really don't like
it I think that supposed to smell minty
but they smell a bit like soil oh man I
really don't like that small that's the
only real negative I think but it's
quite big negative for me cuz i'm going
to put something on my lips I really
want it to smell nice and taste mice or
like nothing but not taste horrible and
so I'm going to obviously keep using
these and see how I get on with them and
I've got a blog posts coming up on them
as well so look out for that on the blog
and yeah anyway that's everything that i
got from boots thank you for watching
