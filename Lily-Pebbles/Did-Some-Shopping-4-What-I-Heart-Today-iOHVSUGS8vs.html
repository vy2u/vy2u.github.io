for you um sorry about my hair I'm
actually going to London Fashion Week
today it's Sunday I didn't win this
video it's gonna go up and I'm on like
last day hair so I've just put it up and
I haven't quite decided if I can go out
like this yet but um I've just got a few
things that I bought over the last few
weeks that I wanted to show you because
I really like some of the stuff actually
so I'm just gonna get started like the
first the first thing is this necklace
and I don't know if you remember but
I've already got this necklace from
Topshop which has like the gold and the
silver and the black beads and I really
they had like a few different versions
of this and I really wanted another one
but by the time I sort of got around to
it I couldn't find them anywhere but
luckily my friend who works at Topshop
found long and the silver ones for me
and saved it for me so this is what it
looks like it's got the white rope here
instead of the black and then it's just
mainly silver with this sort of light
gold bit in the middle and I just really
like these I think they're really easy
to wear and they make sort of any outfit
look a bit smarter and kind of you know
if you were one of our plain top and you
just put this on it just sort of finish
as the outfit and I really like these
and they're much lighter than they look
as well someone said to me the other day
like well I must be really heavy on your
neck but it's not at all really light so
I really like these and I'm glad I've
got two now um the next thing are some
shoes I should have got two shoes so
I'll show you them together I've gone a
bit Tom crazy
Tom's came out ages ago and I wasn't
interested at all I normally do that
when something kind of has a hype around
her I just go back off and I'm like I
don't really want those but then towards
the end of the summer my loafer type
shoes broke I think I showed him like
one of the last videos so I just really
need some flats that were easy to wear
everyday so I went to try some Tom's
um actually I found it really hard to
find the right size because I'm a
half-size I'm a six and a half and when
I first tried on Tom's r6 I couldn't get
a six on
too small and sevens are too big then
someone told me that the different
styles come up completely different
sizes like there's some more mesh and
there's something more canvas no
difference so I tried a few on in
Selfridges and I ended up getting these
ones which are just like plain black
they've got really nice like cute print
inside actually which I think like
that's like all different animals
they're not like the most pretty
glamorous shoes at all I don't even
really know if I like them but they're
really comfy and they're just really
easy to sort of throw on every day and
that's just exactly what I needed just
some easy flats you're also quite good
because I really light so if you need to
like hairy flats in your bag these are
really good then they come with a cute
little canvas bags poem button to put
them in and then a few weeks later I
thought I really need some just easy
sorts of heels and everywhere heels that
often because I find it quite hassle and
and if I'm uncomfortable and but then
when I went to this I think was office
in Selfridges and it's that Tom's
do wedges and they're not bad actually
they're quite nice I like them these are
what they look like they're like black
suede all over the wedge as well like
from the front they have got a little
tongue sign on the back ribs a little
bit annoying but um the reason I had to
get these is because they are the
comfiest things I've ever worn in my
life I'm seriously not exaggerating I
don't wear heels and wedges that often
because I find them uncomfortable I wore
these the other day at a work event for
all day so from 8:00 in the morning to
8:00 at night so 12 hours and I'm not
joking they didn't have any pain at all
the sole is really rubbery so the reeks
of bouncy they don't you know you walk
down a corridor they don't clump they
just you can't hear and evening that
bouncy they just feel like clouds on
your feet they're so comfortable I wear
them without socks because they've got
this nice soft lining inside which you
can kind of see it's kind of bit like a
tartan and I just think they look really
nice as well they also make my feet look
quite small which I like as a size 6
which is kind of on the big end and they
make my feet
smaller so I really really like these
there were about sixty pounds 60 70
pounds I think which isn't cheap but I'm
really glad I spent it because I'll wear
these all the time especially because
they're comfortable I could just wear
them during the day I can be one of
those people with heels during the day
that's so exciting
yeah really like these and very happy
with those another necklace I got from
Topshop actually was when I was looking
for that silver neck because we couldn't
find it or I'll get this one instead and
it's this sort of flag bunting necklace
over a dream it just bit of silver and
then the little flags are gold and I
really like this I think it's again just
really easy to I really into like
accessorizing with statement necklaces
at the moment because when you're
getting ready early in the morning you
just put on like plain clothes you can
just easily put on a necklace and I've
had so many compliments on this necklace
as she saw a guy wearing at a London
Fashion Week which is a bit worrying but
I think it's more weird for him than it
is for me so yeah really like that again
really light and comfortable to wear and
mothered or the fashion stuff together
so these I've shown a lot on my
Instagram and have had loads of
compliments on them so I'm sure you've
all seen them my instagrams at Lily
pebbles if you want to follow me on
there and these are some trousers that I
got from Zara and this is what they look
like they've got a kind of I think like
leopard or a cheetah or something on
their black with white and they're like
really loose and then they go in at the
ankle oh and have a gold zip there and I
haven't really got any chances like this
but I know that trousers do kind of suit
me I mean I've got kind of longer legs
than I do body so it would make sense so
I just went desire and tried on a few
and really like these so I wear them
like high-waisted and that's actually
why I bought these because I think pals
like this you can't really wear them
with flats because they look like
pajamas so I needed a bit of height so
these go really nicely together and I've
just where I've been wearing these all
the time and I've worn them with a nice
sort of plain white shirt tucked in but
you can you a like a t-shirt
there's just so many ways you can wear
them it's quite hard I think to wear
jackets with that might be neat wearing
my leather jackets and you need to have
like a shorter tighter jacket thing
because sort of a visa loose then the
top off needs to be tightly sort of
balance out of it but yeah I really
really like these I don't remember how
much they were but they are current
season so they should still be out and
I've been wearing these loads really
really liked them they made me wanted to
get more houses actually so now it's all
beauty stuff she's got a few bits my
parents just came up from France and
they bought me so more Bioderma very
happy I was nearly running out and they
got me two of these sets so there's like
two four oh it doesn't say how much but
it's like two in one set and so I've got
four of those which is very good I think
I gave through one a month one bottle of
month I think and then they also got me
a mini one which I've never had before
I'm going away in January so I'll keep
this full of traveling purposes I don't
think you could unscrew the lid which is
very annoying because this would be
really useful if you could just decant
into this all the time and use it for
travelling I don't think you can take
the lid off which is annoying but I
might try and figure out how I can yeah
really cute I love this that's actually
like a tiny tiny bottle hundred
millilitres apparently and then I also
the other day I was really kind of in a
bright lipstick and I have been loving
my Dior Addict lipstick it's just so
creamy and easy to wear so I thought if
I already know I like the texture of it
myself
try and get another one from there so I
went to the dual counter and got another
lipstick and this is number seven five
three and it's kind of like a bright
pink but kind of Coralie as well I just
really like it and the lady tried it on
me I went outside and it's a daylight
make sure you always go out to daylight
to see if you like a lipstick because
the lights in like DePalma sores are
just awful so when outside had a little
look and I really liked it and it's kind
of an easy way to wear a bright lipstick
iPhone with these ones because they're
so sort of easy to apply and I normally
put it on and then just rub it in with
my finger
a bit to sort of make it a bit less
bright and I really like it I love these
lipsticks dangerous addiction these
because they're expensive but things
like 22 23 pounds we're just crazy so I
won't be buying another one any time
soon the next thing is a nail polish I
did a post on this the other day I mean
you can see on my nail so I'll link that
blog post below and this is butter
LONDON bossy boots and it's sort of past
Astacio Green and I really like it I
went to the new Selfridges work Beauty
workshop that's recently launched and
they have a whole source of nail polish
wall with SC butter LONDON models own
bourgeois and I don't receive butter
LONDON around that often and I only had
one polish that I didn't really use that
much so I went to have a look and this
one just immediately caught my eye I
just think it's really nice I've been
wearing it loads it's really easy
colored sort of goes with everything
it's not like a bright pink or something
that might clash with your outfit I feel
like this color goes with everything so
I really like this and it's got one of
those lids where you take off the lid
and then there's like a smaller one like
the Chanel polishes which I don't love
because I think these are quite hard to
hold but the brush is quite good and it
applies really well so I definitely get
more butter LONDON or polishes and I'd
recommend going to try out this one
which is called bossy boots and the next
two things I bought from Liberty's in
London which is a really really nice if
you don't know it it's like an old old
like traditional London department store
and it's beautiful the whole buildings
beautiful I went in there on my lunch
break and just went for like a mooch
around which is always a bad idea and I
ended up getting a couple of things
which are both heavily influenced by
Anna from Viviana does makeup who is my
number one influencer wife are hoping
the first thing I went to that I'd never
know how to say this brand to see the
ace up or ESOP I'm sorry if I'm saying
it wrong but I went to the counter and I
had a bit of time to spare so I just
said the lady like hi can you introduce
me to your top five selling best-selling
products which I always think is quite
nice to do because you know they're
probably bored as well and she just
taught me through the products and she
showed them to me on my hand and I just
had it was so nice and then obviously I
ended up buying something but the thing
they bought was the parsley seed mask
because I've heard loads about this
first I love the packaging it's in one
of those sorts of metal tubes which I
love it's a really nice mask you put it
on leave it on for like 10-15 minutes
and it sort of separates on your face I
haven't really looked into it yet why it
does that what the reason is but it
feels really nice it doesn't like tight
enough for her and it leaves my skin
feeling really good I need to try a bit
more to sort of see like the real
benefits but I've enjoyed using it so
far and the lovely lady at the counter
also gave me some samples to try because
she tried on my hand the oil cleanser
which I think I've already used that
sample which is really really nice it is
all from the parsley seed range parsley
seed oil cleanser the parsley seed serum
and the fabulous face oil and these are
all really really nice I was really
impressed and it's just worrying because
I'm probably going to go buy them at
some point but not yet I think when I
finished my cleanser I'm using at the
moment I might buy the oil cleanser
because it was really nice and left my
skin like when you only look look at the
difference in your hands and one's just
so much brighter than the other and then
the other thing I bought is this perfume
which I don't even know how to explain
it jeez so Anna told me that she went to
buy this perfume and it's kind of like a
beauty insider secrets a lot of like
beauty editors know about it but no one
really but I think it's a big like
consumer thing I just think it's real
like a beauty industry secret sort of
thing and I know we went for dinner and
she said like look at this perfume I was
like oh man that sounds interesting and
then we were walking back to the station
and I think I asked her about three
times what the perfume was called it's
just smell amazing I was like what's the
personal call again I'd really want that
and I didn't even realize I was doing it
but I was asking her literally every 10
minutes what it was called so I
obviously like the smell turns out is
this perfume so the brand is called
eccentric molecules and this one is
called molecule one and the idea behind
this perfume is that it's basically
unisex and it's got one molecule scent
in it
so most perfumes I think I'm really bad
at science stuff but I think I made out
of like thousands of molecules and this
world literally has one in it so it's
supposed to sort of bring out your
natural scent and it smells different on
everyone and I think after a while
you're not supposed to be able to smell
it on yourself but other people are
really drawn to it and it sounds a bit
gimmicky but I think the fact that I was
so drawn to it when Anna was wearing it
made me think I really want to try it so
I went to get it this is the smaller
bottle it doesn't come with a lid which
I find very strange I'm not sure why I
do like the smell it's not at all like
sweet or anything I don't I think a lot
of people won't like this but if you
like sort of think perfumes I think you
might like this so I put it on I'm not
joking I've had the weirdest experiences
with it the other day someone on the
tube platform said oh what's her perfume
I told the maid she made me write it
down because they liked it so much rich
my boyfriend this keeps commenting wow
you smell amazing what is that like I've
had so many compliments on it I actually
think it works it's so weird I don't
understand how but even people who don't
like this sort of perfumes keep telling
me them my perfume smells nice so I
don't really understand how it works but
I'm really enjoying using this and I
just think it's really cool and it
wasn't crazy expensive I think I mean I
think this was like 27 pounds it's quite
a small bottle but I think if you find a
nice perfume it's sort of worth spending
money on it so yeah that's the crazy
molecule one perfume story sorry if I've
like ruined a beauty insider secret
thing I'm not really sure I saw breathe
for a model recommend spoke about this
and she was like I'm not sure I really
want to tell you all about this because
then you'll know about it but I don't
know I think it's nice to sort of share
what I thought of it so I really like
that I think that's everything actually
yeah that's so everything I bought it
seems like a lot but I promise it's just
over like a long period of time and so I
hope you enjoyed this let me know if
you've got any of those let me know what
you think of the perfume as well I don't
know where you can get this I've got
little liberties but I'm sure if you
look online for a centric molecule
molecule one you'll be able to find out
and also let me know if you've tried
ESOP or a self brand or what products
you
and so thanks for watching and see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
