haul shopping video for you this is
again stuff I've just got over the
course of time the seasons changed it's
autumn now so I've had to change my
wardrobe a bit so I've spent far too
much money I love autumn winter clothes
I think there's so much nicer but
they're so much more expensive because
of the materials like much better
quality in the knitwear and stuff so I
have spent a bit of money it's not very
good but I've got some really nice stuff
so I'm looking forward to showing you
it's mainly fashion with a bit of beauty
and other bits and bobs here and there
first of all I have red lips
I'm sure you're all going to point to
Alex I don't wear bright red lips very
often so I thought I'd cook you tell you
what I'm wearing because I'm sure I get
a lot of questions so I'm wearing a Mac
cherry lip liner just kind of all over
the edges and then I've used the
Clinique new chubby stick intense and
visa launching in November in their much
more intense color than the original
chubby sticks and this is Mightiest
maraschino and it's an amazing red and I
absolutely love it so I did a blog post
on these so I'll link it below but
that's what I'm wearing on my lips so
now I'll get into the hole and show you
everything I've bought don't turn me off
because it's quite a lot so the first
few bits are beauty and the first thing
I got is this Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder I normally
use a nice powder I don't want to use
powder that often it's only really from
going on night out or I'm wearing a
particularly Jewish and Asian I just
need a bit of powder but I'm nearly
writing out my nozzle on because I don't
use powder that often I don't think
there's any point Bynes or for high-end
one so I've heard good things about this
one
and I got it in 0:01 transparent and I'm
looking forward to trying it actually I
tried it the other night for the first
time it it seemed good I didn't like to
emit too powdery I'm is quite light so
that's good I also gave into the hype
and bought Hyjal Iran and which is sort
of a moisturiser serum type thing it's
got hyaluronic as
it's really different the hydrated skin
which I have so I've used this actually
since I've had it for about three weeks
now and I haven't quite decided how I
feel about it I quite like it it's kind
of like a clear journey consistency it
hasn't like changed my life but I quite
like it I just hadn't read so I'm very
undecided but it's a cool product I'm
looking for trying it more and seeing
how it works with my skin the next thing
I got is from ESOP I'm in my last video
shopping video I think I showed my
parsley seed mask and said that I tried
a few testers of all the products I went
back looking for a cleanser because I've
sort of gone off mile is all hot cloth
cleanser I'm not sure why but I feel
like my skin sort of changed a bit and
growing up and I'm not sure it does
enough for me so I decided to go for
this one which is the fabulous face
cleanser it's actually a gel cleanser
and when I swept up to the counter I
said I don't have gel cleansers and she
was asking why and I don't really know
why actually I just kind of convinced
myself that I don't like gel cleansers
but I said I'd give it a go I try to
sample and I really liked it so it comes
in this nice bottle and you get a pump
as well with it which was actually a bit
hard to get on but the lady showed me
when I went back has for the comp one
and I really like this cleanser actually
I put it on sort of dry or slightly damp
skin and then when you add water to it
source of lavas up a bit but it's really
nice really gentle and just good for my
skin which is sort of joy do you
hydrated but kind of normal skin and I'm
really liking it so far I've got no
negatives about it and I really like the
pump so that's been my cleanser at the
moment and I'll update you and I self
I've used about that much so when I go
through it more I'll update you how I'm
getting on with it but I really like it
so far a couple of non beauty fashion
bits I got some kind of techie stuff
from Amazon so the first thing I got was
this remote control for my camera which
is so good because normally when I film
videos or take photos of myself I'm
running back and forth to the camera and
it's bit of a pain so this is really
handy this is the what's called rc6
remote and I got it from Amazon it
really wasn't expensive
tiny little remote which is good if
you're taking photos of yourself you can
hold it in your hand or like now I'm
going to keep on my lap from doing
videos so it's really good I recommend
that I think there's only one kind of
remote control anyway I also bought
another lens for my camera and I went
for the EF 50 millimeter F 1 point 8 -
that's a really long name but it comes
in a box like this and if you read my
floor the post I did on autumn beauty
with a picture of me my makeup that was
taken with this lens I won't get too
into this because I don't know how many
of you are actually interested and sort
of take you stuff but the lens looks
like this it's really small it's the
cheapest lens that they make you can
kind of hear it's very plastic II oh and
it's got like the tiniest amazi it
basically just blurs out the background
so if you like this sort of portrait
photos with a backgrounds blurry and
it's focused on the face then this is
really good for that it's very focused
in so it's not very good for like
closeup kind of things but I need to
play around with it a bit and kind of
get used to it I really like it for
portrait photos at the moment and it's
quite small so it's easy to keep in your
handbag and stuff when I go out at
Barnsley photos onto more fashion stuff
I bought these rings from Topshop not
sure how to show you these they're
basically stacking rings so there's 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8
rings and so they look like so it's a
mixed in gold rose gold silver and a
kind of black color so I've just been
wearing these sort of spread across my
fingers like this and they're just
really easy I mean they have weird words
on them like wisdom hope but I kind of
just keep those on the inside so you
can't see them and then it is a really
nice way to sort of toughen up an outfit
I really like wearing kind of chunky
jewellery
it's shirts and it kind of goes to the
whole military style as well at the
moment I haven't really been wearing
this off black or ones just they're a
gold rose gold and the silver ones
because they sort of suit me better so I
like those so you get quite a lot of
remember how much they were but I got
I don't think they were very expensive
the next two things are from monkey so I
know it's not quite cold enough for
gloves yet but I had to get these gloves
as soon as I saw I'm really into like
maroon I'm putting them on wasn't
talking I'm really into marine colors at
the moment and burgandy's and these are
going to be so good when it gets cold so
they look like this they're big comfy
mittens really cozy but the most
exciting thing about these gloves is the
other side I think that's pretty cool
my my boyfriend was not impressed and
was running around the shop like this
but I love them I think that's so cool
I'm literally such a high-five person
I'm gonna be running around giving
people high-fives ears but even without
this bit they're just really cozy and I
think never really good for winter so
those are the first things I got for
monkey this is from the store on Carnaby
Street and I really really like it so I
go there quite a lot to look at their
new stuff and the next thing is shirt
which actually saw Barbara form the
Persian baby talking about and I've seen
that a couple of times and thought arts
not really for me but then when I saw it
this weekend for some reason I just
really wanted it and it looks like this
it's like a standard shirts but it's
really soft it's really good for the
wind so it's gonna be really soft and
it's basically a small a lot the sleeves
it's quite oversized just really comfy
and easy to wear with jeans so I really
like that shirt then form and Topshop
feve you may have seen this on my
Instagram feed if you follow me on
instagram my name is Lily pebbles and a
few people commented on this saying they
really like this so it's gone down well
it's a snood which is like a scarf that
has no end just a big circle and it
basically wrap it around like this and
then it kind of looks like this and it's
a really nice blue black white burgundy
kind of color just really nice and warm
and comfortable and I really like it and
I needed a new scarf and I like the
color in the print of this
say that's from topshop the next thing
from topshop I didn't get it all at once
this wants to remind you I'm not a
complete shopaholic but yeah this is
quite a lot but I need some cardigans
and jumpers and just generally warm
things because it's freezing in the UK
and this is a cardigan from Topshop
again more burgundy it's a really nice
knit really sort of loose and baggy and
you really can't see it very well but
basically looks like this and it's just
really really comfortable I'm sure your
senior wearing this in a video soon and
really really comfy the next thing is
another one of these tops I'm actually
wearing now I've got this color so these
are like the they have tight arms and
then they're quite loose I just live in
these I have it in black this color
something else I think I also got it in
this kind of nice purpley color which is
also very nice for autumn I like my Deep
Purple's as well so these are just the
most useful tops ever seriously I live
in them and then I was got this jumper
which I was wearing in my last video so
you've already seen it green khaki
jumper sort of big knit with studs on
the shoulders and I really like this
actually I think jumpers like this are
worth investing in I mean they're so
overpriced in Topshop but I think make
it they keep you warm and they look nice
so I just had to bite the bullet and
spend money on silly things like jumpers
the next two things and the last two
things at home Zara my favourite shop at
the moment and this also I put on
Instagram and got a lot of comments from
it it's this green shirt so it's kind of
an oversized shirt with these big
pockets on the front and gold detailing
it's actually got little gold skulls on
the shoulder and at the front I really
like this because it's really thick
material and it's really warm it's not
you know some shirts when the wind blows
you're like boss freezing but this is a
really nice warmth of suede feeling
material and I just absolutely love this
I really like
the oversized style and I love the color
and just every
Bassets and then the final thing I still
can't believe I bought this I got it
yesterday I try to understand many times
and so many times just bed it's too
expensive it's like a hundred and forty
pounds this is a coat
it's just crazy I think people like to
invest him into coats but just for me at
the moment and how much I'm spending is
a lot it's code from Zara black and it
has I might to try this one actually to
show you let me see
yeah yeah it's black and it has leather
sort of bits here and zips and buttons
and nice zips here and it's kind of
quite long you can't see very well but
I'll link it below and you can see it I
couldn't find online I'll see if I can
find it online now but it's just really
really nice and it's really warm and I'm
quite like that it's a bit smarter than
other coats that I have I think new
looked do one quite similar which I'm
sure with a lot cheaper but I really
like this I tried on those I ended up
getting in a medium the large also fits
at me I thought it might be better if
I'm Ryan Big John force underneath but I
think this style of codes meant to be a
bit more fitted so I went with the
medium and I really liked it and I think
I'll get loads of wear out of it so
hopefully it's worth the money that's
everything from my haul
I easily sucked in all views more
regularly or just stop shopping is
that's quite a big haul I think um so

gonna be filming a lot more soon so
