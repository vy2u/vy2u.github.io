shopping video for you guys before
I have had a few kind of discount codes
and discount cards so I've kind of been
spending I know like this is the season
where it's my birthday and Christmas so
I get quite a lot of presents but for
some reason it's also the season where I
spend the most money I think it's cause
I'm kind of happy and excited and I
always are not spending more money
around my birthday and Christmas it's
really stupid I know but yeah I got
quite a few things only one beauty thing
most of this is kind of fashion and home
wear stuff but I thought you guys would
like to see so the first thing we're
into wet Muji I had a 20% discount code
card thing on like a one-off purchase so
I went with my mom and bought she bought
a few things as well but the first thing
I got are these gloves and I bought
seven pairs of these gloves for my dad
my couple of my friends and for them to
give us presents literally so many
people asked me together for them and
I've got the black ones with gray
stripes and the reason why everyone
wanted these gloves is because you can
use these on smartphones on iPhones
because I think how works if they've got
some kind of metal thread in the tips of
the fingers which means they can work on
touchscreens
but yeah that's kind of they're not that
 they're common basic grays and
blacks but I've got lots of pretty
gloves but when it's freezing cold and
you have to take your gloves off to use
your phone that is just not cool so I
realize I think actually do some as well
that work on the phone but yeah these
ones I got and I really like this it's
very handy and I also got a duvet cover
which I'm so excited about I'm so happy
I could finally do this video so I could
put it on my bed but it's basically a
jersey grey jersey duvet cover and I
used to have one of these not for Muji
one I got in America when I was younger
and Jersey duvet covers it just the
softest things ever they're so soft I
absolutely love it it's quite I think it
was 55 pounds before discount so it's
the sort of thing I would only really
buy it if I had a discount and they have
a sheet and pillowcases and stuff as
well but I didn't you know I couldn't
afford to go all out so I just got the
duvet cover because I think that's the
most important and yeah I love this it
only came in like gray beige and white
something's
thoth gray was nice and yes just so soft
and nice to keep you warm in the winter
and what else take it from Yugi oh yeah
this I'm gonna have to film separately
and show you because I had to put it
together but I got a sort of draw thing
for my bathroom and it's got three big
compartments and then a smaller one at
the top and it's basically my bathroom
cabinet it's just too full and every
time I opened it things are falling out
which was a bit scary so I've got this
just to keep my kind of everyday
skincare stuff and at the top I keep
like muslin cloths and cut them all and
then I have all my cleansers and masks
and everything in there so I'm really
happy it just fits in the corner of my
bathroom and it's just really nice even
though it was painted like home it was
so big but I'm really happy I got it so
that's everything from Muji um I had a
Topshop gift card that I won when it was
their Halloween trick or tweets I think
it was I tweeted like a photo of my face
paint and I won a gift card so I've kind
of tried to spread it out and I didn't
get that one big shop but I spent it all
now so I thought I'd show you what I got
and I got a couple of skirts I don't
know if you may have seen them I wrote
Instagram photos of me wearing them I
don't think I've mentioned them on my
blog or You Tube yes
the first one is this leather skirt and
it kind of just goes out like this and
it has a zip at the back and I've been
looking for our kind of heated leather
skirts or not real leather club or
whatever it's called for ages it was a
really nice one in Primark but it sold
out and this one is actually what I
wanted it's already pleated but I try it
on I really liked it there I actually
got it in a petite I'm not petite I've
never won anything petite in my life but
because the normal event is quite long
and I wanted it to be a bit shorter and
so this is actually perfect I got like I
think it's a 10 in petites which attends
quite someone for me as well normally a
12 so this is kind of on the smaller
side because I wear it so high-waisted
they're just like at my smallest point
in my waist so it's really nice and I
think when I wear this for my birthday
which actually oh yeah this video is
going to go up in Sunday because I'm
going to schedule it which will actually
be my birthday day so it's not my
birthday yet but when
you'll be watching this it will be my
birthday so they mean okay so the second
skirt I got is this tartan skirt which
is really fun it kind of reminds me of
being a schoolgirl / Gossip Girl it's
very on me but because it is a gift card
I really wanted to kind of force myself
by things I wouldn't normally buy
because I'm not really losing out and it
kind of is good for me to try new things
so it has like a black waistband and
then it just goes like that with kind of
red and gray tartan and it's really soft
and I like to round it with my thick
Primark cozy tights and it's comfortable
because it's stretchy and I just really
like it and I kind of like that kind of
preppy look sometimes so yeah really
happy with that scare actually and I've
been enjoying wearing it so I got those
together and then yesterday I went back
to Topshop and I wanted to find a top to
go with the leather skirt to wear out on
my birthday on Saturday night um and I
found this shirt and I really liked it
um I haven't decided to keep it or not
coz I'm tried it on with the skirt but I
think I probably will and it looks like
this I absolutely love the color
it's like electric blue with a hint of
purple it doesn't need a purple on
screen but it's quite perfectly my life
I mean it's kind of sheer and then it
has this kind of panel of black lace
going across going across not across and
then it's kind of longer at the back and
shorter at the front and it's got long
sleeves that go in at the wrist and I
just think that's a really nice color
and this kind of color really suits me
and I think with the black kind of
leather look it'll be really nice
together so I'm gonna try them on but
hopefully that's what I'm wearing
well that's what I would have worn last
night for my 25th birthday I'm very
excited about and so yeah really like
that so those three I got with my gift
card and then I also bought a jumper
from gap I think I've worn this I wonder
what was in the video I filmed of Anna
and I also did a blog post on this last
week and I did an outfit post but I
thought I'd show you anyway because I
did buy it
so it's from gap and I got this one it's
30% off
sweaters is now 40% off the gap that
just has an ism
in sales at the moment and everything's
still tidy and neat around the store I
really like that about gap sometimes in
sales everything's just kind of a mess
and that's why I don't like shopping the
sales but this is one of those
situations where you go to the till and
you're like oh I was going to get it
anyway so that's really good and it's
black and white striped and has this
nice stripe of electric blue at the top
I'm off to go through a phase of liking
this kind of color at the moment but
again I just think it really suits me
and it's a really soft jumper and it was
just such a bargain I think originally
was like 40-something pounds and it goes
down it's like 20-something Inc with a
discount so I really like that and some
of those gaps really good for like odd
things I go through phases of not going
in there and then I go in there find a
big gem and I've just been wearing this
and those it's really nice to layer up
but it's also nice tucked into skirts to
make it a bit smarter and yeah just
really really nice
I also got my beauty thing I'm I don't
know what but I just had an urge to
start using my Mac eyeshadows again I
haven't used them for ages and there's a
couple of colors I've always wanted but
I haven't had and those are patina and
wedge so I got those as that's this one
is patina and it's kind of like a muggy
brown shimmer kind of beige shimmer I
don't know it's really hard to just
quote and then wedge which is a very
similar color but a bit lighter and it's
matte so that's really nice to use like
in the crease and under the eye and I
wondered these may need to like make up
this little quad I've got loads of these
Mac cords and lizard shutters and I
recently depotted all my Mac eyeshadows
I didn't Instagram for it so if you guys
want to go find that as Lily pebbles and
I kind of did it over a candle I'm not
going to make a video on how I did it
because there's so many online if you
want to know how to do pots your macro
shadows just google it on YouTube don't
google it on YouTube search for on
YouTube and there's there's really good
tutorials I did the one with the candle
it was anyway I made this quad
this is Saturn's Hope which I've used so
much of hand written which I really like
and I recently used in a blog post that
everybody else really likes as well
wedge and patina so these are really
nice kind of quad of neutral colors
which I'm kind of trying to use everyday
because I like this kind of look
the moment kind of warm Browns and
Mutual's so I'm happy about those two
and I've been enjoying using them so far
and then the final thing is my newest
purchase I had a discount page for a
sauce so I decided to buy myself a
birthday present my grandma is giving me
money for my birthday so this is kind of
her present as well but it's this
Michael Kors watch and I let me see if I
can show you a bit closer I instagrammed
a photo of this watch and the other it
looks like this if you can see the other
rose gold watch which is the more
traditional one that everyone else kind
of seems to have and I love them both
and this one was actually cheaper than
the other one everyone has which I'm
quite surprised about because I kind of
I think it looks a bit more expensive
but basically I asked everyone to say
which one they think I should get and
the majority of people did go for the
other rose gold on which has the rose
gold face and the three kind of circles
in it I'm sure you guys know CH one I
mean it's kind of like the bloggers
watch I wouldn't tried them on in a shop
and I like them both but I think I got
this one because I think it looks a
little bit more grown-up with the kind
of black face and it's a bit thinner and
it's also a bit less pink it's more gold
than Rose which I refer because I'm not
that much like a pink person and I don't
know it's just I just prefer to get this
one I wanted going against the grain I
think the fact that everyone's hit that
other water made me want this one even
more because I don't want what everyone
has really but I'm really happy I got
this I had to get a few links taken out
but I absolutely love it I'm really
really happy with it and excited that I
could kind of open a birthday present
early because I bought it for myself
which is very naughty but I haven't had
got a new watch since I was 21 and my
other ones kind of a bit young for me
now so I just haven't been wearing a
watch for ages and I'm happy to be
wearing one again so that's everything I
hope you liked my last video which was
the London tag video I did with Anna
thank you for all your nice comments so
far I'm really glad that so many of you
said like oh I'm gonna visit London this
is really helpful because that's kind of
the point I love London I'm literally
obsessed with where I live so I'm really
happy to like if you have
recommendations and stuff and if you
ever want to tweet me
my twitter name without lily pebbles and
I'm happy to give you kind of London
suggestions so thanks for all your nice
comments on that video so thanks for
