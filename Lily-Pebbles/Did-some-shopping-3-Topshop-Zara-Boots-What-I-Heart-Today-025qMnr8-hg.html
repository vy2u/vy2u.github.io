you
mainly fashioned with a few BT bits I'm
just quickly comment on my hair I've
literally just walked out the shower
after washing my hair so it's really wet
and if by the end of this video its
massive I apologize
and but I'm gonna get started these are
things I bought over the pass or a few
weeks last month just some bits and bobs
really so the first thing I usually put
photo of this on Instagram and got loads
of comments and it's this belt and it's
from Topshop so it looks like this at
the front it's just a buckle or the back
and then it's got studs all along and it
sorts of studs that aren't pointed
they're sort of rounded off of the edges
and it's they're gold studs on black
belt and it's a thin belt I don't know
if it's meant to be sort of around
higher up or lower down but I got it in
a small so that I could wear it sort of
higher up um because that's where I like
to wear belts when I'm wearing dresses
and things like that that everywhere
belts when I wear jeans and stuff um so
yeah that's just like that and I really
like that
I can't member how much it is but I
don't think it was crazy amounts um and
then something similar to that I didn't
really get these on purpose to go
together I just like them both um is
this bag from Zara which I absolutely
love I bought this as soon as I saw it
and it can kind of be used as a bag or a
makeup bag because it's small enough to
be a makeup bag but inside its got like
cardholder spaces so it's probably meant
to be like a clutch bag um but it's
black sort of leather feeling that's not
real ever with gold studs and the same
sort of studs that are like blunt not
pointed and so this is from Zara and it
was only 20 pounds like I came as the
most amazing bargain ever I literally
would sit straight away and just think
it's such a good deal and it's really
nice material and I wore it as a bag the
other night and actually with the belt
which I don't really have quite cited as
a sellout or not but it looks all right
and I got some compliments on
but yeah it just felt really nice good
quality bag and 20 quid from Zara I
really think that's so good
so if you need like a small bag or a
nice makeup bag I'd recommend going to
look at this they have them like hanging
up they also had a cream one with sort
of rose gold studs which is really nice
as well um I also got some shoes so I
have these boots from Urban Outfitters
which are my favorite boots but they've
sorts of broken like around the heel as
a massive hole in it and every time it
rains I just get soaking wet feet so
I've been looking for new boots for
absolutely ages but then our summer came
so I sort of just forgot about it
but then you know what the weather's
like here it starts raining so I just
really wanted to have some boots for
when it's not hot and I went to
Selfridges shoe galleries and sold it
everywhere ended up getting something
Topshop that I actually looked at a
while ago they're gonna look out to the
massive on camera but they look nice on
there like this so they've got a tiny
bit of a heel but they're pretty much
flat and then they've got two buckles
and you can sort of see through to the
shoe which is cool because you can
either like wear low socks and then you
can see your ankles or you can wear like
colored socks which could be quite cool
and the straps got all around the other
side as well
which i really like and i think there's
a leather it should be for how much they
were they're like 75 pounds
Topshop shoes are always really
expensive yeah these are size six they
look absolutely massive I'm always
worried about she's looking big on me
and so she could have quite skinny
ankles so I was worried how like clunky
these are but they look nice on I like
them of like jeans or you can even wear
them quite like wearing like heavy boots
with sorts of quite delicate dresses I
like that contrast and look so yeah I
really like these so those are the shoes
I also got from Topshop so more jeans I
love their Lee jeans and I used to wear
Jamie's but they sort of got quite baggy
and started falling down Lee's a bit
tighter which I really like and they're
high-waisted which is good for they love
candles so these are the jeans that I
got their dark khaki green if you can
see really skinny and then at the end
they're sort of folded up with like the
darker green on the inside really really
really nice actually I think I'm gonna
wear this today I just had to show you
so I had to change out of them but
they're really they're really tight when
I first get Li jeans in Topshop they're
so tight I can't breathe in them but
they do stretch a lot so it's better to
get a smaller size than you actually are
so yeah I really like this I think
they're nice to wear with like black
tops white tops like they go with
everything and they're a bit different
to just blue jeans and black because
they're what as well a bit like boring
so I like these and they'll be good for
autumn as well and then actually a top
that I got really goes well with those
jeans and this is from Zara and it's a
grey t-shirt with quite a low v-neck and
then it's got little leather sleeves and
the thing I liked was as well is
actually quite long it looks much longer
on camera than it is it's just sort of a
bit longer than your average t-shirt I
don't really like wearing short t-shirts
so I really like this one it's quite a
heavy material so it hangs well as well
so yeah it's just a little t-shirt with
like fake leather sleeves and it's sort
of a dark grey that I really like that
and that looks really nice with the
green jeans probably with the boots as
well but it's a bit hot today for boots
so I'll probably wear the t-shirt and
the jeans today I'm really happy with
those two actually and then something I
go which I haven't quite decided if I
want to keep it yet but I think I do
this is jacket from Zara I've seen these
jackets for ages and I've always liked
them but I just never really bother
trying any on and I tried this one on
the other day and really liked it so
it's like a stripy blue and white jacket
with sorts of rolled-up sleeves and then
I'm gonna go it's really really hard to
show on camera but it sort of goes in at
the waist it's like oh god you really
can't see it it's like a short jacket
it's also got little studs on the
shoulders which I haven't quite so
if I like this and I think it's a bit
tacky but you can't really see it that
much so maybe if I put it on it's kind
of like this so it's like a short jacket
it can be kind of like smart or casual
which I which is why I like it I don't
know if you actually got to see that at
all but it's like a short smart casual
jacket and quite good for this sort of
in-between weather and I like that it
was 30 pounds from Zara so I haven't
quite decided to film keep or not but I
do quite like it and it's gonna be quite
useful I think and then I've just got a
few beauty bits as well I went into
boots when I was in Westfield because
it's one of the bigger ones and I picked
up two things from nip and fab mainly
because of Barbara from Persian babe she
always talks about this pistachio sundae
dry skin fix body butter and they
actually do a really small size they do
a big pop they also do this little tiny
one so I thought I'd get this sort of
fire out and it has quite a strong like
pistachio smell and it's like bright
green and I've nearly finished this so
I'm gonna save talking about it for my
empties video because it's nearly
finished but I also got a hand cream
which is the dry hand fix
brightening hand cream and this doesn't
say it's pistachio but it smells the
same to me as the body butter so it's
probably pistachio flavored or scented
and I quite like this I'm still not sure
how I feel about the scent but I'll come
on to that in another video so that's
the hand cream it's actually massive my
hunger is probably too big for handbags
so I keep it next to my bed and then the
final thing is this brown sugar lip
treatment from fresh so fresh it's a
brand that actually people from America
probably know better because it's an
American brand I think I think someone
the lady in the shop was telling me
their owners are from somewhere else but
it sort of was started in Boston in
America so they have it a lot in Sephora
and stuff there's any one shop in the UK
and it's in
and I went there yesterday and the first
thing I did was get another one of these
because it's my favorite lip balm ever
it looks like that says sugar fresh and
then it's the sugar lip treatment with
SPF 50 and the last one I had was like a
small one I got in a Sephora set and
this is a big one and they do all
different colors that are really nice my
mom got the coral one but I just like
the plain one and I use it mainly at
night I'm wearing it now it's just the
best lip balm ever it works like a treat
so I'm really happy I got that it's
quite expensive for a lip balm but I
think it's worth it I mean it's really
nice packaging as well as like matte um
so yeah I think that's everything for my
quick little fashion haul hope you've
liked seen everything and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
