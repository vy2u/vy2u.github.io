random video I have no idea this is
gonna be interesting or not but I
thought it's a thursday I feel like I'm
thursdays i can upload kind of silly
maybe not so great videos and i came up
with this idea on the train back from
beach at live and i just thought you
know i'm just gonna do it i think it
could be quite funny it's basically
disappointing product packaging and yeah
that sounds really random but i'm a bit
obsessed with packaging i feel like if i
were to be doing any other kind of job
that sort of job and definitely
interested me like coming up with
packaging for products i am a bit of a
packaging geek and there are some
products mostly products here actually
are some of my most favorite products
there's just certain stuff about the
packaging that I feel isn't quite right
or that kind of annoys me a bit and I
thought it might be fun to go through
them and tell you what I would change if
I could change anything about the
packaging I also think this video will
generate some really funny comments so i
hope you guys leave me a comment down
below letting me know which products you
find the packaging really irritating and
what you would change about it so let's
start with skincare cuz i have quite a
few and this is the product that started
it all off because i was chatting to
someone at b's chat live about this and
I said you don't want be really good if
it just did this and Anna was like yeah
it's a really good idea it's the askia
renascence cleansing gel love this one
of my favorite cleanses but the
packaging because it's white you can't
see when you're about to finish and
literally you'll have your last pump and
then you're out and you haven't got a
backup which most people don't have
backups only as crazy beauty obsess
people do that's really annoying to not
kind of be prepared for when you're
going to finish a product especially if
it's something like a cleanse are they
use every day but the white packaging
does look really chic and smart so I
thought a good option would be to have
like a clear panel on the side just you
can have peek in and see the product
inside and then you should be able to
see it sort of going down and see when
it's nearly at the end that's what I
would do with this this is such a stupid
video I always have another cleanser my
other favorite cleanser which is the
Emma hardy cleansing balm this is just
the most amazing products you've heard
me rave about it before but it comes in
such a ridiculous pot I think they did
fix it so that it doesn't leak but it
basically comes in this huge tub do you
have to take the lid off find someone to
put the lid I've got a really difficult
bathroom with like hardly any surface
area by to put the lid and then you use
take a little spatula you can use your
finger but then it will get in your
nails I take a little spatula and I take
a little bit look
much less than that and then I've got to
put up my hand find somebody put spatula
and then the lid is falling over the
amount of times I've dropped this and
it's just gone everywhere it's so fiddly
and so annoying I don't know if you can
put a bomb in a pump Sarah Chapman comes
in a pump so I think you can even if
this isn't a squeezy tube anything but
the tub this is very annoying i still
use it because i love it but i would
definitely change this packaging the
other skincare product i want to
dimension again a favorite i think this
is my third tube of it it's the esop
parsley seed cleansing mask I love love
love this mask I've nearly finished this
one as well and it comes to this really
cool metal tube but i actually really
like i like your sort of metal tubes
that little bit annoying to use you can
get all those windy up things to make
sure you get all the products out why
don't like about the packaging is the
lid is so small you can't stand it up
like that because it always falls over
so you have to kind of find somewhere to
lie it down I feel like three shelves at
my bathroom so everything kind of sits
on a shelf and this is just really hard
to store it ever know where to lie it
down i'll put it like that so what i
would do is just make the lid bigger you
know so it fills the whole space cuz if
it's like a big chunky lid then you can
just put it like that and it would look
great on the shelf this just doesn't
balance right and it infuriates me it's
always falling over and knocking things
off my shelf and that's what i would do
ESOP okay let's move on from skincare
now I have something from nails seche
vite is my all-time favorite top coat
it's so great quick drying amazing but I
can never quite finish it I spend my
whole time kind of tilting it to try and
get the last bit of product out the
brush just doesn't reach the bottom you
can see there's quite a big gap so I
thought might be a cool idea to put a
little cone extender on the lid so let
me show you what I kind of mean on the
side of the brush there would be like a
little tab and you can push it down and
the brush extends I think that would be
really cool just for when you get right
to the bottom I don't know if that would
work but that would be my kind of ideal
dream for this nail polish okay let's
look back foundation narshe glow great
foundation absolutely love it but when
you buy it it just comes with the lid
and no pump when you buy the pump
separately which you can which is fine
you can't then put the lid on top of the
pump so you're just left with a pump
which makes it really difficult
traveling because you're worried is
going to spill it makes it harder to
store and once you put the pump in it's
really hard to take out because just
gets so so messy i try to like transfer
a pump from one shoe glow to another
own it was just a disaster so if only
they could get the lid to fit on when
the pump is on like the giorgio armani
foundations this has a lid and a pump
it's perfect so much kind of easier to
store safer bed of traveling it's very
annoying and then you're kind of left
with its lid and you don't really know
what to do with it so make the lid
bigger please nas if you only have a few
left Real Techniques brushes i love them
a really great really affordable very
very good quality but when they
originally came out i think one of the
kind of selling points was that they
have this large base on the bottom I
haven't got my powder brush anymore for
this reason I kind of got rid of it but
the powder brush especially has a much
wider base and that's so that the
brushes can stand up by themselves I
don't know about you guys but I don't
stand my brushes up by themselves mainly
if there was no other brushes would do
that and I just put them in pots I don't
know anyone that kind of stands there
brush up on a table which is fine but
because the bottom so wide it does make
it harder to kind of store them in pots
and they take up so much space the
powder brush especially or was it the
bronzer brush that was just impossible
to put in a pot and it kind of just made
it difficult for me to know where to
store it so personally I would scrap the
whole kind of big base thing and just
keep the handles quite narrow that's
what I really like in a makeup brush
apart from that I love these brushes ok
another NARS product the matte lip
pencils these are so great long-lasting
amazing color range but I wish they were
wind up from the bottom because you need
a sharpener to sharpen these and you
need a special big sites shop now you
can buy them from NARS you can buy
sharpeners I have a big one and a small
one but I just forever losing my
sharpeners so annoying to have to take
one when you take these away with you
have to take a sharpener as well I just
feel like if this little color bit the
bottom which I always think oh maybe it
does wind up because it kind of looks
like it's going to move but it doesn't
if this just turned and you could wind
up the product it would make such a
difference i don't know if it's possible
because these are kind of like a pencil
form they're not like chubby steaks but
if it was at all possible i think it
would make these products like perfect
ok on my final thing is probably my
all-time favorite makeup product is the
naked palette by urban decay i love this
i like naked one the best out of all
three that the packaging is terrible
it's like this kind of velvety felt
material which means it gets so Robbie
and dirty and it opens really easily
just feel so cheap
it has a slight magnetic close but not
much and it's just so flimsy and so
dirty The Naked 2 &amp;amp; 3 both come in tins
which I'm not sure if I love that but I
feel like one day they're gonna have to
update this to match the others because
it's just kind of so outdated and just
not fit just felt and makeup don't go
well together so that was probably the
most random video I've ever filmed that
I hope you didn't find it to kind of
negative these are all the ultimate
favorite products for me it's just kind
of little things i'd love to change
about the packaging and i thought you
guys might find it interesting hearing
what i would change about it so please
let me know what you would change about
the packaging for some of your favorite
products and i hope you didn't mind a
little random thursday video I'll see
you on Sunday I am doing a pretty
exciting I think London video so I hope
you will enjoy that on Sunday and i'll
see you all then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
