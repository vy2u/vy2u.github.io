random video I have no idea this is
gonna be interesting or not but I
thought it's a Thursday I feel like I'm
Thursdays I can upload kind of silly
maybe not so great videos and I came up
with this idea on the train back from
peach at live and I just thought you
know I'm just gonna do it I think it
could be quite funny
it's basically disappointing product
packaging and yeah that sounds really
random but I'm a bit obsessed with
packaging I feel like if I were to be
doing any other kind of job that sort of
job and definitely interested me like
coming up with packaging for products I
am a bit of a packaging geek and there
are some products most importance here
actually are some of my most favorite
products there's just certain stuff
about the packaging that I feel isn't
quite right or that kind of annoys me a
bit and I thought it might be fun to go
through them and tell you what I would
change if I could change anything about
the packaging I also think this video
will generate some really funny comments
so I hope you guys leave me a comment
down below letting me know which
products you find the packaging really
irritating and what you would change
about it so let's start with skincare
cuz I have quite a few and this is the
product that started it all off because
I was chatting to someone at B's chat
line about this and I said you know what
be really good if it just did this and
Anna was like yeah it's a really good
idea it's the Askia renascence cleansing
gel love this one of my favorite
cleansers but the packaging because it's
white you can't see when you're about to
finish and literally you'll have your
last pump and then you're out and if you
haven't got a backup which most people
don't have backups only ask crazy beauty
obsessed people do that's really
annoying to not kind of be prepared for
when you're gonna finish a product
especially if it's something like a
cleanser they use every day but the
white packaging does look really chic
and smart so I thought a good option
would be to have like a clear panel on
the side just so you can kind of peek in
and see the product inside and then you
should be able to see it sort of going
down and see when it's nearly at the end
that's what I would do with this this is
I always have another cleanser my other
favorite cleanser which is the emma
hardy cleansing balm this is just the
most amazing product you've heard me
rave about it before but it comes in
such a ridiculous pot i think they did
fix it so that it doesn't leak but it
basically comes in this huge tub do you
have to take the lid off
find someone to put the lid I've got a
really difficult bathroom with like
hardly any surface area by side to put
the lid and then you use to take a
little spatula you can use your finger
but then it will get in your nails I
take a little spatula and I take a
little bit look I haven't even got my
less than that and then I've got to put
up my hand find some it's put spatula
and then the lid is falling over the
amount of times I've dropped this and
it's just gone everywhere it's so fiddly
and so annoying I don't know if you can
put a bomb in a pump Sarah Chapman comes
in a pump so I think you can even if
this isn't a squeezy tube anything but
the tub this is a very annoying I still
use it because I love it but I would
definitely change this packaging the
other skin care product I want to
dimension again a favorite I think this
is my third cheap of it it's the ESOP
parsley seed cleansing mask I love love
love this mask I've nearly finished this
one as well and it comes to this really
cool metal tube but I actually really
like I like these sort of metal tubes
they're little bit annoying to use you
can get all those winding up things to
make sure you get all the products out
well I don't like about the packaging is
the lid is so small you can't stand it
up like that because it always falls
over so you have to kind of find
somewhere to lie it down I've got like
three shelves in my bathroom so
everything kind of sits on a shelf and
this is just really hard to store you
never know where to lie it down I'll put
it like that so what I would do is just
make the lid bigger you know so it fills
the whole space cuz if it's like a big
chunky lid then you can just put it like
that and it would look great on the
shelf this just doesn't balance right
and it infuriates me it's always falling
over and knocking things off my shelf
and that's what I would do ease up okay
let's move on from skincare now I have
something from nails Seche vite is my
all-time favorite top coat it's so great
quick drying amazing but I can never
quite finish it and I swear my whole
time kind of tilting it to try and get
the last bit of product out the brush
just doesn't reach the bottom you can
see there's quite a big gap so I thought
it might be a cool idea to put a little
kind extender on the lid so let me show
you what I kind of mean on the side of
the brush there would be like a little
tab and you can push it down and the
brush extends I think that would be
really cool just for when you get right
to the bottom I don't know if that would
work but that would be my kind of ideal
dream for this nail polish okay let's
talk about foundation narshe glow great
foundation absolutely love it but when
you buy it it just comes with the lid
and no pump when you buy the pump
separately which you can which is fine
you can't then put the lid on top of the
pump so you're just left with a pump
which makes it really difficult for
traveling because you're worried it's
gonna spill it makes it harder to store
and once you put the pump in it's really
hard to take out because it just gets so
so messy I've try to like transfer a
pump from one shoe glow to another
it was just a disaster so if only they
could get the lid to fit on when the
pump is on like the Giorgio Armani
foundations this has a lid and a pump
it's perfect
so much kind of easier to store safer
better for traveling it's very annoying
and then you're kind of left with this
lid and you don't really know what to do
with it so make the lid bigger
please Naz okay I only have a few left
Real Techniques brushes I love them a
really great really affordable very very
good quality but when they originally
came out I think one of the kind of
selling points was that they have this
large base on the bottom I haven't got
my powder brush anymore for this reason
I kind of got rid of it but the powder
brush especially has a much wider base
and that's so that the brushes can stand
up by themselves I don't know about you
guys but I don't stand my brushes up by
themselves mainly there was no other
brushes would do that and I just put
them in pots I don't know any one that
kind of stands their brush up on a table
which is fine but because the bottom so
wide it does make it harder to kind of
store them in pots and they take up so
much space the powder brush especially
or was it the bronzer brush that was
just impossible to put in a pot and it
kind of just made it difficult for me to
know where to store it so personally I
would scrap the whole kind of big base
thing and just keep the handles quite
narrow that's what I really like in a
makeup brush apart from that I love
these brushes
okay another nice product the matte lip
pencils these are so great matte
long-lasting amazing color range but I
wish they were wind up from the bottom
because you need a sharpener to sharpen
these and you need a special big site
shop now you can buy them from NARS you
can buy sharpeners I have a big one and
a small one but I just forevers losing
my sharpeners it's so annoying to have
to take one when you take these away
with you you have to take a sharpener as
well I just feel like if this little
color bit the bottom which I always
think oh maybe it does wind up because
it kind of looks like it's gonna move
but it doesn't if this just turned and
you could wind up the product it would
make such a difference I don't know if
it's possible because these are kind of
like a pencil form they're not like
chubby stakes but if it was at all
possible I think it would make these
products like perfect okay and my final
thing is probably my all-time favorite
makeup product is the Naked palette by
urban decay I love this I like Naked 1
the best out of all three that the
packaging is terrible it's like this
kind of velvety felt material which
means it gets so
grubby and dirty and it opens really
easily he just feels so cheap
it has a slight magnetic close but not
much and it's just so flimsy and so
dirty the naked 2 &amp;amp; 3 both come in tins
which I'm not sure if I love that but I
feel like one day they're gonna have to
update this to match the others because
it's just kind of so outdated and just
not fit just felt and makeup don't go
well together so that was probably the
most random video I've ever filmed that
I hope you didn't find it too kind of
negative these are all the ultimate
favorite products for me it's just kind
of little things I'd love to change
about the packaging and I thought you
guys might find it interesting hearing
what I would change about it so please
let me know what you would change about
the packaging for some of your favorite
products and I hope you didn't mind a
little random Thursday video I'll see
you on Sunday I am doing a pretty
exciting I think London video so I hope
you will enjoy that on Sunday and I'll
see you all then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
