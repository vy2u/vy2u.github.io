talking through my disappointing product
so products that I've tried and I
haven't been happy with the result
they either haven't been what I expected
or they just let me down and I know that
these videos are quite helpful to you
guys but remember everyone's opinions
are different this is just my opinion
and it feels like there's a lot of
products but actually it's not that much
because I've been kind of stashing them
up for the past three or four months and
in comparison to how many products I try
and love it's actually not that much but
I I really wanted to talk you through
the products just so you had an honest
opinion on both the products I love and
the products I didn't love so first of
all I'm going to talk about the pixi
waterproof makeup remover I really like
pixie I love the glow tonic this is just
a little eye makeup remover use one of
those like duo phase I think they call
when you shake it up I just found this
didn't work that well I really love the
Clarins eye makeup remover I also like
the Charlotte Tilbury one this one I
just like within eye make up remover
like this I expect it to take off all my
makeup in one swipe and I just found
that this wasn't quite strong enough I
have a couple of foundations - this one
is the L'Oreal visible lift blur
foundation I bought this in America when
I was in Florida and I also bought the
other liquid foundation I really like
the liquid foundation it's a very nice
drugstore foundation it's medium
coverage dewy very nice on the skin this
one I didn't like as much this is like
it's silicone sister it's very slippy
and greasy and I really don't like that
texture on my skin it feels kind of
grubby and dirty and doesn't feel nice
on my skin also this shade was a
terrible match for me nude beige but
that's not the Foundation's fault it's
just a very orangey shade I just
preferred the other one and there's two
for a reason depends on what texture you
like and I definitely preferred the
liquid foundation I was also a bit
disappointed with NASA's new foundation
which is called the all day luminous
weightless foundation but I kind of knew
that I wasn't going to like it it's not
really aimed at my skin type and what I
want for a foundation it's got really
good packaging that comes with a pump
unlike the shade glow so good on NARS
for tuning that I just didn't really get
this foundation it's meant to be
luminous and weightless flying found it
really heavy on the skin and I didn't
find it that luminous either the
pigmentation is insane which I guess is
good if you have a lot to cover up I
prefer a lighter glowy foundation I
found this was just too heavy on my skin
and it didn't blend very well I just
didn't didn't get on with it at all but
yeah I think this is better for your
skin types nowzick recently released
some new nail polishes and the
collection is called the new white so
it's basically the different take on
white nails it's like color tinted white
and I was really excited to try these a
lot of people have raved about them I
picked up Whitehall Street and Swann
streets one Street is like a minty green
and white whole street is like a gray G
color the first one I tried was Swan
Street and I was really disappointed at
this because I didn't realize that you
needed three coats to get an opaque
color for me three is too many I can
deal with two but I haven't got time in
my life for three codes and I also find
when you do three that it's never that
even because you can sometimes see that
other layers underneath and it gets a
bit patchy so I was really disappointed
with that because these are not cheap
they're like fourteen pounds and I got
all like open stressy about it and then
I tried Whitehorse Street and actually
this the formula for this one for some
reason is different and much better I
found that I only needed two coats for
this so it was a win and a not so win
I'll probably give this away because I
just have other mint polishes that will
do it in two coats I always have mascara
in my disappointing Prados videos
because I like to try a lot and I will
no insulin if I like or not and if I
don't like it I'm not going to carry on
using it especially if it's a cheap
drugstore mascara so I just kind of
throw it in my disappointing products
box so I'm just gonna run through
quickly the mascara I didn't like and I
haven't really got a reason why it's
quite hard to describe why you don't
like a mascara but it just didn't work
for my lashes so the first one is
Maybelline the colossal go extreme
leather black don't really get the
leather thing this just didn't really
work for me at all didn't do anything
for my lashes I much prefer the other
Maybelline like the rocket and the pink
packaging with the black the feathers or
her and what it's called I also didn't
like the Rimmel extra super lash I
bought this and the 3d lash at the same
time and I really like the 3d lash and I
didn't like this one so that would be my
pick out of the team and I also bought
Kiko super color mascara I bought a blue
mascara and I was so excited about this
I was reeling forward to giving it a go
but I wanted to just have kind of blue
tips so I applied my normal mascara
first and then I put this on top and I
just find I found that it didn't really
apply properly you couldn't really see
the blue
I also tried it by itself and I just
didn't find the color transferred on to
my lashes well and it didn't really do
much of my lashes so that was a shame
let me know if you have any good colored
mascara recommendations because I still
want to try a good blue mascara I really
loved the Bourjois Rouge Edition Velvets
but like everyone else I was
disappointed with the shade Grand Cru
and I bought this and I forgot that
everyone hated it and I was all excited
and then all of you guys committed like
that's the bad one so I thought I'd give
it a go anyway but you guys are right it
went really patchy I don't know what it
is about the shade they need to
reformulate this on because it's a
really nice dark red I suppose really
excited to try this but it does the
Apache and it's like sheer when you
apply it's nothing like the other ones I
don't know what went wrong but this was
a bad one so don't get grand cru get the
other shades I was also really
disappointed with this products from
deal which looks very cute it's the
cheek and lip glow it looks like a
little nail polish you pull the lid off
and then you really do kind of unscrew
it like a nail polish and it has this
huge round applicator a bit like the
Clarins kind of honey lip balm thing but
it's a really really watery formula so
it doesn't work as a blusher for me
because it's so watery that it shares
out to nothing and if it even had color
to it it would just go all over my face
and for a lip stain it like a lip glow
it's okay it's kind of very watery and
slips off the lip and hasn't got much
color to it I just think this is a bit
of a kind of gimmicky didn't really do
much product on a recent trip to the
drugstore I picked up this from Rimmel
is the last thing a finished concealer
corrector and I was annoyed bra barrel
and I was a bit annoyed about this
before I even tried it
because one it comes in like three
shades and they're all really really
liked very much aimed at white skin I
know this is very common in the
drugstore but this one I was just
particularly shocked at the terrible
choice of shades even for my skin tone I
struggle to find the right one so I
can't even imagine how hard it is if you
have darker skin tones it's like a hard
concealer and I thought this might be
similar to the Laura Mercier secret
camouflage concealer which I like to use
on spots also I bought it from super
drug so the whole thing is completely
sticky I don't know why they can't put
the security tags on like the bottom or
something but it's just it kind of ruins
the whole product I just didn't get on
that well with this the color didn't
suit me
found it to be a little bit too stiff
and hard to work with also a little bit
greasy that something it's so common I
find with drugstore concealers it
they're quite greasy on the skin and I
would only really use a concealer this
formula if it was like the Laura Mercier
one and lasted throughout the whole day
but this one just didn't last for me so
I was very disappointed with that but I
have another thing from Dior this is
their creme or creme apricot edition
limited okaywe I've just read out all
the French is the fortifying cream for
nails and I thought all that sounds
really interesting
and it comes with a little popped and
it's like red and glossy and beautiful
and it's apricots which is like my
favorite scent hmm actually doesn't
smell like apricot see but oh it does it
look bad actually I like the smell of
apricot so this is like a cream and I
read the instructions and it said just
pop it into your cuticle area to
moisturize but it's like the stickiest
cream ever I rubbed all over my nails
and I was like now why do I feel like I
need to wash off it was just so sticky
and tacky and uncomfortable and greasy
and I feel like I couldn't touch
anything for hours and maybe I'm using
it wrong let me know if I am but I've
read the instructions and it said just
rub it onto your cuticles and leave it
to soak in but it was really quite
unpleasant I even tried using it at
night and I woke up with like greasy
cream all over my face so I don't really
get this products but I'm not gonna say
it's terrible because maybe I'm using it
wrong but I didn't enjoy using it when I
did next up is this eye tint from Becca
and it's in the shade Barak so these are
like they have lip tints cheek tints
it's like a little liquid that you can
blend on but this is an eyeshadow form I
just found it so if it's the shape I
found this to be so sheer that when you
bend it out there is literally no color
and it's very wishy-washy which I guess
you can put a wash of color on your lid
but I found it to be quite messy
I feel like cream eyeshadows are just
way easier to use this was too liquidy
for me and I didn't I just I wouldn't
use this again so it's in a disappointed
products video okay I have two more
products this one is from Tom Ford and I
feel like this is quite famous and quite
well-known you will recognize it when I
open it is their shade and illuminate so
you open it up it's got a big mirror and
it's the cream highlighter and a cream
bronzer I don't know what I was
expecting but the bronzer is far too
orange from
and the highlighter is far too white for
me they're just the completely the wrong
shades if this was like a slightly
grainy brown and this was a slightly
golden e highlights then I probably love
it although cream contours are quite
hard but this is a nice formula I just
found the shades just didn't work for me
at all maybe this would work if you're
Kim Kardashian but not I feel Lily
pebbles okay finally this from YSL
cutest packaging ever I was really
excited to see what was inside this but
inside wait what's it called it's called
the - sure Clark blur Perfector and it
mean it took me reading about this
product about five times until I could
kind of figure out what it was it's very
confusing but I think you can use this
over your makeup it's like a cream to
powder or you can use it as a primer so
it's this funny like bomb you walk your
finger on and then it feels like a
powder I mean quite clever it feels a
bit like hourglass veil when you rub it
on but I tried it over my makeup I tried
to under my makeup I tried it a million
different ways and it just felt greasy I
obviously have a thing about this greasy
texture but anything that feels slippy
and greasy I hate that texture on my
skin and I just don't really get what
this does for my makeup he didn't do
anything from mine personally rubbing a
bomb on top of my makeup I didn't enjoy
that and it's too flippy and greasy to
use as a primer so this is a bit of a
weird off me I didn't know what to do
about this so those are all the products
that have disappointed me over the last
few months and I will keep collecting
and do these videos every now and again
because I know that they're helpful I
really enjoy watching them so give this
video a thumbs up if you did enjoy it
and I'll see you guys on Sunday for my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
