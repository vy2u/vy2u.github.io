disappointing products video because I
talk about my recommendations a lot but
I don't offer and tell you the things
that don't make the cut and the things
that kind of disappoint me so I'm just
gonna run through a few bits that I've
got here and let you know why they
disappointed me so first of all Clinique
have launched a couple of new products
I love the cheek the chubby cheeks they
fall out but along with those they
brought out these which are the chubby
stick baby tins and these are kind of
like very sheer lip balms and they've
got that pH thing so the color adjusts
depends you know like the heat of your
lips or something like that
I found these to be quite disappointing
because although the packaging is really
cute and looks like jellybeans and
they're really bright I feel like they
all look exactly the same when you put
them on and they do change slightly but
it's just not enough for the price I
think if this was Revlon then maybe
they'd probably be a few pounds of
you're right but for the price and
because they're Clinique I found that
they just weren't that exciting the next
products from Revlon and it's their
color state moisture stains and I was
really excited to try these because I've
seen a few youtubers talk about them but
the minute I tried this I knew it just
wasn't for me it's quite like gloopy and
I found it was really streaky and I try
to layer it and I just couldn't get it
to work at all I like the packaging it's
quite easy to apply but I found it to be
quite uncomfortable on the lips and
quite sticky I felt like I just really
aware of being on my lips and I just
couldn't get this to work but I only
have this one quite dark pink shade so
it might be different depending on the
shades I will definitely try some others
and let you know I have a lot of lip
products in this video but the next
one's from Becca and this is the
ultimate colored gloss and I love the
color of this it's like a really soft
peachy pink and I wore this at an event
that I did with Anna and I remember
saying her saying to her does my lip
gloss of karate just like what's gone
really weird and patchy and it like
gathered around the side of my lips and
just looked really patchy so when I
first apply this it was nice but it
didn't last well at all and I hardly
ever have that was lip glosses so that
was really disappointing
the next products from eiko and I'm
actually wearing this today is their new
mascara and it's the sport waterproof
mascara it says catch and curl and this
wasn't the worst mascara ever used I am
wearing it today so it's good enough to
use but I feel like it gives such
natural lashes it's really nothing
special and because it's called catch
and curl I actually found it didn't curl
my
that well and it kind of made my lashes
look thinner than they actually are
which is what mascaras tend to do when I
don't really like them so I think the
packaging is really cool it comes in
this a squidgy tube and the brush is
quite cool as well it's like kind of
curved but the formula I just didn't
really love a couple more products from
eiko and I actually really like the
formula of these this is the me and my
shadow I think this is part of the
lexicon was kind of new range and
they're cream eyeshadows I think that
eyeshadow itself is really good so
there's not like a disappointed product
in itself but on one end is the
eyeshadow and then the other end is a
brush seriously
this brush I don't know what you're
supposed to do with that it's like a
mini paint brush it doesn't blend the
product if that was like a little brush
it would be really good like it'll 2 1 7
type thing or even just a smidge thing
thing this just doesn't really do
anything I don't see the point of it and
it annoyed me and it made me use the
product less just because of that this
next one won't be a surprise to any of
you because I've kind of gone on about
it quite a bit for really bad but it's
the benefit they're real push-up liner
and man I'm so disappointed with this
the whole launch was such a big launch
is meant to like hug your lashes meant
to be really easy to apply the idea is
great gel eyeliner in pencil because
normally gel you need a brush and a pot
and so I really like the idea but I
found that the product came out in a
really awkward way like you can see now
it's come out really far and it's quite
thick formula and then that I could deal
with but when I apply the eyeliner I
found that it flaked throughout the day
and just kind of disappeared which never
happens to me with liquid eyeliner I
also found it quite awkward to use I
just wasn't a fan of this at all which
is a shame there has been mixed
reactions some people love it but for me
this is a no-go just a few more things
now the next one is from Rimmel and it's
their clear brow gel and I love a good
clear brow gel so I thought I'd give
this one a go but and I really didn't
think I could ever be disappointed with
it just a clear brow gel but this one's
really wet I find that too much too much
product comes out in the brush and when
I applied it on my eyebrows I initially
looked like I'd been for a swim my
eyebrows were so wet and I kind of had
to like rub it off and it all got a bit
messy and I can't really bothered for
that self stick to the blink clear brow
gel and give this one a minute next it's
a product from YSL and this looks a bit
like their toosha clap but it's their
radiant to touch all rose
cool so it's kind of like a rose
symmetry version you can use it on the
tops of my cheekbones down your nose or
anisette uses it in the inner corners of
her eye I find this to be a little bit
too sparkly and shimmery I suppose it
would probably work in the inner corners
of your I haven't tried that yet but as
a highlighter it was just too sparkly
and messy and I found that I've got
sparkles all over my face which I'm not
really into the whole shimmery thing so
unlike the tissue cloud which is more
furred in a glow this is definitely more
sparkly okay the final product is from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and it's the kick-ass
concealer in like crayon form I really
like the kick-ass concealer and the
kick-ass powder so I thought give this a
go I like that it's in a crayon form but
that I wouldn't really use a crown under
my eyes I'd use it for spots and the
formula is just too creamy for any kind
blemish it's all right under the eye but
I wouldn't really use a crayon under my
eyes so too creamy it doesn't really
stay and lasts in place I definitely
prefer the pop version which you can
just use a finger for I think it's a
better alternative to this one so those
are all the products that have
disappointed me recently let me know if
you want me to keep collecting these as
I go and let you know which products
kind of don't make the cut I hope this
was helpful to some of you and thanks
for watching
