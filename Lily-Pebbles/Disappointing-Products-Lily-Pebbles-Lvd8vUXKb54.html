well today's video is going to be a
disappointed products video I try out a
lot of beauty products all the time so
naturally I can't love everything and
there's quite a lot of stuff that I'm
disappointed with I've got a big box of
products here and it's not necessarily
stuff that's bad some of it I think is
bad some of it just disappointed me
because I had high hopes and it wasn't
as great as I thought it would be a
little disclaimer of course we all have
different tastes so don't go buy
everything I say you might love some of
these products I'm just gonna grab some
stuff other box I've been collecting
this for like a year now the first thing
is this brush from Mac and Mac pour out
a new set of brushes they were all kind
of really quirky and quite strange and
everyone was a bit fascinated by them
this one is called the oval 3 and it's
meant to be an eye shadow brush it looks
like a toothbrush that's fine I like
weird stuff and happy to give it a go
but I just don't get this I've tried it
and blending that way I mean maybe it's
good if you'll do makeup on other people
but it just doesn't work for me
it doesn't have enough movement it
didn't blend the product nicely I just
couldn't get this to work at all so um
for such like a big exciting launch I
was pretty disappointed with this the
other Henriksen wipes have been spoken
about by so many people before and
although I don't normally use wipes
I thought maybe these were gonna be the
ones to convert me because they're
slightly high-end they've got more like
better ingredients in them and a lot of
people really love them the orange ones
are I think these are refreshing ones
like moisturizing age-defying cleansing
wipes and these ones are the newer
makeup removing wipes I have been using
these I'm not kind of throwing them away
or anything I'm still using them they're
just not as great as I thought they
would be the makeup ones didn't really
remove my eye makeup properly I felt
like I had to drag my eye quite a lot
and the orange ones I just really didn't
like the smell and again they made my
skin feel slightly stripped
I would say that maybe I'm just not a
wipes girl but I've actually found
another set of wipes from the drugstore
that I really like so these ones were
just not my kind of thing I always talk
about the Clarins tan the yellow lotion
you put on cotton wool and put on your
face at night and sleep with it and I
absolutely love that for a facial time
and they recently brought out this one
which is the radiance + golden glow
booster it's a genius idea you just pop
a few drops into your normal moisturize
then you could turn any moisturizer into
a tanning moisturizer it's such a good
idea but I just found that this didn't
work great on me the tan kind of
gathered around my nose and chin and
like eyebrows and it just wasn't as nice
as the other Clarence Tanner that I use
all the time so I'll be giving this one
to my friend and see if she likes it but
for me it was a no-no I wanted to find a
drugs alter native to the Clarins eye
makeup remover that I really like the
one that's like got the blue of the top
and white at the bottom because that
takes off all your eye makeup even
waterproof mascara I wanted to try out
this one which is the Garnier express
two and one eye makeup remover and I
think I've seen someone on YouTube
talked about this I can't remember who
but I was so disappointed to this I've
tried it as many times as I can I know
it looks like I haven't if I have I've
just given up on this one it didn't take
off my eye makeup at all like even when
I'm not wearing waterproof mascara you
have to really use it like a million
times and even then I woke up with
mascara under my eyes the next day so
although this looks similar because it's
got the oil this just didn't work very
well for me at all I absolutely love
ozone so anything new they bring out I
always have very high hopes for it
because I normally fall completely in
love with the new product this one
though is the rare blend infusion
shampoo and the idea of this is it's got
lots of little beads in it I don't if
you can see and this way to exfoliate
your scalp whilst you kind of shampoo
your hair such a good idea but I found
like you can see it hot I've only used
this for like a few washes because I
found it so annoying I found that it was
really hard to wash out the little beads
like you can see them gather in the
shower when you're washing them out but
then afterwards I dried my hair and you
know how long it takes to dry my hair so
after an hour of straightening my hair
I'd then find all these like gritty bits
in my hair and I would really annoy me
so I just found it really hard to wash
out the exfoliating beads it would have
been really good if they kind of burst
and dissolve but I just found they
didn't so that was pretty annoying
benefit I've recently launched their
hydrating tinted lip balms
I have four here in the benebalm the
lolli balm they're all kind of after you
know the tinted things they do for your
cheeks they're the same shades as that I
was really disappointed with these when
I first tried them I kind of opened them
all up and tried them on my hand and
they're all just kind of the same I mean
I get that they're supposed to be sheer
lip balms but for how much they are
I mean look I've just as much as I do
that there's like no
there you know something like the Revlon
lip butters I think of really nice sheer
balms
but these are just too sheer for how
much they cost the orange the red the
pink they all look exactly the same so
for me I think that's a bit of a shame
because it's they look cool it's a nice
new launch but it's just not worth
investing I think now I think some of
you might be surprised with this one I
do a blog post on these it's the YSL
babydoll kiss and blush and I did a
block press when I first tried them and
I was kind of arming a Noreen and wasn't
really sure how I felt about them I
think the idea is great it's basically a
product that you can use as a blusher
and a lip stain which is genius and I
like the packaging it looks cute but I
just really couldn't get this to work
like on my cheeks I found they they
stained in all the wrong places and went
patchy and really hard to work with I
tried with a brush I tried with my
fingers I tried everything and I
couldn't get to work and it's nice on
the lips but I find it quite drying on
the lips and it's just not really the
sort of formula I for wearing on my lips
so as much as I try to love these and I
put them on my dressing-table to try and
make sure I use them every day but you
know you just don't fall in love with
the product and they end up kind of
getting pushed to the side that's what
happened with these I wanted to find a
foundation stick that would double up as
a concealer stick on the go and I've
heard really good things about the
Maybelline fit me range so I went to buy
the foundation sticks I ended up getting
two shades because I kind of they have
this weird thing where it's like two
different colors in it and I wasn't sure
what shade so that was the first thing
that I struggled with was kind of shade
and matching and they were all kind of
funny shades to me so I got home and
tried this and oh this is so bad like
this is so bad it was so greasy and oily
on me it just slipped all over my skin
and I've got like dried dehydrated skin
so if this is oily on me I can't imagine
what it's like on kind of normal to oily
skin I really didn't enjoy this it was
so hard to work with and I've got two
uses I just gave up on it and I must
refer the Bobbi Brown Foundation Stix I
think they're so nice and creamy in the
right way not greasy so this anti shine
stick I actually found to be really
shiny I've spoken about this one briefly
before is the Smashbox full exposure
palette and this came out around the
same time as the Clinique one and
another neutral palette I can't remember
maybe the chocolate one from Too Faced
and this just didn't win and compared to
the others which is so much better it
the idea
is nice it's got a row of shimmer
eyeshadows at the top of row of mattes
and then a really nice brush actually
that comes with it I must take that out
and use it I just found that the
shimmery eyeshadows were more glittery
so they're really hard to work with they
had a lot of like fallout and it just
looked a bit tacky on my eyelids and
then the mattes I found really kind of
creased and clumped in all the wrong
places I don't have oily eyelids but
even if I use an eye primer the mattes
just ended up kind of creasing within
like three hours I just really didn't
like the formula of these so although
the palette looks really pretty and the
shade colors are really lovely and the
quality for me is really important so I
have been using this this next product
is something I picked up when I was in
Milan in Sephora I really like this
brand it's called a boar Ian and I think
they're known for their BB creams and I
picked up this it's the sleeping BB mask
and it says energy blast night mask baby
skin effect so you meant to put it on in
the evening before you go to bed and
wake up with baby skin I liked how this
felt and how it smelt that rhymes yeah
it smells nice and it feels really nice
on the skin it's kind of like a slightly
goopy clear moisturizer but it says
you're gonna wake up with baby skin so I
expect to make up the baby skin and I
tried this every night for weeks
and it just didn't really feel like it
was doing anything different to my skin
and it wasn't cheap so I expect results
so yeah let's just spit disappointed
with the results on this one two more
products then I'm done this one is from
elemental herbology I absolutely love
this brand
I love the cleansing balm and they have
a really nice scrub actually everything
I've tried from them I loved apart from
this which is their harmonizing cleanse
so this is a cleansing oil and I love
oils because they take off makeup really
well but I found this one didn't take
off my makeup at all which was bizarre
I don't understand what's in it because
any oil would take off a makeup well but
this one just didn't take it looks like
I haven't used any I promise I have I
really have it just some reason isn't
going down but it doesn't take off my
makeup at all which I find so
frustrating I'm not going to take my
makeup off separately and then use a
cleansing oil it's just too many steps
so for me like I used this for a couple
of weeks every night and I just didn't
really enjoy it it made my skin feel
quite nice but the fact that it doesn't
remove makeup well is just too much of a
disappointment finally I have a product
from by Terry and this
is the blush glaze and these look really
cute it looks like the bomb de Rose
which is a lip balm I really really love
and it has like a little lid on it and
then it looks like this it's a little
bit messy so it's like a liquid blush
and these look really nice the color
pops the shades look really beautiful in
the packaging but the thing with this is
you put it on maybe I can show you let's
see how messy this gets so the color
looks like that in the pots which is
like a really pretty bright pink but
then when you put it on the skin let me
show you it kind of like shears out
pretty much nothing I mean for how much
this costs I mean it kind of looks pink
now but when I put it on my cheek it's
so sheer you can hardly see the color at
all
which is fine sheer blushes are nice but
this is such an expensive product so I
mean maybe for people who are really
committed to buy Terry this is just a
nice sheer blush and it doesn't cost
that much for them to buy it but for
someone who just like to browse around
space and K if you were to see this and
buy it I think you'd be disappointed
when you get home because it's just a
really really sheer liquid that doesn't
really show up in your skin it's a nice
idea but it just wasn't for me I really
didn't enjoy it so that's everything I
know it seems like a lot but if you
think about how much stuff I test and
this is being like gathering for about a
year
obviously I can't love everything so
unfortunately there are some bits that
kind of don't meet the car hopefully
this was helpful to you though if you
were thinking about trying some of those
products if there was something you
really had your heart set on try anyway
don't just listen to me this is just my
opinion but hopefully this video hasn't
made you feel too down it's a bit like a
negative video I'll see you guys in my
next one and thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
