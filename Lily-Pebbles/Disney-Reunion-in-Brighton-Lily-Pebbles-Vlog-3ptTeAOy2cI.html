the mess we have made is ridiculous but
the weather is kind of funny like it's
raining now but the weather forecast
says it's gonna be sunny and then
Bryson's always kind of quite cold and
windy cuz you're by the sea so we're
kind of taking two different wardrobes

worse than when it's really nice and
sunny and all you have is like warm
clothes with you so I'm trying to take a
bit of both we need to hurry up because
we're gonna head over to Victoria and
Alex to pick them up and then we're

stumps in that case in which has taken

edge of our cinnamon in a car which is
crazy it's like two hours to get to

sandwich Pinecrest and three and would

gonna find his way back but hopefully he
will when he cared wheeler we're just
kidding I like make ourselves ready do
makeup and a little bit concealer then
look for we're tired and we just saw
Leon outside so we're gonna like hit the

face that's weird I need to redo my
makeup we've got about half an hour
until we're gonna go out for the evening
so I'm gonna change my makeup and my
outfit just up my hair spit wind swept
at the moment and I thought I'd show you
what I bought this is the highlighter
from Kevyn Aucoin it's called
starlight and it's quite different for
highlights of me cuz quite pink and
sparkly but I thought it was really
pretty when i swatched it and i thought
it'd make a nice eye shadow as well I
really wanted the Nas eyeshadow from the
new Christopher came that connection I
think Tati spoke about it in a video but
they were sold out in space and came
Brighton which is a shame I'm gonna keep
looking out for the other thing that's
really pretty it's like a peachy
glittery eyeshadow quite different to
anything else I have so I need to stop
chassis now and get ready we're ready to
go which is wearing his November night
top again you love that top and I am
wearing actually mine too Anna wearing
the Topshop shorts and it's pretty
casual but legs out so it's like a mix
