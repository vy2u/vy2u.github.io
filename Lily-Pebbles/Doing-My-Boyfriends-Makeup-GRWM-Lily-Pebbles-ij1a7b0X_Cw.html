little bit of a different video because
it's the 13th that's not perfect 50
brothers of December is New Year's Eve
and we're going to a party tonight a
small party a little gathering with
friends that we do every year and this
year we decided to do fancy dress and
the theme was famous couples it could be
past present dead or alive and the first
thing that came to our heads was Russell
Brand and Katy Perry but that way around
I've already got rich as nails he's
gonna be Katy Perry he's but I've got
black nails I don't know why we decided
to do it the other way around but we
thought it would be a bit funny oh
really and you know I've got the right
hair for Russell Brand
to be honest I've got all the clothes
for it I don't think I'm gonna look very
different I'm just gonna have a beard
rich it's gonna look beautiful
it's literally been my dream to do
Richard's makeup so my dream is coming
true today and I can't wait how you
feeling really a headache where's your
beer over there we've got to get in
sometimes like half to five time you get
to the end of this video I'll be Russell
Brand Richard Lee Katy Perry and I think
I'm gonna start with me I'm just gonna
do my makeup do a beard and then I'll
invite rich back on the camera and we'll
turn him into the beautiful Katy Perry I
can't wait for you guys to see the
outfit so you can go and have some fun
Thanks I'm gonna go drink you know
anything if I actually quite like my
hair and makeup today but I'm gonna
completely destroy it and I don't really
know what I'm gonna do to make myself
look like Russell Brand we haven't
planned this out very well but I think
I'm just gonna back home my hair putting
loads of volume and make my eyebrows
bigger and put on a looser black
eyeliner and then put on a beard so
that's the plan
let's do eyebrows first and I'm gonna
just beef up those brows I'm just gonna
draw on like a whole nother line
underneath or if my friends won't even
notice that the browser's have changed
because my brows are so big I'm drawing
all the way around the eyebrows that
look for one brow and then I'm gonna do
the same for the other one at least this
way you won't be able to see how bad
getting my eyebrows
my god that's horrendous okay eyebrows
done now I've got a makeup from a black
eyeliner and I'm just gonna put that all
the way around my eye and then just
smudge it out I'm just gonna like put it
on anyway
he just looks a little bit like grimy
really that's all grateful just smudge
it with my finger make it look really
messy yeah I think that I'll do I'm
gonna use my contour just to go to all
the cheekbones a little bit which will
make my face look a bit skinnier like
his and then just do the beard under
there okay so now for the beard
I'm gonna use my sister's face painting
kit basically got like loads of colours
in there and then a sponge oh I really
hate sponges this is a really great one
but it's like quite a holy sponge
certainly think it would look quite like
a beard I probably got a wet it wets it
for me please
your nails are dry oh my god this boys
making such a fuss about nails he's like
I can't my nail okay wet sponge so he's
got like a beard one-eyed beers it goes
like a massage and then a gap okay let's
do this beard oh my god men spirits go
like down their neck don't they oh I
don't like having a beard already
complained which is gonna have a full
face of makeup soon alright miss - oh
gee what's going hair all over your face
not sure kind of dude okay cool they've
done didn't we know what to do with my
hair but I've kind of called it in the
photos but he's got a curly messy hair
so I thought I put like all major a
texturizing spray and like a back
combing
comb so I don't really know how to use
back combing I'm just gonna try and like
mess it up alright come on
I think that's me kind of done for now I
think we should get started on Rich's
makeup personally you ready okay I'm not
really gonna be in this shot much
because I'm doing rich makeup but we're
now gonna make him into Katy Perry we've
got a blue wing we couldn't find a pink
wig we've got a blue one from Tiger and
it was cheap we thought we just stick to
the cheap one your nails a dry you don't
have to like funny poor Amit I actually
don't have very Katy Perry appropriate
makeup well I
bubblegum pink lips or anything like
that we had to buy fake lashes so
hopefully the rest I've got some stuff
so I'm gonna put foundation on you doing
or what yes because I think it a little
bit I won't put too much I promise you
owe me so much for this don't scrunch up
your face I'm actually feel I got
addicted to make a part of this this is
very complimentary on your skin which I
have to say I'm really annoyed you have
a beet it's not gonna work
concealer and look up no no look at me
and just your eyes up any ice look at
top of my head let's speak to you like a
child choice dry under eyes yeah all
right really black
using me bleaching my face was here way
to your fake lashes oh I didn't even
wear them look you agree to this I know
nothing's really coming out on your skin
I'm gonna contour oh yeah look at those
cheekbones what's happening I'm
contouring baby see this is like this is
like Kim Kardashian contour going on
here so stick into your beard so we have
to go by my parents house tonight and
genuinely can't wait for rich have to go
into my parents
a dress and makeup you own me marry you

pop of pink

on some champagne pop champagne pop this
cake you know look at that highlight on
fleek what I like on complete what does
that mean they're like Netflix and chill
we all get it all love oh I'm gonna
start with my lorac unzipped palette
okay close your eyes don't scrunch like
triangle to me those eyes but like raise
your eyebrows that they like stretch
debating quite quickly eyelids this but
I was it as like eyeball Pilates
okay hold palette hold the palette and
then I've got I've got the Urban Decay
vice palette this is probably the only
like colorful palette I have oh yeah
there's a beautiful pink you doing like
a tick I will and then I'm gonna do you
hurt my balls stops crunching did I hurt
it just not used to it open your eyes
look at me normally okay look here she
crying my eyeliner

I need you to look up it was really hard
it's not a different look one day yeah
but soon as anything goes do you always

make pasta they say look at this ear ooh
okay now look at this one is natural
Linney it's not look come here look at
the microwave who's he looking oh so
you've got pink on the top and green on
the bottom and I think looks great I'm
gonna do some liquid eyeliner please God
help me if I can
this ain't gonna work it is there's your
eyes just keep them closed that's like
cold cooling after scratching I wouldn't
normally curl your lashes but there's no
way you're gonna let me do that I need
you to open your eyes but look at my
shoulder oh my god this is always been
my dream I finally it's that mascara
I don't fit you fake lashes as far as it
would be I think you're I think you
won't actually enjoy your evening okay
so I need you to look at the top drawer
the only pink thing I have is if it's
for lip peanut cream and a Chanel lip
gloss just like this just like don't
close your eye and smile just relax just
relax
take those just quick yep yep oh my god
beautiful should I go get your wink you
try it on yeah okay I've got the week my
mouth now we couldn't find one that
actually looked like Katy Perry this was
kind of close enough
you kind of got it one-sided like one's
over my ear
alright you did your nails dry now so
you could you feel like my man it's been
stripped yeah I put on my outfit I've
tried to juice up my hair with a
hairbrush it keeps going flat I've got
my beard need to retouch it a bit
this necklace is from Claire's
accessories my t-shirts in Primark
waistcoat from Primark I'm wearing
ripped jeans and boots and I kind of
look like me as I surprised this is very
weird how similar we look I think it's
just the beard that's separating us but
when I'm standing next to my Katy Perry
I think it'd be obvious so now we need
to get rich dressed and I don't think
he's gonna be happy about it
also a bit worried about how much these
eyebrows look like mine I've drawn them
on so much thicker and I swear they just
look like my eyebrows here this is the
dress that we got in the sale at new
look believe it or not rich fits into a
large it's strapless we're gonna have to
fill the boobs a bit it's got a bit of
an inbuilt bra very pretty I'm fortunate
we couldn't find size 11 high heels
surprisingly and whilst if we get for
you we got you a gorgeous necklace to go
with it that's very Katy Perry that was
in the sale I think also a new look and
from Claire's we've got a pink bow to go
in his blue wig introducing for one
night only
the barefoot wonder that is
miss Katy Perry oh it's the necklace of
it the next limit in the hairy chest
you're gonna fill the boobs but feel
nice rich kind of fill them want that
stretchy this is amazing
right we need yet join the power I need
to get drunk so that was the get ready
with me and I hope you guys enjoyed it
we're gonna go and have fun Year's Eve I
