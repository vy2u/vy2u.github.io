video on YouTube to celebrate I thought
I'd finally do a draw my life video and
tell you a little bit about what's gone
on so far so the story starts before I
was born when a 30-something couple told
their two daughters Jojo and Carly that
they were expecting another baby me
my lovely sisters who was seven and ten
decided it was time to run away but
luckily they didn't get far with their
suitcase full of cuddly toys and snacks
I think they just about made it down the
stairs
I was born three weeks late in 1987 in
the bath in a hospital being three weeks
late men I was born with very dry skin
so the Indian Midwife gave me a massage
with almond oil and I'm pretty sure this
is where my love for pampering began
it's the people in my life that define
me so let's start with the two friends
I've known since day one Jake and Hannah
Hannah lived next door and only one year
older than me she likes to take credit
for my existence to be fair my mom did
go around to meet her and thought well
maybe I could just have one more she was
a very cute baby
Jake was my wingman we do everything
together and I love going on holidays
with him one night in Scotland when we
were only three and four we stayed up
past midnight dancing jumping up and
down with huge smiles on our faces
I grew up with a pet dog called Bugsy
she had really curly hair just like me
and my dad and when she was little she
had to have her hip removed I'll never
forget that because when she ran down
the road in the wind her leg would flap
up in the air that's supposed to be a
leg by the way
it was at nursery where I met my friend
Deb's we used to lie to the teacher and
somehow blag our way into the sand pit
every day when we were meant to be
taking turns with the other kids we will
cease to steal the teachers biscuits
we never went to the same school after
nursery but always stayed incredibly
close I was very lucky and I went on
some amazing family holidays to France
America Disney and I have some really
special memories from a holiday in
Antigua in the Caribbean when I was
about six or seven now looking back I
know it's a holiday we took after my
grandpa died but at the time it was just
a really fun holiday and I got to miss
some days of school one day we came
across some washed up sea turtles and we
helped get them back into the sea
another day my sister got stung by a
Portuguese man-of-war and it wrapped
itself around her arms and for years
after you could still see the marks
under a UV light so let's talk about
big-girl school or primary school as
most of us call it and this is where I
met my next group of friends Keisha was
in my class green class and Jenny was in
blue class where all the older more
developed kids were and esterday was in
the class for slightly younger kids we
joke about how her class was still in
nappies we had so much fun together in
school we'd go back to each other's
houses almost every day laughs all the
time and we'd get into trouble in the
playground we had a gang called bad and
we used to fall over on purpose to get
plasters from the nurses room classes
were like treasurer to us I was a shy
girl but not with my friends we'd stand
on the steps and perform Spice Girls
songs we challenged the boys and try and
beat them at sports girl power was
literally our life motto
we started a girls football team and our
dads helped us get proper football kits
for the school and after training every
Tuesday morning at 7:00 a.m. we won the
local league we were so happy
I was always writing in my diary before
bed I kept a diary from the age of 10 to
16 it's so funny to read now but I love
that it has so many memories in there
I remember having some great birthday
parties my dad had a video camera and he
loved filming all of our birthdays and
holidays so I've watched them back many
times one year I had an animal party
where I had a Python snake around my
neck another year I had a swimming party
and all my friends came no inflatables
in the water and one time I had an
ice-skating party and I asked all my
friends to come dressed as punks
secondary school was a weird experience
for me I never really felt like I fit in
with the other girls but I also wasn't
great at the academic side of things so
I didn't really know where I fit in I
spent a lot of time in the art room
despite being terrible at drawing
clearly and I loved being part of the
jazz choir where we performed proper
concerts once a year in a big London
theater I always took part in school
musicals and I had a couple of lead
roles too I still spent a lot of time
with my friends outside of school by
this time I'd met Gemma and we spent
every summer on camp together we have so
many funny stories as we really went
through the awkward teenage days
together
this was my first experience of real
bullying not just teasing
I admired Gemma strength and always
stuck by her and tried to be the best
friend I could I couldn't wait for
school to be over and I never wanted to
apply for uni my career's teacher
convinced me to apply for one course at
least so I begrudge and he did and
although I didn't get the grades I
needed I still got it so I had an
unconditional offer to Birmingham City
University and I knew I wanted to take a
year out after 18 years of studying I
wanted to take time out to explore the
world grow up a bit and meet new people
I worked in Gap Kids for four months to
pay for my flight around the world and
then set off in January I travelled from
London to Australia for a month and then
to Thailand for a month and members to
Fiji and LA on the way home I met loads
of people ate the best food learnt how
to surf so amazing sunsets snorkeled and
visited some of the best beaches in the
world I got back just in time to see my
sister and brother-in-law get married in
South France so then it was time to
start uni I was so nervous and I didn't
know one single person go into my uni
but my flatmates were really friendly
and after a big cry I let my parents go
home I was really homesick for the first
week and nearly dropped out but I'm glad
I stuck it out
on the first day we had to line up and
register in a room full of desks I sat
next to a curly-haired boy with glasses
he looked fully equipped with a pencil
case so when I realized I didn't have a
pen I asked him if I could borrow one my
curly hair in gappiya tan must have
confused him as he heard Spanish and
replied with care that was just the
start of rich in his rich isms uni was
great I got stuck into my marketing
advertising and PR course and met loads
of cool people I built up my confidence
presenting my work and I was excited to
finally be doing well at something rich
and I became official at our
University's Christmas board it also
happened to be my birthday and my friend
surprised me with a cake I was so drunk
that I cried with happiness so many cool
things happened over those three years
my first nephew Bailey was born and I
became an auntie Hannah won a free trip
to New York and took me we had the best
time I moved in with my two friends J
and JC in third year and never knew
living with two boys could be so fun and
easy it was in that house that J helped
me start my blog that I called what I
heart today J was the perfect creative
partner and still to this day six years
on even though he lives in Germany he
helps me develop my blog design he was
the genius behind my Lilly pebbles
makeover
I loved uni were the first which was
something I never ever thought could
happen and I know I owe a lot to rich
for helping and supporting me throughout
the three years I immediately launched
myself into work experience and I wanted
to gain as much as furious as possible
and add it to my CV I'd worked in
production companies in between uni
years but now I wanted a try PR I worked
in PR agencies phoning journalists and
sending out products I also landed
myself an internship in the Selfridges
head office although it wasn't for me so
I went on to try something else
I worked for a bit of music licensing
finding music to place in adverts and
then I found a job opportunity in a
beauty box company on Twitter this was
my first jump into the beauty world and
I started as an intern and was only the
third person to join the company so I
could really get stuck in after a year
and a half I'd worked my way up to
marketing manager but by this point my
blog was doing quite well and I was
spending all my free time working
blog posts and videos from a relatively
new YouTube channel in 2012 my nephew
ASA and my niece honey were born I
literally love being an auntie I was
going to blogger events about once a
week and it was at a lipstick launch
that I first met Anna she worked in a
job that was pretty much the same as
mine and we instantly bonded over our
split work blog life I never thought I'd
meet someone in my twenties that was so
similar to me it was at this point I saw
a job opportunity on Twitter at gleam
futures I went to meet the founder Dom
in a small office it was just him and
one other person working there after
chatting for ages we both realized that
working at gleam wasn't for me but
instead he encouraged me to stick with
the YouTube thing and I think this was
the final push I needed I decided in
October 2013 to leave my job and try
blogging and blog being full-time I was
living at home with my parents so it
felt like a good time to do it rich was
very nervous about the decision and no
one really knew what I was thinking I
started working really hard on my blog
and YouTube putting all my time and
effort into it I set myself a 3-month
goal and told myself I'd find a job if
it didn't work out my stats grew I
started making a good income and it was
the first time I felt really passionate
about something Anna had also been
contemplating leaving her job and when
faced with an ultimatum she took on
blogging full-time and we began this
crazy journey together in summer 2015
rich and I moved into our first place
and at 28 years old it's fair to say I
was more than ready we spent a month or
so doing the place up and on August 14th
when I thought we were going to paint
samples on the wall rich asked me to
marry him and I
and empty home of course I said yes so
that kind of brings me up to date
working hard and enjoying what I do
planning my wedding and marrying my
boyfriend of eight years I'm forever
grateful for the support from you guys
and I genuinely feel like we have our
own secret internet club there not
everyone really understands who knows
what the future holds but life's been
great so far
so let's keep going and see what happens
thanks so much for watching guys I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
