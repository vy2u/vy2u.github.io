another beauty video and I really hope
you all enjoyed my Nana's guide to
blogging and vlogging series if you
haven't seen it I will link the playlist
below but thank you all so much for your
comments and tweets and everything that
kind of supported the little series
because you put a lot of hard work into
it and it was really nice to see all
your reactions so for today's video I'm
going to be doing a beauty drugstore
haul and if you weren't already aware
this month on my website is no money
month so I am strictly talking drugstore
affordable beauty products so head over
there if you haven't seen some of the
posts already and if I've done any
reviews or posts on any of these
products that are about to talk about I
will link them all below so don't forget
to check the description box sorry if
any Fuzzle in background noise but it is
absolutely pissing down with rain
outside it's horrible weather in the UK
so if you hear any noise it's the rain
sorry so got quite a few bits in this
haul because I wanted to stock up in
some products to write about this month
for my website so I'm going to start
with makeup and firstly things are
foundations and I find shopping for
Foundation and the drugstore pretty hard
not just because of color matching but
it's just they're always out of stock
whenever I find a product I like they're
never stopped and the shelves or in the
drawers below so I find it really
frustrating but I picked up two
foundations the first one is the Rimmel
match perfection and I think this is one
of Tanya bird's favorite foundations and
she has really good taste so I thought
I'd go and try it out as you can see the
color looks a little bit pale for me I
ended up getting ivory because I think
there was one called classic ivory which
is the shade up they were out of stock
and I've read wants to try it so this is
slightly too light for me but I can kind
of bronze up my skin with bronzer it has
an SPF of 18 in it which is quite good
and I like this it's kind of medium to
full coverage I'm going to use it a few
times but it was really nice compared to
that other drugstore foundations I have
it's definitely one of the better ones
and I'm going to keep using this and see
how I get on and I'm sure it will pop up
on the blog somewhere the next
foundation I got is the Rimmel wake me
up foundation and this has really mixed
reviews some people say it's fast you
shimmery and get sorry some people say
it's gorgeous
and glowy and I don't like
packaging it just doesn't appeal to me
at all but yeah it says anti-fatigue
effect and radiant glow this has SPF 15
in it as well so that's really good as
you can see this compared to this the
colors are just crazy this one looks way
more orange but there are a lot more
color shades in this foundation there
weren't that many to pick from and this
one lines up going going for ivory which
I think the lighter shade which is crazy
for this to be the lighter shade in the
range but I'm gonna use this a couple of
times and it's quite hard to kind of
have a decision on it yet when I went
outside and looked in the mirror it
didn't look that crazy glittery to me I
don't mind a little bit of shimmer if it
kind of makes my skin look glowy it was
easy to blend quite nice coverage but I
need to try it more to have like a
proper decision on it I also picked up a
couple of concealers the first one is
Maybelline instant anti age the eraser
eye and I've seen quite a few people on
YouTube talked about this it comes in
this little tube and on the top is a
sponge and then you turn it to get the
product out and it comes out with a
sponge I know a lot of people pull the
sponge out and then just kind of use it
on the back of their hand but I wanted
to use it with the sponge because it was
obviously put there for a reason and it
is quite nice to use you kind of turn it
it clicks and then you just kind of put
it under your eyes and it feels quite
nice with the foam it's definitely not a
genic but I know it's just me using it
so don't really mind about that the
concealers a little bit too shared for
me it is nice and brightening under the
eye but I just with my dark circles I
didn't really feel like it covered
enough I'm gonna give it another go
though because I mean used it a couple
of times but so far not my favorite
drugstore concealer I also picked up the
soap &amp;amp; Glory kick-ass concealer and I
love the powder that goes alongside this
so I really wanted to try it it
basically opens up and it has two
concealers and then I has a powder to
set them and I think that is such a nice
little kongo especially good to put your
hand back because there's such creamy
concealers you can just use your finger
to apply them so on the this side on the
left side there's a peachy shade so
that's really good for under your eyes
if you have any dark circles and this
side is a more kind of greeny shade and
that's good for any redness around your
nose on your chin so that's a really
good concealer it does remind me a
little bit of the Bobbi Brown corrector
and conceal it's a really
creamy I did feel like I had to build it
up quite a bit to get the coverage I
wanted and it does kind of move around a
bit so if you have oily skin this one
isn't for you but if your dry skin it's
nice because it is really kind of
moisturizing and the palette is great I
already have that and love it's just a
translucent powder so any kind of skin
tone can use it I really happy with this
one so far but I got a few more makeup
it's I also went to super drug and
picked up one of the sleek map Me's
these have also had really mixed reviews
I know immediately Anna loves these but
I know Anna from yoga does makeup really
didn't like them so I don't know
everyone has a kind of different opinion
there's supposed to be like a matte lip
like a type thing I haven't actually
used this yet my try not my hand though
didn't look right Matt so I'm interested
to see I need to find a day where I'm at
home and I don't like testing lipsticks
and I know I'm going out because it ends
up being a disaster I'm out with
disastrous lipstick so I'm gonna try
this tomorrow and I'll let you guys know
what I think of it I also picked up a
blush from Revlon and this is one of
their matte blushes I think matte
blushes are really nice to use if you
have a lot of kind of smokey eye or bold
lip going on and you just need a little
bit of color but nothing too crazy and
this is in blushing Barry I love berry
tones I think they really suit my skin
tone I'm really struggling to open this
there you go so it looks like this it's
just a kind of neutral tone down berry
shade and I really like this if you are
looking for a good matte blusher I
definitely recommend this one it reminds
me a bit of my nas blushes again I
haven't use it that many times but when
I have I've enjoyed it so far I also got
a mascara and I don't I don't know
everyone seems to be obsessed to
drugstore mascaras but I find it really
hard to find nice ones I've tried so
many that just don't do anything to my
lashes but this one came quite highly
recommended it's the Max Factor full
splash effect um just like this this is
the black one and I look to the brush
before I bought it and it is a huge kind
of plastic brush a little bit like
making me favorite clinic mascara so it
definitely wanted to give it a go and I
do quite like it's one of the better
ones I've tried I feel like you need to
put quite a blog work into a layer and
layer
to get like full long lashes I would say
it was good but I'm not obsessed with it
on my favorite I'm going to keep
searching for the best drugstore mascara
but I love Maybelline the rocket and
falsies and soap &amp;amp; Glory
mascara are there any good ones but I
want to try some new ones so this one
hasn't crazy impressed me I also got a
couple of skincare bits and I think
there's some really good skincare
drugstore products out they just have to
search for them first one though I
wasn't that too impressed with saying
that I really wanted to try this the
L'Oreal Paris skin and perfection and
this is kind of like a Bioderma dupe so
it's just a cleansing water that you can
use to remove your eye makeup or your
makeup on your face whatever you want
really I went to the competitor by derma
I am doing a post on it I don't if it's
gone up already but I'll link it below
if I have and I don't know it look first
of all look how much I have used that
I've used this twice the packaging is
ridiculous it all kind of just squirts
out like there's no filter on there so
you use way more products and you waste
so much product compared to Bioderma
I also find that this is a little bit
more oily Biderman literally feels like
water but is this you're kind of left
with a bit of an oily residue and my
phone if you put too much on cotton wool
when you do your eyes it can sting a
little bit so I don't love that I like
the fact that Bioderma feels like
there's nothing in it whereas this feels
like there's got some kind of funky
ingredients in there and I think it is
good and it's definitely easy to get
hold of them Bioderma so I would
recommend if you wanted to try something
like Bioderma but you didn't want to
like import it or anything well they're
Bioderma is getting easier to get hold
of now especially in London
it's alright not blown away definitely
still prefer Bioderma but I'm glad I
tried this and I think we're gonna
finish a pretty student because the
stuff I go through it quickly I was also
on the hunt for a good drugstore mask
and I came across this one in super drug
it's from their own brand and it's the
distressing
aloe vera face mask and it's a mud mask
so it comes out as I could quite thick
green consistently like a cream and it
instantly feels really cooling on the
skin that's what I really like about it
when you're putting it on wear this with
a brush or your hands it feels really
cooling and calming on your skin and
then you leave it on for like 10-15
minutes and it's hard and remove it with
water
muslin cloth and I feel like it wasn't
too hard to remove either
I love the origins masks but I've never
been that much of a fan of the clay
origins masked nose not just everyone
else's because I find it really hard to
remove and I end up tugging my skin and
my skin looks red by the end of it
because it's so hard to get the clay off
resist what I feel like it's creamy and
as you're removing it kind of kind of
rubbing it into a skin and it feels
really nice and moisturizing and calming
and distressing so I really like this
and it's something crazy like three
pounds so I definitely recommend this
and I think this is a new range for
super drugs as well for body bits I
picked up one thing and I knew that I
wanted to get this came highly
recommended from my friend Amelia and
it's a Vaseline spray and go body
moisturizer I went for the alone fresh
scent because the other forms like cocoa
butter and quite strong scents and I
don't really like using body products
with a really strong scent because I
like to put on perfume so I went for
this one and it's a really cool
packaging if the lid clicks open so you
don't have to like worry about losing in
it
and then you just literally spray it
onto your arm and rub it in and it's
like the easiest body moisturizer ever
one of my new year's resolutions are put
the post below or it'll it's about my
butene year's resolutions was to use
kind of body products more because I
have so many and I never use them and I
think something like this will encourage
me to use it more because it's just so
easy and quick I don't like to stand
around off from her shower I'd like to
get into my warm cozy pajamas so this is
really quick to use spray rub in and
you're done so definitely recommend this
happy with it so far I was so into
Sally's I luckily have one quite near to
my house so I popped in to see what they
had and I got a couple of things for my
hair I noticed the Palmers olive oil
range and olive oil it is amazing for
your hair I've made like a DIY home mask
with olive oil and it worked really well
that made my hair really soft so I
thought I'd try these they were really
cheap and really affordable this is the
Palmers olive oil formula with vitamin E
replenishing conditioner so it says
smooths and teams are really frizz prone
hair this was in the afro hair section
and I have crazy curly frizzy hair so I
definitely need two products like this
sometimes they can be a bit too heavy I
probably wouldn't use this every time I
wash my
and maybe every other time and just from
like the mid-length so that ends but
this is a really nice condition I'm
gonna use it once and I really liked it
so I'm looking forward to kind of
finishing this hopefully I also bought
to go alongside that the conditioning
olive oil spray oil and this looks
really interesting because it literally
looks like olive oil in a bottle it says
it has keratin in it though which is
really good for making your hair kind of
better condition protecting it and
making it soft
there's no sulfates no parabens just
there's like a really good product I
haven't used this yet it's a bit
intimidating I feel like I'm gonna get
really oily hair but I'm gonna give it a
go and hopefully it'll be good smells
good smells like you can eat it so yeah
the final product that I got from
Sally's is from elegant touch and it's
the rapid drive for nails with 50min E
and this is like a quick dry spray so
you paint your nails do the top coat and
then you just spray this on it's like
it's aerosol now I'm gonna like choke to
death though this is really good if
you're in a rush and you need to now
strike quickly
I find that Seche vite the top coat I
use dries pretty quickly anyway so if
I'm just at homes you my nails and the
safer probably wouldn't bother but if
I'm in a rush or I'm out and about doing
my nails on the go then this is amazing
because it does make your nails dry in
like ten seconds I do find that it kind
of mattified them a bit you lose a bit
of the shine which is a shame but it's
worth it if you don't want your nest as
much I tried this and I put my hand
straight in my handbag and they didn't
chip or smudge which is amazing so
that's everything from my Beauty
drugstore haul I hope you enjoyed seeing
when I picked up and definitely head
over to my website if you like drugstore
affordable products because that's all
I'm talking about this month and I have
