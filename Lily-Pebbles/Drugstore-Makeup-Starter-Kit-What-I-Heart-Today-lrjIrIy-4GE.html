my drugstore makeup starter kit I did a
blog post a while ago called an
introduction to makeup and this is quite
similar to that but I've got a few
different options for each category and
it's pretty much just my favorite
products from the high street so I've
got loads to talk about first up is
foundation and I have two favorites the
first one is the Revlon nearly naked
foundation which is still quite a new
launch and I really like this it's a bit
annoying that doesn't come with a pump
but it's a really nice lightweight
foundation it's really kind of light and
jewy which is the sort of foundation I
normally go for it also has SPF 20 in it
I really like this foundation I think
Revlon did really well with this one I
also really like the Bourjois healthy
mix serum the radiance reveal which is
the new one I think they reformulated
they also put in new packaging this one
does come with a pump I really like this
one this would be my favorite out of the
two they're quite similar but because
there's kind of quite a serum you
texture I feel like it's really nice it
feels a bit like the wire sell it a
tease your cloud foundation I use my
hands to blend this in and I just really
like it for a nice kind of summer Julie
finish but still kind of gives good
coverage I don't like when foundations
are to sheer but I also don't like when
they're heavy so this is perfect for
concealer I have one option because I'm
not a fan of the collection mm lasting
perfection concealer but everyone else's
I find it really cakey and drying on my
skin so the one that I've been enjoying
recently is the Rimmel wake me up
concealer I haven't actually tried the
foundation and to go alongside this I
really should let me know if you guys
have a whether you like it or not but
the concealer is really nice the shades
are a little bit dodgy the one I have
which is soft beige is quite orange and
quite peachy for me but I can make it
work I just really like the texture
they're really easy to blend they last
well and they don't look cakey or dry at
all they're really kind of moisturizing
and it comes with a little dopher
applicator as well so I really like the
room will wake me up concealer for
bronzer I have one option I found it
really hard to find a good drugstore
bronzer I was trying a lot but I do
really like this one which is the one I
picked and it's the bourgeois bronzing
powder it's the one that looks like
chocolate and apparently smells like
chocolate but I think it smells like
plastic don't smell it I wouldn't
recommend it but it's a really nice
bronzer that comes in two shades I've
got the lighter one and this is really
good if you find that NARS lagoon is a
little bit too orange for you I think
you'd like this one it's quite similar
to the
bronzing powder it's a bit lighter and
softer but also you can build it up and
contour with it I just think it's a
really nice light bronzing powder for
blushes I've got one powder and one
cream my favorite drugstore powder
blusher I've had this for years
it's from the natural collection which
is weird because I don't really buy
anything from the natural collection but
their blushes are really good
this one is Peach Melba but they've got
loads of shades and they're all really
nice kind of soft pink shades I just
think these are really good they're
really pigmented they're really soft and
easy to blend and I'm a big fan of these
blushes I've had this one for ages I
should probably check it out and get a
new one but it's lasting really well for
cream blushes I think you know what I'm
going to say it's the Max Factor miracle
touch creamy blush in soft pink I
absolutely love this flusher and the
packaging is awful but the product
inside is amazing really soft easy to
blend it doesn't go to powdery when you
put on the skin I really wasn't a fan of
the new bourgeois cream blushes I felt
like as soon as you put them on your
cheek they go really chalky powdery and
really hard to blend with your finger
but this was really easy to blend it
feels a little bit her lip balm and
because of that because it's a little
bit stickier lasts really well if you do
have slightly oily skin you may want to
get a powder and I always recommend
getting a translucent powder because I
feel like you can get the coverage from
your foundation and concealer but if you
then add on a colored powder you can
look a little bit heavy and cakey so I
always go for translucent and use a
powder just to make sure my makeup stays
put and so I don't get shiny throughout
the day so the two that I'd recommend
and the first one is the Rimmel stay
matte powder I really like this have
used it for years this is the
translucent one or transparent they call
it in 0:01
really nice powder I haven't really got
bad thing to say about it doesn't look
powdery at all when you put on the skin
and the second one is I think slightly
more expensive it's a soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a blot and these are really
similar just feel them in store and see
which one you prefer and this one may be
slightly more finely milled which means
it kind of looks less powdering it's
kind of a bit of a softer powder but
they're both really nice I really like
this is the one I'm using at the moment
so now onto eyes I've got cream shadow
and I've got powder shadows for the
cream you know which one I'm going to
say there's nothing better on the high
street than this and it's a Maybelline
Color tattoo 24 hour and
on and on bronze I absolutely love this
I recommend it to everybody comes in a
little pot it's a nice bronzy color you
can use your finger to apply it and put
on a really sheer wash of color or you
can just keep packing it on build up to
a really kind of deep bronzy color and
because it's cream it lasts really well
and you can use it as a base under
eyeshadows or on its own it's really
versatile product and I absolutely love
this for powder I have two pallets that
I found I was on the hunt for the best
pallets and I couldn't pick between
these two I really liked them both first
one is some soap &amp;amp; Glory and it slid
stuff this isn't that affordable it's
about 10 pounds it's quite expensive for
the drugstore but it comes with four
really nice shades it's one of those
palettes that you know you're where all
the colors inside so these are the four
colors you get a dark matte Brown a
light highlighting color kind of peachy
all over the lid color and then a
shimmery taupe ones and I think is all
really nice they can get a little bit
chalky you kind of have to play around
with it but I really like that I think
the shade selection is just perfect I've
also got this one from Revlon which is
called naturally glamorous 0:20 and
these are kind of funny shape palettes
they open to the side but I looked at
this and then when i swatched them in
store I was blown away they're really
creamy and buttery they're less chalking
than a soap &amp;amp; Glory I do think the
texture of these is better but I just
really like the color selection in the
serving boy one so I wanted to put them
both in but in this one you get five
colors you get a few different bronzy
shades and one orange e one and we'll
brown one and a more shimmery one you
get a really nice light highlighter
color in the middle and then a really
kind of deep dark brown that you can use
on that outer corner and blend it in
I think this palette would create the
best Brown smoky eye and as I said the
quality of the eyeshadows are amazing
this is really good for traveling I'm
definitely going to take this one away
with me I really like it for eyeliners
I've got a couple of options if you like
black liquid eyeliner I definitely
recommend the soap &amp;amp; Glory super cat
liner I've been using this for years I
haven't actually worn black liquid
eyeliner for ages but when I did I
always use this one it's got a kind of
felt tip applicator and it's not too
long and it's not too short it's really
easy to control the line and once it's
on it lasts all day but it's also not
too hard to remove it's just perfect
really black black I like this and for
kind of normal I liner there are a few I
do like the Rimmel scandaleyes
original ones but I thought I'd pick
these ones right so the Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeshadow pencil because
with these you can just do a line on the
top of your eye but you can also use
these as cream shadows so they're kind
of really versatile the two that I
really like a bad girl bronze which is a
really nice bronze shade and bulletproof
beige which is a really nice champagne
color that you can use in the inner
corner of your eye whereas a highlighter
I just think these are really good
because you can use in so many different
ways and they're really affordable for
mascara there's only one I really like
I'm quite picky with my mascaras I have
quite naturally curly long lashes
I think mascara is a really personal
things so if you're going to make your
own little starter kit just pick the one
that you like really cuz I know everyone
likes different ones but a drugstore
mascara that I've been loving recently
is the Maybelline the rocket and I
didn't think I would I didn't rush out
and buy this as soon as it came out but
for this video I was testing loads of
products and this one really jumped out
at me I've been using it for weeks at
musing it today I really love it I just
feel like it makes your lashes go really
long and gives them Nosa volume really
easily without much effort actually has
one of those plasticky brushes that I
don't normally like but it grips the
lashes really well and I've really been
enjoying using this for lips I have a
kind of lipstick and a lip gloss if
you're a lipgloss kind of girl I
definitely recommend the Rimmel vinyl
gloss these are really non sticky I
don't know about you guys but I only
wear lipgloss if it's not sticky because
always it dries Emad your hair gets
blown into your lips and your lips get
sticky and it's a nightmare so I went
round likes watching all the lip glosses
a while ago and this one was pretty much
the only one it isn't sticky I do like
the baryon ones as well but smell is a
bit sickly for me so yeah I really like
this one and this is in the color be
famous which is a really pretty coral
and then for lipstick you know what I'm
going to say and it's the Revlon lip
butters I love these because they come
in so many shades you can either get a
really bright one like wild watermelon
which is like a really bright rosebery
red or you can get everyday natural
color like very smoothie which is one of
my favorites and you can just wear this
as a kind of tinted lip balm so whether
you're a lipstick person or a tinted
lip-balm person you can kind of find a
shade to see you they're really
moisturizing and easy to wear and I
absolutely love these finally if you're
looking for some high street brushes the
ones that definitely recommend all the
Real Techniques brushes I love
these they're made by Samantha Chapman
from pixie where my favorites are the
blush of brush the use of bronzer the
buffing brushes for foundation and
setting brush use for concealer haven't
tried the new ones yet I'm definitely
going to but I really really love these
I think something they're missing those
sort of eye brushes the face brushes are
amazing however actually tried the eye
brushes but the set that it comes in
they don't really look like the sort of
brushes that I use so one that I
definitely recommend if you're looking
for an eye brush is the number seven eye
shadow blend and contour brush and this
is pretty much a deep for the Mac two
one seven and it's really affordable I
really like this brush it's in a small
kind of travel size and yeah it's pretty
much exactly the same as a two one seven
and it washes really well it's really
soft they just gave it a little wash now
and so yeah these are really good I
really like these as a two or seven deep
so that's everything from my drugstore
makeup starter kit I hope you enjoyed
seeing all my favorite products from the
high street
I really enjoyed kind of testing them
out and finding my favorites most of
them I knew already I had to go on a
hunt for the bronzing powder and some
eyeshadow palettes as well and I really
enjoyed it I found some amazing products
I know I'm going to use for a long time
so thank you so much for watching please

liked it and I'll see you in my next one
