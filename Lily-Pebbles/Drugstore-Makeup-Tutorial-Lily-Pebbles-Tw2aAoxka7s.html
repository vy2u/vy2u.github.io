be doing a drugstore forwardable makeup
tutorial or back-to-school look if you
are in school it's really simple basic
it's kind of my look that I do all the
time but using drugstore products so be
prepared to see me with no makeup on now
okay looking slightly worse for wear
with no makeup on but I'm gonna get
started by using a primer and this is
the Rimmel stay matte primer its new and
I really like it because it's like a
white cream it's not too silicone and E
which I don't really like my love
drugstore primers are really kind of
slippy this is really nice it feels
quite moisturizing I'm just gonna rub
that all into my skin the nice thing
about this primer is it dries quite
quickly as well it doesn't feel too wet
which my Laura Mercier one does feel
quite wet you have to wait for it to dry
a bit for foundation I'm going to use my
Rimmel match perfection and I got the
shade true ivory in the end and my Real
Techniques buffing brush one pump gives
you quite a lot so I'm just gonna use
one pump and spread it all over my face
then using the buffing brush to just
buff in circular motions and make sure
you go down into your neck as well it's
feels really nice and light this
foundation I think this color finally is
a good color match from Ethel is such a
pain when I find the right color I think
true ivory is the less pink toned of the
ivories it's more of a a yellow or
neutral base so you can see the
foundation looks quite natural but it's
got good coverage as well so once that's
blended in all the way around the edges
I'm then gonna conceal I'm going to use
the soap &amp;amp; Glory kick-ass concealer
because I really like this there's a
powder to set it there's also two
different shades so I'm going to use the
pinky er one for under my eyes and just
using my finger because it's really
creamy I'm just gonna dab that under my
eyes because it's slightly pinky it will
help with any dark circle
because it's quite creamy you have to
kind of keep a layer in it until you get
the coverage you you need and I'm going
to use the other concealer that's a bit
more green for any red blemishes so chin
around my nose and the green and it
cancels out any red it's really easy to
blend with your finger because it's so
creamy I really like this concealer
around my nose I always get a red nose
so I'm taking it a little bit on my nose
as well so once I've done all the
concealing I'm going to use the powder
that's in the top of this concealer and
just set it because it is quite creamy a
can move around but this is a nice
translucent powder so it doesn't add any
coverage it just sets everything in
place I'm also gonna put a little bit on
my forehead in case I get a little bit
shiny I love this powder I have the full
size it's really fast okay next I'm
going to use a little bit of franz herb
because i'm looking a little bit pale
and i'm going to use the soap and glory
solar powder which is absolutely lovely
I love this it's got like two different
shades so I just saw my brush around
together and it gives a really nice like
natural glow I just do it to my
cheekbones down my neck and talk to my
temples I've really liked this one so it
reminds you of NARS Laguna it's not too
orange but it still shows up on the skin
bronze is done so I'm gonna use a bit of
highlighter and another soap &amp;amp; Glory
product I know I've talked about so from
Tori a lot but I love their makeup and
and this is their glow all out which is
a really pretty peachy highlighter so
I'm just gonna put that on tops of my
cheekbones for blush I'm gonna use my
gosh blusher in a flower power this is a
really pretty easy to wear pink so I'm
just going to take a little bit put on
the back of my hand because it's quite
bright and up to the tops of my cheeks I
really love this blush I've been wearing
it like
every day this month I'm not really
going to do my brows I'm just gonna use
a spoolie and a cheap hairspray and just
spray the hairspray and spoolie and then
just brush that through my brows and
that will just keep all the hairs in
place I can't do this this is a really
good like cheap alternative if you don't
have a brow set gel this works just as
well if not better for eyeshadow I'm
going to use the Max Factor golden
bronze which is really pretty eye shadow
it's very much like mac soba it's like
kind of yellowy golden and it's so nice
just to worry about itself so I'm just
gonna put that all over the lid using a
blending brush this is actually actually
this might be a zoeva brush but number 7
do really good blending brush that you
can get in Boots
just sweeping that all over the lid you
shouldn't really need to but if you feel
like the edges need to be blended just
take a big fluffy brush and blend the
edges and then take a smaller brush and
use that same shade underneath the eye I
really like this kind of light brown
under the eye it's very kind of
mary-kate Olsen now the shadow is done
I'm going to use a bit of brown eyeliner
and this is the L'Oreal color riche
Nicole and these are really nice easy to
blend but not too creamy that they kind
of move around on your lid so I'm just
going to write them to run that along
the upper lash line quite close to the
lashes aren't anything too dramatic
okay eyeliners done just a really soft
black brown line and now for mascara I'm
gonna use I think this is new it's from
Maybelline it's the falsies big eyes so
it's like the falsies but it's got an
upper lash brush and a lower lash brush
so let's use the upper one first which
is this end I think it's might be
slightly smaller than the original
falsies but let's give it a go
yeah it still gives a really good length
and volume very quickly do you like this
mascara I'm not going to put too much on
though this is a really kind of natural
everyday low this is a really nice
mascara actually it's good if you like
to do your lower lashes because the
original falsies is probably too big to
use on your lower lashes so you don't
have to put on your lower lashes but I'm
going to just do it for the purpose of
trying this mascara so the other end is
a much smaller brush and you can just
run that on your lower lashes okay so
finally for lips I have really saw
chapped lips at the moment so as much as
I would have loved to do like a bold lip
for you guys I'm gonna use my revlon
berry smoothie lip butter because I know
it's moisturizing and it won't damage my
lips any more than they already are
damaged so mister news is really nice
like everyday my lips but better color
I love this lip product away that's all
the time it's very nice and moisturizing
and looks really natural so this is the
finished look I really hope you enjoyed
seeing a drugstore kind of cheaper
alternative makeup tool and if you are
in school then maybe this has given you
some inspiration for a back-to-school
makeup kind of look my next video is
