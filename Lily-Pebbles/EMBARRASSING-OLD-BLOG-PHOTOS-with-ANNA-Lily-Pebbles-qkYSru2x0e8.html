long it's been a really really really
must be dinner and fine as she is here
today at my place and we're gonna film
some I think some very funny videos I
think though on my channel we're going
to be looking back at old blog posts
because we've both had our blogs since
2010 I think about 2010 yeah so that's
like six new some years almost seven
years
no seven years god that's crazy so we're
gonna be looking back at really cringey
old blog post and just laughing okay oh
my god we've basically picked for each
other like I've picked some of Anna's
and she's picked on mine we're gonna
show each other and then on Anna's
channel we're gonna look at some of our
old videos and as we doing videos longer
than me when did you saw again like 2010
and I think I start about 2012 a couple
years into blogging and what I found
soon oh yeah hello mr. Anna's channel
after this to watch us reacting to some
old videos this is gonna be hilarious
going you go first
thank you like path of your I'm already
mortified I apologize in advance for my
weird I think I thought I was like a
fashion blogger at the beginning I was
really into lookbook Doane you know over
in name this is your first ever vlog
place I went all the way back all the
way back to the beginning I started to
Johnny thousand and ten so actually I
did he's a little I'm quite upset I
think I think was like what I got for
Christmas
oh yeah this will on the trip with my
friends on a holiday
yeah it's a real it's a real crotch shot
I put in an image with like Lily xxxx
like it's step 4 image like it was good
fit girl but I thought I was so fancy
amazing do I think this is your first
ever or the first one this is exists
yeah Mac Oh
look at the peachy pink miss Anna loved
her like she is like she has been a pro
since the beginning like she knew you
she wants to be a beauty blogger like I
took me a while to figure out like what
my thing was but she like in the
beginning was that yet max shy girl like
missed you so much should I go I don't
because I fell like they updated the
formula and then it kind of lost it for
me and but I went through that whole one
I went through whole well I love what
you're posted they have those of emojis
in them it must have just like this tiny
like little like smiley face with text
and they've updated I feel like I had a
point where I have this boss that was
like why are you writing with a moody
just like know that it's not allowed and
from that moment I have never written
with emojis ever again in a blog post I
don't think oh my Mac must have lipstick
message also includes okay so the whole
reason that lily and I did this video is
because a couple of weekends ago really
came to visit me we basically just found
these hilarious book post of ourselves
and we spend like half an hour just
laughing crying with Pilar Tina this one
it's back in the day when everyone was
like up the blogger events and Lily's
blog back in the day was very much as a
lot of outfit but there was a lot of
single product reviews like mine as well
and then loads of event write up like
over a girl about town I like to show
off all the events and this one was one
that really sticks in my mind cuz I was
there too I don't think we knew of each
other at the time but the Saturday night
nail lacquer fashionista
it were these like nail polish that you
like rolled the lid over and it would
like change the colors yeah I mean
actually a couple of posts on Nell Nell
Zink did a similar thing back to that
event to wasted about it was really
excited I heard that the Saturdays have
been launching a nail polish and then to
hear it would be a magnetic polish as it
would be affordable amazing we'd love
Jenelle
there are a lot of nail polish reviews
in the early days but there was this
there was this launch and they were
painting nails Oh me and that way with
the Saturdays I was so excited oh my god
my hair is so long
yeah it is really long but it just made
me laugh because it brought back
memories about I have a picture of me
and Laura there and we're both so orange
oh my god this is the best one camera
love televiewers readers how much she
loves a new camera so that's cool oh my
very face but I mean look at this party
it would have taken me ages to put those
four pictures next to each other as well
I think I used to do it in pain also a
choice upload my matte lipstick catch a
video but after it failed twice
that was before fiber optic that was
when news after upload on youtube videos
overnight I remember no it's better like
final visit 18 hours to finish
oh my god I mean obviously the five days
or Lily's block of quite hilarious but
for some reason there's something about
the text and this one that really cracks
me up so it's good sparkly stuff Lindy's
before she kind of vote quite frequently
you sort of did these roundups of just
general like things you've been up to
anything at all and say this is on the
27th of October from 2011 I remember
this long shot on this piece which no
not bad to see you're thinking me a Lego
runs these are actually quite
comfortable I have them in brown
one of my favorite pairs of boots like
to this day so you write about your
boots
that's lovely I think you're right back
yeah dad's look at all this person you
know but this is the bit that gets me so
it's you and Zoe and this is Zoe and I
at the Ellen H&amp;amp;M launched at the Versace
range it was a bit of a late party
section of H&amp;amp;M but to be fair we did
turn
oh my god maybe they went after work
together I love that coach amber it oh
yeah I remember that coat and these were
very in yeah I was very in and then you
bought a sparkly job writing about so I
did does anyone else is pretty tough
just not about sherry no I quit cheering
because they should go through it's
quite fun to see how they change my new
number one there was something was it I
think it was the text in this one that I
found hilarious baby
so turned to the way that we think we
thought everything was so like important
yesterday I tweeted I decided on my new
number one foundation my new number one
foundation is drumroll please doctor
Chanelle Lumiere the guys there is only
one question left then what is your
number
I ended every block place of the
question and then I copied you I didn't
say haha this one so Lily was really
into style there was a lot of style pays
back every day and this one for the days
where people had like people take fancy
purchaser for them I mean you look
really nice and it's stuff that you had
probably still wear today just a couple
of tweaks but this one I was like that
Lily you know I just written hair bow I
remember borrows oh my god what is that
why are you looking like down and up in
front of my wardrobe to take photos oh
that's a huge yellow one as well is that
coming up why am i doing that
oh my god like there is just no way oh
your hair you can see where it needs
cutting like thank God I did that that
has in blog post called the chop alright
there are lots of there was lots of hair
post actually so I've written as my post
is my like M notes actually it says the
best style post I've ever seen
oh yeah can we just no I don't think my
tripod went up this was actually one of
the posts that being Lily were laughing
about when we were like searching three
and I just had to find it again it just
throws so hilarious and oddly we
mentioned it's because her tripod didn't
go that high so my photos I'm like
bending down it she had to write I think
I saw I thought was really flattering as
well I was like really cool what is my
hair doing really big green you know
trousers and a stripy top and like some
weed
why are you got like a multiple or
something you've always the obvious to
know America thanks so much I love my
arms and forgive me then my watch and my
bracelet I used to love it oh let me go
you could paint on in the crowd the
crowd watching did my parents and
friends know I was doing this in my room
like how embarrassing
no wonder they all thought I was like
joking miles that you have a blog like
this no no no I thought they would look
nice with my top stuff for like herpes
what do you think nice or a bit green
now the end yeah at the end of safe I
mean that it's so nice that we have
these to look back on but it's also just
mortifying and so if any of you think
you've starting a blog don't worry
everyone starts off really crap yeah I
think it's fun to laugh at yourself
we can laugh ourselves was a long time
ago I think I did like a month ago
forever changing and growing up I hope
you guys enjoyed looking at those old
photos so so funny so don't get to go
watch the video we've done on Anna's
channel which is video
