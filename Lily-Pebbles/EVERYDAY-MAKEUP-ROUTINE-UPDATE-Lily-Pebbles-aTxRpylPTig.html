am about to film a Q&amp;amp;A video which you
would have seen last Sunday and I
thought before I film why not just sit
and film me do my makeup an old-school
sit-down chatty makeup video I'm
literally just going to apply my makeup
as I would but chat to you guys as I do
and show you what products I'm using I
don't know if the lighting is like true
to real light because I am using the
studio lights I'm sorry of things colors
don't show up properly but as usual I'm
not doing anything fancy today this is
just my normal everyday makeup but I
thought it'd be nice to just sit and do
my makeup and chat to you guys first
thing I'm going to do because my lips so
dry I've had a reaction again to a
lipstick I don't know what it is so I'm
just going to put on some lip balm my
lips are so bad at the moment I've
nearly run out my favorite like German
lip balm kind of freaking out although
this isn't even helping my lips right
now I think I'm going to have to go to
the doctor this time ok so excuse my
white lips but I'm going to start with
my base and I'm going to be mixing two
primers the first one is the Too Faced
hangover primer which is really
hydrating and the second one is the Dior
glow Maximizer I don't like to put this
one all over the face because it's
really glowy so I like to just mix it in
so I've got two pumps of the Too Faced
one and then one pump of the Dior and
it's like a real champagne glow color
I'm going to mix those together and then
apply it onto the face I really like
using primers at the moment because my
skin is quite dry taking it down to the
neck as well the two face primer is so
hydrating it just feels really nice on
the skin especially if it's been awhile
since I did my morning skincare routine
it just adds a bit of moisture back in
okay so now my skin is prepped I'm going
to be using the it cosmetics CC cream
I've just been using this everyday for
the past like two months I love this I
especially love it in summer it's a
tinted moisturizer but with really good
coverage yeah it says full coverage it I
would say it's like a medium to full but
it's so glowy and hydrating that it
doesn't look heavy on the skin so I'm
just taking a pump of that and then I
put a little bit on my cheeks nose chin
one pump is more than enough it blends
really nicely so I just like to Pat it
kind of around the face and then taking
my very dirty but also very
Real Techniques complexion sponge I can
never say complexions one I'm going to
Pat that into the skin and you'll see
how amazing and glowy the sintered
moisturizer is it has a really nice like
lemony scent to it that I really like
I'm just gonna pop that all into the
skin take it down to the neck as well
also a bit onto my eyelids just even
them out I do like a mix of passing and
moving the sponge like swiping but I
really like to work it into the skin
because it's quite new use a wet sponge
it can feel quite damp on the skin if
you really work in it lasts well okay so
that's the tinted moisturizers done and
now I'm going to take my Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer still loving this
concealer I use the shade light neutral
this is a brand new one I'm going to
take that under the eye I use quite a
bit of this because it covers anything
that the tinted moisturizer didn't and
if you use a brush with the tinted
moisturizer you get a much fuller
coverage I just like it quite light and
then going back in with the sponge I'm
just going to tap that concealer into
the skin I find it actually really
brightens the under eye area which is
why I like it so it just adds a bit of
coverage down the center of the face and
normally at this point just because I'm
really fussy about my dark circles I
just take a tiny bit more and I just
place it here and actually I normally
use a brush but I don't have a brush on
me so I'm just going to very lightly tap
that in so everything is incredibly
glowy which is just how I like it why
I'm going to put on a tiny bit of powder
because I'm going to be filming after
this and it's actually new powder I
haven't tried it yet sound Chapman
recommended it to me we've got a video
coming up very soon together and it's
the Charlotte Tilbury powder I thought
they did a translucent one but they
don't there's actually I think three
shades so I got to medium and if Sam
says this is the best powder ever
then I'm sure it is so I'm just going to
put a little bit of that on the chin and
on either side of the nose and around
the eye area and that would just stop
anything from creasing felt like a nice
powder
okay now onto bronzer and I'm still
using the two
milk chocolate bronzer I just don't feel
the need to change I love this bronzer
it does exactly what I need it's the
perfect shade I actually can't believe I
used to use NARS Laguna because now when
I use that it just feels far too dark
and muddy for me I'm just going to do it
on the outer parts of my face and you
can really build up with this bronzer
because it's so light I like to put it
quite high on the cheekbones at the
moment I'm not doing much like
contouring for my everyday makeup so
that's bronzer done and before I carry
on with like highlights and blusher I'm
going to quickly go and do my brows so
for this I'm going to use the benefit
precisely my brow pencil this is the
shade for I've really been liking this
actually I'm going to use the brush end
just to brush my brows up and then use
the pencil end to fill in the front part
of my brows just where there's a few
gaps there music very light hand and
then also to fill in the arch where it's
a little bit and then I'm using a not so
clear brow gel I really need to get a
new one this is disgusting but this card
just combs them through smooths it all
out and it should keep them in place
although this one is so old it probably
won't okay now onto a little bit of
blush to give a bit of color to my
cheeks this is the balm frat-boy
such an old blusher such a classic just
a gorgeous like peachy pink I really
love this blush I'm just going to put a
little bit on the apples of my cheeks
very lightly so it gives a gorgeous bit
of peachy color and then I'm going to be
using a cream highlighter if you follow
me on snapchat my username is Lily
pebbles I've had so many comments
recently from people asking what
highlighter I'm using and it's the Becca
champagne pop but in the way oh this is
opal I don't know which one I've been
using I think I've been using champagne
pop an opal they actually look pretty
similar but it's the cream highlighter
and I find that this just looks so much
more natural on the skin it gives you
really like natural glow it's good if
you have slightly older skins like more
mature skin any of lines around the eye
but I just love this so I take a little
bit on my middle finger and then tap it
onto the tops of my cheekbones not too
close to the eye not too far down either
can you see that such a gorgeous glow I
hope it's picking up on camera but you
can just be much more like flexible with
the cream I find and you can really work
it into the skin and it just looks so
pretty I love the Becca cream
highlighters I would really recommend
them I'm going to put a little bit down
my nose a little bit on my Cupid's bow
and you can kind of build that up as
much as you like really I'm just going
to leave it like that for now for my
eyes I'm going to use one eye shadow
only I've been at home a lot doing
wedding stuff so I haven't been wearing
like a lot of makeup sometimes I pop out
but I haven't been going to expand see
events recently or anything so although
I normally use around three eyeshadows
today I'm just going to use one and it's
the Burberry pale barley eyeshadow that
everyone raves about Anna introduces to
me a long time ago and I love it it's a
great like one wash wonder so I'm going
to take a little bit of that onto my
zoeva brush and it's kind of like a cool
tone taupe I'm just going to sweep that
all over the lid it's such a pretty
shade and it really is like all you need
if you don't usually wear much makeup
and you want to wear a little bit of
makeup to work I feel like this is the
perfect eyeshadow for that I'm also
going to take some of that eye shadow
underneath the eye just to balance it
out a bit so that's the eye shadow and
I'm going to add a little bit of brown
eyeliner I always like to add line or I
just feel bit like naked without it and
of course I'm going to use Mac
groundbreaker which is my favorite
eyeliner I'm already on my second pencil
and I really really like it and it's
just a brown so I'm going to somehow
with one hand just line the top lashline
quite close to the lashes this will also
warm it up a bit because the eyeshadow
is quite cool toned and I actually
really like warm tone almost pressing it
into the lashes I'm not really focusing
on doing a perfect line because I'm
going to smudge it out with a brush so
now I'm taking that little pencil brush
again and I'm just gonna very gently
blend it so this will just made the
eyelashes look a bit thicker and fuller
for my mascara I'm going to use the
bourgeois volume reveal waterproof that
I mentioned in my favourites video
really really liking this mascara I
don't know why I'm using waterproof at
the moment this is such
nice mascara although it's starting to
clump a little bit I haven't had it for
that long but it's not expensive to
repurchase okay as I said my lips are
really sore so at the moment I actually
haven't been wearing lipstick but I'm
going to put someone just for today's
video so I'm just going to rub in that
lip balm make sure it's all kind of
soaked in I'm going to line the lips
very lightly with the huda beauty lip
contour in bombshell these are new I
think they have them on cult bc and
she's also bought up some liquid
lipsticks which i haven't been able to
try it because of my sore lips so i'm
just going to use the lip liner i'm sort
of using its side on so it's not a harsh
line I'm slightly drawing in my Cupid's
bow and for my lipstick I'm using the
mini version of Clinique blushing pop I
thought it had the full size of this but
I don't it's one of my favorite
lipsticks I really really like it so I'm
just going to put that on top and I
think that's a really pretty blush pink
shade so that's everything it's a little
bit quicker than my usual routine but
I've really been enjoying using all
these products and I just wanted to sit
and show you guys what I've been wearing
on my face recently so I hope you guys
