really good weekend so far before I
start this video I feel like I need to
have a little quick catch-up with you
guys because so much has happened over
the past couple of weeks I feel like my
life has kind of been turned upside down
and I feel like there's a bit of an
explanation because this video now has
been filmed on Friday which for me is so
last-minute so I feel very disorganized
at the moment in the last couple of
weeks my dog passed away as you guys
know I got a new flat so me and rich are
in the process of moving and then rich
proposed to me so I'm now engaged and
kind of planning a wedding and so it's
all kind of come at once which
apparently a lot of people say that
always happens everything happens at
once things happen in threes it's all
been a bit crazy I feel very
disorganized I feel like I'm really not
ahead with my videos and I suddenly
realize I need to film a monthly makeup
routine video and then I thought I
really haven't worn much makeup recently
and when I have been wearing makeup it
just hasn't been anything special I feel
like your priorities or get kind of
switched around and this month it hasn't
been a very beauty makeup you month of
me it's been very like home wear and
tiling like so I'm going to show you the
makeup that I've been wearing this is
probably my least adventurous look out
of all the ones I've done but there are
a few parts in here I've just been kind
of grabbing whatever's there also with
the whole moving thing I feel like I've
really kind of let go of my skincare
routine which is so bad my skin is
feeling very it's alright the textures a
bit weird and it's quite dry I feel like
I really need to get back into my
skincare routine I just want to like
move and put all my stuff in the new
place but I'm not sure that will happen
for a few weeks now so I'm gonna start
by using the clinic Moisture Surge
face spray I've been using this Lowe's
I've just been relying on this to give
my skin a bit of hydration it's really
refreshing and it really does like
inject the moisture into your skin I
also have by the way the hairiest most
untamed brows ever I haven't had time to
go to blink brow bar I've kind of been
plucking them myself and they've gone
all terrible so please excuse that for
my face I've been using this a lot this
is the it cosmetics CC + CC cream does
that make sense yeah it cosmetics CC
cream makeup by Tiffany always talks
about this Anna kind of jumped on it
will move in alter in LA so I basically
copied her because she was so excited I
was like I'm gonna need to try that
there was an illuminating one and the
original and I went for the original
because the illuminating one seemed a
bit too kind of shimmery
I really didn't like this at first I put
it on I thought the color was a bit off
it's slightly too kind of grey for me
and I tried to blend it in with my Bobbi
Brown Buffy and brush and it was really
like stiff and wasn't moving around my
skin and I really didn't like it and
then I went back to make up by Tiffany's
video where she reviews this and she
showed in the video how she applies it
so I tried it that way and now I love it
so this is very dependent on how you
apply it
I'm gonna take like half a pump because
one full pump I think is a bit too much
so I'm taking half a pump I got the
shade light and it's a kind of grey I
think that is quite dark for a light
shade I don't think it would suit
everyone but basically what she does is
take half a pump press it between her
fingers and then Pat it on the skin I've
never done this with any sort of base
but it really works it has the most
amazing scent to it smells like lemon
it's really refreshing so I'm just
patting that all over the skin to kind
of spread it evenly around the face it's
a very weird thing to do when you're
used to like using a buffing brush and
then basically smooth it down and I
found this a much better way to apply it
it's kind of like oh I tell you medium
to full tinted moisturizer kind of
feeling I think if you build up you
could probably make it quite full
coverage but if you pat it on like this
it's kind of medium it's definitely more
coverage then like your average CC cream
or tinted moisturizer I'm just gonna
like pull it down onto the neck I've
basically been wearing that like
all month and yeah I really like it and
then gonna use my Charlotte Tilbury
retouch a concealer I love this
concealer I actually really miss the
open decay conceal I finished that one
and I just haven't haven't been shopping
at all this month so having me now to
pick another one up but next time I'm
near an urban decay I will pick up
another one of those so I'm just gonna
add a little bit of this under my eyes I
recently saw a Claire Marshall mentioned
this in her empties video and she didn't
like it I'm really surprised I
absolutely love this I'd say it's like
one of my favorite concealers just
because it gives quite a good amount of
coverage I think for like one is cliquey
concealers and it has like nice
brightening qualities in it so I
basically just apply it like that and
then I take my Real Techniques setting
brush and just blend that in again this
is just really quick and easy most days
I've been driving over to our new place
to wait for beds and match
is to be delivered and all fun things
like that so I haven't really been that
bothered about my makeup I need to start
packing up all my makeup soon and Anna
actually gave me the best tip ever she
said to put it in sandwich bags so you
have a Cassandra CH bag for your blushes
and a sandwich bag for your bronzers
instead of just having them all loose in
a box and I'm actually really excited to
do that I love a bit of organization
taking that onto the eyelids as well
just to kind of neutralize the color
okay now I'm going to use these products
from Chanel so one of them is a powder
and the other is a bronzer this is one
of their lab beige powders I don't use
this that often but I've been reaching
it for it recently because this CC
creams quite dewy I like to set it in a
few places it goes on beautifully and
you can't see on the skin and then this
is a bronzer from their new collection
which is the healthy glow the beige
bronzer and it's really cute it has like
stripes on it and it's a very it's the
same formula so it's very sheer and you
can't really see it on the skin but it
gives a nice kind of warmth to the skin
I'm gonna take one of my arm Kate cheek
brushes I have two of these they are
amazing and I'm literally just gonna
pass it on to my chin and the sides of
my nose under my eye and onto my eyelid
and then in the center of my forehead
only a tiny amount because I like the
glow on my cheeks and now I'm gonna use
the bronzer I've been using this and the
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar-powered Almonte I
haven't been kind of contouring I've
just been using a nice light bronze it's
funny because on the weekend I got
engaged you never really know how you're
going to react with these things and for
someone like me that normally documents
everything and I like to dress up and do
my makeup and put on a nice outfit I
literally didn't pick up my phone or
camera all weekend I was pretty much in
my pyjamas all weekend I made absolutely
no effort my hair was greasy my eyebrows
were bushy and I just didn't care I just
saw all my friends and family and it was
so fun and I thought it really
interesting that that's how I reacted I
never would have thought I thought I
would have wanted to take photos I had
like a little barbecue and I didn't take
any photos can't believe I'm shocked at
myself so I'm just taking that kind of
up my temples down to my cheeks and then
down slightly and it's not contouring
it's just kind of warming up the outside
of my face I like to keep some of that
bronze it literally doesn't even feel
like August at all in the UK it just
feels like winter really
crazy okay I'm just gonna do my eyebrows
slightly but there really isn't any
saving them they're so bad I can't wait
to get them threaded but as usual I'm
just gonna fill in the front parts ever
so slightly and just here on the arch I
always like to make it slightly higher
because it kind of dips there and then
I've been trying out this new clear brow
gel because my Anastasio wanna identify
because it's coming to the end but he's
making my eyebrows slightly kind of
white and gray which is strange so this
is their brow now stay in place a brow
gel in the clear I think it comes in
different shades and the brush on this
is absolutely teeny-weeny so it's quite
nice because you can just do the bits
that you need to do at the front and I
like to do the ends as well I think it's
quite nice to have a small brush a lot
of clear brow just have such huge
brushes on them so I think this one's
really good and it doesn't make them too
crispy okay I should probably do this
last but I always like to leave my eyes
to last I don't know why I'm gonna use
the Jacqueline Hill and Becca champagne
pop highlighter I'm obsessed to this
I've talked about it so much it's
beautiful kind of golden e peach
highlighter and I don't know if I'm
allowed to say this I got an email I
don't think it's a secret I really saw
it if it is but because we've all been
raving about it so much I think Becca
have been convinced to bring it to the
UK so I don't know when I have no idea
but I think champagne pop is gonna come
to the UK which is very exciting maybe
it'll be in space and cake is there's a
becquer there I don't know this is all
kind of guessing but it's such a
beautiful highlighter just watch me
apply it so I put I feel a little bit on
my brush now and I just put it to the
tops of my cheekbones oh it's amazing
I've been wearing this every day because
I think it just gives you such glowy
beautiful skin it's so pretty a bit
lately to it okay now for my eyes I've
been going for kind of kooky Matt Brown
mary-kate Olsen type of brown smokey eye
so it kind of sounds like it's a lot of
work but it's not really it's kind of
one shade no eyeliner I'll show you what
I mean I've been using Mac groundwork
quite a lot which is a cream eyeshadow
and it's a really nice kind of light
brown kamilly shade so I start with my
finger and I just Pat that onto the lid
works really nice as a base also sorry
that I'm using a studio light in this
video because there's light behind me
you literally wouldn't be able to see me
otherwise I have nowhere left in this
house to film because all my like
cushions from my bed or at the flat
I'm just putting that all over the lid
there's like a nice base and I think I'm
gonna put a little bit of that under the
eye as well it kind of helps if you're
gonna put on powder eyeshadow on top it
helps it all kind of stick as well okay
so now I've done the cream eyeshadow I'm
just gonna go on top of that with one
eyeshadow color I'm gonna take it from
the lorac Pro palette which I've really
enjoyed using this month I did a whole
first impressions video on this so if
you haven't seen that I will put the
video here yeah I really like this
palette and I'm gonna take the shade
taupe which is this one so it's a
slightly kind of cool like cork colored
matte brown lucky I'm wearing my like
Pilates leggings because they are
covered in eyeshadow right now I'm gonna
take quite a lot of that on the brush
and then just layer it on the lid I love
this kind of tone of brown I also think
you could be really messy with this like
it's not one of those like neat
eyeshadow looks I always think when you
see like the Olsen twins with their kind
of smoky eye it's definitely not tidy
I'm just taking a slightly bigger brush
and just blending out the edges okay so
that's the eye shadow done and what I'm
gonna do now is instead of having
eyeliner on top I'm just gonna use
eyeliner in the tight line which is like
the waterline but on the top and I'm
gonna use Mac Teddy which is a really
dark brown because I feel like if I use
black it's gonna make my eyes smaller
Brown would just kind of define the lash
area and I don't think I can do this
with one hand so I'm gonna like lean
down and basically just gonna lift up my
eye and do that in a bit and then I will
come back to you I would say that Mac
Teddy probably isn't the best one to use
unless mine's like dried out it's quite
hard and I feel like you should really
use a soft eyeliner when you're doing
the inside of your eye
I don't know Charlotte Tilbury has a
dark brown but her eyeliners are
incredible so I would definitely
recommend one of those okay for mascara
I'm gonna use something a bit different
I got this a few weeks ago and I fell in
love with it
it's from Clinique and it's one of their
new chubby lash which is just a new
mascara for them but this is in the
shade black honey black honey is like
one of their colors that they have
throughout all the different lines they
have eyeshadows eyeliners etc and it's
like a dark kind of plummy aubergine
which is really different for a mascara
but it just makes sense
I feel like Brown can be a bit boring
and black can sometimes be too heavy for
the
day time and this is like somewhere in
between it's like a Reddy brown and I
think it's beautiful so I'm gonna go
apply this I think it will go really
nicely with the eyeshadow the mascara
itself I like it it's not as good as the
extreme volume the bond that's like
silver with the green that's my favorite
Clinique mascara but I do think this is
good it's definitely good enough to use
and it makes your lashes like kind of
purple I think it's really interesting
it's a really like different color for
mascara so that's what the mascara looks
like now I feel like I can leave the
skin like that but I'm just gonna add a
tiny touch of Bobby Brown pot Rouge in
powder pink so this is there pot Rouge
just like a cream blusher that you can
use for your lips or eyes or whatever
you like really I'm just gonna take a
tiny bit on my finger and just like tap
it on the apples of my cheeks just for a
tiny flush of color these are so good my
like mom and all my friends swear by
this product okay and then finally for
lips I'm going to use a lip liner from
gosh which is a drugstore brand here in
the UK and this is 0:01
nougat nougat nugget nougat I don't eat
it so I don't know how to say it a new
gap crisp nugget crisp you guys will
have to correct me on that one but it's
basically a nude pink kind of matte lip
liner I'm just gonna line the lips you
can't really talk while I do it
it's very similar to my own lip color
you can you can kind of reshape your
lips slightly if you need to then I'm
gonna take a clean finger and just kind
of rub it in so it's more natural and it
is quite matte so if you want to put a
clear lip balm on top you can but that's
the makeup done so that's what I've been
wearing when I have been wearing makeup
which hasn't been that often but I
forgot in the evening just like a cork
matte brown smokey eye
neutral lips sometimes I just put on Mac
patisserie or I just leave my lips bare
and I've been obsessed with this
highlighter it's so so pretty and I hope
you guys found this kind of interesting
sorry it was definitely a boring one
they will be more interesting next month
I swear and I think I've kind of semi
one out video ideas at the moment there
was a time where I had loads of videos
scheduled and now I'm just not really
sure because I'm so like up in the air
so if you guys have any specific videos
that you'd like me to film please let me
know and I will get those done somehow
yeah thank you so much for watching I
hope you're having a really good weekend
and I'll see you on Tuesday for another
vlog
where I think we'll just be painting the
flat so that should be interesting maybe
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
