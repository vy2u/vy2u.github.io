beginning of the four-day bank holiday

of vlogging this weekend I haven't done
a look before and I thought I'm getting
out to a lot of different things this
weekend so I'm just gonna film it and
see what happens
I don't know my sweet life a two-part
thing depending on how much I do but I
just thought I'd take you along and show
you what I'm up to
so yeah it's Friday morning and I'm just
about to film a skincare routine video
oh my god look at my bed I'm so barest
I'm gonna take that out on a minute

just make that up no yes 600d and my
skincare stuff so I'm gonna make a video
on that yeah I'll see you guys in a bit
what am i doing today we film some
videos and write some blog posts get all
that kind of stuff done and then I think
we're going into town I've got a Origins
facial later at the new counter they
have at john lewis and off the street so
it's like a new brightening mini facials
so i'll show you that when i go there
later rich just came back from food
shopping

Easter Bunny which is really nice but
they blatantly just bought it for itself
because it happens to be his favorite
chocolate but it's really cute and I've
got my friend Hannah coming around for
lunch so we just quick you had food
shopping and got some stuff so I'll show
you what we're going to be eating and we
just didn't have
Swami's and free and mozzarella and some
French bread though rich got brown
French bread which looks really gross
I'm not a brown bread fan so hey that's
nice but just some bits for a quick
lunch
China's got here now so this is my
friend Hanna so we're just carrying on
eating lunch not very excited but then
I'm gonna go to town later so I tell you
that Jun's introduce it to Hanna and my
big curly friend it's not big curls a
big she's actually tiny so we're just on
our way to town I'm gonna go to the
origins counter time Lois to have my
mini brightening facial I shave it
already I'm gonna be late about like
half an hour 20 minutes to get there
which is quite tight for time but
hopefully I'm really at their own time
we're just stirring up some petrol can
we see rich there you can't see him he's
somewhere they're filling up petrol I'm
making them drive because I'm really
tired I feel like sitting on my bed all
afternoon and writing blog posts and
it's made me really sleepy now and I'll
probably film again one about the
origins Council
so just come out origins I've had my
mini brightening facial took about 15
minutes
I don't really lovely lady do it and its
really nice they cleanse my face so the
nice creamy canva exfoliated with his
amazing wipes that they'll already have
the product on it and you're just usin
straight away and then they use a really
intensive moisturizing mask which I
absolutely love that I'm gonna go and
buy and then they use the New Brighton
which I'm already using and I love that
and and then put moisturizer on top and
the new spit of the ginseng as well so I
really liked it my skin was really
fresher than female
we're not going to go find someone to
have dinner put figure into me because I
can convince rich rich
I mean more cheese and
amazing it's my favorite
like it
we've demolished this tray of food

day we're gonna go have a mud treatment
at half-10 which is so early and then
have lunch and champagne afternoon tea
and then we're coming back so yeah we're
gonna leave now
that's driving and stops at legislation
tickets
drinks and stuff I've been that original
of course so much better than life and
jaffa cakes from a peak and rich times
out of coffee said there was just
thought all right now wouldn't that and
should only be around 40 minute drive so
that's fine we're in ways and mouth you
can see windsor castle right there's
really pretty we was looking up to the
hotel where the spire is it's literally
right opposite the castle this is the
hotel with hot in gotta it's like a
small hotel so it's really nice
literally directly opposite the castle
we're just gonna go ahead and check in
and spa treatment so this bar good
stable spa they just gonna just in this
file waiting area for United inherently
very dark and relaxing so we've just
finished in their spa I couldn't film in
there so I'm just container but what we
did run in given dressing-gowns and
showing around as far as green eyes
that's quite small and then you get sort
of the main room is a big Jacuzzi in the
middle
customs and stuff and Brennan's his
little private room and had like a mud
bath to basically cover yourselves and
mother sits in the steam room for 15
minutes and come out a shower the mud
off and then we exfoliated with
chocolate or English little stuff which
is not amazing and then the shower of
and they were back into this steam room
and then we went to the jacuzzi there's
like two showers a tropical rainforest
shower and cold ice bucket shower like
coolest ring and bucket tips over and
it's freezing cold is really good for
your pores and stuff so
now
my restaurant so in the restaurant with
tower grocery and yet it's literally the
Casa was just opposite and I think I
might get like a duck salad or fish and
chips haven't quite decided just got our
starters I'm having a crispy duck salad
and rich is having muscle room and
reveal them their present
my sauce is it no that's mistakes yes
baking it through a means of gesture our
relationships so good chunky chips chips
with truffle sauce truffle butter just

around the stores now
Oh

there and have a local is I feel hmm and
some fine I still say there we go is
benefit now it just stumbled upon this
so I'm definitely in the area and look
it's somebody stuck in there even though
rich hates the smell we gonna go in and
have a look you've just crossed over the
bridge from Windsor to come over to Eton
and get Eton College which is big and
fancy and very posh nice so just coming
to look around
we've just been walking around the shops
and I'll show you what we got
you found a fudge shop for the Eaton
fudge shop so you got a few different
types of fudges we got I'm not gonna add
subtle difference but we got peanut
butter clotted cream vanilla one and a
mini egg one egg but it tastes like yeah
they pretty much the same but we had a
lot of shopping tastes amazing try I
also went into lush I got home this is
the breath of fresh air Toyota they have
three different types and the lady said
one of them was for oily skin and one
was first of all to ski and I had rose
in it and this is a sort of general for
everyone so I got this one because I've
got a pretty normal
skin and then I've got one other thing
the ocean salts fake swab because I saw
a este from se button raving about this
so I really want to try it and I think
it's like a bright blue behind open it's
like a bright blue scrub and say yeah

has been really nice day we're on our
way home now very tired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
