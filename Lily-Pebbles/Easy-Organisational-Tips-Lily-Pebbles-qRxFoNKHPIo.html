about organization or organizational
tips for quite a while now but
ironically I found it really difficult
to organize the video in some kind of
format that makes sense there's no theme
to this video it's just random tips that
help me become a more organized person
and I think the reason I wanted to give
my opinion and put it out there onto the
Internet is because I feel like I'm
slightly different to your average
organized person
I feel like wherever I look whether it's
in kind of stylus magazine or on YouTube
videos organized people tend to be tidy
people they also tend to be morning
people and I am so jealous of those
people that there's no point me trying
to be someone I am NOT and I'm never
gonna be the sort person that wakes up
early in the morning I'm a night owl I
like to stay up late I get loads of work
done in the evenings I feel like my
creative juices flow more in the evening
and I've also never been a tidy person
just ask my mom I've always had a flawed
robe flawed robe in case you don't know
is when your floor pretty much becomes
your wardrobe I've always got clothes on
the floor rich is always annoyed that
I'm messy he's the tidy one out of two
of us so I do feel like normally
tidiness an organization come hand in
hand but somehow I am a very organized
person who is not tidy and I'm not a
morning person so maybe that'll make
some of you feel a bit better that even
if you're not a tidy morning person you
still have the ability to be organized
and I thought I would just run through a
few things that help me become more of
an organized person and a lot of it is a
change of mindset as well the first
thing is a calendar and I live by my
calendar since I got the iPhone years
ago I've always used the iPhone calendar
and I absolutely loved it I actually
have three different calendars I've got
a personal one that only I can see I've
got a work one that I share with my
managers and agents and then I have one
for me and rich so I feel like that
really helps especially the one for me
and rich if I make a time to see a
friend or I'm going out for dinner I put
it in the calendar and then rich know
straightaway that I'm out that evening
obviously we still talk to each other
but it's really good if you can't
remember if you're gonna be home for
dinner and it's nice to see things
you're both kind of getting up to and
there I also love using the alerts in
the iPhone calendar I set myself
reminders so I put
in the calendar but in case I don't
remember to check the calendar I set an
alert kind of five or ten minutes before
the event to remind me to do something
it's very easy to kind of put things in
a calendar write lists but feel like a
lot of the time you forget to actually
check the lists and look in the calendar
I also recently created a wall calendar
for myself you might have seen in my
vlogmas vlogs I printed off the calendar
from Etsy and then I kind of mounted it
and stuck it on the wall and for me
that's more of like a mental thing to be
able to see the year ahead I am a
massive forward planner and I think
that's a big part being organized is not
leaving things last-minute I like to
always think ahead I like to always
pretend that I've got a deadline to
reach even if I don't for example mine
and Rich's wedding it's quite a while
away but I'm acting like it's next week
because I just like to be ahead I would
prefer to get everything done and then
have time to relax and have any
last-minute emergencies come up I always
like to forward plan so for me seen a
calendar of the whole year on the wall
really helps me plan out any holidays I
have make sure I don't miss any
birthdays I really like to visualize the
year ahead and that's another thing
because I'm a creative person for me I
know that visual things really work for
some people
writing is okay and ceilings and
computer and for me colors and visual
things I know they stick in my brain
better I know a lot of you guys who
watch aren't bloggers on youtubers so
I'm not going to go in depth planning
blog posts I've mentioned it in previous
videos and blog posts before but I do
like to create tick lists for myself and
not everything gets ticked all the time
but it's nice to be able to tick off
something on your list and I also think
that when you are making lists don't
make huge complicated lists I like to
split them out into like personal things
wedding things blog things YouTube
things have separate lists so that you
can work your way through it and keep it
small you know if some things aren't
realistic leave it for another day don't
give yourself like a huge list because
it's too overwhelming and you won't get
any of it done
I briefly mentioned before giving
yourself time to plan ahead I thought
I'd written down on my list because I
really do believe in forward thinking
and planning ahead of time before I
travel even if it's just like local
travel I have an app for the London
tubes and I like to look how long the
journeys gonna take me and if I'm going
somewhere in the morning the night
before I apply my journey work out how
long it is and I would like to plan to
be somewhere 15 minutes to half an hour
before and half an hour before sounds
like quite a long time but there's
always delays and I feel like in my mind
if my meetings at 9:30 I think that I
have to be there at 9:00 because there's
no harm in getting somewhere early but
for me being late is a terrible terrible
trait I hate being late and I'm hardly
ever late so if you just think in your
head just change the time aim to be
there at 9:00 act as if if you're not
there at 9:00 something terrible's gonna
happen and then you'll probably be there
on time so I like to plan my journeys I
look on Google Maps a lot plan how long
car journey are going to be or how long
it takes to walk somewhere on my phone I
have so many different apps I've got a
Tube map I've got Google Maps and then
when I'm traveling abroad I love to use
the aeroplane apps as well so there's
like a British Airways one a virgin one
easyJet this is the three that I use
most the time and you can check in on
your phone before whether you're
dropping off your luggage or not and I
love to download my boarding pass onto
my pass book on my phone because then it
pops up and it reminds you that you're
going to the airport because you're
gonna forget it's so easy to get to
you'd after like faff with boarding
passes in your bag you just it's always
there on the homepage of your phone it's
like the best invention you just tap it
and then you can get on the plane so
easy to use it makes the whole thing
smoother and quicker I feel like your
email inbox is something that can always
be very disorganized and most people
have very chaotic inboxes when I see
people whose phones have like 745 emails
that really stresses me out and I've
been there before I know you can get to
that point and then it's so overwhelming
you don't know what to do I know people
that have like started new email
addresses because of that but if you can
sort that out start from the beginning
and start again I think it's really
important to keep your inbox empty if
you can or just to like a minimum of
five emails and that sounds really hard
but by the end of every day I really
like to clear my inbox
that's replying to an email or filing it
I have files for all my emails so I'll
have personal wedding PR events finance
I put all these different folders and
it's really easy once I've replied to an
email to just file it away and then it
means finding emails is so much quicker
I hate when you have to search for an
email and you can't find it so I'm
really into filing emails and clearing
my inbox every day if I can if I can't
do it every day that I try and do it by
Friday something really random that I
think I learned from my mum is to keep a
stash of greeting cards in your house I
have a little collection of birthday
cards anniversary cards Christmas cards
all kind of cards whenever I go to a
shop and I see a nice card I just buy it
just in case and you never know your
friend might get engaged or you might
forget someone's birthday and it makes
you feel like a more organized person if
you just have some cards that you can go
and take a look and then give someone a
card little things like that I feel like
really change your life as I mentioned
I'm really not a tidy person but I do
agree with the whole tidy desk tidy mind
thing I am not very good at this so I'm
trying to give myself advice my office
that I'm in right now is a complete tip
it's like a storage room and I do find
it really hard to concentrate in here my
desk gets cluttered so easily I don't
know why I've always got mess on there I
tried to tidy up at the end of the day
so that at least when I sit down the
next morning I can start with a couple
on canvas but normally about an hour
into the day it's a mess again and now
that kind of home tip is online food
shopping I think it complete depends
where you live some people only online
food shop for me growing up my mom
always used to go to the supermarket so
now that I have my own place I've been
doing a lot of online shopping I feel
like it saves time and the best thing
about online shopping is you can save
your favorites list so things like pasta
chopped tomatoes eggs milk things that
you always get I loved that I included
chopped tomatoes I feel like that's not
something that everyone gets but a lot
of pasta those sort of things you always
buy already on a favorites list so it's
so easy just to tick them all and then
just add any extra kind of fresh fresh
veg or fruit that you want for that week
and it saved so much time when you're
walking around a supermarket you pick up
things you don't even need I'm a big fan
of online food shopping and favorite
lists the final thing
to keep notes the notes at on the iPhone
I absolutely love I have everything in
there from like potential child names
I've had in there since I was a teenager
to like blog posts that I write on the
tube or lots and lots of lists I have a
lot of lists in there I think it's so
good to write stuff down I did about you
guys I have a terrible memory but often
I think of things and then an hour later
I've completely forgotten so I just
write everything down and sometimes I go
through my notes and find things that
I'm like oh I forgot I wrote about that
I don't know I think it's really good to
get stuff down and writing and see it
there so I felt like that was a little
bit of a random video but hopefully you
got a few organizational tips from there
I know that I'm an organized person but
when it came to trying to pass on some
tips I did struggle a bit I had to ask
rich like why do you think I'm an
organized person what's MIT what makes
me organized so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next one
