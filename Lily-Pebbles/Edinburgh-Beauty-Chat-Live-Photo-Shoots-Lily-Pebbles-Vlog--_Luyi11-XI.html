Wednesday and I thought I would vlog
this week because I have quite an
exciting two days coming up I've just
finished packing my bag because today
I'm off to Edinburgh with Anna for our
final Beauty chat live with Clarins I
don't think I've ever been to Edinburgh
before I don't know why I can't remember
maybe I went as a kid but I definitely
haven't been in like my adult life so
I'm so excited
gutted though because we were meant to
have these chat live event it's tonight
and then we were meant to have a full
day tomorrow to explore but I had to
change my flight too early in the
morning but it is for an exciting reason
so I will show you guys tomorrow
but I'm really looking forward to
heading to Edinburgh catching up with
Anna and I think we've got a couple of
three hours this afternoon to explore
before the event where we're gonna meet
you guys and I can't wait so I've just
finished packing up my bag and I think
I'm ready to shut my case which is
always a scary moment because I hate
both packed everything so frustrating
because I don't think my last video it
went into people's subscription boxes on
YouTube and I have no idea like I have
contacts at YouTube and it's still this
like myth about how how this happens
because I asked Anna if it was in her
subscription box and she said it was but
then my friend Georgia it wasn't in hers
and it's so frustrating when we work
hard in videos and then there's just no
way people knowing that it's even on
there because it hasn't gone into
subscription boxes so working up to find
out that that is the case which is very
frustrating I've emailed someone YouTube
to find out if there's anything I can do
to help that situation but I'm not sure
there is so if you haven't seen my
Sephora haul and liquid lipstick Tryon
video I will link it up at the top of
the screen if you want to go have a
watch I'm sorry if you missed it
I'm in the airport now I had to force
myself to sleep in the car because I
felt so caustic and I just met up with
Anna who is here and obviously doesn't
have a bags to check in because she's
packed everything into a tiny backpack
ridiculous I have a reason because this
thing I'm doing tomorrow
with so many clothes of me right cup of
tea and then we're gonna go and find
off-mike we have arrived in Edinburgh
we've just checked into our rooms and
the flight was not great not gonna lie I
knew that was gonna be a bad one I felt
panicky before we'd even taken off and I
hated the entire takeoff but I made it I
survived as always absolutely fine just
did not enjoy it at all we're here and
I'm really happy to be here I definitely
haven't been here before I don't
recognize anything so we're gonna go out
for a wander we've got maybe like a few
hours we're gonna walk around get
science eat explore the local area come
back get ready for tonight and then come
meet you guys I'm so excited just walk
into this kind of shopping area look how
beautiful it is you can see right now
yeah leave it this photo shoot that I
have tomorrow they've just emailed me
saying I need to wear something
colourful and you guys know what my
wardrobe looks like so this is why I
know we have a limited time in Edinburgh
but I'm gonna have to go to Topshop
because I have anything colourful the
most colorful thing I have in my
wardrobe is gray we're trying to find
somewhere to get some food for getting
very distracted by whistles Lululemon
there's some really good shops here in
Edinburgh but yeah we're gonna go ahead
and find the Clarins hub that we're
gonna be at tonight so we know where
we're going we just found the hub is
down here look at this amazing view
Castle is right above it okay I think I
found jackets slash top in Zara and we
made a little detour pass Space NK and
now we're on Fissel streets which is a
really nice little cobbled the road
we've been recommended a good toy
restaurant rip rush the wrong let's go
home
a good toy restaurant so we're gonna
have late lunch / early dinner and then
go back to the hotel to change but even
though we're not doing cultural things I
think we're having a good view of
Edinburgh this is restaurant closed door
oh no they don't open till 6:00
apparently fissures in the city is also
mentioned very good which is right here
opposite cool we've walked up like a
million steps homes our breath and Luisi
clearly the personal training is not
working yet we're off to find a place
called Mary's milk bar because the lows
of you guys tweeted us recommending it
it's going to be a really nice ice-cream
shop so we're walking down a pretty road
now straw and find it we're back at the
hotel now and we haven't got long to get
ready but I'm just gonna like touch up
my makeup and I want to curl my hair oh
crap I didn't bring any products with me
hopefully anna has some kind of
texturizing spray with her I knew I
forgot something it's cuz I packed
really early this morning and here look
how cool the room is this is a side
bathroom super swanky and the bed looks
really nice
alright I'm gonna put some curls in my
hair or I'm ready I've just chopped up
my makeup a bit put on the anasazi a
liquid lipstick and done my hair but
it's all just gonna I don't know what's
gonna happen - it's got no product in it
and it's freshly washed from last night
so that's a bit of a disaster I might
see if I can like find somewhere to get
some product on the way and it's just
found out this new brand Edinboro so
she's pretty happy about that
which will help the hair situation if
you'd have to walk in the wind
alright you'll add the Chancellor's nice
alright let's do this
while we're waiting partly but I'm gonna
do it outfit of the evening with Anna
because you look very chic go then talk
us through Rhys car nice Zara jacket is
like a dressing-gown
Rhys knitwear because I feel quite cold
yeah it's not at all
I thought it might be so our trousers
our desi you look so cheap yeah we've
just got to the Clarins urban oasis and
I thought I'd show you around
you've got glasses here ready for the
champagne and it's basically amazing
isn't it so cool in here bit faster do
you know what I could this thing letting
off the smell this is where everyone
kind of sits I haven't vlogged at the
other venue so I thought I'd show you
everyone coast it's here and there's
like yummy food and the main an ogre sit
on the scary stage which isn't that
scary once we're on then and then we do
a little Q&amp;amp;A and there's loads of stuff
going on here like facials and samples
and stuff it's very cool
Hey
we had a friendly and stay lovely and
forget more loose weave mean Anna got
busy lolly in the second session and
lights on talking about we started like
trying to make emoji faces like that's
the like wonky mouth one I'm pretty
hungry we're gonna go back to the tower
I'm up some chips or pesto something
like that
like carby um and then we're gonna bed
oh I'm feeling all like buzzy like when
you come off for finish your school play
I've had too much lemonade we're back at
the hotel and we're trying local gins
and this is like a royal garlic flavored
gin and it's amazing and it's got like
some apple slices it's the best gin ever
we just stayed up in the bar downstairs
eating like pizza bread and hummus and
chips and it was great and having like
local gin and tonic really really nice I
am going to get ready for bed and to
like shower and epilate because tomorrow
I'm on a photo shoot I'll try and
explain a bit more tomorrow but it's
kind of a bit of a teaser because I'm
gonna talk about it properly in May so I
probably won't talk too much about it
now but I'm basically doing a photo
shoot with Teenage Cancer Trust I'm so
so honored to be asked to be involved in
this project it's for their campaign
coming up in May which is all about
protecting your skin in the Sun you guys
know it's a topic that means so much to
me but I as I said I'm gonna talk about
it properly and made but I am gonna show
the shoot tomorrow
just like parts of it so I'm gonna head
to bed and I'll see you in the morning
bye
morning guys it was definitely a
struggle to get this morning at like 6
o'clock I'm just not an early morning
person but I'm all packed up and my
makeups kind of semi done because I'm
always so nervous about getting other
people to do my makeup there is a makeup
artist at the shoot today but I just
don't want to not look like me so I've
kind of done my makeup and I thought
they can always touch up if I need to
and I can put on
and making like Tom my hair or something
so I'm gonna head downstairs to the
lobby to me Anna and we're gonna get on
a flight home to one was in now and I'm
meeting up the Teenage Cancer Trust and
they put Jake Creek Adam who was from
x-factor and it Oakland Katie Miller and
they both have personal connections for
the charity so they're like filming this

bit of an extra on today but I'm looking
forward to go into me everyone and I'm

talking to those people about like
staying protected in the Sun that was
fun really the controller's talking to
you guys about the campaign I'm now
gonna head home I'm so tired I got sick
this morning and six yesterday and I
need a nap and I need to catch up on you
I'm back home now I'm actually really
happy to be home it took two and a half
hours to get back from that shopping
center it's so much traffic in London
today because it's the day before Good
Friday so people are just travelling
everywhere and that was quite a painful
journey because I get quite trouble sick
but I'm happy to be home and I'm
snuggled up with a blanket I'm gonna
watch a little bit of TV and then I'm
gonna go to my sister's I really should
just like stay put but I cannot be able
to cook and so I asked if she'd make me
dinner she said yes so I'm gonna go run
there for dinner hopefully have some
nice like comfort food I also thought a
question came up during beauty chat live
last night about my fear of flying and I
wondered if you guys wanted me to make a
video about it thinking about making a
video doing a bit of a QA inside the
video at some point as well and just
talking about my personal fear of flying
cuz I do feel like it's a little bit
different from other people I know
they're scared to fly and here we will
have like our different worries and it
could be quite interesting video
Jennifer knew I'd watch it you do all
those videos that probably wouldn't get
very good views compared to my other
videos but I'd like wanna make it so let
me know what you think we'd be
interested in that I'm wearing the Kat
Von D liquid lipstick in lovesick which
I really like and everyone's very
complimentary of it when I wear her I'm
heading to my sister's now I think she's
planning on making fajitas so I'm gonna
go over and help her I'm listening to
loads of throwback tunes and having a
great time in the car he's stuck in
traffic for ages but his old school 90s
Tunes really helped him
Alissa needs to dream he loves you not
let me know if you know that song I
brought my sister Liz Earle cleanse and
polish because she has really dry eczema
skin and loves using her stuff it's good
for her skin oh gosh this is all the
frizzy bits come out to play this time
of night let's see one two three four if
you don't already follow me on snapchat
this is pretty much what you can expect
from my snapchat but I am home now I had
a nice kind of chilled evening with my
sister we had fajitas and watched People
vs OJ which I'm completely addicted to
by the way happy to be home still have
not unpacked this mess really need to
get to that but I'm gonna sign off here

419 ninth video that I have uploaded on
YouTube which is insane which means that
my next video on Sunday is my 500th
video and not gonna lie I've been lying

keeping a very special video under wraps
