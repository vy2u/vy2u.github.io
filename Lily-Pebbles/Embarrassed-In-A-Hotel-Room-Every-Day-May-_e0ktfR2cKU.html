I've worked out pretty early today so I
got so much to do before heading to the
hotel I've asked the check in early
around 2 so I can film and is coming at
6th from beach at or maybe a bit earlier
so I've got about 4 hours to film that
video I've got a lot to do this morning
I've just woken up and edited
yesterday's vlog and I'm just uploading
it now this is the thumbnail I made
which is like pictures of some of you
guys send your snapchats so I think
that's going to look really cool I'm
just uploading that now must go eat some
breakfast I obviously haven't done that
yet because I'm really bad and I need to
pack as well for this hotel of what's
such a long list of things to take look
seriously that is my list crazy I just
want to quickly show you guys something
with my camera because I've noticed a
lot of other youtubers have problems
with their memory cards and I just feel
like I need to share this knowledge
because when I didn't know this it used
to drive me mad my memory card used to
always get full up or I would be filming
and it said there's no space but there's
nothing on it
he's driving mad is to go through memory
cards and they're so expensive there's
such a little trick this will be so
obvious to anyone who's in photography
but it's really important to format your
memory card and I'm going to show you
how to do that so on my camera you press
menu and then you go along to the second
two right yellow bit and it says format
click that and then you'll see how much
is in use so at the moment I've got
nothing on my memory card and you can
see there's already eight point eight
gigabytes used I don't know why all the
reason is but you basically have to
delete that it will delete everything on
your memory card those I don't do it
unless you want to clear your memory
card you click OK and then it's back to
nothing it's so important to do that I
think every time before you film I like
to always import my footage someone else
why I use an external hard drive I do
that because then I don't have to put it
onto my computer which will take up all
the space and so I put onto my external
hard drive I keep that plugged in while
some editing so that software knows
where to find all the footage but yeah
formatting your memory card is really
important something I don't think many I
throw everyone knew about but I've seen
quite a few youtubers having problems of
their memory cards recently and that is
probably why so a little random memory
card tip for Wednesday morning it's not
Wednesday morning it's Tuesday morning
literally just
lost a day for about an hour so right
back on track I'm going to do a blog
post on epilating and I got this newborn
silk Apple 9 which is like their super
fancy one it comes with like an
exfoliating brush for your body which i
think is really cool I'm excited to see
how this compares to the one I've got
which is I think the five most basic one
and I will do a little kind of
comparison post so many people have been
asking questions where epilating so I'm
writing that post now for Thursday okay
I'm going to pack my thing we have
States ridiculously - big kipling bag
it's not huge but it's quite big for one
night because I'm taking my tripod and
cameras and everything is so much Pat I
think I'm also going to take this huge
Muji box is like the large large one so
put all my beauty stuff in there
I can't pack though without putting
something on YouTube so let's see what
there is
woo Sammy's got a haul up I'm gonna
watch that did I write you guys but I
always have to have something playing
when I'm packing or do my makeup okay
that is pretty jam-packed I've got
brushes here looks like I've got loads
it's because I'm from in a video I would
never normally take as much stuff so I
do drew muslin clothes perfume eyelash
curlers toothbrush skincare makeup you
can fit quite a lot in and because it's
quite high actually you can put
full-length kind of things in but it's
just going to be huge it's going to take
up like all the space in there not great
for packing but great if you're filming
videos and you take a lot of stuff in
one box I never usually listen to
anything when I'm on the cheap music or
anything like that I like to kind of I I
like to be nosy if I'm honest then like
listen to people's conversations and
stare at strangers but Anna always
distance to music and people always say
they listening to stuff and I remember
that my friend Lucy told me about these
really good podcasts so I'm downloading
them now they're called ear biscuits
everyone probably knows them I'm
probably completely late on this they're
basically interviews with really
well-known youtubers like Hannah Hart
and grace Helbig and Tyler Oakley
talking about their backgrounds
and apparently it's really really
interesting so I am downloading these
now I have mammary Tyler Hannah and
grace so we listen to those on the tube
or as many as I can okay I think I'm
pretty much packed up so I'm going to go
see if there's any food
in the house and then finish up my
emails and head to the Rosewood Hotel
okay so this is what I'm going to do for
lunch
I'm obsessed the pasta I love pasta
whenever I'm hungry all I want to use
pasta but it's really not that great
whew and I don't want to eat it that
often anymore so I'm going to make very
basic pasta sauce just with garlic
onions and chopped tomatoes so there's
nothing bad in there it's all healthy
stuff but instead of having a pasta I'm
just gonna have it with some grains this
these are one of those like ready-to-eat
there's a freak a roasted green we
haven't tried some before looks like
that
so I still get the pasta fix by having a
sauce but I'm not actually having pasta
okay I just put these in the microwave
for a minute Oh harder to do with one
hand then I thought there you go so I'm
going to put up that much about half a
packet this is the sauce just like a
nice garlicky tomato sauce really
doesn't look very appetizing that's
going to taste good I have to leave here
in around half an hour so I'm going to
sit and reply some tweets I'm so sorry
that I feel like I don't reply to as
many tweets at the moment it's just
because I've got so much to do it's
really hard to reply to all of them I'm
going to go through now and reply to as
many as I can without it being too
irrelevant like days ago okay it's time
to go
okay I'm in the hotel room and this
hotel is so nice I've never actually
stayed here before but one of my best
friends got married here so I've been to
the hotel
will that aircon loud definitely be
turning that off a reform I'll be stuck
I'm going to start filming it's now
quarter to two and Anna's coming here
like quarter to six so that might that
may sound like a lot of time but with
these sort of creative e videos I like
to just take my time I hate being rushed
filming so I'm going to film as many
clips as possible from all different
angles I don't really know what the
point of this video is I'm not sure if
you guys are going to learn anything or
it's going to affect your life in any
way but that's the nice thing about
making kind of entertainment videos it
is just for entertainment so hopefully
it will be entertaining to watch I just
got in the room I was listening to that
podcast that's really interesting
actually I'm kind of a bit addicted and
stop those start filming so I'm just
taking my tripod and camera out of my
case and I'm going to set it up and I'm
going to start by walking in the hotel
room maybe poor film I quickly show you
the room so this is where you walk in in
oh is this a wardrobe but haven't even
looked in here oh yes wardrobe I'll be
good for filming mini bar on the right
um lovely big bed this table love this
table this is so nice and I'll show you
the bathroom I feel like all hotel rooms
these days have marble they really
predicted to this trend was going to
come back beautiful marble bathroom big
mirror with like a really close mirror
there and a bath this is such a nice
hotel room so I'm gonna just start I
don't know I should have probably
planned this better but let's see what
happens I'm feeling creative I'm gonna
put some music on we don't know how to
vlog and film in videos at the same time
is a challenge but currently got my
camera set up on this table I'm a
suitcase there I'm on like shot three of
probably 100 so I just keep going and
fill you in every now and again okay
just a little update I'm now going to
start filming in the bathroom so I'm
going to start doing my makeup and like
an that bit will take a long time it's
of products and stuff like that one of
the guys from the hotel trip is coming
up first we came up to drop these which
is so nice if I'm open to
a just to say welcome Lily here are a
few treats to enjoy and because I as I
said we're having dinner with the people
from Urban Decay tonight in the hotel
there's it delicious and I have to say
one for rich
well once chocolate vanilla helped
chocolate so you came up to drop that
off and he was like can I come in to put
on the table I was like okay came in
there's a camera set up in his eye okay
bit weird
goes and then he comes up against rip
something off and the camera was
literally set up at the end of the bed
literally facing the bed like the camera
was here facing the bed he thinks I'm
filming a porno I look she said to him
as he left I would by the way I swear
I'm not filming a porno and he was like
oh yeah right oh god it was so Verizon
why did I even say that now it made him
think that I was filming a porno really
quite embarrassing
oh my knickers are out yet just realised
that I'm gonna carry on filming now I'm
like an hour and a half in I've got
about four hours to go
okay I've come into a bit of trouble I
am onto my concealer so I've done my
skincare foundation concealer and I've
just realised the light in the bathroom
is so bad you guys can't see anything
that I can't start again I really should
have filmed sitting here in the natural
light I don't really know what to do I
think I'm gonna have to carry on and
just make do because I'm not starting
again I don't know I find a way maybe
I'll come back into the natural light
after okay makeups done you know when
you obsess over an albums so so so much
you have to stop listening to it because
you've overdone it that's why I did with
Ed Sheeran's album and I haven't
listened to it for months and I'm now
listening to again and it's so good I'm
just singing along and loving it I'm
just sitting down before I do my hair
and outfit part of the video to film
some close-ups of products which I'm
doing there and doing a lot of
stop-motion thing just to make it a
little bit more interesting this video
is definitely not meant to be a tutorial
the lighting was so bad at the bathroom
there's no way it's any kind of tutorial
but I hope that you guys will enjoy the
video anyway I'll show you example of
one of those stop motions where's that
mascara gone so take a photo and move it
a little bit another photo stop-motion
cutaways are by far the longest thing I
think I've been doing it for 45 minutes
now and I've still got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 to
do quick pause for an Instagram photo
and take one in ages I think I'll use
that shot running out of battery which
is fine because I bought a backup
obviously but I need to film till
morning as well and the beauty chat oh
my god ok I just really really really
hope the visa chat is really quick and
we end this battery is like proper full
sometimes they've run out quicker than
they should and I really hope that one
lasts ah I don't know freaking out now
I'm just message alerts if you can bring
one I think she's already on the tube
having a bit of a sulk now because
Anna's already left home so she can't
bring a spare battery so we gotta fill
in beauty chat when she gets here and
I'm gonna ask her to help me with my
outfit I wanted to make this video we're
going to call it like the night before /
the morning after and I was going to do
like getting ready for the night out but
then also like very quick easy morning
routine but I don't think I'm going to
have enough battery to do the morning
bit and then it's just going to be like
a get ready with me which isn't what I
wanted to do and I don't know what to do
about it and why did with my charges
because I bought my charge of my
vlogging camera
I couldn't have forgot to bring the
other one mmm
imma be annoyed Anna's here she's making
her way up to my room I think she'll get
me out of my sulk I always get a little
sulky when things don't go my way
filming was just exist but so long doing
it but I hopefully battery will last for
the outfit bit I'm looking forward to
seeing her as I'm gonna tidy my room
haroon's always so tidy Anna's here now
oh you do much houses by the way thanks
mother come every hmm you love a bit of
recent right we are gonna head down to
the pretty courtyard I think and film
some outfits probably gonna be really
embarrassing cause I reckon all the
other blog visite gonna be arriving
right about now Lay's is like
good-looking men out there as oh no big
good-looking tell you but the man and
it's utter Lana now but I boys okay we
just filmed the cutaway Clips
outside and it was pretty embarrassing
we were literally on the road where the
calves were coming through is to keep
having to move and have always men
watching but I think the shots looked
really nice so I think they'll go for in
my video that I still don't really know
what the aim of the video is
we're going to sit in our DP g chat i
think i put the camera here because the
lights here it would have been nice to
sat at the end of the bed but i think
one of us would have had a really bright
side of our face so we're going to sit
here i think give it go and we've got
some flops here ready yeah
oh that's qui dixie rich is here now
