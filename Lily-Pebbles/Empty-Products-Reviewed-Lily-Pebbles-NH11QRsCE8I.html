I haven't done in a very long time and
it's an empties video I have a big box
here of empty products this may sound
weird some of you that haven't seen an
empties video before and it is kind of
weird I'm going to show you all the
products that I finished but the idea is
that I'm gonna tell you what I thought
of them and give you many reviews along
the way so let's dive inside my little
empties box here and have a chat about
the products I finished which is an
achievement for me to actually finish a
product so there should be some good
ones in here the first two you probably
wouldn't expect to find an empties video
because they're brushes but I'm calling
them empties because they have come to
the end of their life and it's time to
move on there are two brushes from Real
Techniques and I love Real Techniques
they get me wrong it's one of my
favorite brush brands but because they
are slightly cheaper I think they do
have a sell-by date and they're not
gonna last forever this is my blush
brush that use of bronzer and as you can
see it's kind of gone a bit crazy and it
has like a weird hole in the middle I've
washed this and I've used it I've had it
for a really long time probably over a
year now it's just it's got a bit kind
of matted and it's a bit gross and
there's nothing I can do to make it
better so I'm just gonna get another one
but I love this for bronzer it's the
perfect size for kind of contouring or
bronze all over and yeah this is a
really great brush I've also got one of
my buffing brushes to throw away I've
still got another one that's newer that
I'm gonna use but this one is just come
to the end of life it's kind of smudging
in all the wrong places and just not
working as well as when it's me another
tool those come to the end of its life
is one of my wet brushes this is
literally covered in hair sorry this is
so gross I do if you can see but some of
the bristles have bent and flattened
which is a shame I absolutely love this
brush I think it's much better than the
tangle teezer it's called the wet brush
and you can get it from cult Beauty it
works amazing in tangled hair but this
one maybe I was just using it too hard
because the bristles are all flattened
and it's definitely broken but I have
got a new one in black it's worth you
purchasing because it's really that good
but maybe it doesn't last that long
because this one kind of died I have a
makeup remover in here and this is the
Garnier micellar cleansing water and
this I don't know I don't have much to
say about it I don't think it's as good
as by
so far nothing has been as good as
Bioderma in my opinion I also think it
came out a little bit too fast and some
had so you kind of used more than you
needed to and it's a bit of a waste it's
kind of going in and picking up whatever
is there as I see it this is from NARS
and it's the Laguna bronzer it's not
completely finished but there's pretty
much nothing left there's just a bit
rather sides I love this bronzer and
I've been using it for years
but I haven't repurchased this one yet
because I've been using my so pandora
solar powder which i think is just as
good and I haven't felt the need to
repurchase Laguna I used to literally
run out and repurchase it straight away
as soon as it finished but this time I
happen so let's see when I finished my
soda powder I'll have to decide which
one to repurchase but Laguna is a really
great bronze that works on most skin
tones it's slightly darker so maybe not
if you're really pale but I love this
I've also finished a product from
Tresemme and this is the keratin smooth
7-days smooth system shampoo this is
like it's got keratin in it so it's
really good if you have coarse frizzy
hair like mine it adds that sort of
straightening system into it and I
really like this it's likely kind of
silicone II I don't know if the
long-term effects are that great I do
prefer the Bumble and Bumble straights
range over this but for a drugstore
version I did quite like this made my
hair feel really soft and in really good
condition I have some makeup wipes in
here these are from the yes - range and
it's a soothing cucumber face wipes and
I was using these in the mornings and I
think I think they're nice I went
through a stage of using face wipes in
the morning quite recently I've stopped
doing that now because my skin's getting
a little bit more dehydrated so I've
been using cleansers like proper
cleansers in the morning but if you need
lack of quick wipe these are pretty good
some cotton wool pads from tiger and if
you feel like and going through my
rubbish bin now
someone actually mentioned oh this is
wet gross someone actually mentioned
when I did my hauls that these are
terrible cotton wool pads and they were
right they're too thin I had to use like
two or three air time I definitely won't
be repurchasing those I think I'll stick
to my boots custom wool pads but they
came in pretty packaging so I finished
one of my body shop camomile cleansers
and this is an oil cleanser I've
recommended this in past videos I do
really like it I think it's really good
for removing makeup most oil cleansers
are this one is really soft and gentle
and very affordable as well I did find
that towards
and it was getting a little bit kind of
gross at the bottom I had to just pour
out the end I didn't want to finish it
because it was getting a bit kind of
yucky towards the bottom I don't know
what that's about maybe it doesn't have
good like lasting power and has like a
sell-by date I don't know it didn't last
that well I feel like you need to use it
quickly if you want to use it but it's a
really great oily makeup remover oh I
have a candle in here this is the white
company wild mint peppermint spearmint
and white tea this is so nice I mean
there's nothing left there's a tiny bit
you still smell it it's really fresh I
think this is a really nice one to put
in your that corridor of your house as
you walk in it's really kind of
uplifting and it makes your house or
flat or whatever smell like the white
company which is just the most delicious
smelling relaxing place ever I really
like the look of this candle as well
it's like white and mattes and it comes
with a little lid and yeah I really like
the candle I might actually borrow
another one I have a Bioderma in here of
course not much to say about that it's a
great makeup remover especially for your
eyes I also have a mini or beige dry
texturizing spray and I did repurchase
one of these I like the Bumble and
Bumble version as well but I do think
this one is better and it comes in a
really nice handy handbag size as well I
just spray this in the roots of my hair
like here and judges it up and it gives
it a little bit of texture and volume
and makes it look a little bit messy as
oil which is a sort of look that I like
I have more wipes in here I really went
mad for the yes - wipes apparently I
also tried the yes - blue berries which
to the aedra fresh ones
and the yes - grapefruit ones which are
the correct and repair these are
brightening ones I think these are my
favorite out of all three I really
enjoyed using these in the morning
because they were very brightening and
good for before your makeup but as I
said I'm not really using wipes at the
moment I went through a little stage of
using wipes and the St range I think is
a good one if you do use makeup wipes I
also finished a Sarah Chapman overnight
facial which I'm so completely obsessed
with I've already bought a new one I
love it it's an overnight oil you put on
as your last step in your skincare
routine and sleep with it on your skin
it's amazing if you have dry dehydrated
skin it's so nice to put on it feels
like you're giving yourself some sort of
spa facial it smells incredible and
they've recently launched a morning
facial which is slightly lighter and a
bit more serum like which I'm also
obsessed with I think it's so so good so
yeah as I said I've already bought
another one of these
and this is a staple in my skincare
routine okay only a few things left my
blink clear brow gel I already
repurchase another one this is great for
setting your brows in place I always use
a clear brow gel pretty much every day
also one of my NARS creamy radiant
concealers this one's in vanilla I'm now
using custard because I'm slightly more
tanned and this is a lovely concealer I
use it and like all my videos it's
creamy you can use it under your eyes
you can use it on blemishes
it's definitely by far my favorite
concealer and then I also have a mascara
from Topshop this is their full slasher
mascara and I remember quite liking this
it's got one of those plastic brushes
and it grips the lash as well um I
haven't repurchase it because I have
loads of mascaras to get through but I
definitely would I really enjoyed this
and I think that's everything that's all
my empties so I hope you enjoyed seeing
all the products that I finished and
hearing kind of mini reviews of them
some things I'd repurchase and some I
wouldn't let me know what you finished
recently and whether you will repurchase
it or if you've already forgotten about
it thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
