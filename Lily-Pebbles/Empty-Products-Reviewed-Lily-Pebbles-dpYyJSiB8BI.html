doing a good old fashioned empties video
where I show you all the empty products
that I finish and give you kind of mini
reviews along the way I was a sure if
people still like these kind of videos
or whether you find them boring so I
also on Twitter and I think pretty much
all of you who replied said yes you
still like empties videos so I'm gonna
go ahead and tell you what I think of
all the products obviously I think the
majority of these products I would have
liked because it's unlikely I'll finish
a product unless I like it I do have a
disappointed products video coming up
for the products that I didn't finish
so like I've said products a lot okay so
the first thing is a box of the DHC
silky cotton pad I'm already on to my
second box I went and we purchased
another one from Selfridges beauty
workshop these are great I much prefer
them then a cotton wool when I'm using
it on my face they are double sided so
you use less and they're really really
silky soft and they feel great on your
eyes they don't drag at all because the
eye area is so sensitive so I really
enjoy using these and it's nice to have
them in a little box as well a box of
these I have the price on the bottom
it's 4 pound 50 but as I said they
lasted me a really long time and you can
use both sides I also finished a top of
the first aid Beauty facial radiance
pads and I haven't repurchase this yet I
really need to actually you can get them
on feel unique I loved these you get 60
pads in a pot so they're pre soaked
cotton wool pads and use these on your
face as a chemical exfoliant I don't
really like using physical scrubs that
kind of scrub your face I just
definitely enjoy using those but these
are so easy you just take one do a swipe
turn over do another swipe and your skin
feels exfoliated all the dead skin cells
are kind of been removed and your skin
feels fresh it really adds a glow to
your skin and they're just really easy
to use in the little pop and pre-soaked
pads so I really really recommend these
I've got quite a bit of skincare here so
the next thing is from origins and it's
to make a difference plus moisturizer I
love these little tubs of moisturizers
there's a tiny bit left in there Oh
smells so so good this one I go through
these quite quickly just because I'm not
that fussy with moisturizers I have a
few of these lying around so once I
finished one I just go on to the next
one at the moment I'm using the make a
difference night version I think for the
evening and I'm using the Kate
Somerville moisturizer in the morning I
get most of my hydration from serums but
as
moisturizer I really like this next up
is my ESOP parsley seed mask now this
looks ridiculous because I've used one
of those kind of Rolly things to get all
the product I do go through these quite
quickly and I don't even use it that
often so you probably don't get that
much it's cheap I'm guessing I use it
all over my face as a mask it's my
favorite mask of all time it's great
when I'm feeling a little bit spotty it
really kind of draws all the impurities
out of my skin it dries really funny
with like swirly marks all over your
face but it's also not that hard to wash
off I find a lot of charcoal masks
really hard to remove and this one isn't
as cool you leave it on your skin for
like 20 minutes so I've normally put it
on and then I watch YouTube videos and
then I wash it off and it's great I
think this is probably like my fourth
one so I'm definitely gonna get another
one next time I make a copy see order I
also finished a tub of my Emma Hardy
amazing face Moringa cleansing balm
longest name ever this packaging this
terrible is completely cracked and
leaked everywhere but this is just a tub
of her cleansing balm this is I think
the big one and I've used it all up I
really like using this one in the
evenings because it's really really
hydrating I always recommend that osteo
renascence cleanser which is great for
morning and night but this one if you
have really dry dehydrated skin is
really nice because it's a really
nourishing moisturizing cleansing balm
so it starts like a barber you put a
little bit in your hand and it turns
into an oil so remove makeup really well
I use this on my eyes and my skin it
just leaves my skin feeling really
moisturized and not at all like strips I
think I've already got another one of
these so I haven't had to buy another
one yet I'm working my way through the
other pot now okay I think I'm done with
skincare now so now onto a bit of hair
and I have to collab dry shampoos I go
through these mini ones very quickly
you're probably not really supposed I
think they're meant just to be for your
handbag but I should prefer the formula
in the smaller ones compared to most dry
shampoos they don't make your hair wrap
that white I find that the bigger ones
are more likely to make my hair white
then the small ones it might be because
I use more I don't know what the theory
is so I prefer using the little ones but
I do go through them very quickly my
favorite scent out of all of them is the
London one in the black packaging I
really like that so Ashley what is it
classic fragrance and then this one is
New York which is a fruity fragrance
these are really good I think they are
just so affordable so easy finding the
perfect dress
who is pretty much impossible I've just
stopped looking but these are definitely
my favorite out of all the ones I've
tried I also finished one of the nail
polish pots from Bourjois now I've raved
about these in the past they're just
little pots you stick your finger in to
take your nail polish off there's like
foam soaked in nail polish remover and
this is the one that you can also use on
your toes because there's a little bit
in the lid as well I've always raved
about these they're really fast easy to
use make your life so much easier that's
why nail polish remover is all kind of
in there in one but recently my nails
have just been so dry and flaking and I
couldn't really understand what it was
because I wasn't really doing anything
different I know the weather and the
winter kind of makes a difference but
what I realized is when I use these I
put my whole finger in so it really kind
of dries out my finger and cuticle area
because normally when you use nail
polish remover you just pull on your
nails but with this you put your whole
finger in so I found that it was
actually drying my fingers up as well
which obviously affects your nails so
I've stopped using this for now and I've
gone back to nail polish remover and it
is actually really helping which is the
shame but it's kind of interesting if
you do find your nails that quite dry
and you use these I think it might be
this drawing them out I finished a
little dip teak Bay handle well nearly
it's one of those things that you just
keep burning it and then it keeps
melting and then turn into wax again I
love BAE I have the perfume that goes
with BAE which I can never pronounce
it's like long de leur or something like
that but I love I love the basin I think
it's actually my favorite from all the
dip teak cents and this is just a little
mini candle I think I got this with a
gift with purchase from Space NK such a
nice little treat if you do what shoot
yourself I have a body shop shower gel
here this is the wild argan oil I was
going to say that this doesn't lather up
that much but it kind of looks really
bubbly it's only because I tried to like
rinse it out just before doing this
video that's all bubbled up but it isn't
a very kind of bubbly foamy shower gel
it's made with argan oil so it's very
nourishing and moisturizing actually
really did like it me and rich both use
this one it smells nice it smells quite
soupy and that's much to me I don't
really repurchase body shop shower gels
are always thought to try some kind of a
different scent but I did really enjoy
using this and I would recommend it now
because that wasn't that many products I
thought I'd also throw in products that
I've nearly finished because I don't
make these videos that often so some of
these products I'm very very nearly
finished so I thought I will talk
through
as well first of all is the LA
roche-posay my Scylla solution which
I've got that much left of it and I've
really really enjoyed using this I think
in the last video where I mentioned this
I said why Dermot is hard to get hold of
and there are loads of comments saying
don't be ridiculous you can get it in
almost any pharmacy but what I mean is
they still don't sell it in boots and
Superdrug which is kind of where most
people go to get their stuff form are
still there you want to get a makeup
remover so I gave this one a go from LA
roche-posay and I really like it I think
I actually prefer to Bioderma
I really like the packaging because it
squirts out really easily onto the
cotton pad which makes the whole thing
so much quicker it's a very kind of slim
bottles easy to store and it feels great
on my eyes and skin I can't use this in
the morning when I want to give my skin
a quick kind of cleanse I can't both to
do the whole cleansing thing I use this
on my little DHC pads and I really like
it but you know why what I keep thinking
it's got like a sweet scent it doesn't
have any center it is very gentle and
I've been enjoying using this I've also
nearly finished my Charlotte Tilbury
take it all off genius I makeup remover
I just don't know how I feel about this
I definitely wouldn't repurchase it
because I just felt like I'd want to try
some other makeup remove this as well it
does come with a little pump which is
much sprayed everywhere which is handy
but I find that when you pump it with a
cotton pad it kind of squirts out the
size it's always a bit messing because
it's blue you have to be so careful I've
had an incident where I've squirted blue
all over myself which is very annoying
through the pot I don't think is perfect
the solution is nice I don't wear
waterproof eye makeup Arriba so it takes
my makeup off fine but it's not like a
one sweep wonder it does need a little
bit of work so not quite the perfect eye
makeup remover but I'm happy I tried it
I nearly finished these before I moved
on to something else they're really
grubby from the shower as me before but
ill it's the bumble and bumble
hairdressers invisible oil shampoo and
conditioner I'm gonna put these down
because they're a bit worse it says that
it's a really lightweight feather but I
actually found it to be too heavy on my
hair and I have dry hair so that's
saying something
I just found using it everytime was just
weighing my hair down and I never felt
like had clean hair after I washed it
there was just too much kind of moisture
going on so I stopped using those I'm
now using the sunday shampoo and the
living proof frizz free conditioner
together which I really like but if you
have really really dry hair there may be
using those every
other wash would be good I've also
nearly finished this which is a
miniature version of the honorifics Kerr
Amuro fixer or avexir I don't know queen
of Hungary mist I would never buy the
full size of this because it's just so
so expensive but I've had a couple of
these minis before in travel sizes or
form what that's gone from a gift with
purchase and I really really like it
it's just a toner mist
I think the full-size the spray is
better because this one's a bit like
direct so I can't spray it directly onto
my face because I end up like squirting
in my eye but what I do is I gave a
couple of sprays in my hands and kind of
press them together and then just press
it onto my skin and it feels really nice
and fresh tones my skin and I always
take that with me when I'm traveling
just because it's such a good size okay
a couple more things two things for lips
my Mac syrup lipstick I talk about syrup
all the time look how much is left tiny
tiny tiny man I never finished lipstick
so I feel really proud of this I think I
actually may have finished this already
this might be my second one I don't know
but it's like my all-time favorite
lipstick it's so easy to wear it's like
a slightly more plummy version than my
own lip color and I'm never you gonna
keep this because I already have enough
empty Mac products that when I finish
this one I think I could do like a back
to Mac when you get a free lipstick so
I'll probably just get another syrup
because I love it and I've also nearly
finished my cowman's cop it's German so
I'm sorry to my German viewers Kofman
kinder cream so I think this originally
started as a nappy cream for babies but
they made a little lip balm version and
a lovely subscribers sent this to me
like a year ago when I was suffering
from really sore lips and this is my
all-time favorite lip balm I just don't
use anything else I mean I can't believe
this when I'm out and about because it
is a white cream and it makes my lips
really white if you ever watch my vlogs
and think why are her lips so weird and
white it's probably because I've got
this on it and I have got a really sore
lips at the moment it just comes and
goes sometimes I'm trying new lip
products I get like an allergic reaction
and takes ages to heal but this lip balm
is so great it's a cream which I much
prefer then the sort of Vaseline II
slippy petroleum type lip balms they
don't do anything for me it's like a
quick fix but the reason you're you're
reapplying cellphone is because it's not
actually doing what it needs to do
whereas I find the creams really soak in
the lips and just give so much more
moisture and they've really healed my
lips when they all saw so I love this
I'm nearly running out and rich couldn't
find any when he went to Hamburg
recently so I think I'll just have to
make a trip out to Germany to buy a load
of these so those are all my empties for
this Oscars a month but it's been longer
than a month I'm just gonna do these
every now and again when I do finish up
a few of my products I hope you enjoyed
hearing what I thought of them and as I
said I will have a disappointing
products coming up soon for now that's
all please don't forget to subscribe to
my channel it is free and it just means
that you get updates for all my videos
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys on Sunday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
