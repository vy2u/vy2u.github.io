alternatives and I've called it that
because some of them are Essie nail
polish dupes the colors are exactly the
same but some of them a little bit
different and they're kind of just
alternative colors that similar just as
nice but slightly different as you guys
know I love Essie nail polishes I have
done since I was really young I used to
buy them before they came to boots and
Superdrug when they were I think we
started is about 13 pounds and then they
went down to 10 pounds I really like
them I know some people say that they
chip but I get on really well with them
and I love the colors and I just have a
huge collection so I thought it might be
a nice idea to show you some alternative
brands that do very similar colors and I
have 10 nail polishes here to show you
so I'm gonna get started because this
might take a while so the first one I
have is Essie San Tropez and I bought
this one I bought topless and barefoot I
think I bought them together about two
years ago
and it's a really nice nude quite a
light-colored sandy nude and the
drugstore alternative I have to go with
this is one of the Barry M jelly shines
and I've got a lot of these in this
video because they're just so good and
they come in such nice colors and this
one is in light G which is pretty much
exactly the same color like she's
slightly darker than se San Tropez but
they're really similar
I love the barium jelly shines and the
quality is so good and they're so thick
and so I'd really recommend giving this
because this is only 399 compared to San
Tropez which I don't know if they do
this color in the boots and Superdrug
collection so this could still be 995 if
not then the ones includes $7.99 so
they're not that expensive anymore but
399 is such a bargain compared and the
colors are exactly the same the next SUV
nail polish I have is merino cool and I
love this one I think it's so smart and
chic it's kind of like a topi color um
it's quite dark on the nails but really
really pretty and this is a sort of
business meeting color I think and the
drugstore version I have to compare is
fashionista rhythm and fashionistas a
brand you can get in Superdrug in the UK
I don't know if they're sold anywhere
else sorry I have a look online but you
can get them as a super drug and super
super cheap there You've really nice
blushes and eyeshadows as well but these
colors are really similar memory Nakul
is slightly slightly darker but they're
really really similar obviously i think
the quality of SC is much better
compared to fashionista but if you're
just looking for color then this is a
good alternative i paint my nails sort
of every other day so for me the quality
of the nail polish isn't that important
because i'm going to just read you my
nails anyway but if you're the sort of
person you like good quality nail polish
then i think in most cases SC version is
better than the drugstore but i'll let
you know if not and the next polish is
Essie tart deco I absolutely love this
one it's like a really really light
coral with slightly peachy tone in it I
always get compliments when I wear this
one is the perfect kind of spring/summer
polish and the drugstore what I have to
compare is another barium jelly and this
one is called papaya
I think the barium jellies are just all
really se kind of colors I have quite a
few like I said in this video but these
are really really similar the SU one is
slightly slightly darker but seriously
they're so similar I'd definitely go for
the 399 one over the $7.99 one but you
can get tart deco in the super drug and
Boots range but yeah these are really
really similar and I love this color
the next se polish I have is lydic ism
and this one is such a blogger color
everyone has it I think it's just a
really really pretty light look as the
name suggests another really nice
spring/summer color and I love this one
it's kind of quite unique I think I
don't have a lot of lilacs so I really
enjoy wearing this one and the drugstore
turn tip I have is a new one for models
own I think these are five pounds most
models own polishes are I'll have a
check if this one's more expensive I'll
let you know but it's from their
segmented range and it's called grape
juice and it's a really nice color so
the thing with these polishes they're
meant to smell so it's like grape juice
and you can scratch at the top and have
a little sniff and that smells like
great but I'm not so sure that the
Polish actually smells of grape I gave
it quite a big sniff and then fell bit
sick from all the chemicals but these
two are really similar again se is a
tiny bit darker modders own ones about
five pounds s he's about 799 so it's not
a huge difference but the models own one
is scented apparently so if you're into
that kind of thing then go for the
border zone but yeah that's quite a good
deep there the next one isn't so much a
dupe and it's
for se-min candy apple this is my
all-time favorite nail polish it's the
best mint colored polish ever I have two
of these because I was so worried about
running now I have one of the old
versions of one of the new version and
there are lots of min nail polishes out
there so if you want one that's exactly
the same it's so easy just everyone will
have one room all will have one they all
have them but I wanted to talk about
this one today because I am huge fan and
this is the bourgeois it's Solak glossy
which I think there's a new launch for
them and the color is Siri for Amanda
feel the a French name something like
that and I'm wearing this today I've
been wearing it in my past few videos I
love it it's more like a true mint color
and but Essie mint candy apples more of
a bluey mint but I just love the border
or color so much that I wanted to
mention it and the border on 6 pounds so
it's only kind of couple pounds cheaper
than se but I really really like this of
greeny mint to it and I've just been
addicted to it recently so that's a nice
alternative if you want to go for a
slightly different because everyone
wears in Candia the next se polish is
lapis of luxury and I love this one I
feel like this is a bit underrated if
you're gonna talk about it that often
but it's a really nice blue and it's
kind of a purpley blue it's just a bit
different to your average blue and I
really really like it this is one of the
new ones
yeah lapis of luxury I love that color
and the alternative I have to that is
another berry and jelly and this one is
in blueberry which I've already spoken
about in a couple of my videos I love
the color but it's pretty much exactly
the same the barium one's slightly
brighter this time very similar shades
but barium is a little bit more like a
pop of color but they're really similar
and I think again for 399 these polishes
are amazing they're such a good deal
next up is Essie cute as a button and
this is one of the most popular polishes
I think I always see people talk about
it and it's a really pretty pinky coral
it's definitely got more pink in it than
orange and I really really love this and
another spring/summer amazing color I do
wear this all year round I seem to wear
summer colors all year round
anyway the alternative I have is from
Bourjois and this is one of their no
chip polishes and it's a number 25
these are $5.99 so compared to se $7.99
the color is against Kauai did a blog
post on this like a year ago I'll try
and find it in linkable
but seriously these are so similar
they're in sack you the same and I
actually even though there's not a huge
price difference
I really like the bourgeois it goes on
really thick just like one coat you
don't even need two coats and the brush
is kind of short and angled so I really
like applying this actually a really
impressed with these no chip border on
nail polishes and and the color match is
just exactly the same next up is Essie
glamour purse which I really like the
name for this song this is quite similar
to a couple of other Essie nail polishes
that I have is kind of a brownie gray
color I say like a light brown and even
though I wouldn't normally pick brown
nail polish I think this doesn't look
really smart and when I wear it I always
really liked it I just forget to wear it
that often but I'm gonna compare this to
Topshop Big Smoke and these aren't
really dude they're quite different
really SC is definitely a lot darker and
Topshop Big Smoke is more kind of light
gray but they're similar sort of thing
so if you want something similar and
you're struggling to find an exact dupe
then I would recommend a stop shot one I
love Topshop nail polishes I think
they're really good quality and they're
five pounds which is a pretty good deal
I think and there's so many colors to
pick from and I have loads of Topshop
nail polishes so I'd recommend go and
have any look and yeah these two are
quite similar next is Essie splash of
grenadine and this color just makes me
smile I call this like the Barbie pink
it's kind of a pinky purple it just
reminds me of Barbie I love it I don't
worry that often I don't really wear
Pink's that often but when I do it
always makes me feel happy and summery
and really pretty color I think and I'm
comparing this one to model zone lilac
dream these again aren't exact cubes you
can see the SE one's a lot more pink in
the model zones a lot more purple but
they have similar kind of tones to them
and they're both kind of pretty pinky
purples so I thought I'd throw them into
this video I do like models own nail
polishes I don't hear the best quality
but like I said I paint my nails so
often it doesn't really matter if they
chip after a couple of days but yeah
those are both pretty pinky purple
colors and finally Essie bikini so teeny
all the bloggers went crazy over this
now
when it came out I don't know what it is
about it it's kind of a purpley blue it
reminds me of blackness of luxury a
little bit they're really quite similar
actually bikini so teeny is slightly
lighter it also has this like crazy
shimmer going through it which I didn't
really realize when I bought it I do
find this one quite hard to apply the
second coat kind of goes on it's
different color to the first so I'm
always a bit mmmm about this one and I'm
comparing this one to Rimmel London Pro
professional finish 420 aqua cool and
that's this one and I'd actually
recommend this one over see because this
bikini so teeny I don't know what it is
about it but just applies funny and the
Rimmel pro nail polishes are really good
and apply it really nicely and the color
is really similar the river one doesn't
have the shimmer running through it but
in terms of like the purpley blue
recolor I think they're really similar
and the red more one is about 459 that's
what it is a boots compared to the 799
se so it's quite a good deal and I think
there are more nail polish is a really
good quality
that's all ten nail polishes I hope you
liked seeing them and I hope it kind of
helped you if you wanted to get some
alternative nail polishes to SC because
I know everyone has SC they're not that
cheap they're not really that easy to
get hold of so hopefully that helps you
a little bit thank you for watching and
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it and I'll see you my name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
