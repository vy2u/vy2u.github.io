video for my friends and family and your
comments are just making me love so much
it's like making me relive it and I
still feel really awkward vlogging but
whatever I'm gonna get on with it it's
Wednesday today and I thought I'd start
vlogging because I'm not sure what else
I've got planned for the rest of the
week but I thought I'd do like a 2 day
vlog and this morning I am going to
essays book launch which would be really
fun and then I'm going for lunch with
Fleur and Amelia and I haven't seen them
in ages so it's really nice to catch up

eyeliner today and I'm wearing faux
leather trousers if my asus unboxing

that some honey I just put on my autumn
coat for the first time and found some
old gross tissues in the pockets last

need to put that on I think I'm gonna
sign off of this today's vlog and I vlog
another day either tomorrow or on the
weekend so see you guys then morning
everyone today it is Sunday I think I
was meant to vlog yesterday but I forgot
and we've ended up actually having quite
a boring weekend we have not got many
plans today we're just gonna go for a
walk in Kenwood with my parents really
we both really feel like we need a walk
I think
yesterday was just a bit of a crush to a
big day and then we're gonna go to lunch
and then we're going back to my parents
to look at our wedding photos we got
them on Friday night it was the most
exciting thing ever
a photographer Razia did such an
incredible job and also she sent me like
all the photos editor she didn't just
like cut them down to just like a few
there was like two thousand and
something there's a lot to go through
but they're better than I could have
ever imagined I'm so so happy with them
so me in which you've looked at them a
couple of times there's so many though I
thought I could keep missing some I need
to like sort them all out into different
categories
and which ones to put in a book which
ones to put in a blog post but today
we're gonna go to my parents and show
them the photos it's a really nice sunny
day actually actually what I'm wearing
this is my new a sauce jumper which you
guys would have seen in my whole video
you haven't seen that I will link it it
was a patron haul where I decided in the
video whether I was gonna keep it or
return the item these jeans are gap and
then I'm sorry my neck trainers because
it's Sunday and I want to be comfy but I
actually have clean hair for once on a
Sunday me and rich stayed in last night
and I wash my hand because we are very
cool I need sunglasses this is where I
keep my sunglasses I think I'm really
into these ones again at the moment
which are they're very bands I'm also
wearing my saline bag and my denim
jacket which is from Daisy Street on a
sauce with my little flying dollar pin
love that we woke up a bit late today so
we're running late for this walk we're
like 20 minutes behind my parents so we
have to try and catch up with them
power walk Sunday morning power look out
on lava flow looks proper also in London
we're gonna go to Carlito for lunch I'm
not a massive fan of college show cuz

go to Space NK because what did you want
