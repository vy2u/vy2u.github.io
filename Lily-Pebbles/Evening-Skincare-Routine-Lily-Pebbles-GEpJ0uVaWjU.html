skincare series if you haven't seen the
first one I'll link it here and it was
my morning skincare routine this video
is going to be my evening skincare
routine which is a little bit longer so
I really hope you enjoy it
the first thing I do when I get home in
the evening especially if I've been out
in London all day is run upstairs and
start my evening skincare routine I
start by washing my hands as usual but
it's particularly important if I've been
on the cheap I just want to get rid of
any bacteria before I start touching my
face I then take a cotton wool pad but
this time I split it in half down the
middle
I take a couple of pumps of Bioderma on
each half and then I use this to remove
my eye makeup this works fine for me
because I don't use waterproof makeup
but if you do wear waterproof mascara or
waterproof eye shadow and a really good
eye makeup remover is the Clarins
instant eye makeup remover I like to
double cleanse and the first cleanser I
use is the Wren
clarifying cleanser it's clay based so
it's really clarifying but doesn't leave
your skin feeling strips at all it also
helps to remove all your makeup
I massage this into the skin before
moving it with a muslin cloth
the second cleanser I use is the Emma
Hardy amazing face cleansing balm I
really like to use this because it's
really nourishing and moisturizing on
the skin it's oil-based so you can
really kind of work it into the skin I
just take a spatula and take a small
amount and then rub it all over my skin
really kind of massaging it in
when I finished massaging it into the
skin I then remove it using a muslin
cloth
when I finish cleansing I just Pat my
face dry with a clean towel every other
night I like to exfoliate my lips using
the fresh sugar lip polish this tastes
amazing and it's really good for getting
rid of any dry dead skin on your lips
after I finished exfoliating I just
rinse it off using some water then for
exfoliating I like to use the pixie glow
tonic which is an exfoliating toner I
prefer this to a harsh scrub and it
means I can use it every evening so I
just take a couple of tops at a custom
old pad and apply it all over my face
after I've done this I take my second
toner which is the LA roche-posay Sera's
ink which unfortunately you can't get in
the UK you could only get in France for
eye cream I really like the super
facialist by owner Brennan vitamin C
brightening eye cream it smells amazing
it smells like chocolate oranges and I
should take my ring finger and apply it
around the eye sockets then for my
evening moisturizer
I love the origins high potency nighta
means it's really thick so I like to
apply lots of it at night before I go to
bed and I just rub this all over the
skin
you've seen this before is my Clarins
extra firming neck cream I'm still using
it and hoping it'd prevent a turkey neck
when I'm older so I just apply this in
an upward motion to my neck thanks for
watching don't forget to come back on
Sunday to see my video on my favorite
masks and treatments and oils and all
things like that I hope you liked this
one and I'll see you guys on Sunday bye
hi welcome to the first video in my
three-part skincare series this is going
to be my morning skincare routine I
really hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
