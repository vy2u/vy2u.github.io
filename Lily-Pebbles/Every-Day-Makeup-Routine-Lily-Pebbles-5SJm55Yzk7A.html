is going to be my current everyday
makeup routine as you know the look is
always very similar I know what I like
and what suits my face but the products
are slightly different in this video I
haven't done one of these videos in a
while so I thought I'd just show you
what I'm currently wearing on my face
all the products used in this video are
going to be linked below in the
description box so go check that out and
the next shot you see will be me with a
no makeup so don't get a shock but I
really hope you guys enjoy this tutorial
I'm going to start by using my MLS Rosie
for autograph amazing radiance cream
this is just a really nice hydrating
glowing primer I like to use a primer
when I have time as a book quite dry
skin and then using my Mac Studio sculpt
foundation and NC 20 I'm really liking
this foundation at the moment it's kind
of medium coverage it gives quite a nice
glowy finish and I like to apply it with
a damp Real Techniques complexion sponge
so I just bounce that all over my face
until I get the coverage that I want
I'm then using my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer I use this under my eyes down
my nose around my nose and on my chin
and then I go in again with a damp
sponge to mesh it all into the skin and
sometimes I take my Real Techniques
setting brush just because I get a bit
Creasy under my eye and then using the
tarte smooth operator finishing powder
just underneath the eye to prevent any
creasing where I put the concealer for
bronzer I'm using the new NARS
limited edition Laguna bronzer I'm
pretty sure this is the same as the
original Laguna but it's got a very
strong scent of like Sun cream I really
like it but I think if you're sensitive
skin the scent might not be for you for
blush I'm using Bobbi Brown pink rose a
really nice and natural rosy pink I'm
just putting that on the apples of my
cheeks for highlights and using Becca
moonstone highlighter and just applying
a tiny bit on the tops of my cheekbones
this has been my favorite highlighter
for quite a few months now for my
eyebrows I'm using a Delilah brow line
in Ashe I just brush through my brows
first and then apply a tiny amount in
the front and the arches of my brows
and then using a clear eyebrows to set
them all in place for my eyeshadow I'm
using the new Clarins waterproof cream
eyeshadow in copper Brown this is really
nice you can either wear it really sheer
or you can keep layering it up I like to
use a flat brush to apply onto the lid
and then a bigger fluffier brush to
blend it out and you can just keep
applying it until you get the required
amount and it's a really pretty copper
color
so implying that all over the lid making
sure to blend it out and I also like to
apply it under the eye as well for my
eyeliner I'm using Mac groundbreaker I
absolutely love this eyeliner at the
moment it's so easy to use it's so soft
I like to apply it to the top lashline
and then sometimes I like to use a brush
just to blend it out and make the edges
really soft
I blend eyeliner pretty much every day
for the past two months
my mascara I'm using the Tarte lights
camera lashes again one I've been using
a lot of the past month it really
defines and lengthens the lashes it's
quite a wet formula so I tend to get it
on my eyelid like I did today but it's
really nice and then at this point I
like to use a setting spray this is the
Clarins fix makeup and it's very
refreshing my lips I'm using the Kylie
Jenner lip kit in Kandy K this is the
most neutral shade that I picked up I
just line the lips and then use the
liquid lipstick and it really does stay
put all day so please let me know what
