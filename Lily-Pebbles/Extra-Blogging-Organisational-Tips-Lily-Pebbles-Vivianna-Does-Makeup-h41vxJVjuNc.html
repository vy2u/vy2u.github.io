and this is our final installment of our
little guide to blogging and vlogging
series but sad it's ending but hopefully
you guys have enjoyed it today on Anna's
channel is some extra vlogging tips so
I'll link that here and you can go and
watch that after this one watch this one
first if it's not lots of extra tips for
vlogging in my organization and things
like that it's kind of if you've had
your blog for a while now and you're
thinking what what now yeah well now
grow it a little bit and just feeling
uninspired this is a few extra tips so
good place to start is to get very
organized which is something that we're
both quite hot on we are big fans of the
notebooks it's just in our personalities
we're those kind of list making type of
annoying people yeah see if you like out
and about if you ever come up with blog
ideas or anything just get your phone
out and you might have to see Anna on
the tube you other shoots yet which is
like seriously it might and look this
for some day differences if you have an
idea and you feel inspired just go with
it
yeah definitely notes on your phone is
awesome for that and the amount of times
that I will wake up just before I'm
about to going to sleep like you know
you kind of shot yourself off yeah I
just had a good idea for blog post like
so definitely keep a note-taking device
near you at all times because
inspiration can happen a huh yeah and
with your notepad if you do have a nope
I just make a kind of the list routine
thing like me and Anna's video with
videos you know if you use take blog
photos if you need to write post if you
need to like add in any links have a
little list then you can just tick off
as you go makes it a little stress-free
we actually make my own tick boxes
because the eyes how Virgo I am or mood
you do there's a nice lists with the
tick boxes I like those see I get a
notepad get organized it makes it a lot
more enjoyable I think also you've
mentioned this briefly before promoting
your blog post but really go for it I
think it looks good kind of promote it
overly promoted behind remember people
see a Twitter feed for like seconds so
doing about it throughout the day if you
like no one's going to be annoyed you've
got a blog post you're proud of tell
people about it yeah and you can do for
Facebook posts as well yes because
really good one as well
and to not do it so much on Instagram
its grounds more about just sharing
pretty photos if you type in a really
pretty blog picture that you want to
share is a good idea to say hey this is
on my blog today and also on Instagram
definitely make sure your blog link is
linked up on your Instagram because I
think I get quite a few people coming to
say hello from them yeah and with
Facebook the posts that you put on
Facebook if you have a page office in
your personal page it shows up on
people's home fee so add a nice big
image as well yeah I know to get
people's attention put your link in
there everything that's a nice way yeah
on Facebook I always write a little kind
of introverted post then do a link to
the post and then load a separate photo
yeah it comes up in life and they con
people same pages actually that reminds
me photos if you are on blog loving
which if you're not you should put your
blog blog um it's a great way to follow
a lot of it the first photo they show on
blog blogging is the first photo from
your posts so if you are going to choose
what your first photo should be choose
your favorite one and the best one that
you think of so always put that kind of
app top yeah that's a headlining pitch
exactly so if you work full time and you
have your blog or YouTube as a hobby on
the side then you're probably thinking I
have time to tweet all day about my blog
that is fair enough so you can actually
schedule tweets and Facebook posts
I wouldn't recommend kind of overly
scheduling but if you want to get a few
tweets out throughout the day arm I use
TweetDeck and I'm a big HootSuite lover
yeah Lee hates HootSuite I just might
tweet them it's amazing it's really
really good lightly exec just for the
odd kind of tweet here and there if
you're out and about or the amounts
hundred without internet connection for
the day because you're in a restaurant
doesn't happen they don't have Wi-Fi
will tell and you can schedule Facebook
as well and I'm sure there's tutorials
online but it's quite easy very one of
the best bits about blogging is the
comments and kind of just like run with
that the amount of inspiration and ideas
the post that you can get from your
readers is incredible I actually find
sometimes and comments but my blog
especially like they just crack me up
they actually make me laugh so much
they're so funny or such a funny Bunch
it's great
it's definitely take inspiration from
the comments if something is saying
maybe your lighting isn't fabulous take
that on it's not a bad thing taking
instructive criticism it's an awesome
thing like yeah that's how you don't get
bit to get better if you've been a bit
uninspired as well take inspiration from
offline from your family and friends
sometimes your friends to say people say
to me I just can't get eyeliner right no
matter what I do it does this it smudges
down my face and I'm like oh I go
different blog post you know we get
quite involved in the whole beauty
blogging community forget that we all
kind of know a lot about beauty yes it's
nice sometimes speak to like friends or
family who don't notice much and take
some inspiration from there as well we
often get asked about how to grow your
blog and I know people get really
frustrated that they haven't got many
people reading their blogs but I think
it's important to remember that it does
take a while and it's nice to have that
organic growth I think for the first
year and a half like 30 people read my
blog and you know it just takes a while
so although these little things could
help just let it grow organically
because as well as math is amazing and i
think i blog for about whole month
before even one person stumbled across
my little corner of the internet and it
just takes a long time I mean you know
doing this very year there for years I
really have my blog for four years
yeah and I've had my for most four years
as I said it's a long hard slog by if
you really love it then just keep going
with it and you know who will start to
be so the main things take away from
this is just enjoy it enjoy having a
blog and feel passionate about it and it
will come across in the front signage so
I hope you guys have enjoyed this little
series and don't forget to check out on
his video today on a blog it's yeah oh
