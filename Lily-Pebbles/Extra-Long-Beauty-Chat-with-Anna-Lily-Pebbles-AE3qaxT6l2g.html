do another beauty chat video and I'm
here with Anna hello when we tweeted
last night ask you guys some questions
and there were so many so many are so
many good ones so many good ones so
we're gonna make this an extra-long
version instead of five questions we're
gonna do ten what so question 1 from
attic Zaheer what makeup tips for
mummies on a school run I usually have
two minutes two minutes I'm quite good
at getting quick you're like ready
really quickly so I would say concealer
number one mascara and there's something
like a little perky on the lip like the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stain
and shade lovesick loving this at the
moment yeah I was gonna say concealer
mascara and blusher because I think a
little color to your cheeks is nice and
my sister's a mom so I know you could do
that quite quickly but if you get
eyelash extensions then you have time
for a bit of lip color
oh yeah that's too eyelash extensions
yeah
brow threading yeah you meet nothing is
amazing because they stay curled as well
you just don't need to come together at
all Lisa D said is there any area of
makeup you feel you have yet to master
or just can't get the hang of yes what's
yours
eyeliner oh yeah I'm really getting
those eyeliner and now I wear it more on
a daily basis and I'm finding the Kohl
pencils are just the way to go there
they're easiest to apply the easiest to
blend if you make mistakes it's very
easy to correct and but I I'm not sure
if REI forget it you will yes I think
for me I was thinking about this one I
think for mines concealer which is a bit
more weird but I tend to just get my
concealing go I put loads on but I blend
it in and then I was like Lisa elders
video and I'm like oh yeah there's
actually like a trick to it me like
layering and less is more and pin point
concealing and I'm just a bit like
rushed I can I just put it everywhere
and I ends up looking a bit heavy in
places so that's something I could
definitely do better pin point
concealing yeah I always righteous I've
got one on my forehead right now and I
was like I'm gonna get my Laura Mercier
super camouflage and dot it on and in
fact I just got this like concealer on
was up yeah
I always waited more on an area that I
need it but it's quicker
Belu says best long-lasting foundation I
have to I think good old yeah
Armani Giorgio Armani luminous silk it's
just awesome it just clings for days
it's great in a good way in a good way
but recently I've been loving this
makeup forever HD foundation I have to
shave one to five is what I'm wearing
today and actually it's really long last
thing I'd say it's a bit more matte than
other ones like that I've normally go
for but it really does look pretty
amazing on I've never sure I don't rent
stuff I don't like it I would like to
funky packaging yeah it's like had a
spill inside all that that doesn't
please it my one I would normally say
that Armani one as well but within the
last week I've absolutely fall in love
with a new foundation yesterday this is
the rmk creamy foundation and it comes
in a pot so normally I would just be
like no no way but it's amazing it's
Neverland yeah it's medium to full
coverage so it's a little bit like more
coverage that I would normally use but
I'm wearing it today and I've been
wearing it all week
amazing you don't need a tiny amount and
it just kind of like blends into your
skin and it's amazing and it's there but
at the end of the day I look in the
mirror and I still have the same like
Foundation which is really rare for me
because normally just disappears you're
making me want to try this it's so good
I really want you to try it cuz like
tiniest amount it's so like pigmented
it's amazing maybe I can escape a little
bit out yeah I could possibly because
I'm okay Francesca asked if you would
have the opportunity to design a
lipstick what would it look like and
what name I'm like coverage I was
thinking about this in the shower while
I was getting ready for this and I was
thinking a really hot like orangey red
yeah I needed to find yeah kind of like
NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil and red
sweat I feel like it would be down that
Avenue and then I thought of his name I
think I would cool it
bah-bah vivy baboon like Vava Pippi like
that get back in oh I don't know black
very simple chic but be very mad I know
that I'd be very matte lipstick yeah
about you okay oh my god of you like it
yeah okay so they're color wise I think
if I was gonna make my own lipstick I'd
want to be able to wear it all the time
so I wanted to be up in everyday
lipstick so I think might be a mix of
patisserie and syrup for mac so that's
patisserie and then that's syrup and
they're like how to your favorite lay
neutrally ones I think I'm wearing the
both on my lips today so second eyes
everyday easy to our color
that's what color it goes okay and the
name the name I don't know exact name
but I don't think any other like lip see
brand they always die picked like either
then you know the little typically stuff
I think I read funnies name lipstick
after like emotions and feelings so you
can have like pissed off you could have
so many different get my Envy and then
packaging wise the same like black I
love Chanel lip sticks and but I
wouldn't have the gold bit and I would
have like a really simple logo you can't
even really tell it's a logo definitely
glossy I hate Matt because say the knob
okay so kawaii
our ladies cuz they're quite sick oh
another kitchen there's a guitar I did
like created yeah you need I wouldn't
have a lid I feel is annoying when you
have to hold the lid in your hand wiping
on lipsticks I'd make away so you can
like press up something and it like pops
out the other end or just like knowledge
lick or like something like to new you
go out that and now it comes up oh yeah
they're quite cool if I'd make away if
not I'm to have a lid set for it that
would be my lipstick I kind of want to
see these
Sophie asked is there any products
you've bought or received lately that
you think overrated this one is kind of
not necessarily lately but in the last
like few months the bumble and bumble
City swept finish so excited about this
I always love bumble bumble releases
anything that's to do with big hair from
them it's awesome in my eyes but this I
just didn't really feel it to me it was
a bit too gel like in consistency it's a
bit too tacky in my hair and I prefer
thickening products to be more matte
yeah I quite liked it but I definitely
prefer the dry spun finish dry someone
finish yeah all over that my one which
you're getting it really upset about
it's good it's good that we liked it
isn't everything anyway - MacLaren's
radiance + golden go booster oily
Clarins is amazing for tanning and I
don't think there's a terrible tool it's
just not what I hoped it would be
it's basically a little kind of tanning
solution that you put a few drops into
your moisturizer and you can make any
moisturizer into like your tanning
moisturize and I think it's a genius
idea but I just found this kind of
didn't look that great I mean it kind of
collected around my nose and chin and ii
didn't look as natural as the
liquid one well yeah like liquid gold no
look really good go it's like a liquid
bronze good living tanning yeah I love
that one and I just didn't fer this I
didn't like it as much
I understand it because foo said you get
to meet your a list crush describe the
makeup you'd go for okay so mine will be
Ryan Gosling
and I feel like I would keep it quite
natural because I want Ryan to like me
for me you know I don't really have an
a-list crush but when I when I first
made this question I thought like Justin
Timberlake Kim's right let's go with him
because I love him
and he's with Jessica be alright yeah so
I did a bit googling and what this could
be this is a good library it's good idea
obviously like the way she looks
she's very glowy natural my yeah she's
got quite a golden goddess eyeshadow
of like I have a heavy flutter yeah I
definitely like a natural lip I think he
likes natural girls and I would woo him
you put your research into that I love
that matt72 says how about makeup
shopping tips I'm not sure about this
one I feel like I want to hear your
answer okay so in the drugstore are
these different drugs so and high-end
shopping for me so in the drugstore I
would say when you're trying foundation
try it on your chin and neck and then go
outside it's a natural daylight to have
a look in the mirror because those
lights and boots and Superdrug and not
good yeah I think that's a good one I
was thinking more along the lines of
whenever I go you'd be shopping I get a
basket I fill it up and I have a great
time and then before it actually gets
the till I always have a bit of a moment
and I think I really need this and I try
and look and I see if I've got dupes
among my stash already at home yeah and
I kind of have a quick little do I
really need this moment and just check
myself you know yeah don't be afraid I'd
like to ask if the product you want is
an owl they prefer to ask someone if
they've got any in the drawers
underneath or if no one's there to help
you just have a look because you're the
one buying what I really am oh yeah I do
like the drawer they're taking your
money so yeah go for it and then
high-end which i think is quite a
different thing like when you're buying
foundation don't be afraid to ask for a
sample
oh definitely and if they get funny
about it just take their names and
reassure them the order to come back and
buy it from them if you like it because
that's the only reason why they'd be
funny about it yeah most and most brands
actually already have the little vials
like behind the counter and are ready to
go for a sample so definitely sample
high in foundations if you can because
they're like certain parts of poly
exactly and let this else doesn't help
you but don't feel pressured trust your
own opinion oh I have another tip
sometimes if I go to a new counter or
makeup run they don't really know that
well and I feel bit overwhelmed Elston
what their most popular products are
that's a good way that's always a good
one is to ask them what their favorite
are yeah I like that
really we three are switch products
which put up okay
I thought talk really Rios which product
makes you have a new panic attack if you
think you've lost it oh these little bit
eyelash curlers are such a bizarre
choice the japonesque power curl I
everything and that time I saw you and I
was like Anna your lashes look so
uncurls yeah I feel like when I've got
my lashes cold I'm just a happier person
I really do and long as you're happy
there's been some occasions where I've
like temporarily lost my eyelash curler
for like a day or so and I just feel
what happened right it's for great
Brooke mine's just as shallow mine's
don't know product might as well so like
a tool is my ghd's because if I woke up
and I went to Shea to my hair and they'd
exploded or been stolen I'd I didn't
want dude I think you'd cry I'd send
rich out to buy me some new ones even if
they were like thousand pounds because
that's how much seriously
yeah no I leave got a tight relationship
with it with your ghd's I understand
it's that morning hair I can't do
anything with that have to just wash it
a bit curly okay from Essie button said
describe a recent makeup fail oh I don't
really know what to say first question
and then when I was getting ready to
film this video I got my mascara like
normally you get mascara sometimes on
your eyelid or something or like up here
that's fine nose on my cheek Oh God mine
was I haven't worn lip products for ages
cuz you guys know I've had sore lips and
then remember last week Wednesday we had
like we went out for the day of loads of
meetings yeah I walked a neat chubby
stick intense and grounders get great
grinders ki Grande is great and I just
kind of forgot I was wearing it and I've
been really bad at reapplying it I kept
every time I checked myself in the
mirror I had like a dark thing around my
layer the middle gone girl it lying yeah
I was a regular for like you better like
reapplying with my moisturizing
something yeah we're so it's got a bit
of Sheen to it you know so in that vlog
about there probably okay the last
question is from the summer one thing
you should get in boots or superdrug
this is a good question because we get
asked this a lot of thing I like that
question a lot I instantly I did we
think about it too much I went for this
I honestly think that the new Bourjois
Rouge Edition Velvets are just beyond
incredible wo no no I've got nausea or
now but I mean it's basically exactly
the same thing but in terms of liquid
lipstick formula this just beats
everything else hands down really I
think it's awesome it's just so matte
but not drying so long-lasting actually
took me about like six cotton pads and
eye makeup remover to get this off my
lips it just lasts incredibly and it it
layers really nicely and so many others
kind of don't really do that and this is
the shade pink pong it's adorable it's
really nice I thought of one from boots
and one from super drug because you're
trying things just Pat yeah but I also
forgot to bring this with me so I have
nothing to show you guys I'll try and
put an image in if I can my mom from
Superdrug is actually something you made
me buy which is the NYC palette in the
best afford way which is a really good
dupe for the Chanel Krista's palette and
I love it really shades yeah need that
really like it I did a person I think
you meet in Boots is Satan Glory's sonde
powder which is like one of my favorite
ones I use that more than NARS Laguna
these days because you're less orange
and I love it use it everyday is amazing
it's got like slight split down the
middle it's got two different shades and
it's lovely
so that's that so that's everything from
our extra-long beauty chat video and
that was fun as always everybody that
wasn't even Anna's channel I'm sure you
