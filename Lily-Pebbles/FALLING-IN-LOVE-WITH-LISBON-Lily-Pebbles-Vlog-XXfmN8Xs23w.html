sort of about the perfect opportunity
I can't wait but we've got yesterday
I've had a full day and evening here and
guys I am seriously in love what a
beautiful beautiful place I didn't
really know what to expect and if we
have any expectations other than a lot
of people love it here but there are
like beautiful colored tiles everywhere

so friendly the weather is amazing I

annoying she took us on a walking tour
that Old Town it was so pretty we all
took loads of photos you've got ice

going on a bike tour like cycling so I
thought I would vlog today and then
maybe on Thursday or Friday when rich
arrives I don't really know I wanted to
do like a bit of this trip and then a
bit of the trip with rich but I don't
want this to be like an epically long
vlog it's just too hard to edit so we'll
see what I end up filming I think we'll
probably take some more photos today and
just walk around and enjoy enjoy the
city I'm really late for breakfast I

buildings of pilings

good guys here you me and Megan a
sharing but one wait here sure I'm kind
of terrified I'm not sure we like it but
we'll do the taste test and see that
he's really up side the verdicts is good
I really like it pretty busy I can eat
the whole thing quite filling
we've stopped by the water amazing
bridge literally like San Francisco all
right we have been cycling for four
hours our bombs are already massive and
it was it was really really nice and
that the MU is like so privileged but
it's like 2 o'clock now we have an equal
to half a I'm going to start up this
light little place that ever you know it
is it looks like a seafood restaurant
I mean it having some garlicky corn
which house I had last night
all right which also had last night
Kerry has this what's actual name for us
hopefully crew it's a pork secret it's
secret of course because it's so good
that's good I think I don't know why it
really is not good
we've found a cute little lolly truck is
gorgeous to Risto and it will really
please labored lollies and then we need
a watermelon are we this various
parameter swore to melon lolly is insane
it's so good oh this is to the cheers
allow me oh we've just got back to the
hotel and I think Kerry and I maybe some
others are going to go sit by the pool
because you've got like a couple of
hours we haven't really done that yet so
we're going to sit by the pool we're
taking our laptops as well just we can
get some work done in the shade but yeah
the pool looks so nice here Wi-Fi going
to focus I have a pina colada
by the gorgeous pool lovely life sorry
guys I didn't vlog much down by the pool
I just lost my Pina Colada which was
delicious but we had a couple of hours
by the pool it was really nice like I go
on trips quite a lot now and you never
really know who you're going to be with
and you don't always get on with
everyone
oh my god so I just need to like throw
out my makeup but this is such a nice
group when they all bound so well so
written by the pool and chatting really
and we're able to make so much content
while we're out here which is so good
I'm really enjoying taking photos and
editing and we like sharing loads of
tips and advice and stuff it's just good
good feel on this trip I'm not getting
ready for dinner I thought I'd come back
to the room a lot early because I don't
like to take my time I haven't had much
down time problem sitting by the pool
but you know what I mean like time alone
so I'm just getting dressed although the
rain is really tight I'm quite concerned
or not the mouse eat dinner in it
oh dear may have got a little color on
my nose snot but doesn't hurt persist or
look like what they had makeup on
there's no full-length mirror here I
don't think we just show there isn't one
folders one in the cupboard
you know what loads of clothes with me
what I'm wearing tonight is actually
from next obviously bought a lot of non
next clothes as well but I'll say this
when Rich comes I want to wear next
tonight and it's top that's next and
it's got like a really cool back better
than as you can see and this like blush
pink
so this cub is six rosy blush pink
diamond skirt it's like a little bit
longer at the back but it is quite tight
I think maybe the denim jacket could
look cool denim denim like a blue and a
pink and some black sliders I think I'm
going to do my makeup now maybe I'll
prop you up on the window whilst I do my
makeup I always like to make sure what
I'm in a hotel so I do my makeup
please window main natural light all
eyes especially when it's sunny you go
outside you just look like orange
okay I've talked to you guys up though
the craziest thing I've the worst hay
fever here I didn't even have hay fever
at home for a left so I don't know what
going I do see some white pollen slider
when we were slightly and earlier by the
way I love the bike ride it was so good
anyway few of my sniffing I have
terrible hay feeder I'm just going to do
my makeup oh I talked to do it will be
usual stuff but I thought I would tell
you guys I think our little blogging
community industry needs a bit of
positivity at the moment so I'm going to
quickly tell you how great the girls I
am on the ship with us that didn't make
sense but you should definitely go
follow them all Kari is such a babe I
obviously know Terry she's a good friend
of mine she is super talented she is
like the queen of taking photos and
editing she's seriously hard work you've
been doing it longer than any of her and
she says always like wanting to improve
and get better that's the same thing
improve and get better but she just
deserves so many more followers she's
brilliant
Danielle Pisa is hilarious I love her
she is so friendly and open and warm and
I get on really well with her we kind of
grew up in similar areas and whenever I
see her at an event or anything we got
so well she's just hilarious also
talking about hilarious
Lorna is hilarious she really makes me
laugh she's very like full of life she
has a good energy to the group naomi is
so sweet I've seen no Nyami well we both
have gleam and I've known her for a
while she's just really kind and gentle
and we would have really good chat Amy
I've followed Amy for so long those of
you who know me know that Amy's like my
number one girl crush so it's been so
nice getting to know her pop please she
is the most like softly spoken gentle
kind wouldn't hurt a fly girl ever she's
so gorgeous she's even more gorgeous and
realized like a real beautiful I told
her that she might look like my grandma
when she was her age she's got a real
natural beauty Meghan is also on this
trip whoo I also know because she's with
the same management as me she's really
fun she's like a bit of a tomboy like me
which I really like she's really fun to
be around she's always like very
positive and high in energy in a good
way not an annoying way and she just
like knows her style so well I really
enjoy seeing her outfits on the strip

wanted to share the love a little bit I
think it's nice to if you can I'm just
popping some concealer and this is a new
concealer from Beauty pie super luminous
concealer I am loving this is such good
coverage but it's like glowy is so good

watch because my favorite thing to do
look haslam Danielle look I'm had
opposed to loving this light this
evening is beautiful it's like gold an
hour and there's the bridge I don't know
what that bridge is also really to find
out but like I said earlier looks like
San Francisco bridge right actually the
same size but the Sun is setting the sky
is actually pink and it looks beautiful
which is like walking down to the
restaurant I'm not sure what this
restaurant it could but it overlooks
like all the boats in the water and
stuff I'm really enjoying wearing
summery code someone just come in from
