favorites video and I know these aren't
the most exciting videos and everyone
loves them but it's quite nice just have
like a moment once a month where you sit
and just talk about your favorite things
from the month I kind of like the
routine of doing them as always I've got
a really random list of things talk
about gone other days where I just
listed hundreds of beauty products that
I love now it's like the most random
list but I want to keep these really
honest and true to the things I actually
love I think I've got about eight things
on my little list here first one
actually is the beauty products and it's
the Maybelline the eraser eye concealer
I never had any interest in trying this
and I don't even know what made me try
it I picked it up one day and I am in
love I'm pretty sure Amelia's been using
this for years so I don't know why I
didn't get it earlier but it's a
concealer that you twist up it's got a
foam applicator on the top and you can
just apply it straight on the face this
is a brand new one so look how lovely
and neat it looks and this is one that
I've nearly finished and it's a grubby
man so the packaging is not great but
then I really like the foam applicator
you just twist up and you it's really
kind of soft under the eye as well you
can kind of go like that
I put now my nose around my nose on my
chin and I feel like it's really high
coverage but it blends really well too
which is a really nice combination I use
the shade light it fits me well I'm
pretty sure I remember that there aren't
many shades to pick form which is really
annoying
I'm lucky this one kind of suits my skin
tone see I really like it worth trying
like an affordable drugstore concealer
while I'm talking of concealers is
actually another concealer that I've
been enjoying this month and it's a new
launch from NARS it's the soft matte
complete concealer I don't usually use
ones that come in a little pop I've just
been enjoying the Select touch-up so I
like to stick my finger in kind of war
products and then it's really good for
the chin I've had a bit for support each
in recently sometimes to top up under
the eye when you have dark circles or
around the nose it just finds quite easy
to use I haven't used the Estee Lauder
one that Ana love I'm imagining that
they're pretty similar though it's kind
of hydrating high coverage very easy to
blend it and work with on the skin so
she knows that's a new law just throw
that in there because I do think it's
worth checking out the TV show that I am
loving is first date hotel
know where this is shown it's definitely
a UK programmer than if it's shown
anywhere else but first date was a
program where they film people on their
first day in a restaurant and it's all
set up like people know that being
filmed it's a special restaurant you go
and before you go on the show they match
you with someone and they're so good at
matching people it it normally works out
and it's such a nice program to watch
it's just like you're really into
watching human like experice social
experiments things like that you'd love
it but a first dates hotel is like the
spin-off show where they go to a hotel
in France and it's like a lovely park
from and they actually go on a date
there and if they like each other they
go on a date like the next day I feel
like I've explained this really badly
but if you love first dates you have to
watch the first dates Hotel because it's
even better it's so good I love it and
then they interview the couples
afterwards and they say whether they
just want to go on a date with each
other again or not and it's so awkward
but it's great I highly recommend it you
guys know I love the wet brush I've
recommended a few years never got on
with Tangle Teezer but I think the wet
brush is brilliant it has a handle it
literally glides through my hair no
matter how many knots I have but I did a
job with look fantastic maybe like a
month ago and I discovered on their
website that they have a wet brush
cleaner I didn't even know this product
existed and it's like changed my life
because the only downside of my wet
brush especially the one I use to
straighten my hair like this one I'll
use on wet hair I've got a smaller one I
use when I'm straightening my hair it's
just full of hair and it's like getting
all dusty and gross and I think I'm
making my hair dirty by using it this
little contraption is genius but they
really know what this little side is for
but this one now it's really hard like
plastic prongs and basically what you do
I'm sorry this is so gross I like left
my brush hairy to show you you kind of
brush this like this I don't know if you
can see quit it like pick up oh this is
gross can you see it picks up all the
hairs and its own whimpers going to put
that down on us it's so easy to just
like get all the hairs out it's genius
change my brush life definitely get the
cleaner if you use the wet brush this
lipstick combo I talked about in an
upcoming video so I'm not going to go on
too much about it but I've always really
liked the Charlotte Tilbury
pillow-talk lipliner and he's recently
brought out of pillow talk lipstick to
go with it and it's just a beautiful it
sort of a nude pink but was gorgeous
like rosy tone to it I find it so
flattering on my skintone I love her
matte revolution lipsticks because
they're so long wearing but comfortable
on the lip
so this combo is just dreamy I thought
I've already talked about it everywhere
so I'll leave it as that
the next favor I'm also talking about in
an upcoming video it's my Gucci Soho
disco bike and I've actually already
prefilled or what's in my bag video so
you will see that soon we're all going
pop a detail about bag and what's in it
but I just wanted to add it into my
favourites because I've worn this almost
every day since I bought it and it's
without a doubt the best bag that I own
come back and watch the what's in my bag
videos because I'll talk more in detail
about it I just really want to put this
in because I just I loved it and loved
it so much
keeping it on the accessories theme I
have this necklace which you guys would
have seen in a lot of my videos and P
follow me on snapchat and Instagram
stories whenever I posted out there I've
been wearing this a lot it's a necklace
by a brand called by Alana and this is
actually given to me as a birthday gift
by the lovely girls from clinique which
was very very generous with them I've
heard about this brand before I didn't
own anything from it and this is silver
which I don't usually wear silver and
quite less gold person but this is just
so pretty so it's a long necklace that
goes down into this little tendon and
then it has a long part sticking down
that was a really weird explanation but
I just think it's so pretty is so
different and I get so many compliments
on it when I wear it I definitely want
to check out what other julu pieces she
has as part of her range so also it says
what goes around I didn't even notice
that really love that this candle I have
kind of like 3/4 the way through it the
dip teeth new Rosamund II I never really
know how to read their candles it's like
a special limited edition candle with
this amazing wrap around it it just
looks so pretty when it burns when you
stop getting halfway through it glows up
and it just looks so nice in the evening
I don't know what this scent is I love
it the music wiki Google Earth so it's a
Valentine's Day limited edition candle
oh so it's a combination of two types
and rose top notes of currant and
bergamot and it's also got notes of rose
and light chic it's very floral but in a
fresh
way not in a heavy way and I really like
it my next favorite is a singer called
Samuel Jack and rich actually got me
into him she discovered him and became
obsessed and rich becomes obsessed with
things it's like it's all he'll listen
to so I kept hearing him and I started
singing his songs I even known what was
singing so then I gave him a listen and
he's got a few songs on Spotify not not
lows but I really really loved his music
I'm pretty sure he was born in London
but grew up in South Africa now lives
back in the UK but you wouldn't really
tell like he sounds very bluesy very
like soulful I just loved the sound of
his voice I loved the songs they're so
catchy and I don't know if you listen
for yourself I'm going to leave some
links below
Samuel Jack and actually when I'm
filming this video I'm going to his gate
tonight in London and I can't wait
because I haven't seen him live before
me and Richard go in with some of my
family yeah I haven't been to a gig in
ages actually so I'm really looking
forward to seeing him live and pretty
sure he'll be great and really really
like a song do you know what I'm going
to add in some Instagram favorites as
well because I have been loving using
Instagram recently my username at lady
pebbles if you didn't already know if
you want to follow me I've just been
really enjoying like looking at other
people's instagrams as well let me just
think off the top of my head who I have
been enjoying at least you know who I
think has been killing it Suzanne I just
think her style is so so cool I love the
sort of shows that she wears she really
knows how to dress for herself and her
Instagram is pretty much exclusively
outfit photos which is hard I don't know
who takes me chosen for her how she gets
roasted like every day but it's so much
like style inspiration and when I was
recently redoing my wardrobe I went the
whole Instagram to look throughout the
ideas so I'm going to add two downs
username below let me go check her out
and maybe that deter month I'll try to
put like one Instagram person in every
month the last favorite is another TV
show this is one we are watching on
Netflix I think I can never remember
whether it's Netflix or Amazon or Sky
pretty sure this is a Netflix one and
it's sneaky pete my sister Karli
convinced us to watch it I feel like
I've got so many things that I'm
watching at the moment but I'm still
loving this is us and we're also
watching sneaky pete sneaky pete i don't
give too much away but it's about a con
artist and his adventures i don't know i
really hope it's really hard to describe
things without knowing if i'm giving too
much away i was watching
we're kind of halfway through and
is just in a little bit my studies worth
watching its quite gripping at the
beginning and I'm hopefully in it hoping
it will pick up again the main actor in
it is Phoebe's brother and Friends which
is just so funny all I can think of when
I watch it okay that's all for my
monthly favorites this month I hope you
