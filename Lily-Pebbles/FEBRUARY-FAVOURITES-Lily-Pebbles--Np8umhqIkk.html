I'm gonna be doing my February favorites
video literally every year I struggle to
say the title of this video it's very
frustrating that is the video I'm gonna
do today I haven't got a load of
favorites but I have a few so let me get
started with the beauty stuff first of
all is a foundation which I am wearing
today it's the fenty Beauty foundation
and I've been wearing this a lot
recently because my skin has been really
bad like you guys know I really rarely
get any kind of like spots but as I
mentioned on Instagram stories I had I
had laser hair removal on my face which
is something I have a lot and it's
always fine but then I went to Miami
you're not really meant to go in the Sun
I did wear SPF and then I had a facial
with a brand I've never tried the
products from and it just broke me out
straight away so I've been getting like
really bad skin on my cheeks so I have
been wearing a fuller coverage
foundation and this one from friend TBC
is really great the shade I have is ever
so slightly too warm for me which is a
little bit annoying but I do want to
pick up another one in a lighter shade
it's just got a really good coverage but
it doesn't look like I'm wearing a
really heavy cakey foundation it looks
really glowy and fresh on the skin I use
a damp sponge to apply it and I think
this is a very good foundation so
definitely worth checking that one out
in the meantime I'm desperately trying
to fix my skin by just using very basic
skin care like I'm not using anything
fancy just a really simple cleanser and
moisturizer and hopefully my skin goes
back to normal because I normally have
very easy skin so it's very annoying got
quite a painful spot on my jaw line
right there as well as having a bad skin
at the moment you guys know about my
lips I'm not gonna go on and talk more
about them because you guys know I've
been suffering from dry lips for a long
time but my friend Nadine baguette I
think that's how you pronounce a surname
I will link her down below in the
description box she recommended trying
the lavash pros a/c supplies I surpassed
and I really feel like I've tried every
lip balm ever but I love lost per se and
I trust their products so I was like
okay one more I'll try one more lip balm
and this is amazing guys it I think it
repairs the barrier the skin barrier on
your lips
something like that it does something
different other lip balms yet barrier
repairing balm and it really works you
know they're not perfect they're not
back to normal but this lip balm is
massively helping me I've already gone
through a tube and I've got like two on
back up really really great lip balm
definitely try that if you've got dry
lips
okay the next product I think I
mentioned this in my December favorites
video when I just got it but I've
already completely finished on I'm onto
my second and I can now confirm this is
my all-time favorite concealer the nas
soft matte concealer is great and I do
still use that but this if I had to pick
one concealer to use for the rest of my
life at the moment it would be this it's
the by Terry steelo expert CLIC stic I
love the packaging it just clicks up and
comes out the bottom it is very creamy
so I think that you will go through it
quicker than a normal concealer but it's
so easy to use I saw under my eyes
around my nose on my chin I can use a
sponge to blend out or a brush this can
double up as a foundation if you want on
days where I'm not wearing foundation it
definitely gives me enough coverage if I
want to put it on my cheeks it's such a
beautiful creamy gorgeous concealer I
wear the shade 3 which is maybe a little
bit too warm but the shade 2 is too
light for me they are difficult to get
hold of I keep going in space and Keun
it sold out so I don't know if there's
like a stock problem or something but if
you can find one of these they are
amazing
ok next for beauty you guys know I went
to Miami with Space NK and igk and I
love igk I tried quite a few products
already that I've bought in Sephora last
year and I loved their dry shampoo and
their texturizing spray but after this
trip I fell in love with so many of
their other products seriously every
time I try one of their products I fall
in love it's amazing it's probably
turned into my favorite haircare brand
it's so great so you guys know about the
dry shampoo the texturizing spray but I
thought I'd run through a few of the
other products that I've just become
obsessed with first of all the hot girls
shampoo and conditioner this is like a
coconut milk I think it's a coconut milk
shampoo condition it's a hydrating one
smells amazing feels great on my dry
hair so those are really nice a bit more
like basic but these products are
incredible so what should i do first
let's talk about expensive this is the
high shine top coat so you
like once a week in the shower as a
conditioner and then you wash it out and
I'm not joking guys I put this on my
hair I can leave on for like a minute
and then wash it out and my hair
instantly feels so soft and silky and
strong and amazing quality I've never
tried a leave-in conditioner that is
this great by the way it says in the
back just to tell you guys this the IGA
products are vegan cruelty and gluten
free and petroleum and mineral oil free
paraben sulfate free it's basically free
of everything and it's still
unbelievable and it smells good so how
they manage that this product is amazing
the next one I want to recommend is the
rich kid
coconut oil gel this can be used on damp
hair or dry hair I don't do it on both
but I really like to use it once I've
curled my hair just to kind of make my
hair a little bit PC and it gives it a
little bit of hold it hydrates it and
styles it at the same time and then if
I'm wearing my hair straight in it's got
it's a bit like fluffy and I wanted to
just look more hydrated I use this which
is the mistress hydrating hair balm and
these are similar this one's a bit rich
kids a bit more like a stiff formula and
mistress is more of a liquidy kind of
creamy formula that you can just run
through your hair and it just adds
instant hydration these products are so
good I'm so obsessed with them it's kind
of all I'm using at the moment okay onto
more random favorites and this one first
I picked this up when I was at so her
farm house recently it's from the brand
Soho home and it's a mug and these are
pricey they're 10 pounds each I wanted
to buy four because we're not the sort
of house that have all matching mugs
it's never gonna happen
so I try to get like two or four of
everything so there isn't just like one
of every mug they only had two in stock
but I would definitely buy two more even
though they were expensive I absolutely
love the color the design I think this
is a really special mug I know that
sounds crazy but if you're into like
home wear like this I think this is it's
the perfect size as well though it's
quite big but it's not too big not too
round this is my actual perfect mug I
love it I guess
want to get more the dream would be if
all of my marks were like this but then
I'd find another Morgan full of and have
the same problem again my name's random
favorite is a radio station I think it's
a digital radio station my sister
introduced me to it it magic chilled now
magic obviously everyone knows and magic
chilled I was like I don't know it
sounds a bit boring I don't know why
they called it magic chilled it's not
chilled music at all is basically like
mid to late 90s early 2000 like pop
music it's so good it's if you haven't
listened to mine and Anna's teenage
throwback playlet I feel like it's all
the best stuff from that playlist it's
such a good radio station every time a
song comes on I'm like oh my god I love
this song so definitely check out magic
chilled if you spend a lot of time in
the car and then my last kind of style
favorite is things with French slogans
on it's become a real thing you guys
know one minute you know about my
whistles t-shirt
there's Jana Sequoia water I had this
for quite a while and I loved it and
recently especially and other stories of
just having influx of things with French
slogans on and I didn't realize until
someone commented the other day that I
have quite a few so this blue jumper
from and other stories it says and more
and I love the kind of rainbow letters
on it then we've got this one also from
and other stories which has Paris
written five times in red really really
like that another and another story is
one I think this is all part of a
collection for them says bonne journee
in yellow so into yellow at the moment
and then this one is from Suzanne which
says dooma dooma dooma dooma did it but
again really like the kind of rainbow
letters there so apparently that is a
thing that I'm just into at the moment
didn't realize kind of accidental not
hating it this month has been so great
and it's just only getting more exciting
obviously the first week of March is
when my book comes out and things are
really kicking off now it's funny
because my mom and my sisters and
Ritchie will read the book and hearing
their thoughts it's like getting my
first reviews it and my sister finished
it and my sister's a real bookworm and
she studied English at a level what I
think she went on to do it at uni as
well so
to get feedback from her just she was
saying like she thought it was brilliant
and she feels that all ages could relate
to it so that was really nice and then
my other sister was also just blown away
she said she found that just saying like
female friendships she wasn't sure how
much they would be to say about it or
how interesting it would be and she's
like you have to read the book to
understand she's like I am now analyzing
me and my relationships and my
friendships she's like so relatable I
feel like you've traveled through my
whole life journey of friendships my mom
also just loved it and my family are
really honest they wouldn't just say
this they would definitely point out the
bit they didn't like and they have said
a few bits that they were like oh I'm
not sure that was necessary but
understand where you did it my mom was
just so impressed she's like I think
it's so relatable I think it's so
grown-up she was like it didn't feel
like a little girl writing a book about
her friendship she said it felt really
grown-up and helpful she like learned
something from it
rich is still Regent now as I film this
video and it's funny hearing from like a
male's perspective because he's just
like you guys are mad I feel like with
guys friendships are just so black and
white and with girls there is so much
it's so complicated
but yeah it's really exciting hearing
people's thoughts on the book it's
actually really satisfying after all the
hard work just to hear what people think
it means so much to me so I can't wait
until you guys read it and tell me what
you think
basically March is going to be epic I
can't wait and yeah I'll be vlogging
definitely for sure thank you guys so
much for watching those are all of my
favorites for this month and I'll be
back again next week with another video
so I'll see you then
