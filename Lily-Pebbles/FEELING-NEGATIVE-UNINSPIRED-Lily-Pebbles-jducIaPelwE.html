different position in my lounge today
because it just felt a bit wrong to have
like my proper set up and I wasn't
really feeling it to be honest I thought
but this one I could just sit on my sofa
and have a little chat with you guys
before I get going with this video if
you haven't seen my last video it was a
vlog and I will link it above and if
you're new to this channel or you
haven't yet subscribed please click on
the subscribe button because then you
get alerted every time I get any video
and I would absolutely love it if you
subscribed as I'm filming this it's a
Friday afternoon and I'm waiting for my
friend Hannah to pick me up for my hen
weekend which is so exciting and I'm
just feeling really excited about life
and happy right now which is why I
thought it was a good time to make this
video because it's complete contrast to
how I felt maybe like two or three weeks
ago if you follow me on snapchat you
might have seen I had a bit of a blogger
meltdown and obviously compared to some
of the awful things that people have to
go through this is so minor but I think
everyone has their like bad days and I
realized throughout that the messages I
was getting from you guys on like
snapchat and Twitter was that you kind
of appreciated the fact that I
acknowledged that I was having a bad day
because I think everyone has bad days
and bad weeks but personally for me that
week was the the lowest and saddest I've
felt in maybe ever definitely since my
kind of blogging YouTube career and
there wasn't really any reason for it
either
I felt very lonely I felt very confused
about what I wanted to do and I just had
a massive lack of passion for anything I
really remember the feeling of just
feeling like I didn't care about
anything
I don't care about beauty I didn't care
about fashion and didn't care about
fitness I didn't care about food I
couldn't think of anything that I cared
enough about to make content for you
guys to talk about and the pressure was
kind of getting to me
and I ended up not putting videos of
putting a video up that week I think
just the busyness of planning a wedding
and kind of being alone in this job it
all just kind of built up on me and I
just had a terrible terrible week but
now I feel great it's only a couple of
weeks later and I feel absolutely fine
back to normal and at the time I felt
like oh my god this is the end this is
the end of my YouTube career I can't
think of anything I ever want to make a
video about again I
wanna be in the Internet and while I was
kind of in that period I really felt
like that was it and now I'm out of it
so I thought it might be a good idea to
make a video on like how I got out of
that mood and at the time it wasn't
something I was intentionally doing but
now I can look back and see kind of what
I did to get out of that and I thought
it might be useful it might inspire you
if you're feeling like you're in a bit
of creative funk I understand what I do
is quite specific but I think there's a
lot of people that have kind of creative
jobs if you're a writer nyet writer's
block or if you're just feeling a bit
uninspired about life that these little
tips or things that I did might help you
if anything maybe it's just nice to hear
about someone else that was having a bit
of a rough time and I feel better now
who knows I might feel crap again next
week but at the moment I'm feeling
excited for my hand and feeling happy
and I'm back into making videos so I've
kind of split this up into three steps
I'd say I'm gonna talk you through the
different steps that I took I filmed a
few fancy cutaways - inserting just to
make this video a bit more interesting
and the first step for me is to focus on
things that make you happy when you're
in that negative dark place and you just
hate life and you hate everything and
everything's feeling so negative and
you're feeling overwhelmed you just have
to get yourself out of that space for me
my flat is where I work and it's very
small and it's very enclosed so for me I
need to get out the flag get away from
this space go somewhere else that makes
me happy spending time with my family
spending time with my nieces and nephews
the kids who don't want to talk to me
about instagrams new update or snapchat
filters they don't know about Internet
stuff it's so nice to spend time with
the kids so going up to my parents house
having fun in the garden with the kids I
went to visit my grandma all these
little things really took my mind off it
and that time that I was with the kids
or with my grandma I wasn't thinking
about work I wasn't thinking about the
internet or anything I was just enjoying
the moment and that really really helped
me I was a finally catching up with
friends as great I rarely really talk
about work with my friends sometimes it
will come up but you know when you're
with your best friends you just talk
about whatever and you have a great time
and again it's just a distraction from
what's going on something that happened
towards the end of that week when I was
really rubbish was a bit of a light bulb
moment of oh my god this is genuinely
made me
the happiest I've felt all week and it
was so unexpected I was driving to my
parents I think it was like a Friday
night I was driving over for dinner at
my parents with rich and we had our
phone connected we were playing Spotify
and Stevie Wonder song came on and I
just started singing along I normally
kind of sing along to the radio anyway
and then I just got really into it and I
started singing really loudly and I'm
not joking it was like a smile just took
over my face I had the best three
minutes that I had had the whole week
and I was singing it took my voice and
bitches just like go ahead and let it
out
and I was singing so loudly and it's so
random but I love singing I used to
always sing at school and it actually
makes me happy so now I know what I'm
feeling rubbish singing as loud as I
possibly can in my car when no one can
hear me genuinely made me feel better so
that's something I've added to my list
and then the final part of this first
section is to not keep it all in I think
when you're feeling a bit negative and
monie and miserable for me I have guilt
of oh I don't want to moan at people or
complain because then I feel guilty
because my problems aren't as bad as
other people's or I don't want people to
have to listen to my negative energy or
you kind of it's like a cycle of like
guilt but then you still feel rubbish
and eventually I thought you know what
I'm just gonna go on snapchat and say
how I feel and it actually made me feel
so much better I'm sure there were
people out there who didn't want to hear
me Moaning but there were so many of you
that message back with lovely messages
and you're really understanding and
really listened to me and that kind of
interaction really helped me just
letting it out and saying it whether
you're saying it online which probably
isn't the best idea or you're just
telling a friend or a parent or a
sibling it's talking about how you feel
out loud you feel like it's not gonna
help but it really does just get
everything from here out because what
you'll find is actually there's a lot
jumbled up in your head once you say out
loud it might not be as bad as you think
or it's easier it's kind of make sense
of it when you're hearing it back
yourself so don't cry don't keep it all
in and just let it all out
so you focus on the things that make you
happy and I think step two is for me
have an Internet detox day I don't think
I could do a whole week just because
this is my job you can't just take a
week off work but having a day when
you're just not on the internet you can
clear your mind
really helps I find that going for a
walk is a really nice way to clear my
head music always makes me feel good if
I'm listening to songs that that make me
feel good so put in your headphones and
go for a walk around the park just take
deep breaths and take everything in
around you and try and clear your mind
or not all have a think about things
whether you're using a thinking time or
to clear your mind just getting out and
walking around and taking everything in
can really help simple things just like
watching a film that you love can make
you feel so good I like to just snuggle
up on the sofa and watch a nice film and
for me TV has become a way to kind of
zone out because watching YouTube videos
now as much as I love it
kind of reminds me of work and it's all
a bit like internet ease so just to
watch a film and kind of put your phone
in the other room
you can just sit and zone out for a
couple of hours and watch a nice
feel-good film reading a book so
old-school but having a flick through a
book I find that reading quite an
intense book isn't great when I'm
feeling like that but I have quite a few
like coffee table books that I like to
flick through and it can be really
relaxing just to read a book and then
the other thing I found that really made
me feel better that again was very
unexpected was calligraphy this new
little hobby that's come out of nowhere
that I didn't know I was gonna suddenly
become really into calligraphy but I
have dived in headfirst and I love it
minute I tried calligraphy you haven't
seen my blog where I learned calligraphy
I will link it above the minute I tried
it I knew it was gonna be such a
therapeutic relaxing way to just zone
out that you can't do it you can't check
your phone whilst doing calligraphy when
you're doing it you have to be
concentrating your zoned into it and it
the motion is just so relaxing so I
really enjoyed the process of learning
how to do calligraphy and now I can
practice it I'm also obsessed with
getting an iPad pro and a pen so I can
like do it digitally that that just got
me really excited about something new
which I wasn't expecting okay so step
one and step two were done so now you're
feeling better about life and I think
that three is to go back to the drawing
board and reevaluate things I like to
brainstorm new ideas and this can't read
before sometimes
come to you but I like to just sit there
with a notebook make some notes
something I find really useful with what
I do is to look back at old videos and
watch videos that I've loved making in
the past and it will kind of remind me
what I love about making videos and why
I enjoyed making a certain video what
you guys enjoyed and just kind of
looking back at when you were feeling
good about things and then I like to
plan ahead I think I got to the point
where I was you know I had like a day to
make a video but a day is not enough to
make a video as good as I wanted to make
it so to get a little bit ahead gives me
a bit more space to be creative so
having that kind of week where you get
ahead really helps as well all these
things together did help but ultimately
it comes down to just how you feel and
I'm really happy that I feel much better
about things now but I also now feel
really sorry for people who feel like
that for a long period of time because I
felt awful and I felt very alone in it
and I felt like I couldn't explain to
people how I felt I felt like my friends
and people around me in the industry
maybe because I known a lot people
thought oh Lily's just moaning but I
really really felt awful but anyway I
feel so much better now and I don't know
what if there's a point to this video
not but I really wanted to sit and talk
to you guys about it and if you have
been through the same thing or are going
through the same thing you'll feel
better if you have a creative job I
think it's very normal to have moments
of you know a creative funk that's kind
of what you're in a creative funk so I
hope you guys enjoyed this little video
and found it interesting or helpful I
have another video up and she's there
hopefully that'll be a vlog and then
next Sunday morning as usual if you're
not already follow me on snapchat go
follow me there where I do kind of daily
vlogging steps and also follow me on
Instagram
Lily pebbles Instagram now has stories
haven't quite figured out what I'm gonna
do about snapchat Instagram but I think
Instagram I'm gonna do less and kind of
nice and little clips and snapchat will
just be me blabbing away all day so
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
