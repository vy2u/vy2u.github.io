today's video is a bit different and a
bit experimental so please bear with me
if it turns out to be a little bit crap
but I kind of wanted to do a what I eat
in a day video but they're also not very
me and sometimes I don't love watching
them so I thought today I would do a
kind of vlog slash what I eat in a day
but also show you what I bought
yesterday from Planet organic which is
like a health food store if I did a very
honest what I eat in a day just to be
fully transparent here I would probably
not have breakfast some days I do if I'm
can be bothered to come downstairs some
days I just get ready upstairs in my
bedroom and like start filming the video
straight away and then it's the twelve
o'clock I'm ravenous
and then if we've got something to eat
for lunch for lunch like maybe like a
tomato soup or some leftovers from
dinner the night before or a bit of
pasta or something a bit of rice was
like veg I'll just like figure out
what's here if not I will walk up to my
local cafe and get a bagel with salmon
and cream cheese then I'll probably have
a cup of tea in the afternoon maybe some
like nuts er which is like a massive
cracker with like peanut butter on it
and then I'll have dinner with rich that
is what I honestly eat in a day but
today's video is more of like what I
want to eat in a day so yesterday I was
near Planet organic because I want my
favorite health food stores and I just
thought like I'm here so this happens
sometimes if I'm organized enough I'd be
like oh I'm working all day from home
tomorrow I'm gonna need stuff to eat and
drink so let's just get some my
favourite stuff so I'm not forcing
myself to eat stuff I don't like that's
not what's happening today I I genuinely
all of these things and love them I'm
just too lazy and disorganized to get
around to actually buying any of them
and also they're it's a tree they're
quite expensive so this isn't like an
everyday thing at all so I don't know if
that kind of makes sense but I love
watching like food pools so I thought I
can kind of show you what I bought
whilst I eat it throughout the day is
this video gonna make any sense I just
don't know
but I'm only saying I think I can show
you which I'm not gonna be easy today
we've already we had spaghetti last
night so we had to empty it out into our
like jar but this is the Bayona spelt
spaghetti which is quite difficult to
find annoyingly because this is the only
person I can really eat at home when I
eat pasta in Italian restaurants if it's
like a true Italian restaurant and they
use something called zero zero flour
then I'm okay but any other kind of like
white pasta even brown pasta gives me
the worst stomachache so when I'm at
home I have spelt spaghetti and I really
love it and would highly recommend it it
cooks faster than normal white pasta and
it just doesn't leave you that like
heavy bloated feeling but I promise you
it tastes exactly the same I'm the sort
of person that doesn't like like the
tastes of weird pastas it tastes just
like normal web master but yeah like I
said you don't get that bloated feeling
at the end when you're done so that is
what I bought I can throw that packet
away now and then everything else I
think I will show you as I go so it's
now half past nine I've been upstairs
getting ready like I said I'd only wake
up brush my teeth up shower or whatever
and then I just get ready I don't might
come down for breakfast and then go back
up I don't know why I didn't get that
hungry in the morning I think I have
quite a big dinner and probably later
than most people we eat around like
eight o'clock and I've just never been
like a morning person
I do like breakfast and I can eat
breakfast it's more that I just don't
need to I don't like wake up starving
but when I do I have a couple of
favorite breakfasts I either make
porridge with some fruit and maple syrup
or I have like half bagel with peanut
butter or cream cheese I really like the
onion bagels mixed with cream cheese
delish another breakfast that I really
enjoy which is in here is the Bayona I
really like this by owner brand they
seem to love everything they do
it's the granola the honey hazelnut one
so I don't know if this is particularly
good for you honestly because it's so
sweet it says sweetened only with
organic honey and lovingly baked into
Munchie golden clusters okay so is
just honey I'm fine with that I'm not
like a super healthy person but it
tastes good and I like to put a little
bit of milk with it and we usually have
skimmed milk in this house rich has like
oat milk and all of those things so we
didn't have a mix so it just depends
what I feel like on the day and and
maybe some fruit I put some raspberries
I also bought yesterday I know if it's
weird to have raspberries with milk that
sounds weird but I don't think it is I
only put like a tiny bit of milk in just
like stuff a little bit so this is what
they looked like
you can see the kind of little clusters
and I'm gonna make some of that for my
breakfast now and I'll show you the rest
of the stuff as the day goes on there it
is granola a little bit of milk a little
bit of raspberries I know this looks
like a tiny portion but as I said I
don't get that hungry in the morning
it's worth mentioning as well I am
working from home today so compared to
some of you that might commute into work
and get there and just be starving I
remember I used to work in an office job
by 10:30 I was absolutely starving
I've literally just walked downstairs so
I think my portion sizes are gonna be a
bit smaller I get really hungry at
dinnertime that's where I have my
biggest meal which I know you're not
really supposed to do whilst I sit down
to eat my breakfast I am gonna start on
my emails and tasks for today it's 11:30
and I'm gonna pull myself a drink
because I'm really bad at drinking
enough I never do I kind of find water a
little bit boring to drink and so it
doesn't motivate me to have any so
yesterday when I was at got myself my
favorite coconut water which is the
rebel one some of them I don't love Vita
Coco I actually don't really like any of
the other coconut waters pop in this one
they will taste a little bit like bad
breath to me but this one tastes really
good and it's just raw coconut water and
I think it's to do with when they pick
the coconuts which affects the flavor so
I just got a big one of those I'm gonna
pour some into a glass
I'm such a slow drinker so I'm not going
to over Felix I know I won't drink all
but look it's pink it's just like so
hydrating coconut would sir tastes
delish Rocco's popped round to say hi so
I thought I'd show you here's what he
eats in a day well you got here he's got
a fritter which is made from squash yeah
potato yes yep I'm peas and some baby
Bell oh you like thick it's better than
my lunch cup of tea at 10:00 to 12:00 is
12:30 so it's not quite time for lunch
yet but I'm a little bit hungry
so I'm gonna show you one of the things
I bought for a snack dried mango delish
so some of this stuff it's lunchtime
and luckily I was very organized with my
little yesterday so it's actually in the
fridge because I got it yesterday
obviously but I've tried this before my
sister recommended it to me and it's so
delicious it's by a brand called tanpopo
japanese food and it's burdock and
carrot pokey I don't has a pokey pokey
pokey
rice salad so it's like rice and veg and
it doesn't look that exciting but it's
the most delicious things like so
well-seasoned it's so young so I'm
really excited and it's quite small
portion so sorry I probably have like a
mid-afternoon snack so I'm gonna have
this probably some more coconut water as
well this is what it looks like it's so
delicious and there's like rice at the
bottom mmm just walked around to my
sister's house it's so sunny I needed to
get a bit of air I had a minstrel 1
minstrel okay let's talk snacks because
I've already shown you the dried mango
which I had the entire packet definitely
not healthy but other things that I
bought that I'm obsessed with toasted
corn this is the one from the lava corn
which is sea salt flavored I think my
favorite one is when it's not flavored
it's just toasted corn but I think this
Brad does plain one this is I
plain as it gets and they look like that
that a little bits of corn and they're
so addictive ma'am rich like you like a
whole pack of this this evening I'm
gonna try and hold off because they're
so addictive but once you start you
literally can't stop and then the other
thing because I've already had two of
these I had to yesterday out of hand a
natural licorice I flipped buddies
before the raspberry licorice they are
so good and they're really like filling
so these are sort of things I would like
to row my bag if I know I'm gonna get
hungry you need a snack
so these what I've got to pick from this
afternoon I'm gonna hold off yet I'm not
that hungry yet I'm gonna go do some
work
a film a video upstairs and then I might
have a cup of tea no I'll keep them
going for a bit longer and this would be
my like 4:30 5 o'clock snack before
having dinner later I have just been
working away for the past few hours I've
done well it's actually 5 o'clock but
we're quite late eaters I know it's not
really good for you to have a late
dinner but rich doesn't get home from
work like earlier 7:00 on a good day
which i think is pretty normal I don't
know if it's depending on where you live
some people I know husbands get back
earlier but I think we have a normal
office job sevens quite normal time to
be home so that's not like an early day
so we don't eat till like 8:00
because I'll probably will probably
start cooking when he gets back or you
know I'm not like a waiting wife if
dinner when he gets back because I
normally work up until he gets home and
I think I am gonna cook a bit earlier
tonight though saying that just because
I have to wash my hair so if I cook
earlier and then wash my hair I still
have time for TV watching oh my god I
haven't actually been looking at myself
what do I look like so anyway it's 5
o'clock and I'm a little bit hungry so I
am going to corn it's gonna get very
addictive the salt is definitely gonna
hurt my lips but a bit hungry I'm also
going up somewhat coconut water because
these are gonna make me thirsty this is
what the corn looks like seriously try
it guys used to get like a really cheap
one from my local newsagent so it was
also delicious just so good so it's now
6:30 I finished work rich said he's
gonna be back late so I'm gonna make
dinner now normally I would wait but I
want to wash my hair tonight and I need
to leave it to dry naturally and it's
gonna go huge or frizzy and you just got
you guys don't need to see that so soon
as I'm filming I thought I'm gonna make
dinner a little bit earlier I'm gonna be
making a Spanish butter bean
you with fragrant rice I've mentioned
before that we are doing hellofresh
and we're still really loving it some
nights to be honest I can't we both like
cook a proper meal and I'd rather just
like make some fast or do something else
kind of easier um so that's the only
time I don't love it but most the time I
always I never regret it once I actually
get Mac to death together and make a
cook it's only a six step I never regret
it's always so yummy last night we had
like a pork biryani or something and it
was so good so this one Spanish butter
beans shoe we haven't done this before
my little fridge also it's really handy
because they have like stock and little
flavorings and stuff as well I guess
it's quite a lot of plastic packaging
I'm sure they're gonna comment on that
sure lot normally there's not as much
stuff so on this side it shows you what
it looks like how long it's gonna take
all the ingredients you need and then on
this side are the six steps I do find it
quite stressful sometimes I'm like ah
what do you do when too many steps and
then like here's where it says the
measurements and the whole kitchen will
become very chaotic in about 10 minutes
time and we haven't got much work
surface area we've got this little bit
here and then this little bit here which
is actually really small so I find that
a little bit tricky in this kitchen I
cannot wait for our new kitchen right so
I'm gonna read the first two steps see
what I need to do and kind of get going
with this the first thing you do is
toast
flaked almonds
I mean that's if I kill a from the
packaging just says toast until golden
and then set aside so I like to do is
look at the next step to see what's
coming up okay put the shallot and
vegetable stock and rice cooking in
there I just need to like bring that to
a boil and then simmer it for a while of
toast the almonds so next I think it's
time to do with courgette okay I'm just
softening the other half that's a lot I
mean I'm not reading this out so that
you guys could follow the recipe it's
far too complicated to do that I think
now I need to add Cosette so all the
little spices are in these little pots
which makes it so easy you got have to
measure anything out no to add Ghana and
pre-k for me it's the spices that make
my hellofresh cooking better than my
normal cooking because when I cook I can
cook but it's pretty basic and I
wouldn't know like what sort of spices
to add to make it a bit fancier so
that's why can that's how I can I taste
the difference in being essence doing it
the rice is pretty much cooked in there
I've just added the butter beans to the
courgette and tomatoes and now I'm gonna
be adding in some spinach crazy what ash
a lot and big vegetable stock can do to
rice this tastes so good
so I've served up the rice and then I've
got the butter beans to go in here
looking and smelling good
pretty sure it's done so I'm just gonna
put some of this onto the rice and then
this is like the salsa it's just like
parsley toasted almonds and black olives
bit of lemon zest that's gonna go on top
okay so this is the final dish well this
is the final dish with the salsa on it
that one's for rich I sometimes tend to
skip they like extra bits cuz that's
normally well like the parsley and the
stuff that I'm not a massive fan on lies
so I'm giving rich the salsa cuz he'll
like that but I think I'm just gonna
have mine like this and it smells so
good
very excited dig in rich wasn't home
from work yet I'm gonna go eat this
alone on the sofa and he can have his
when he gets back sorry I just stopped
you with a fork then I'm gonna cover his
and foil to keep it warm here
I'm gonna watch station 19 I watch TV
when I eat dinner I sit on the sofa when
I eat dinner I think it's fine we do
sometimes make an effort to set the
dining table when we're both eating
together but I grew up eating dinner on
the sofa so it's very normal to me I'm
gonna try some just to give you guys the
taste test mmm it's so good I made it
I'm gonna eat my dinner and I'll
probably check in with you later when I
have really frizzy hair and I'm probably
eating some kind of snack I'm ending my
video looking ridiculous because I'm
about to straighten my very frizzy hair
this is what my hair looks like when it
dries naturally awful anyway I just
thought I would tell you that I'm having
a cup of tea which I'm very excited
about what's the time rich 10 o'clock
cup of tea and one of my licorice things
so that is my what I wish I ate in a day
on a good day I hope you guys like this
video let me know what you thought
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you in the next one
