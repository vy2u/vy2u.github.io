for you today it's actually a really
nice sunny day which just put me in a
group in a great mood it's Tuesday and
today I've got a day in town my hair
looks like this because I'm actually
going to the hairdresser's I'm going to
hirtius since this morning
not for color this time I'm going for a
Brazilian blow-dry I'm very excited I
really should have them more frequently
throughout the year because of my hair
type but I just don't I'm lazy and I
find the process quite uncomfortable
always makes my eyes stream and she
maybe I should bring some spare makeup
with me today because I'm going out
tonight I'm going to have a Brazilian
treatment done it basically just I don't
get it done to make my hair dead
straight and I just get it done to make
my hair more manageable and easier to
straighten and it just takes away the
bulk and the frizz so I'm going to
hirtius ins in Harvey Nichols to get
that done and then I've got some
meetings in town and then tonight I'm
going to a very exciting event with my
friend Deb's so I'm just sending some
things from my laptop to my iPad so I
can do some work in the hairdresser's I
don't just kind of sit there relaxing if
I'm going to the hairdresser's midweek I
make sure I've got work with me to do
and then I need to head into town
quickly show you what I'm wearing today
this vest top is old it's from monkey
mmm I don't love it I couldn't really
find a top to go with these these are
new clots from Urban Outfitters and I
like because they're very comfy and airy
great for a hot day but I struggle to
find a top that kind of goes and you
can't really see in this light it's okay
I don't love it necklace it is whistles
and then the shoes are from ASOS and
then hopefully my hair will look better
once it's actually it won't you look so
greasy because they put the product in
and then they blow dry it in I have to
spend like the next 4 days with this
like really really hydrated but like
greasy hair oh dear I have these new
little friends I got in the weekend I
actually got a big plant for my desk and
then I got these little ones as well for
my Kier and they're really nice I just
need to find some nice pots for them to
go because I don't have any so they're
just kind of sitting here for now I
really like this one spikey I just got
the
but whenever I have like a 10 o'clock
appointment I was in Kuwait for the
schools open
you gotta get and waiting open and I'm
going to
okay I have the Brazilian permanent
blow-drying my hair and this one's
actually different you can tell my eyes
aren't watering because it's
formaldehyde free and it's purple - this
one
the new Brazilian treatment blonde
that's purple which is good because then
I won't get brassy tones my hair and
this one you wash it out so they've put
it on 20 minutes and wash out 80% leave
pretty cent of it in blow dry my hair
and go so I don't have to spend like
cool days
greasy hair so much further my eyes
aren't singing if you didn't see that is
what is cool okay I'm going to embarrass
myself blog in public I don't care but
I'm out the hairdresser now and I'm so
glad that they've reinvented the
Brazilian blow-dry because my eyes
didn't stream it was so comfortable I
don't have to wait for days to wash my
hair I can watch it today if I wanted to
I'm going to leave it in a couple of
days I think the annoying thing is it's
stripped to the color that we did
recently and me and Jason knew that
would happen so my hair a bit warm and
orange again but I'm going back next
week just to get my roots dark in so
it's kind of back to how it was so I'm
gonna have warm hair for a week but it's
very straight and glossy and hopefully
you'll make managing my hair a lot
easier I'm now heading off to a meeting
and little house which is like so her
house in Mayfair and I'll catch up with
you or just actually I think I'm gonna
go get some it super stand ready hop
group God it is boiling today it's like
29 degrees it hasn't me to top here in a
while
I'm not going to the game office I've
got like an hour to kill I'm going to do
males and then I'm gonna meet dead maybe
I ought to my P o box while I'm here I'm
just looking forward to some air cotton
