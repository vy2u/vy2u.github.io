video again these are things i bought
over the last few weeks it's been sunny
so i've been shopping mall my lunch
break what can you do also I've got all
the windows open because it's so hot and
I'm on the top floor of my house so it's
like a sauna so sorry if there's any
sort of noise from the windows but
hopefully they won't be so I'm gonna get
started because I've got loads of stuff
and this is sort of fashion and beauty
i'll start with the beauty stuff there
was a 342 deal at superdrug ish i think
is still going on across all the
cosmetics so i went to the big store in
Marble Arch London and picked up some
things I picked up two more se polishes
and one in splash of grenadine which is
it's nice pinky purple color that I'm
actually wearing on my nails now I
really like this one and i also got not
just a pretty face which sort of dusty
pink i haven't tried this yet but it
looks like a nice everyday kind of color
i also got two lip products one's the
revlon move over which is a matte
lipstick and it's a really nice sort of
a neutral color which would be nice for
work and i also got another rouge caress
a lip butter kind of thing in what's a
cool tempting line look which is really
nice it's kind of it doesn't really show
up much on my lips it's kind of the same
color as my lips but it's nice as a lip
balm i also got from superdrug Garnier
summer body it's got really sunny
recently it just made me realize how
pale i look so i wanted to try a gradual
tan i'm actually really really scared of
tanning products because i'm always
scared I'm gonna get orange I just think
people who have freaked and just look
awful but i thought i'd give it go and
its really nice and really natural and i
think i do look a bit more tanned it's
not nothing major but smells nice as
well so yeah smells like fruit so I'm
happy I got this and I've already used
up like this much so i think i'll
probably be bias one again when i finish
and i also got this from spacing k
I heard Anna from Viviana's makeup and
este from essiebutton talking about this
and it just made me want it it's the
nooks reve de Mille lip balm I don't
know how to pronounce that but it's it's
really nice lip balm it's like 10 pounds
ridiculously overpriced for a lip balm
but it's amazing and I'm happy to spend
that much money if it's a really good
product so it however looks like this in
its a matte lip balm and i was using
this wrong when i first got it because i
tried it on I was I couldn't really get
the hype because I was sort of swirling
my finger around and then applying it
and nothing's really happening then I
realized you literally have to like
scoop out the product and so like if
you're like me and you like having a
smooth lip balm it's probably isn't for
you that's quite frustrating you have to
scoop out products and literally like
layer on your lips and then it works so
well and it lasts for hours like maybe
four to five hours keeps your lips
moisturized but it's a really really
nice frosted glass bottle it's really
nice and heavy I like the packaging um
and I think that's one of the best lip
balms I've tried so I'm really happy
about that I don't know if any of you
saw my what's in my bag video but I
showed a little dip teeth drawstring bag
that Heath all the bits in my handbag in
it got really grubby and started to
break and it was really annoying me so I
wanted to get a little bag to put in my
handbag to keep all my lip balms and
hair grips and things so I got this bag
for Muji um and it was really cheaper
than I was like five pounds and it
actually came with about 50 pens like
there's all different colors which I've
actually found quite useful I keep them
in a cup on my desk at work and have a
couple in here as well and so it's a
really nice sized bag my handbag and I
keep like any makeup I want to take to
work or like a mirror hand sanitizer all
my little bits in there that's really
good so I'm glad I got that from Lucci
what else does few more Beauty bit I
went to Mac and got some bits
the first thing I got sposa lipstick and
I've been looking at this one for ages
every time I go in ice watch it on my
hand imagine a look around to buying it
and and yesterday I just thought I'm
going to get it so this one's called
fanfare it's a chrome machine so it's
really nice and moisturizing and it's a
kind of pink with a bit of coral in it
I'm not very good at describing colors
but it's really nice and wearing it now
actually and so nice summery color I'm
really glad I got that in the end i also
got from mac of 263 angled brush it
takes up to that just looks like this
and i want to start for summer trying to
use liquid eyeliner less and use shadow
more to line the top of my eye I just
think it looks a bit less harsh and more
natural and I haven't really got a good
angle brush they're all a bit too thick
this one's really nice and thin so I I
got this as well and that's all i got
for mac okay on to the clothes that I've
got the first thing I what was this top
from hmm or i call it Henny's but no one
ever knows what i mean when i say that
so i'm gonna call it hm it's this mint
green sheer kind of shirt thing I've got
this already in sort of a peach color
and a black from last season and they've
just black this colors or I really like
its foot sort of a v-neck a pocket on
the front and then these curved loose
arms I'm just really nice easy for me to
wear at work and its really light so
it's good for the summer another thing I
got from hmm
is this top kind of a similar style this
is fun I think this is these are both
from this of trend collection and it's
the only bit and Henny's I really like
and this is a sort of pink top it's like
a t-shirt in the front feels like a
shirt the materials that this thing good
buttons going down the front and then
the back is like a cotton material so I
think that's really nice it's like a bit
different and quite easy to wear and
then i also got which I've already done
a blog post on these American Apparel
leggings which probably right be able to
see much of but they're like shiny
leggings and they look pretty much like
the disco pants but they're much thinner
and easier to wear so are we ought to
get these because I do love the disco
pants but it's quite like a hassle to
wear them because they are really tight
and they re thick and if you're wearing
a long top you can have see the button
and zip so these are really nice and
they were like 30 quid which is quite
expensive for leggings but I really
think they're worth it's a really really
good quality and then the last stuff I
got for the top shop I went yesterday
after work and I'm first thing is the
skirt which I absolutely love so happy I
got this then the receipt by the way
from my topshop purchases flew out of my
top shop bag get into Oxford Street
under a bus so I really need to like all
these things and not want to take them
back because I hadn't got the receipt
and this is the skirt so it's like a
short pleated skirt and look like a baby
blue color and a little bunny print I
think it's so cute than if you can
really see the whole thing I try and do
an outfit post with this anyway but
really nice for summer and little vest
top tucked in I'm really excited to wear
that and I also got the t-shirt it's
quite like a basic t-shirt it's like 16
pounds but it feels nice and look nice
on so it's like a normal t-shirt with
rolled-up sleeves and it's sort of grey
with like this black greenie print and
then at the back is a little zip at the
top so I like that again more easy
clothes i'm just going
easy clothes these days because we wake
up a half six in the morning it's too
hard to side with too many options and
then I also just got some jeans I
realized that i've got like baby blue
jeans and pink jeans and all these
different colors but the only actual
Jean color jeans I have a quite dark and
not very summery so I picked up another
pair of Li for their like the lighter
color like this with a little rolled up
bottoms their ankle braces so a little
bit short and these is really nice just
plain old jeans nothing that special so
that's it from my whole quite a lot of
stuff but as I said it's over the past
few weeks and I hope you enjoyed seeing
what I got and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
