the phone hello if you don't know
Victoria which is crazy if you don't you
should her videos are amazing but she's
been in some of my videos before cuz you
went to Florida Disney together which
was the best trip ever we still talk
about it like on a daily basis and
whilst you guys are watching this we're
gonna be in Brighton having a little
Disney reunion so I'll be vlogging not
to go up on Tuesday and me so if you
haven't subscribed to Victoria already
head over to her channel her videos are
so amazing and bright and lovely and
cheerful today we're gonna do a little
haul video and show you guys what we've
been buying recently and I was like do
you want to do a horse oh yeah but some
stuff with someone else before I mean I
actually really want to see what you do
by it okay
so Julie go first yes I do okay so the
first thing that I picked up this month
are these beautiful little pink they're
almost like mules aren't they but sandal
mules yes so no it's so cute with this
rose gold trimming on the inside really
lovely blush pink I just thought you
know for summer holidays matching with
some like white collapse or little denim
shorts like an evening that'd be super
cute they comfy yeah they are really
confidentially I mean it's cuz you go
quite wide at the bottom so you got a
really good stable platform to stand on
and yeah they're really really cute I
love that rose gold detailing I love
Jeana I buy all my shoes and jeans I
think this so it's so comfy yeah
they really are and they're really with
a good price as well yeah so yeah I got
some shoes too okay warning mine look
really weird I feel like most people
will hate them and they look much better
on than they do Oh obviously the scale
the Bears are so girly these are mine
okay fun cause they look weird off but
they've got like this wooden what's that
called like heel wedge so much makes
them kind of casual but the black makes
them kind of smart
open toe and this is like elasticated so
they're really really comfy and they
look so weird I think they look so
comfortable I think they're really nice
oh and you can wear them like with jeans
for casual summer evening I also wore
this I was too that L'Oreal event that
we went to
and I think you look really nice so yeah
I really like these they weren't cheap
they were like 120 which for me I think
it's quite a lot because I don't really
buy shoes that often but they're so
comfy as long as they come here now I'll
wear them and what beautiful wood as
well without text yeah that's so
different I think exactly it's a bit
different I love cause do you shop it
yeah me too I love that love it so far
so sophisticated
yeah there's my shoes ok next thing I
picked up was a big splurge I'll be
honest but I saw these in the airport
going to Barcelona a squeak and then on
the way home they have them again so
like it's like they have to get them so
I think they're called the N fall
glasses and the lightness very big of
course I bought them because he had pink
on the inside it she doesn't she doesn't
like pink with a pink on the inside and
then the black white pink on the outside
other month okay wow you're really
statement you know that's very big cool
classic I've been desperate for some
Dior sunglasses every time I get
Selfridges or sunglasses how anyway I've
been looking but they never have the
ones I want and they seem quite hard to
find I think like a brand like that I
feel like they're not easily accessible
reason so they never have the ones I
want there's a so-so no cute aren't they
I just thought they'd go with a lot of
things they really see you oh thank you
so there's one glass other good
investments yes all of mine like ray
bands and stuff they're saying that I
was in sunglasses that returned I know I
don't normally because I feel like I
want some glasses to be good quality in
last but I saw these in Broadway Market
if you ever been to mark London yeah yes
mainly a food market but there's a
little bit in a school playground that
has like accessories and stuff and
they're kind of to keep me going
pillow find my nice deal and they have
this like mirrored effect which I really
like that's what I was like oh that's so
huge at the moment they're in yes and
they've got like gold on the side I
don't really know if they suit me that
well but yeah they do they're kind of
cool there are only ten pounds so not
much yeah okay so the next thing I
picked up I'm a massive grey mal fan
like a lot of my friends know that I
pick up
Grima but I did see this from whistles a
sauce and it's a very basic gray multi
very short little sleeves round neck it
has got some nice little details at the
seam down the back I love to see I'm
just gonna say it's you know about it
makes all the difference yeah that's
what makes it whistles yeah exactly and
it's a really beautiful grain bottle as
well really really I mean yeah it's it's
quite pricey for t-shirt I think it's 35
pounds but is that bad for like a good
basic exactly the quality is gorgeous
and it will go with so many pieces yes
summer I thought it was better to buy a
better t-shirt for this price than to
buy lots of cheaper t-shirts that
weren't gonna last me a song I agree
yeah okay my neck I'm gonna do some
accessories I have quite a few I'm going
to work rings so these two I'll do a
little close-up these are from I went to
Brick Lane last weekend and there was a
little food market in the Truman old
Truman brewery and there's like jewelry
stands and other things at the back and
they sell prints and this girl who makes
her and Julia was selling these and it
was like one for eight pounds of 250 you
get in so I just put these and I really
like they're absolutely beautiful
exactly what I was looking for I just
like wearing lots of rings by I don't
mind and resting it rings but I haven't
really found any and then you find one
that's like 150 pounds then you're like
just got one yeah what loads yeah so I
thought mother I get some cheap ones but
they're actually feel quite good quality
as well they look beautiful
and the other ring I have is this as she
was sent to me I don't normally include
that at all but I really wanted to show
you look it's a little brown called
leave Renee I think they pronounce it
and it's a really cute little gold
pineapple ring and I love it and it fits
me I have tiny tiny fingers or rings
never fit me yeah so this is a small and
it fits perfectly on my middle finger so
yeah loving gold rings at the moment
yeah they're beautiful are you to go for
silver but they're so pretty
I'd definitely go for that used to like
only wear silver when I was younger but
now I own you her cold I've gone
completely the other way okay next thing
that picked up again from a sauce or
whatever it's been your new sauce I
think but it was these crepe I feel like
a crepe material black trouser
a sauce I've turned them off of X I
thought they looked quite cute with a
bit of turn up and heels
I'm in a bit of a phase that I love
wearing court shoes and little heeled
shoes at the moment so these with me
like that gray mile t-shirt from
whistles with a little pair of course
shoes is so kind of Victoria Beckham she
do it so you as well that is really nice
I'm so jealous so you can just wear like
heels on a normal day like I'm like
wedding exclusive heels and even then
I'm like I just think it must make some
outfits so it's just Canyon I mean
obviously if I'm going somewhere really
far away then I'll need to get a taxi
there if I'm wearing heels but that's
why I look good as much as possible but
these are super comfortable and they fit
so flattering they loose they've got a
little bit of a loose feel to them
although the fine around the waist we're
in a quite loose around the legs and
then office around here so a little bit
of a wider leg more of a straight leg
but so flattering on okay my next one
you would have seen if you watch my
vlogs because I've had this for a little
while now it's this bag it's from brandy
melville if you mean the brand new but
there's one off Carnaby Street in London
and it's it's kind of a strange Brian
like I really love the style but most of
their clothes are one size which it's
really weird it doesn't really make
sense so it's kind of hit or miss with
me but I really like this bag it's got
like the fringing detail which I love
it's a whole like 70s trend at the
moment gold hardware is it moves I take
35 pounds it's kind of not an expensive
bag then hand the zips already broken
which is annoying but it's a good size
for like everyday and I've worn this
every day since I bought it I love that
yeah my sister loves it as well okay
next up is something I picked up from
mint velvet it's a place I haven't
really ever shopped at before but I went
a little bit crazy on there because I
just loved everything that I saw and
this was a I guess he'd call this a
blouse but you can't the blouse yeah
this is a tunic better than acetate
unix-style yeah yeah Shan Pro so the
guys I put the back to get you into it
as well
cropped sleeves three-quarter sleeves
and it's a little bit of an oversized
I mean I have this in a size 8 and I'd
you should go for size 6 but this seems
to fit in a really lovely flattering way
and I really love this embellishment and
this bit of dye Monti and sequins really
prove detailing my mom loves him in
velvet and the quality I haven't got
anything but the quality of the plants
so I said you nice lob as well yeah but
they're quite honestly have a look at me
velvet that clothing is so gorgeous it's
so pretty
so all it's in Barcelona and I'm gonna
take it away on my next holiday I loved
it it's really pretty
ok my next item is a couple of necklaces
first were the one I'm wearing I'm
really into triangles at the moment for
some reason I also really want triangle
tattoo but I'm not gonna let myself but
this necklace is from Urban Outfitters
and it's like a - it's got like two in
one really simple gold and the other
necklace is from brandy melville which I
thought when I bought the bag and it's
also like a kind of like a double
triangle chain very simple I like
wearing them together actually it's kind
of lay it all up that's almost like an
antique gold as well as yeah just a bit
more contrasty you're looking like more
vintage it is also quite into my junior
at the moment how can I say the word
jewelry weirdly jewelry I'm excited but
I'm northern jewelry jewelry I think
jewellery
I always loves me that doesn't come out
easily I love how these these rings and
these look that is in the same place
yeah I actually thought you're gonna say
they work together no this was 13 pounds
of Urban Outfitters just so really good
alright it looks beautiful qualities
yeah it's so hot in here by the way can
we just explain to people why we might
look a bit 30 we've got all the windows
closer to this for the sound it's a bit
like a greenhouse yeah and we're wearing
matching stripe yeah let's carry on
great ok so last thing I picked up again
was from mint velvet but like I said
rather obsessed with that at the moment
and it is these trousers they're slower
in as three it's like a dusty lavender
lilac gray if that's the type of color
but it has almost they're not a really
really
leg they're almost a slightly cropped
length which again will look beautiful
with court shoes and heels I think I
wore these with some little heel sandals
and I went to Barcelona and they just
look so gorgeous I absolutely love them
they're really flattering on as well
they fit really beautifully they're
really nice they're quite high-waisted
they yeah they were little bit high
waisted but definite on your hips and
more of a kind of mid yeah rise I'd say
a little bit I suppose but just so
flattering I just love the print with
any kind of t-shirt that does kind of
make it a little bit more exciting nice
I really need to take you shopping
I feel like you're really loved that
shortly date okay my final thing is from
Topshop it's still in the bag and it
still has its label on because I need
your help
I'm excited sorry what was yesterday the
whole like 90s trend is back and I think
it's hilarious and I'm well up for it I
love that they do denim jackets are back
in finally so I was been on the hunt for
the perfect one for ages I tried on like
the vintage Levi's ones but the arms are
really baggy yes the style didn't look
great I've been looking around a fan
smiling Topshop and I really liked it my
actual sizes are twelve but it was kind
of too fitted I didn't really want it I
wanted a bit oversized they didn't have
a 14 so I got the sixteen I don't know
if it's too oversized so I'm have to try
it on for you and show you but I like
the color denim because it's like not
too light it's not too dark
I wish the bottoms were gold but that
doesn't really exist in denim jackets
rolled up sleeves
I'm also if you get the slightly bigger
side then it's a bit longer the twelve
was quite crop domain I'm not lying to
that kind of girly style so I'll
probably wear this like with black jeans
or with a place suit or a dress or skirt
underneath I love that idea
and I like it I just don't know whether
to maybe hunt out 14 I'll show it on for
you so 460 was too big but I do like
that sort oversize denim jacket look
yeah that's such a grind
yeah I like little reps as well yeah it
looks a great shape this is so funny
when my trends come back in that you've
already lived one like I used to a denim
jacket and jeans like together yes we'll
do that not everything that we both
picked up I hope you guys enjoyed this
little like random haul together we are
now going to film a video for Victoria's

opportunity but either way it's gonna be
