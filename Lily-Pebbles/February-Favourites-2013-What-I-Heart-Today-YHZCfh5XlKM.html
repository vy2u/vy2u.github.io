favorite and I don't have that many this
month I've got five beauty favorites and
one fashion favorite so six all together
I'm wearing no lipstick today because i
am on some kind of hydrocortisone cream
thing because of the stupid Maybelline
lipstick um so yeah that's why I look a
bit kind of no lip sticky and now i'm
going to get started i did spend the
first two weeks of this month on holiday
so that's why i don't have that many
favorites and that's why the first one
is holiday related and it's the Clarins
after sun moisturizer self tanning and
it says rehydrates intensifies a tan i
always like to use kind of gradual
tanner with my after sun because i think
if i'm going to moisturize like I don't
moisturize my boy need that much when
I'm at home on holiday I do every like
oh come back from the beach or the pool
I have a shower and then I moisturize my
whole body so if I'm going to go through
the effort of doing that I quite like
having a gradual tanner in because it
takes me quite a while to get a tan when
I'm a Hyundai anyway and i love the
Clarins face gradual tanner that you
kind of put on with cotton wool and
leave it overnight I really loved that
so I was excited to try this and it was
really good at left a really nice kind
of golden tan and I only had a couple of
streaks if I kind of wasn't
concentrating but other than that it was
really easy to use and I was very
impressed with this the next favorite is
something probably seen a lot of people
talking about and it's the barry m gelly
high shine nail paints and this one is
in blueberry i think yes it looks like
this and i picked up one of these a
while ago I've now got two more colors
I've got pomegranate one and like a
lighter pink one and I love these I love
the formula they're really thick that
meant to be like a gel nail polish
they're really thick and they dry really
quickly I always do my nails at night
and I wake up and they're all smudged
from lying in bed and this never happens
with these so i really love formula and
this color in particular i really like
it reminds me of an Essie nail polish I
have and it's one of those you always
get comments
compliments on it when you wear it so
really impressed with these actually
I've got three and I might see if
there's any other colors I like I
remember thinking there weren't that
many nice colors but the formula is
really nice the X product is a
foundation and it's the Revlon nearly
naked foundation which is a new one to
us in the UK it's been an America for a
while I think another product but has
the word naked in the title is obviously
like a thing revlon and urban decay of
battling out with the naked products but
yeah i was really excited to try this it
has got an SPF in it but SPF 20 I'd say
it's a light to medium coverage probably
one of the lightest of all my
foundations and but really easy to blend
i use my Real Techniques buffing brush
and I'm wearing it today I've been
wearing a kind of every day for two
weeks and I really really like you I've
got the color 150 nude but that was too
dark for me before I went away it suits
me now but I think I'll be quite a lot
lighter in a couple of weeks and but
yeah really liked it the only problem is
everybody has said I know there's no
pump and you just turn a lid and it's
just got the foundation there and I just
think that's so annoying you get it you
kind of have to poor little boy in your
hand or use a cotton bud to get it out
and you always end up wasting product
and having to wipe your hands and just a
bit of a pain I'm prefer to pay a little
bit more for a foundation with a pump
but what can you do it's quite cheap for
a Revlon foundation i think it's 799
which is quite a bit cheaper than the
others but i'm really impressed I love
the field event on the skin I love the
finish and yet really liking this at the
moment the next product is from Topshop
makeup and it's this palette it's called
cream highlighter kick in kick start and
the openness it's not so reflecting it
looks like this it's got four cream
products in it the top two if I tell the
right around this is a bronze this is a
blush and then there's two kind of
highlighting colors and I've been using
the bottom to the most i've been using
this one on my cheekbones and that damn
i knows in this one in the corner of
corners of my eye and I think the
formula of the creams are really nice
and they're really easy to use with your
fingers and is a really nice palette to
carry in your handbag I've just been
taking us everywhere with me and I
really really like it I don't use the
bronze and the blush colors as much the
blushes reading
actually the bronze is just a little bit
too golden for me but I just really
really like this I saw it when I was in
Topshop thought I'll try it and I'm
really glad I picked it up cuz it's
definitely one of my favorites this
month next is surprisingly a main
putting lipstick after all the fuss with
the other one I really like this
lipstick it's called 916 neon red in its
from their color sensational range which
looks like this has got like a really
bright packaging um and it doesn't look
like anything that's special I'm not
really sure what tracted me to it but I
bought it when I was in westfield and
boots and i really liked it you know you
just put on a red color and you're like
yes I really like this I would put it on
to show you guys but I can't because my
lips so I just watch it on my hand for
you but it's just a really nice bright
neon red and the formula of this was
really good it didn't hurt my lips at
all it felt really comfortable on and
yeah I'd really recommend going to pick
up one of these if you can so my final
favorite is something that really helps
me through Fashion Week and if you saw
my blog post or my Fashion Week outfits
if you haven't i'll link it below I was
wearing the same bag and every outfit
and that's because I need to carry my
iPad and notepad and all these things so
I needed a bag that wouldn't get in the
way when I was backstage but would carry
kind of my ipod in it and that's where
this guy came in and I love this bag I
got it from Urban Outfitters I got in
the serve 20 pounds so many of you guys
like tweeted me saying you got it when I
get down to 10 pounds with free delivery
online so that's really cool i'm glad
you got it discounted although i've paid
20 for it and the yeah really like this
bag is gone long strapped and it's the
perfect size for like an ipad and
notebook mine actually broke the
original one i showed you in a video
this part of it broke but i went back to
the shop and they gave me a new one so
that was good but yeah really like this
bag i think it just looks cool with any
outfit and it's just really profitable
and easy and that saves my life during
Fashion Week's that's definitely a
favorite so that's everything from my
februari favorites that's really hard to
say februari favorites some reason I
hope you enjoyed watching this and i'll
see you in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
