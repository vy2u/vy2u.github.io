February favorites video and I've got a
big mix of things today from makeup to
style and also some films as well so I'm
gonna get started and the first product
I'm gonna talk about is this eyeshadow
palette from zoeva so if there's a
really great brand
I think it's German you can get it
online and it's really quite affordable
for the quality that it is I think it's
amazing
this is their nude spectrum eyeshadow
palette it's new they have three
palettes I think this is the one that I
completely fell in love with you guys
know the deal a beautiful nude palette
I'm gonna tilt it like that so it
doesn't reflect it's got a really nice
mix of shadows but I just love the
quality of their eyeshadows they're so
buttery and creamy and they really last
all day on my lids this one in
particular is so much like Mac all that
glitters I really really love it I've
pretty much been using them all apart
from the black that's probably the only
one that I haven't got much use out of
this gold is a very yellowy gold but
it's still really pretty I think every
shade is very wearable I've just noticed
that it doesn't have a mirror because I
got something in my teeth and I was
trying to check before filming but
neither this or the other products I'm
talking about has a mirror in it which
is a little bit annoying but I prefer to
pay less and not have a mirror because
so many of my other products have
mirrors in them this is 28 pounds 50 and
you can get it online on the zoeva
website the next thing I want to talk
about is Emma Kate Koh and I've been
following Emma Kate on Instagram for a
really long time and then I noticed that
my favorite shop in London home and
pantry started stocking her products and
I just went crazy
she's an illustrator I'm pretty sure
she's based in Australia and I just love
her stuff it's really simple it's like
squiggly handwriting stuff but I just
love the style and sort of things she
comes up with so I've got quite a big
range of stuff from her I've got a lot
of greeting cards and I love to stock up
on cards as I mentioned in my
organizational video just in case I need
them for a special occasion this one
says it's going to be okay I promise
this one says miss your face this one
says darling just own it and I
have this as a print in my office on the
wall this one says I like you the most
and I'm glad you exist I just love the
things it's really different what it
says on the cards from like the standard
like happy birthday or I'm sorry I get
so bored the same greeting cards over
I also have a couple of her prints this
one says always kiss me goodnight and I
really want to put that up on the wall
next to my bed and then this one's a bit
bigger and I think I'm gonna put this up
in the lounge and it looks like this and
it says live wild show up stand out
drink coffee make love have grace get
lost wonderful risk everything follow
that dream maybe a little bit cheesy but
I think it looks really really nice
sorry that it's reflecting they're still
in their plastic packaging she seems
like a really sweet girl I love her
style I'll link her website down below
and you can see where her products are
stopped near you but I really think it's
nice to invest in like a young business
and I just really love her illustration
style okay I have three films to
recommend this month I saw all three of
these this month and I just really want
to throw them in because I love a good
film recommendation they're not all new
the first one I watched on Netflix and
it's called still Alice and it has
Julianne Moore in it and she was
absolutely brilliant I think she won an
award for it I didn't realize at the
time in the film she is a mom and a wife
and she gets diagnosed with early onset
Alzheimer's
and she's a young very clever professor
so it's all about her journey dealing
with a diagnostic and how it progresses
and it's very oh my god that dog is back
I swear this dog only barks when I film
it's a really sad film also completely
brilliant the next two films are a
completely other scale of things that
both comedies first ones trainwreck and
this has Amy Schumer in it who is so so
funny she grows up her dad like doesn't
believe in being with one person forever
so she's kind of a bit of a floozy
is that the right word but then she
finds someone she was to settle down
with it's just really funny it's a
light-hearted comedy something to watch
when you haven't really got anything
else to do and then the next one is man
up which is an English film featuring
Simon Pegg and Lake Bell I absolutely
love Lake Bell and it's so so funny
she's a kind of long-term single girl
who accidentally stumbles across someone
else's blind date and kind of goes along
with a life tends to be the blind date
and it's really funny and sweet and just
I absolutely loved it like the whole way
through I've got time to rich being like
I love this well I just didn't expect to
love it that much it's so well made and
so like my kind of humor I love that
it's a British film so definitely worth
watching I think that might also have
been on it
Lix okay I'm gonna keep going with these
random favorites Muji pens I've talked
about these in an Instagram maybe a blog
post already I love these Muji pens
they're the 0.5 gel ink pens and they
come in like 19 shade 19 colors I think
I've got the black the turquoise the
blue and the lighter blue and I just
love them they're so nice for like
writing in your notebook they're small
enough that they don't get smudgy and I
love they come in different colors I
don't know if your station you obsess
like I am then you might appreciate this
but these are really great pens I
definitely recommend them if you're just
here for the beauty favorites don't
worry they are coming but the next one
is also very random what's app but for
web now my friend Lucy introduced this
to me and it has changed my life if you
are someone who uses whatsapp on your
phone a lot then you will love this it's
basically whatsapp but on your desktop
so you just like typing web.whatsapp.com
or something like that I will link it
down below and it means you don't have
to keep checking your phone especially
if you're sitting at your desk it's good
for a Productivity cuz you're not kind
of keep having to go to your phone but
also if you're trying to like keep the
fact that you're chatting to your
friends on the down-low at work it's
also really good you just open it as a
tab on your internet browser if you want
then you can have the notifications pop
up in the corner of your screen if not
you can just check it and you can just
chat on whatsapp but by typing on your
computer it is genius I absolutely love
it I use it every day now when I'm
sitting at my desk because I have a lot
of like whatsapp chats with friends and
work so it's amazing if you watch my
blogs you would have already seen these
glasses I swear this isn't sponsored
work I just had such a nice experience
with this brand that I really want to
share it and it had such a good reaction
when I mentioned it in my vlog these are
my new glasses from Bailey Nelson Bailey
Nelson is a shop in London there are
three or four branches around London and
the whole idea is that it's like a set
price 98 pounds for any of the glasses
style and I includes the lenses as well
and every time I tell someone that like
in real life they are blown away because
glasses are really expensive and you end
up buying these like designer frames you
don't even really want but these are
also good the styles of the glasses are
really really nice as well they're all
really on trend that all Bailey Nelson
brands it's not all different brands
it's just one brand and I went for the
mark over autumn fade these are
currently sold out online
I think you guys went a bit crazy after
the vlog but I'm sure they will restock
and if you are in London you can go into
the stores and get them in there they
look like this I really like that
they're round and they're faded on the
bottom so if either sometimes if you get
like black glasses it can be a little
bit too harsh on the face so this really
kind of softens them up a bit I'll put
them on for you to see that is what they
look like sorry for the reflection of
the light and the coolest thing about
this that I just realized last weekend
is they also do little clip Cotton's to
make them sunglasses these are only 30
pounds to clip on and if you are a
glasses wearer or know that when you're
driving in your car and you have and
it's sunny you have put your sunglasses
on but then they're not kind of
prescription unless you pay for them to
prescription but that can be quite
expensive so these literally just let me
show you how they work they just clip on
the front like that and that instantly
turns them into sunglasses which i think
is just such a genius idea and I really
like the shape of these sunglasses as
well so Bailey Nelson glasses I had such
a nice experience with them so I would
definitely recommend it
okay now on to Beauty auskey I have
recently brought out two new products
and moisturizer and a serum I've been
trying both of them for about three to
four weeks now I really like them both
but the one I wanted to talk about today
is the new moisturizer which is the
Renaissance 360 so this is part of the
Renaissance range
I love the release that's cleansing gel
I talk about all the time and this is a
day moisturizer I'm pretty sure today
maybe it's not as well I think it's more
day it's anti ageing so it targets signs
of aging that you may be concerned about
like fine lines dehydration elasticity
in the skin it's just a really nice
moisturizer I love that they are
transitioning that with their products
into this kind of packaging I still wish
they'd have like the clear bar down the
side like Sarah Chapman has so you know
when you're running out but it's so much
better than that old packaging really
compact and good to travel with and this
is just a lovely hydrating day
moisturizer that I've been using
everyday this month and that's
sixty-five pounds by the way I recently
run out of my favourite concealer which
is the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
and it made me realize that I don't
really talk about this enough it's just
but something becomes part of my daily
routine I kind of forget that it's a
favorite but this really is I can't live
without this concealer and I'm
distraught because I've run out and it's
sold out everywhere they've got like a
worldwide shortage I hate shopping for
beauty online unless it's like something
from that cult beauty that I'm
repurchasing so I've been going into all
the urban decay shops and they are just
sold out of my shade which is like
neutral it's so frustrating because last
time this happened when I was using the
NARS concealer they had like again a
worldwide shortage which made me move to
this one and it's just so annoying when
that happens but I really do love it I
love that it's got like a really big
applicator cuz I just swipe it under my
eyes and like one swipe can do my whole
face this concealer has made me use less
foundation because I feel like I can use
more of this and it just looks more
natural on the skin I use my Real
Techniques sponge and I use it damp and
I just Pat it in and it's such beautiful
coverage so just wanted to remind you
guys that I love this when the hmm
Beauty range launched I went wild I
haven't been back recently I really want
to see what's new but this product is a
real standout for me it's their blusher
in cameo pink and it's so so pretty it's
just a really kind of natural flush it's
slightly Brown II slightly pinky I feel
like sometimes on a blush is too pink it
just doesn't look natural but this one
looks really natural on the cheeks I've
just noticed that there's no mirror in
here but that's okay it's really nice
packaging it's like hexagon shape gold
and black this blusher is $6.99 which is
so crazy affordable
I really am impressed with H&amp;amp;M bTW range
okay finally to mascara and they are
both very very different and they're
both new this one is from Estee Lauder
and it's the sumptuous knockout mascara
I love the packaging of this it's really
like weighted and it just feels and
looks beautiful this mascara I use more
when I want like a natural long lash
it's got one of those plastic he brushes
it really gives me a lot of length and
lift and just perfect for a daytime lash
when you don't want anything too heavy
you want something very defined this
mascara is 24 pounds and the other
mascara I've also been loving is a new
one from Marc Jacobs this is the Velvet
Anwar foundation I don't love the
packaging as much it's very kind of
baked for no reason and the brush is
like a big fluffy brush it's not like
one of those plasticky ones it's a fiber
brush I think they're called and this
one gives very big full thick lashes
this is more like a nighttime look
mascara and I also really like it
really clumpy but I kind of like that
sometimes I couldn't find out how much
this was in pounds I know that Mark
Jacobs has just come to the UK they are
now sold in Harrods but I couldn't find
it online so in dollars this is $26 I'm
not sure if it's the same and pounds or
a bit cheaper or a bit more expensive
but this is a really nice kind of heavy
mascara I hope you guys have been
enjoying all my videos throughout

making them and what I've done is I've
actually linked every video from
