talking through my februari favorites
and stay tuned until the end because I
have something quite special to tell you
about and it's really / fighting now
this one's always a struggle because I
really struggle to say the word februari
februari februari it's like jewelry
pairing I say that weirdly as well this
is just going to be this month's
favorites as i'm going to call it and i
have quite a nice little box of goodies
heads talk through i think a lot of them
are going to be quite repetitive
especially if you read my blog because i
was on these chat live talk quite a lot
of the month so i was using kind of the
same products all the time the ones i
really trust and i know they're going to
do a good job but i do have some new
favorites as well so i think i'll start
with skincare and i probably start with
the most interesting thing from the
month and that's from DHC which is an
asian brand i'm not sure exactly where
it's from but i got this from the beauty
workshop in Selfridges they're the silky
cotton pads this may sound really weird
I know you can just get normal cotton
pads but I find because the eye area is
so delicate some cotton pads are really
rough I hate blondes for superdrug they
actually hurt my eyes so I thought I'd
just give these ago you get 80 pads in a
box and what I found is you can actually
use both sides so let me show you what
it's basically a box full like this and
one of them looks like this and they're
double sided but they're really thick
it's really hard to explain as like
space in between it like puffs up so
when you use one side the other side is
completely dry and clean even if you've
soaked that side and eye makeup remover
so you can use one for both eyes which
means that you do can I get your money's
worth and i really like these they're so
soft and gentle around your eyes and
I've really been enjoying using it and
i've been using them with my new eye
makeup remover this is from charlotte
tilbury and it's take it all off genius
I makeup remover now I bought this after
Caroline hirens raved about it on her
Instagram she said she'd put like loads
of eye makeup on her hand and then one
sweep of this court of everything and
then I didn't understand what the hype
was all about so i was using this and it
literally wasn't taking anything off it
was so rubbish i didn't understand the
hyper to I thought I'll what waste of
money and that went on for about two
weeks or that I'm going to keep trying
I'm going to finish it because it was
expensive and then I realized that it
says on the back shake pump soaked and
swipe and I hadn't been shaking it's one
of those kind of covered with a core duo
phase or something like that so
there's like an oil at the top you have
to shake up to get it curr to activate
so once I did that oh my god is amazing
I probably right wasted this product for
like two weeks but when you do shake it
it is such a good waterproof eye makeup
remover just kind of one swipe I like to
hold over a few seconds and then swipe
it gets rid of oil makeup and it comes
with a really handy pump something to
bear in mind though I do find it a
little bit messy when you kind of pump
the product onto the cotton wool it can
square out other side so be a little bit
careful because it is a blue liquid but
it's very handy and I think I prefer
this to the Clarins waterproof eye
makeup remover I would repurchase it I
really really like it so I've been using
that on my eyes and for evenings where I
can't really bother to cleanse properly
maybe also for mornings that's when I
use this I've using the lush pose a
micellar solution I think that's how you
say it which is just kind of their
version of bioderma I run out by dermo
and it's still quite hard to find so I
kind of didn't bother repurchasing it
and I had one of these lying around and
I really really like it i think i
actually prefer it to buy a derma it
works just as well it has like a
slightly sweet smell to it that's nice
it feels very gentle on the skin
especially if you use it with the silky
cotton pads from DHC I really like it
I've used quite a lot and it squirts out
like really fast oh my god I'm saying so
many innuendos in this video I'm really
sorry but I like the packaging and yeah
this has been really nice to use just on
my skin I have a couple of new basis
that I've been enjoying I wouldn't say
they are kind of firm favourites but I
feel like towards the end for the month
they are becoming favorites and I
thought I just give them a little
mention first one is from bare minerals
and it's their complexion rescue this is
new it says it's a tinted hydrating gel
cream I really really like this I had
the wrong shade but now I've got vanilla
which is 0-2 in its perfect shade for me
it's just a really nice reminds me of
the laura mercier oil free tinted
moisturizer it's slightly thicker than
one like a BB cream but you can blend
out with your fingers or with a brush
and it's very natural and gives you
glowy skin and i really like packaging
i'm just enjoying using this at the
moment and i'm also enjoying using the
l'oreal visible lift serum foundation
that i bought in america i still haven't
checked it this is available here
someone said it is and it's been out for
ages I don't think it's anything unix
I team but i just thought it looked good
it says it's got pro retinol a in
vitamin C in it it's got an SPF it's
like a serum so it is quite nourishing
it's good if you have mature skin types
and it's not a tool cakey it just looks
very fresh on the skin so I've been
enjoying using this one as well thank
you all so much for your lovely comment
on my burberry video i was reading them
all a little bit excited they're really
really nice comments so thank you and
since that video i've been loving the
blush that I used it's called earthly
blush and I used it in that video so you
haven't seen our link it below it was
like a little tutorial thing it's a very
very pale blush but when you use it
actually really nice for contouring i
think i'm going to do a blog post on
like the best blushes for pale skin and
this will definitely be in there it's
just amazing like it really doesn't look
as good as it is I've kind of blown away
by this blusher I've been using it every
day since that video as I mentioned in a
previous video it took quite a few
trusty lip products are waved me on the
beach at live tour and one of them was
the kat von d ever lasting lipstick the
first one I bought was Bachelorette back
in the day and then recently I bought
this one as well which is outlaw which
is like a dog bred these are so so good
there can be a little bit drawing
compared to the Sephora lip cream but
they are very very long lasting they're
definitely not strong as the hourglass
ones I think they did really well with
these lip products and they definitely
want to get another color next time I'm
near a sephora if you do live somewhere
where you have sephora definitely
recommend checking out the kat von d
everlasting liquid lipsticks they are
fab Oh back to skincare slightly I did
mention this in my monthly makeup
routine I think it was I've been using
Charlotte always magic cream again I
have this little kind of sample pot so
it's not the full size product i think i
got this when the brand originally
launched i hope it hasn't like gone off
but i got a couple of these little
sample pots and I've just had it makes
do my makeup and I've been using it
every morning and I find that I wake up
and I do my skincare routine and then I
have breakfast and then just before I do
my makeup I just need that in quick kind
of boost hydration that makes my
foundation sits better it gives me kind
of glowy skin and I feel that this is a
really good quick fix for those with dry
skin i think if you have oily skin or
combination skin you won't like this but
if you do have kind of dull dehydrated
dry skin like I do it's a really nice
hydration booster this little pot is
particularly annoying if you have to
kind of scoop your finger in and then it
goes
your nails I like to use a little cotton
bud and I think the full size is quite a
large kind of tub would be good though
if it came in a pump would be much
easier to use originally i hated this so
I don't know what's change my wine but I
think it is a little bit of magic for
hair I have been loving my obey dry
texturizing spray and I think I pretty
much told everyone who I was chatting to
at the beach at live tour and I did a
blog post about how the bigger one is so
much better I used to always buy the
small one because it's much more
affordable and it's really handy handbag
size but recently I decides to invest in
the large one and oh my god it's like a
different product I don't notice because
i'm using more or because of the way the
product is put into the cans because i
know that that can differ sometimes with
a large can and a small one but it's
just like an amazing amazing product i
like the small one but i love love the
big one it just adds texture and
movement and oomph and volume into your
hair so if you feel like your hair is a
bit flat in life lesson isn't really
doing anything spray a bit of this I
like to spread quite into the roots I
know that analytes to kind of just
missed over the top they're quite a few
different ways you can use it but it's a
really really good product and this
large ones been lasting me a long time I
can feel it's still really heavy and
I've had it for quite a while okay
finally the start of the show I think
the by Terry Umbra Black Stars now first
one I bought with brown perfection ages
ago I told you guys about it I
absolutely love it a really nice brown
creamy eye shadow since then I've bought
for more so I have five now I know it
seems crazy and they're so expensive but
I don't like to waste my money so I
promised I wouldn't have invested if I
didn't think they were absolutely
incredible I have velvet orchid which is
a really nice kind of quite matte purple
I bronze moon which I'm wearing today
which is a really nice shimmery bronze
I've misty rock which I've worn a
million times before it's like a pale
purpley pink with silver pigment in it I
have midnight forests which is quite a
matte green and is really really pretty
especially on brown eyes and then brown
perfection was quite a matte brown
they're all so different they have the
most incredible formula that when you
apply it you have quite a bit of
blending time but then it sets and
doesn't budge at all and love the
packaging it's so handy to just pop in
your makeup bag or even just store in
like muji drawers if you have those just
a little bit addicted to these I think
I've now got all the shades that I like
probably but all the shades they do but
they're so so good i would highly
recommend them but if you do what
something what
portable and more kind of budgets I
really like these which are from
bourgeois and then units their color
boost eyeliner and eyeshadow I wouldn't
use it as an eyeliner but for eyeshadows
they're really nice the shade 05 is very
similar to misty rock is that kind of
purply taupe with a silver shimmer in it
these are much more shimmery than the by
terry ones and they're not as good like
they're not but they are really really
good and definitely good for the
drugstore price as well so those are all
my favorites for this month and as
mentioned i do have a bit of a special
announcement you may have noticed that
