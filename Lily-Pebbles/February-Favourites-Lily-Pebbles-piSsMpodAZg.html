today I'm going to be doing my februari
favorites and as usual I thought I
didn't have many but then when it came
down to I've actually got loads so I'm
going to get started and Wiz my way
through them so first up is something a
little bit different and it's a hair
perfume from the brandy unites which
I've spoken about before I absolutely
love their seven seconds detangler it's
works amazingly but it also smells
really good so I knew this would be nice
and I think there are just two cents and
the one I prefer is Elana and basically
her perfume obviously you can spray your
normal perfume on your hair but it
actually really dries out the hair and
the idea of this is a scented spray that
you can spray into your hair and it
won't only not damage your hair but it
helps your hair as well its got like UV
defense stuff in it and it protects your
hair makes it kind of nourished and it
smells really good too i'm just going to
spray bit in smells so for this one
smells really fresh it's like fresh bed
sheets and and it's not too overpowering
that you can't wear perfume at the same
time like a difference then it's more
like if you brush past someone they'll
be low your hair smells nice so I really
really like this and it's a nice cute
little size to fit into your handbag
next up or some makeup brushes and I've
spoken about the brand zoeva before I'm
not sure if I have on YouTube but I
definitely having my blog they are a
really good affordable makeup brand they
do really good makeup as well I like
their blushes and but their brushes in
particular so good because they are just
like mac but so so much cheaper they're
really affordable and they've recently
bought out this rose gold collection so
it's black with rose gold detail and I
absolutely love it I think they're so
nice there's some really good brushes in
there this kind of angled cheek one is
so nice the huge powder one is really
good for my hourglass ambient lighting
powder there's kind of a buffing brush
equivalent and the blending brush is
exactly at mac 217 so if you are after
some makeup brushes and you don't want
to splash out on Mac prices whoops then
I really really would recommend these I
think there's such good quality of how
much they are and I love the rose gold
collection my next favorite some lip
glosses and probably the most talks
about lip glosses this year so far they
are the tanya burr I
Andy lip gloss and I really like these
I've been getting more and more into lip
gloss this year especially since I've
had really sore lips because lipsticks a
little bit too heavy for me when I have
chapped lips so like today I can just
put on a little bit of lip gloss and it
doesn't hurt my lips and it looks really
pretty so these are the three shades I
have I have afternoon tea picnic in the
pot and sheep picnic in the park there's
a little bit too pink for me and but
chic and afternoon tea a perfect pinky
nudes and I really like them I really
like the applicator it applies really
smoothly and nicely on the lips and
they're slightly creamier than your
average lip gloss and really pigmented
like you can really see the color you
know in some lip glosses are just they
look just a little bit glossy not much
color this is like proper pigmented lip
gloss and they're really afford were
there like 699 really like the packaging
just really impressed with these so and
I'm really happy for Tanya as well I
think these are doing really well you
get them on feel unique or superdrug for
nails this month I've been loving my
orly bonder base coat and I've done a
blog post on this i was having real
problems with the yellow nails and
because i paint my nails all the time
and I lose dark colors a lot that I
found that when I was taking my nail
polish off my nails were a bit yellow
stained and so I couldn't really like
give them a break because I didn't want
the yellowness to be seen so I asked
Twitter and you guys gave me loads of
recommendations and one that came up
loads was this as a new base coat to try
I just didn't I thought my biscuit was a
right i think i was using the author
london one which is actually quite
pricey so anyway this is a rubberized
base coat so it's kind of worked a
little bit differently and since using
this I've had no problems of the other
nails it's made my nail polish last so
much longer because it's rubberized the
nail polish color they adheres to it
better and last longer I just think this
is the best both codes that i will keep
repurchasing this forever i'm so happy
with it an old favourite that's crept
back into my life is Mac strobe cream
and I haven't bought this for ages but I
was in Mac with Anna recently and they
have little minis by the Kansas Earth oh
I'm going to give it another go because
my skin's been looking a little bit dull
recently and it's basically like an
illuminating cream that you can kind of
use as a primer and it really is quite
illuminating and I'm wearing
today and I find that the days i do
where at my skin looks much kind of
glowing and radiant and although the
smell is a bit kind of mac i don't
really like the smell but i think this
is really good and an easy one to
everyone to pick up so if you find some
of the other kind of highlighting
products harder to find this is a good
one that I just think works really well
I have to skin care products one very
high end and one Logan so the high end
one is from dipped eeks new skincare
range they brought a whole new range of
skincare products to add to their
candles and body care staff and this is
the infused facial water for the face
and it's basically just a infused water
so I've been using this on cotton wool
as a sort of toner I use it in the
morning and when I wake up and I use it
after i cleanse before moisturize in the
evenings and I really like this this
smells kind of funny like it's not the
nicest smell ever but it kind of smells
a little bit rose like a little bit like
grape water and it's just been working
really well I am going through it quite
quickly so it's probably not worth it
for the price but I've really enjoyed
using this and my skin seems to really
like it on the lower end of things I
finally found an affordable cleansing
balm I'm so happy about this it's the
mero maya melting cleansing balm and
I've seen Caroline heroines talked about
this before so I knew it was going to be
good but for 14 pounds I didn't really
know what to expect and its really
really nice it's a cleansing balm that
comes in a tube which is already points
for me because I hate scooping things
out of a tub and so it comes in a tube
and it's a little bit more kind of oily
than the Emma hardy cleansing balm and
sarah chapman one you start wobbling
into your face and crash spreads around
really easily and then if you mix it
with water it emulsifies and turns into
a bit of a milk so it's slightly
different than the higher-end flensing
bulbs but it works just as well it makes
my skin feel really clean gets rid of
all my makeup because of the oil its
kind of breaks it down and when I wash
it off my skin feels nice and
moisturized so I definitely recommend
getting this you get from john lewis i
think and Debenhams i will link them
down below um but yeah a cleansing balm
for 14 pounds finally there's been one
eye shadow that I've been reaching for
pretty much every day this month and
it's an old favorite I've had for a long
time and this is my
palette and here it is inside it's this
one right bang in the middle and its
patina and i bought patina I'd say about
three years three or four years ago when
I was watching a Pixiwoo wedding
inspired makeup tutorial really remember
this because it's like a really nice
light gold and when Nick it was
definitely Nick for pixie when she
applied it I just thought that is
perfect everyday gold eyeshadow so I
would angle it I've loved it ever since
it's so easy to just put all over the
lid it gives it gorgeous wash of this
kind of light cool tone gold and it's
just really really lovely it's quite
hard to explain but it's definitely one
of my favorite and mac eyeshadows and
I've been getting a lot of use out of it
this month my last makeup favorites is
from hourglass and they've recently
released their ambient lighting blush of
course you know i love the ambient
lighting pounders i have dimmed light
and diffused light and everyone talks
about them they are great powders so I
was really excited to hear that they
were doing blush versions and packaging
slightly smaller than the powders but
inside they look beautiful they all have
this different colored like swishy
swishy print and this one is mood
exposure which is the one that I have
and in the pan it kind of looks like a
muddy brownie not really sure what this
is gonna like on my face kind of shade
but when I applied it it's so beautiful
it's like a plum color so it's really
nice you can kind of even contour with
it a little bit but it's just a really
pretty blush and it's kind of a nice
change from the peachy pinky blushes
that I have so many of and so I've been
using this every day and it's so soft
and easy to apply and blend and I'm
really really impressed with these I
definitely another shade but I just
can't decide which one I'm going to have
to go and swatch them when they're in
store and pick my favorites if a final
favorite this month is a random one and
it's from T pigs which the tea company
and it's the licorice and peppermint tea
and I wanted to include this because I'm
a sort of person who would say licorice
and peppermint tea absolutely no way
that sounds hideous I hate licorice
black licorice is one of my most hated
things in the world but this doesn't hit
a licorice at all it tastes like a sweet
peppermint tea because you get the taste
of
peppermint and then the licorice which
is like the sweet part you can kind of
just feel it on the side of your tongue
where you're like sweet taste buds are
and it's just a really nice like
sensation and its taste delicious and
one tea bag is really strong you can use
it for like two or three cups I'd say I
just I really love th the quality of the
tea is really nice they come in this
nice little like silk tea bag I one of
those starter sets to try all the
different teas and this is the one that
I was really impressed with so I bought
a bigger pack and I've been going
through it quite quickly having them in
the evenings they're just so relaxing
and soothing and sweet but not too sweet
perfect after-dinner when you're full
and i absolutely love this so that's
been my fav very favorites I hope you've
enjoyed seeing all the products I've
loved this month comment down below and
