relaxed and chill that I'm in my comfies
I was going to do a blog post on YouTube
questions filming editing tips etc and
you guys send so many good questions in
via Twitter that I thought I better just
make a video instead because alloys it
will be a really long and rambly
blogpost so I'm just gonna answer some
of your questions and a lot of them are
quite similar so it's quite easy to
cover a few at the same time a lot of
you asked about lighting so I'll tell
you what lighting I have I have a ring
light over there and a softbox light
over there it's not great you probably
should have like two soft boxes or one
ring light in the middle but because of
my setup there's a bed right there I
haven't got much space that's just how I
make it work for me I like to have two
lights coming from me from either side
but I also have huge windows behind me
so that's what makes this whole area
look quite light and soft I find that if
you film just against a kind of flat
wall everything can look a little bit
flat I like to have some space behind me
so it's nice and blurry but if you do
want that kind of bright white wall
behind you then I'd recommend having
some lights on you and some lights
separate on the wall as well if you're
just starting out and you want
affordable lighting and that was a
question that a lot of you asked as well
I would recommend use natural daylight
so to do that you'd want to face the
window and have the camera so you have
window camera and then you'd sit facing
it so the lights on you it might go kind
of in and out and it might wash you out
if you play around with the settings of
your camera you can make that work but
also what I did at the beginning was I
shared a softbox like with Anna so you
get like a set of two on Amazon and we
split the price so it was cheaper and
that's something you can do if you know
anyone else the phils videos or takes
photos that's a kind of good cheaper
alternative Kate asked what camera do
you use and microphone so I use a canon
600d for filming these sort of videos
and I think the lens is a 13 millimeter
F one point-four but I write it all down
below in the description box I really
like this camera because the screen
flips around so I can see myself I use a
remote like this so I can focus myself
without needing help from someone else
and it doesn't have any sub autofocus so
it won't keep going in and out if I need
to refocus on a product like this I
would just have to do it manually which
I'm fine with
I use this lens for filming myself
sitting but if I'm doing close-ups
probably use my kit lens and when I'm
taking portraits of people I use my
Canon 50 millimeter I think when I
started I did have this camera because I
was already blogging so I already had
this camera for blogging so it was easy
for me to use this just for videos as
well but there are loads of other
cameras that aren't kind of huge SLR
cameras that are good for filming as
well I'd say look around go somewhere
like Curry's or PC world have a chat
with them there tell them what you want
I definitely recommend filming in HD I
think it's really important now and
having the flip screen is really helpful
see you can see what you're doing but
it's not essential
Clodagh asked if i was to film youtube
videos on my iphone how would I edit
them so I've never filmed my iPhone
because I don't really like the quality
I'm quite picky about kind of HD quality
and I just think it always looks a bit
kind of pixelated on the phone but if
you are going to film in their phone
which a lot of people do do for vlogs I
would just recommend keeping your phone
that way rather than that way because
I'll always it will have space either
side of it so keep your phone landscape
when you're filming and you can edit the
same as you would with any other video
footage you just import it into whatever
software you're using and it will work
just the same lara asked how do you stop
yourself worrying about how other people
perceive you on the internet it's
difficult it's quite hard to put
yourself out there and you're basically
asking people to comment with their
opinion but I am quite like a strong
person inside I have a lot of support
for my family and friends so I don't
really let negative comments get to me
but it is hard sometimes you just have
to remember that youtubers has such a
huge audience your reach reach is such a
huge range of people when you're on
there it's not just people who like
beauty or who like you people can just
stumble across your videos at any point
even if they have no idea who you are
and they've never watched your videos
before so you can't expect people to
instantly love you and like everything
you do there's always going to be
opinions there's always going to be
people your comment you don't agree with
their opinion and you think oh my god I
would never write down someone else's
video but you're not gonna love everyone
in the world are you you're not going to
get on with everyone so take it all with
a pinch of salt and don't let it be a
reflection of you let it be a reflection
of them Celina asked I'd really love to
know the best way to grow an audience
I've been youtubing and blogging for a
while and it's been a struggle it is
really hard it's important to remember
that most of the youtubers that you
watch have been doing it for three or
four years I was quite lucky because I
had my blog for a couple of years first
so when I started my youtube channel I
already had an audience on my blog and I
think I reached 10,000 subscribers
relatively quickly for a new youtuber so
I don't really know how it feels to
start from I mean I did start from zero
but I had an audience elsewhere that I
could kind of tell them look I do these
videos but even then it's really hard to
get from there to where I am now and
there's no magic formula I think it's
just about being patient and being
consistent giving your audience you
don't have to have
schedule but give them some consistency
don't go quiet for three months because
they they're less likely to come back to
watch your videos just keep at it keep
positive keep your videos as good as you
want them to be eventually your audience
should grow but there really isn't a
magic formula I wish I could if I knew
one I would share it with you
marina asked how complicated is it to
learn how to edit videos did you learn
yourself or did somebody teach you I
have never been taught how to edit I
think most youtubers all self-taught
really I remember I used to edit a few
random videos here in there from
holidays on iMovie when I was younger
but I have zero experience in editing so
I'm all self-taught I started with
iMovie which is the one that comes on a
Mac and I've recently within the last
kind of six months updated to Final Cut
Pro X you definitely don't need to Final
Cut Pro iMovie is great
I've never used anything else another
one of the questions is about editing on
a Windows and I'm really sorry but I
can't help there because I've always had
Macs and I think they're great
I'm sure Windows do a program as well
similar but you'll have to look into
that cuz I'm not sure so yeah I've
always been self-taught editing it's
really important to me to improve my
editing and I just spend a lot of time
practicing and sometimes I will practice
editing a video before I filmed it if
you know what I mean things like look
books that are harder to edit I'm just
always trying to find ways to improve my
editing I'm always googling or searching
on YouTube for tips and tricks and I
think editing your videos is part of
being a youtuber and I'm always proud if
I've worked hard on a video and you guys
say all your editing is so good that
just makes me so happy and I'm always
very proud of myself
Nisha asked how do you stay motivated
with your channel if you're having a
blog it is quite hard to stay motivated
especially if you do videos like Beauty
because I mean there's a lot of products
out there but there's only so many times
you could do a roundup of red lipsticks
or you talk about your brows I mean I've
definitely repeated myself over the
years but I always try to if I feel like
I'm having a real block and I normally
phone ana or that point in freaking out
like I have nothing to write about what
a film about I like to just relax
haven't pamper evening take a bath
definitely don't sit there with your
notepad open trying to think of ideas
just kind of take yourself out of your
normal environment
and normally my friend will say
something like oh why does my lipstick
Smurl of my face and it'll be that
moment where I think oh that's a good
idea for a video that's the phone so
just don't stress too much about it let
the ideas come naturally and if you want
kind of plan a little bit in advance so
that if you do get that block you've
still got some content to go up while
you're thinking of new stuff Bronte asks
how did you get so epic on Final Cut Pro
I'm definitely not epic Final Cut Pro is
really good it was definitely a good
investment for me to get there are a few
different things you can do the Yukon on
iMovie one that someone else asked me
how I get that mirrored effect there's
lots of kind of effects like that on
Final Cut that you can easily implement
it's just spending time learning how to
use the software it took a long time for
me and I'm still learning there's so
many things I don't know how to do it's
just practice practice practice the
teacher asked what do you use to make
stills or thumbnails so for this I'm
sure I don't do it the right way but
it's just the way that works for me I
use a program called pages which is kind
of like word for apples and I put my
photo on pages I cut and do whatever I
want to it first maybe on iPhoto I put
on pages and then I just put text over
it and then I take a screenshot of that
and use that as my thumbnail thumbnails
it's kind of a funny side they're not
square they're not photo shaped they're
slightly longer more landscape but you
kind of just play around and you get the
get used to it sometimes minor cut off
at the top or bottom and I'll just do it
a bit again and upload it I think when
you first start YouTube channel you
can't upload your own thumbnails but
after a while you can that might have
changed now I definitely say keep your
thumbnails quite similar so that when
your videos come up in people's
subscription boxes they can recognize
like oh that's a lily pebbles video or
that's an SE button videos are always
really good and recognizable poppy tales
and trials said would love to understand
the process from start to finish on
editing and how long it takes
so my filming process let's try go
through this really quickly I will do my
research on a video I will decide days
in advance what products I'm using and
plan the video out in my little notepad
like this then I will on the day get
ready to film I will set up my lights
I'll set up my camera I'll get all the
products I'll put them in front of me
I'll sit in the film a video I'll take a
thumbnail photo if I need to and I'll
take close-ups of products if I need to
and then I will take my memory
out of my camera I'll plug my memory
card straight into the back of my
computer I'll put those files there's
video files onto an external hard drive
I do that because I think it's safer and
I like to keep my files are then
importing them from that external hard
drive into Final Cut Pro and from there
I will spend my time editing it could
take I mean I'm not one of the other
questions as how long does a to edit a
simple video where I'm just sitting like
this could take a couple of hours so
maybe less a vlog is quite quick because
I've only filmed the clips that I need
but something like a lookbook or one of
my packing videos I did with there's a
lot of different cutaways that could
take longer
sometimes videos have taken days dead it
also depends on my schedule and how I
can fit it in so I'll edit my video I
will make my thumbnail on pages while my
video is exporting so I'll exported it
onto my external hard drive I'll upload
it onto YouTube I'll upload my thumbnail
I'll fill in my description box our set
is unlisted to get the embed code to put
it in my blog post and then I will
schedule the video that's the process
and it's pretty long have I even missed
anything out I don't know I've never run
through it like that before so I hope
you haven't missed anything out okay so
hopefully that was helpful and I covered
a few other topics there's always so
much to talk about with YouTube try to
think of there's anything else that I
haven't covered I think that's it
hopefully this is helpful to you or just
interesting if you are thinking about
starting making videos just remember it
doesn't have to be perfect at first and
you might not even perfect now and I've
been making them for years just give it
a go if you want to or just enjoy
watching videos and it's a very fun
happy thing it's entertainment so take
it with a pinch of salt and good luck if
you are starting out thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
