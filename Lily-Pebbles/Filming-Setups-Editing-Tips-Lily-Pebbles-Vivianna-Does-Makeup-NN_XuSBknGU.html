Anna and this is our second installment
for little guide to blogging and
blogging series so the video has gone up
with Anna's channels today I will link
to that on her pretty face here and if
you missed off it first videos for
Thursday are linked and below with a
playlist for all these videos that we're
doing as well so this one is going to be
our filming setups and kind of vlogging
editing tips there is a lot of ground to
cover here there is so we should gonna
link all of our equipment everything you
mentioned below in the description box
so if it sounds a bit confusing just
check down there for all the details so
the first thing I think which is really
important when you are making videos for
YouTube is to invest in a good memory
card we both use these which are the
SanDisk Extreme and there are HD
formatted so they worked really well for
HD videos and we both have the 32 gig I
started like the 6 exactly 20 but
seriously these just make life less
stressful because you don't have to keep
importing the files until computer and
you can store so much the amount of time
go get to the end of a video and a good
card fall so annoying very annoying oh
there's some Amazon they're quite
affordable they're a lot cheaper to buy
on I don't buy them in store another
thing to grab with the remote these are
really cheap to pick up a thing like a
tenner
we've both got the Canon rc6 as I think
and they come in so handy because from
here we can focus and make sure that our
faces are in focus and also you can
start and stop filming they come in it's
so high because without them there's
kind of no real way it's such a way your
self unless you've got something around
they can help you so a very good
investment also obviously a tripod we
mentioned even Anna's video I have a
valve on one yours in Manfrotto
any kind of try avoiding it from Amazon
will do just something for your pool or
carrots it doesn't no no no also my tip
for kind of framing your videos would be
just to try and like spend a little time
before you start filming setting that
I've been thinking about the framing
don't kind of cut your head off here
think about what's behind you you don't
get dirty washing I mean you might but
you should see the amount of things we
like to keep out here you know
just think about the kind of framing to
make sure you're in focus and you like
it before you start filming
I always actually like sit in my pajamas
before I'm actually properly ready to
film and have a quick little set I
always press record and I go my pretend
care talk and then I go watch it because
there's nothing wisemen for me in a 10
minute video and then it not coming out
how you want it to for videos it is best
to use natural light so that means in
the UK we now currently have about four
hours of the day where you can actually
film which is just a bit crazy so if
that's a bit of a problem for you then
softbox lighting is awesome it's a bit
pricey but as I mentioned in my video
me and Lily bought a set of two lights
and actually she took one and I took one
which made the whole thing much more
affordable it's all different lighting
you can get now you get once it was keep
on your camera if you haven't got much
space for kind of stand-alone like yes
but you can also use a lamp or anything
you have as well I also think it's quite
nice to light from behind you it just
adds a bit of warmth to your videos if
you have a nice lamp or lights or a
candle that's why you always see candles
in the back of beauty videos nice warmth
behind tip that I actually get is that
you should always like videos from like
in front of you above and behind I have
not got enough space in my flat to kind
of keep lights for all of that belies
the dream one day and play around with
the settings in your camera as well I
know you like to use daylight adds a
little bit of readiness so there's a few
kind of ways you can play around my luck
when it comes to cutaways which are
usually like the little close-ups that
people edit into videos make sure that
they have beneficial for the view
because the amount of times I put in
cuts ways and then I'm like you can see
you don't need to see it closer up so
kids doing a swatch or a cutaway of you
actually applying the product in if
you're into making Beauty videos and
they're quite handy to do definitely
with depth of field as well if you don't
want depth of field is it's kind of hot
just got myself in a little ditch it's
like this space behind
I used to film in front of a wall
I wasn't liking my videos as much
because it was just a little bit flat
whereas you see all this nice like
blurriness behind us it's because we
kind of have more space we have a table
and a sofa and play around with that I
think that's the moment that is also to
do with your lens and we're going to
quickly talk about them they both use to
film our videos and the reason that
there's good depth of field might able
to get like a bit of blurriness I mean
we know really nothing much about
cameras I'm sure there's a lot more
technical information about this than
what we're telling you but something
with a smaller F number creates that
look better we both use this and it's
the Sigma thing is the f1 point for 30
millimeter f1 point 4 yes so it's a
little bit heavy so it's not one to take
around with you but we both always use
this for filming it's always the only
one now what's what on any of my recent
videos to film with and yours as well
so as I was saying if you want to know
the techie stuff there's so many good
videos on YouTube I always look at
reviews before buying techie stuff a
cheaper version of that would be the
canon f 1.8 50 mil which i think is
around 8 pounds which is significantly
cheaper than the m sigma but we both or
we both use these in the mean yeah you
just have to have your camera quite far
away from you but it's really good so
once you've filmed your video is time to
import it and edit which is I actually
love that bit but something we'll find
at the border but I like editing so
something that a little tip that you
might not know because I remember when I
think was you or Amelia didn't know
about they're not native a lot of Mac
computers have slots in the side Peter
insert your memory cards straight in so
you don't need to use the cord or
anything so just put it straight in and
import it into iMovie create or whatever
you're using we use iMovie
create a new event and I like to label
everything so I don't lose any files but
you're just so down below
something that I really picked up and
this is honestly one of the best things
I've ever purchased is an external hard
drive yeah they are so good because
video files take up so much space and my
old laptop was like churning away with
all of these videos on it so these are a
really good purchase this is a G Drive
one terabyte one Cyrus huge but I wanted
all our videos we film
I lose them so I put them all on here
yes so this is kind of has like all of
my life on it
yeah they come in very handy and that
way it won't slow your computer down and
take on memory on your computer ok so a
few editing tips as I said we both use
iMovie and I think it's quite easy to
use so it's quite user friendly if I can
use it anyone come in yet and like we
said in our first video if you are a bit
stuck YouTube it google it that answer
will be out there somewhere
you I have to say YouTube is incredible
for iMovie tutorials I actually recently
got a new was it called MacBook Pro yeah
and it has this new version of iMovie oh
and I think it's called iMovie 10 and I
was like oh my god what is this
it's so confusing different to the other
one when like onto YouTube and some but
lovely guy in America had made a whole
sheet or how to use it and it's so
Handy's that onto the YouTube tutorials
that iMovie are just wet also a bit like
blogging photos you will come up with
your own style of video editing
naturally you can put transitions in
which kind of in between each clip that
makes give fuzzy and stuff but my one
tip would be to when you do cut your
Clips don't do it too close to the
beginning or end of your senses because
you'll find you're cutting yourself off
it's all a bit kind of jump it's a
little bit space honestly this is like
least maybe if you I always love in your
videos like today going to do a November
favorite I know you have like some music
to offer as well as some like writing
but just don't get over the top I don't
think it needs anything if you create
good content your videos don't need a
fast quick side note I actually never
used to edit my videos at all on my
first videos I uploaded on YouTube or
just completely one take thing so if you
messed up you just stuff again or use
left of if I messed up I said a really
big sweater box it again oh my gosh you
know how I did that bit can be done you
can just do like one take you don't even
have to end it yeah
also I think I see you guys will
probably know because you obviously
watching YouTube videos and
my personal opinion when you watch the
video I think the first five kind of
seconds ten seconds is really important
and people have judge a video by the
other thing am I going to keep watching
so I don't think the long kind of fancy
intro is that necessary I think get
straight to it
so once you go under how long our intro
for this videos nobody have an intro
inch I mean like her today is and
everything is looking like we look like
my maid in choice
oh we should have every video I know I'm
actually really won't want to take I
want to make one I'm going to literally
get up and show you our filming set up
right now now where your Anna's so it's
not always like this but today this is
what it looks like so I'm gonna get my
camera out this should like you team in
section right now let's do this alright
okay Nazis attract sequester you see
that we are both wearing tracksuit
bottoms
okay so H&amp;amp;M one room so we decide sit on
the floor today we did this is ever
sitting with the table behind us and a
safer and this is how we have our camera
set up so sorry it's a bit bright there
but we've got Anna's ring light and then
the camera just like this and the Sigma
lens is on that and then we've just been
focusing it with our little remote and
then the tripod and that's it and we
both just sitting here in our I hope you
