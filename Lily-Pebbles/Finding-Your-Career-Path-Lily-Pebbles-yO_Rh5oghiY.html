as some kind of smart schoolgirl but I
guess it's kind of appropriate for
today's video it's gonna be another
sit-down a chatty one not sure why I'm
making so many videos like this at the
moment but I'm just making videos that I
want to film and they happen to be this
kind of style today's video is gonna be
about finding your career path and I
came up with this idea quite a few
months ago but I've just been waiting
for the right time to sit and talk about
it and it's just something I feel really
passionate about I'm not sure why I
guess it's because I really struggled at
school and now I'm really proud of what
I'm doing it just happens to be a
subject I'm really passionate about and
I always find myself talking to friends
about it and we all feel quite
passionate about it actually I feel like
this is a saw video I would have really
enjoyed watching when I was at school or
when I was at uni or when I'd left uni
so I'm hoping that some of you might
enjoy watching this so let's start by
talking about school and I really
struggled at school I've mentioned this
before I was definitely not an A grade
student I actually don't think I got one
single a the whole time I was at school
I just struggled with the authority and
the academic side of school I feel like
when you're at school the teachers tend
to put you in boxes I mean things might
have changed now I haven't been to
school in a very long time but I'm
talking about when I was in school it
tend to look at what subjects you're
good at and therefore what jobs you can
go into with those subjects and I always
felt like there just wasn't a place for
people who weren't good at any subjects
or didn't love any of the subjects you
could be good at a subject and not enjoy
it and I just felt like I never fitted
into any of those boxes and not only did
it make me feel really unconfident the
fact that I wasn't didn't feel like I
was good at anything but it was just a
real struggle between me and my teachers
all the time I think doing well at
school and being an intelligent person
don't always go together I would count
myself as an intelligent person I got
five B's and two CS and my GCSEs and I
got one C and two D's in my a-levels and
one of my AAS levels I actually got a
you we just unclassified that means I
probably got three points right in my
name but I pretty much got nothing else
right that was a psychology AAS level I
mean I go to you I really don't think
I'm a stupid person I would say I'm
quite intelligent and so that's kind of
one of the points I wanted to make I
don't think you should feel like you're
not an intelligent person if you don't
do well at school so let's use me as an
example I'm very aware that
everyone has very different situations
but all I can do is use myself as an
example in my experience I'm away it
won't be the same for everyone let's
forget about my actual job which if you
don't know it's kind of blogging you
tubing everything that comes with that
it's a very new strange kind of job so
forget about the actual job itself but
let's look more at the skills that come
with my jobs so as part of my job I use
writing photography editing presenting
that's kind of what this is like
organization planning and I think it's
really interesting to look at all those
different skills and see kind of how
that was when I was at school writing I
would never miss still to this day I
would never say I'm a writer I'm sure
loads of my grammar is terrible but I
don't think being amazing English Lit
I've got being English Lee I think I
don't think that means you're a great
writer or not I would never have said I
wanted to be a journalist or anything
like that if you'd asked me at school or
even uni are you a good writer I would
have said no but that's just because in
school I wasn't good at it or it wasn't
something I took time to do why I find
quite interesting is I don't think
schools and uni's necessarily take a
look at the things you're good at
outside of school and the hobbies and
passions that you have when you're not
in school and it's only something I've
realised in the past couple of years and
my friends have also realized actually
if you look a bit deeper I was always
into writing and I loved writing I just
didn't realize it these are all my
Diaries I kept a diary from age 10 to 16
this is my first diary which by the way
I read last night and is hilarious maybe
one day I'll read you some of the pages
it's very funny
so I had a diary from this one and then
I went this one which went more teenager
years which is ridiculously embarrassing
and then I had another one and then I've
got two Diaries from when I went
travelling in my gap year my friends
always remember me keeping a diary but
it's not even something I thought about
it's just something I did and I was
quite consistent with it as well so
obviously it did enjoy writing and I
obviously liked telling stories and
writing down my thoughts but it was
never something that my teachers knew
about or encouraged it was just
something I did at home and I think a
diary is pretty much like writing a blog
so I think that's really interesting
that I've actually ended up doing
something very similar to writing a
diary which is something I always
enjoyed doing I also found this in my
old bedroom this is the most hilarious
thing there's loads of them so
apparently I also don't remember doing
this I used to make magazines it was
called at the Fab Four and it was about
me and my best friends as Lily Jenny
Keisha SJ this one's called a fallout
it's all about when we had like an
argument is just the most hilarious
thing this one comes with a free gift a
smarty lid so I obviously had a really
big passion for magazines and writing
and creating things and I think that's
pretty interesting I also loved being in
school plays and acting which I think
comes hand-in-hand with making videos
and presenting and I used to make little
videos when I went on holiday with my
friends I used to kind of film it put
together a little video just to show
each other and I also used to make
little stop-motion videos when I got a
bit older at uni I remember making a
little video with paper clips where
they'd go all around the table and
they'd make a little heart shape and I
never put it anywhere YouTube wasn't
even around but I remember just enjoying
making things and finishing them and
creating a project so all of those
interests and skills and things I use
now and at the time it was never
something I thought could affect my
career or job so I think the point I'm
trying to find the actual points to this
video I think the point of that part is
that maybe you have skills and interests
you don't even realize you have just
because you're not good at maths or
science or art or any of the subjects at
school doesn't mean that you have other
interests just outside of those boxes
actually you'll end up using in your
career as a really extreme example if
your careers teacher were to ask you
what do you enjoy doing and you were to
say something ridiculous like I really
like speaking to my friends every night
on the phone a curious teacher would
probably say great what you're gonna do
with that I hated talking on the phone
so that's not something everyone enjoys
doing and actually one of my best
friends has a job in sales and her job
is to talk on the phone all day and for
that job you have to do enjoy talking on
the phone so I really think there's
actually a job for everything for every
interest even talking on the phone
that's probably a ridiculous example I
think it's really important to have
self-confidence and to be self-aware and
what I mean by that is to know your
prose and to know your Cotton's when it
comes to interviewing so let's say
you've left uni now and you started
interview interview for jobs I think
what will make you stand out from others
is being really self-aware
being sure of yourself not being cocky
and overconfident but just knowing will
you'll get out and what you're not good
at where your skills lie and I remember
when I was interviewing I found it
really hard when people would ask me
kind of what I'm good I found it quite
hard to kind of sell myself and be proud
of anything especially after going to
school and uni and just being so bad
everything I felt like I was just a
failure and I remember I was in the pub
with my best friend Hannah and I was
talking to her about an interview and I
was quite nervous and unsure of myself
and without me even asking her actually
she kind of launched into this speech
and she basically listed off all the
qualities that she thought I had that
were great and she told me I was kind
and organized and you know she went to
all the different qualities and Nonie
was that a massive confidence boost and
lovely to hear from someone else but she
said some things I would never have
described myself as because I think
sometimes someone who knows you really
well that's not yourself can see
qualities that you can't even see in
yourself so I would really recommend
asking someone close to you to tell you
what they think of you and what you're
good at and what sort of person you are
because you might hear things that you
didn't know and it's a great confidence
boost it's really interesting and a
great way to be self-aware I always I
think it's important to know that there
are so many jobs out there again it
depends where you live and what
opportunities available to you but I
feel like when you're at school it's
very much do you want to be a teacher do
you want to be a singer do you want to
be a doctor do want to be a dentist and
I never wanted to be any of those things
or didn't feel like I could there are so
many more jobs available and I think if
you try and think about what sort of
thing you're interested in then when you
can and if you have the opportunity just
launch yourself into that industry one
of the best jobs I had was when I was a
runner in advertising so I knew that I
kind of had an interest in advertising
my uncle worked in it I kind of liked
adverts you know of something to go on
so I got a job as a runner I don't think
I got paid at first when I did it wasn't
much but it was the best experience ever
Hirano is basically if you go on a photo
shoot or a shoot for an advert it's the
person basically running around getting
tea and doing all the rubbish jobs from
doing that job I met so many different
people and I saw all the different jobs
available in advertising industry so I
saw the agency they were the really
important people we couldn't really talk
to and then the clients who
are more important and the agency spoke
to the client and I worked for the
production company and within that there
was a director and then there was the
talent who was the model and then there
was hair and wardrobe and I kind of got
to see all the different jobs that go on
to make one thing and it meant that I
could see am i interested in working for
an agency am i interested in working for
a client do I like the production
company do I want to be in the advert
myself do I want to help make all the
props for the advert so I want to do the
makeup it's the best way to see what is
out there because I think that's the
hardest thing I remember saying I don't
even know what jobs are available how
can I know what I want to do and I don't
even know what exists and I think that's
one of the best ways to find out what
jobs there are out there
I also remember in between reception
jobs and I did like I worked in shops
and stuff I used to do market research
which is when you basically get paid
like 40 pounds for a couple of hours of
your time and a market research agency
will show you an advert or show you a
piece of packaging and you basically
have to give your opinion it's meant to
be kind of like a random group of people
that's how all kind of brands and
companies do market research or fizzy it
was nice to get bit of money on this
side but that's where I really realized
that actually had a passion and an
interest for advertising and marketing
because everyone else was just there to
say yeah I like that color or no I don't
like that color and I found myself kind
of getting really really involved there
going oh I think it'll be much better if
it was like this and to learn getting me
to passionate about it so that was quite
easy way for me to realize clearly I
have an interest in that so I think the
point of this video is to tell you of my
experience maybe give you a little bit
of confidence to those who don't fit in
any of the boxes at school and let you
know there's so many other jobs out
there outside of the usual jobs you hear
about if you fail school you will be
alright obviously try your hardest not
to Ida try promise but I think it's
quite easy to leave school feeling a bit
like a failure and it's important not to
feel that way and to really take a look
at yourself and your passions and your
interests and your probably a lot better
and a lot more stuff than you realise
you are so I hope you found this video
interesting I hope there was some kind
of point to it something you can take
away please leave me comments and let me
know I want this to be like a two-way
conversation I hope you guys enjoyed my
vlog from Paris that went up on Tuesday
