products i finish sort of video where I
just go through all the products that I
finished and tell you what I thought of
them and whether I'm going to be
purchased them so I've got them all here
and I'll start going through them this
is quite a few the first one are these
redken hair products that this is the
extreme range the shampoo and
conditioner that i got from feel unique
and i really like these were the first
redken hair products i've tried quite
surprisingly and I don't know why I've
just never really tried them before
always had other shampoo conditioners on
the go the first thing is they smell
really nice it's kind of like banana
strawberry smoothie a little bit there's
a bit left in there actually it's quite
hard to get like the last bit of product
out but a little bit left maybe I'll use
this for one more go um really like the
smell I think they're good they didn't
like wow me and change my hair
completely but um I would repurchase
them and I probably won't because I like
to try sort of different shampoo and
conditioners so unless I sort of
finished trying all the ones I want to
now I might go back to these but i would
recommend them and you can get from feel
unique which is free delivery so that's
good um I also finished a bioderma
curling h2o I go through these all the
time and I've usually got a backup but
I'm already on my next one and I've got
a new one as well for when I finish that
one and so yeah I've spoken about this
before absolutely love it it's just a
makeup remover that you can get from
France and I use on a custom wool pad
and take my makeup off with it I
occasionally use it for my face as well
but I chose it cleanse my face and just
use this on my eyes so yeah I finished
one of those and loved it i also
finished this um Neal's Yard hand cream
which is the melissa hand cream and this
was actually a present from Gemma from
Jen's backyard when she stayed over she
bought me a thank you present which is
really sweet and I absolutely love this
I've only ever tried I tried a toner
from Neal's Yard perform really didn't
like it so
I sort of just didn't really go back and
as soon as I smelt this when she gave it
to me I was like oh my god this smells
amazing it's really like it's really
like zingy and refreshing I really
really like it and it's in like one of
these tubes so you can squeeze out every
last bit which I really like it's a
really thick hand cream really really
like luxurious and and I just kept it in
my handbag and had it on my desk and I
think she stayed over when it was the
Mary Clare Awards which was about
februari so I've had this quite a long
time at last really well actually and I
definitely want to buy another one of
these I am using the soap &amp;amp; Glory hand
cream at the moment but I don't love it
so i think i'm going to go get my ball
of these just to keep in my bag so
that's the melissa hand cream and i'd
really recommend that will go and smell
it because i think you either love it or
you hate asthma i also finished my fresh
sugar lip balm I got in America
Christmas I got this in like it's I
think this is a mini version and because
I saw Anna from very on thurs makeup she
had one hers looked massive compared to
mine so I thought this was the full size
but i don't thing is now i got this with
the lip polish like the lip scrub and I
just like fish this completely actually
I had a tiny bit left in that fell off
on the tree bit like just fell off felt
really upset my friend us with me I was
like no Thor's bit mental but I
absolutely love this so this is their
brown sugar lip balm and it smells
really nice I don't know if it smells
like brown sugar and brown sugar really
smells but it kind of smells a bit sweet
but but if I can select proper it's not
our son lip balms are really sweet and
they just see on the top layer of your
lips this is like one of the best lip
balms have ever tried I think um I kind
of I think i actually prefer it to the
nooks lip balm that I'm always talking
about it's quite hard to get hold of
fresh products here like in America they
said it's 40 and stuff but there is a
store and Marla in High Street in London
so I'm definitely going to go there
because it's not too far for me and I'm
going to go have a look my mum where's
the perfume from fresh and they're so
nice
I'm going to go see what they have but
yeah that's a lip balm I'm i think i
will get another one of these actually
definitely i also bought the body shop
coconut hand sanitizer or hand cleanse
gel as they call it and someone at work
had this and you it's one edge products
you can smell smell it from across the
room it has the strongest coconut smell
it's really really nice so i ran out to
get one think like three for two as well
so we also have got them as shared um
and as a little bit disappointed when
you first put it on it smells really
nice of coconut but quite soon after it
has its horrible after smell that just
doesn't start coconut sauce smells like
alcohol which makes me think it's kind
of quite a cheap full up and I didn't
love it i prefer myself and glory had
made and which I've repurchase that I'm
using that now and I finished this one
but i don't think i'd buy again and if
you like coconut smell then i'd
recommend getting one just because I
living is expensive anyway but it's not
it's not my favorite hand sanitizer sort
of to make up e things and I finished a
laura mercier primer and I've already
got another one I think I bought back up
one when I was in America because it was
a bit cheaper i bought it before i
finished so am i went straight two that
one and i love this it's one of those
products that I'm kind of just common
bothered to try a new one I tried the
benefit Prime and I didn't like it felt
the greasy um so I just sticking to this
one because it seems to work well for me
it's really refreshing to use in the
morning it makes eye makeup stay on all
day so yeah I've got another one and i'm
already using it i also finished my soap
&amp;amp; Glory liquid eyeliner which i showed
in my whole video that i've already
bought another one is my favorite black
liquid eyeliner all the writings rubbed
off but um there's a little bit left but
it kind of towards the end it's not as
black as I want it to be so I just get
another one and but last quite a long
time actually and love this product is
the super cat lips open glory super cat
liquid eyeliner I finished a couple of
bobby brown products one is the
vector which is a sort of pink toned
concealer to put all the eggs under my
eyes that sort of corrects the darkness
I get really dark circles and I use this
with a brush even though they sort of
recommend use your finger but I find it
really nice blend out with a brush and
I've completely finished that one and
along with my Laura Mercier prime i
bought another one in America because
it's cheaper and have already started
using that one and i absolutely love it
really nice creamy gets rid of dark
circles and i also finished the
concealer kit that was in warm ivory and
pale yellow so that looks like that it's
got like a powder on this side and
conceal on this side I won't be
repurchasing this one I didn't really
like it i found that the concealer
really creased and I've just prefer
using the corrector and then like either
Mac concealer all my collection 2001 and
and I just didn't really get on with
this I used it all but I wouldn't buy
again even though I really like the
little palette and think about keeping
it may be putting like lipsticks in
there or something and it has a little
mirror on it as well so yeah that's the
concealer I wouldn't really recommend
that but you should try it you might
like it i also finished a Chanel vital
email accra foundation and I've actually
got another one I don't remember buying
another one when I finished this I
literally obviously shop in my sleep I
do have another one so I haven't used it
as much but that's one of the things I'm
still trying to use again I've been
trying I'm so applying a shopping my
stash video I just try to use products
that haven't used for a while in my
collection so that's one of them and I
do like it it's a quite thin foundation
and I have to use my hands to apply I'm
actually wearing it today I do quite
like it it's nice for the summer it's
not my favorite but um it's nice and I
like little packaging so I have another
one on the go I don't know how that
happened but then yeah I finished this
one and this and the color eyewear is be
30 days sable so that's quite nice as
well I actually really like I tried the
compact version of this yesterday and I
really like it
I wouldn't wear it it's like a whole
face like a cream foundation which is
kind of weird but it would be really
helpful for me I'm going out after work
to just use it to like put it around
here and like all the bits that need a
bit more coverage and but just for that
purpose it's not worth 40 pounds which
is just so expensive so I'm just trying
to forget about it and I can't buy it's
just expensive so I'll just use this for
now and then the last two things I'm
kind of cheating I haven't completely
finished them there's one use left in
them definitely one wash and they're the
ocean drive recovery shampoo conditioner
um and I just didn't want to wait I
finished it because I probably won't do
another video this for a while k to be
quite a lot of time to finish products
and I wanted to talk about them because
they are my absolute favorite shampoo
and conditioner I've ever used hands
down and erosion is quite expensive
brand it's definitely not drugstore
prices and they uses ocean oil which is
just so good your hair and when I use
these like instantly I just feel a
massive difference my hair is so soft
and it's a really thick luxurious
product and i just cannot rave about
these anymore so the drive they have
like four different Rangers jaw
recoveries for obviously dry hair and
they've damaged reverse 14 ones that's
been damaged up really try those next
thing they're like oh I don't know it's
gonna be painful when I have to
repurchase this but I definitely have to
do because i really really love them and
so i recommend trying it on they do
little travel sets so maybe try that
first because they're smaller and i'll
be bit cheaper but absolutely love these
and so that's everything i finished all
that much it tasted quite walls gift
through products because i have so many
and i always like switch and change what
i'm using but i'm going to make a
massive efforts to use up my products
more and which is why i like these
videos it does encourage me to use my
products more and that that's it for
today so thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
