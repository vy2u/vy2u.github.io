empties video I'm a slightly different
background today because it's absolutely
pouring with rain and my bedroom has
three big windows so the rain is so loud
I wouldn't have been able to film video
so I've just come into the spare room to
film this one I'm so yeah another
empties video but quite a few empties to
go through it's just a chance for me to
show you how I got on with the products
and yeah what I thought of them
basically so I went through another
bioderma I think I go through one of
these a month now and you know i love it
i got four more that my mom just brought
back from France for me so that's just a
winner as always and the next empty is
this neon a hand wash and this is the
sensuous hand wash and I really really
like this I never really put that much
thought into which had wash to use i
normally use like a cheap bar from a
supermarket but then when I got this one
the minute I finished it was so upset
just really make such a different make
it really makes such a difference it
made my hands feel so soft and well
looked after and really nice I'm trying
out Burt's Bees ones at the moment which
I quite like but it's a bit more
clarifying that makes my hands feel bit
squeaky clean as this made me feel
really soft so I just I love neon
products and I need to look into how
much this was it's probably quite
expensive I think I would purchase it
because it was really really nice any
maybe when I have my own home and I want
to make the bathroom nice I'd get a nice
hand wash like this and the next thing
is this vo5 hot oil moisture soak elixir
and I think I saw Lily Melrose talking
about this which is where i bought it i
love the packaging it's a clear
squeezing plastic bottle and you can see
the oil and then there's a guideline of
how much to use on the side it was
actually quite hard to use in the shower
because once you squeeze once you start
squeezing it all kind of pulls out I
think in the video I showed this where I
try to smell it kind of went all over me
as well and so actually even though the
packaging looks quite
it's not very good I really didn't like
this I use a lot of ocean oil and raw
crude oil which is really sort of
luxurious thick oil and this in
comparison just kind of felt like
colored water it didn't do anything for
my hair I really didn't feel like it
sort of works into my hair it just sat
on top of it and didn't make it feel any
better off the shower and then it did
before and I wouldn't be purchased this
I wouldn't recommend it but me it's
worth trying maybe if you have less
damage dry hair than me your hairs kind
of more normal than it might work but I
really didn't get on with this and
didn't write it at all the next product
is a lush product and this is the breath
of fresh air tone or water I got this
ages ago when i was in lush I just
thought I really fancied by the toner
and it comes in this little spray bottle
and you have to spray onto a cotton wool
and then put it on or to your hands and
then pata on because if you spray it
directly onto your face it's a really
direct spray which isn't very pleasant
and it smells nice miles really like
refreshing so it's nice for the morning
especially and I didn't notice a massive
change in my skin when using this and it
kind of just felt like using water
really so I I wasn't very happy with
this and I wouldn't repurchase it I
don't really get all in that world of
lush products a few love baths buttons
that I like but I wouldn't really use a
lot of the skin care even that's meant
to your natural I just feel like it
breaks me out and makes my skin I don't
know I had a bio experience for the
squirrel once so I'm not sure about lush
and then next is this body butter and
it's the Nippon fab pistachios sunday
and Barbara from the Persian babe is
obsessed at this and you know you watch
someone's videos and they're just obsess
for the products you have to try it so I
went out and bought this is the small
version it comes in like a bigger one as
well and there's a fewer flavors I tried
this one and oh really don't like it
it's really really sweet and I probably
should have actually looked into it more
before because i know i don't like sweet
things it's really sickly overpowering
like well body but is actually really
nice so I'm thinking my trying another
sense because they were a few at me as
mango chocolate I don't know I'm going
to go see if there's any less sweet but
it's just fast it's really artificial
like candy floss kind of sweet I like
little pot I used all up anyway I used
on my legs mainly so it wouldn't like be
to me in my nose for me to smell um but
yeah it's a good bunch of butter so if
you like just go and smell of those
testers in Boots so if you just go and
smelling your know whether you like it's
very away um yeah it didn't like love
that one and then I have to so I've got
like two of each of these two superb
hoary handmade hand sanitizers I go
through these so quickly I keep one on
my desk and one of my handbag because
what am I half when I going on the tube
and one of my desk just for every now
and again i'm a bit hand sanitizer crazy
most hand sanitizers so quite like
alcohol but these smell really nice um
yeah kind of floral and fresh I mean I
wouldn't like we're a perfume this might
like that but for your hands it's quite
nice and it just gets rid of any sort
dirt or anything this on your hands and
say yeah I've got two of those that I
finished and i would definitely
repurchase those i think i already have
and i also have two of these red hand
creams this is the vert of a hand and
body cream and I think these came free
in a magazine and wiping drama and I
don't know how I've collected to i think
we had some magazines at work or
something and no one else wanted them i
really like these higher creams actually
yeah it smells really like really fresh
and i really like how small bail because
it really easy to store in your handbag
I think again at 1am I have
one of my desk and just went through it
so quickly but yeah really really like
this probably wouldn't be purchase it
because i always have hand creams around
so maybe if I ran out that I would get
into this but I dinner how much is but
Reds quite expensive so it's probably
more than I'd want to spend on a hand
cream but I'd really like this so if you
like rim it's worth going to try the
hand greens and i also finished a
bourgeois one second magic nail polish
remover and I was thinking when I was
using this how do you know when it's
finished because i don't know like does
it dry up because my still quite heavy
it's definitely got a nail-biter of in
there but what mine started to do but
you can see how copy is what it started
to do towards the end is Kim white
gloopy and when I put my nail in there
also some of the foam the black favor to
come off and it was just getting really
gluteals taking ages to take my nail
polish off there's not until I've got my
new one I've already repurchased that I
realize you just put your finger in an
hour and it's so quick so what it starts
taking longer becomes a bit oily gloopy
even that's when you know it's the end
of the road and so I've already bought
another one of these I absolutely love
them they're just the easiest things
ever and made painting my nails so much
easier and so I've already got another
one of these and i love it you can get
from superdrug and that's the bourgeois
one second nail polish remover and and
then two more things one is this Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion this is a
small size i think my come with my naked
palette or it came with something and I
just saw I've really miss you use up its
comes with like this little applicator
um and I don't like the package at all i
think they've actually changed it
recently so it's a squeezy tube i think
and if I have that's definitely a good
idea
because this just you don't get anything
on it and I don't know the primer itself
is kind of like baiji color and it's
quite good but I feel like if I mua
Prime I that's a pound it's just as good
and I think this is a lot more expensive
a lot of people rave about this but I
don't love it I don't think it's that
amazing it's okay it's a little bit oily
I think the air just sees that up
because it was like me and then the
final thing is not very glamorous but
it's Deirdre and but the reason I
mention it is because it's the shore
maximum protection do gym which is like
five pounds or something crazy is this
really expensive it's got one of those
gross things turn and comes out the
holes or hate that beer it's good it's a
good deodorant I don't know I don't
think it's worth feeding expensive than
others I me I'm just going to go back to
buying normal Theo Jones I used to
actually be quite allergic to a lot of
the urchins and had to buy the aloe vera
ones so you like bad rashes and really
itchy and the realms I think this was
nice but I think unless I had like
problems at the cheaper ones I wouldn't
buy this because I didn't see like crazy
amazing results and actually it made a
lot of my clothes go white which is
quite annoying so I wouldn't write the
shore maximum protection deodorants and
I think that's everything actually so I
do you like to see you my empties and
i'll see you in the next video thanks
