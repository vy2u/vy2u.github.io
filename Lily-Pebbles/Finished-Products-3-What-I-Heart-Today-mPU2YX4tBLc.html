video for you or I talk through all the
products that I finished and tell you
what I thought of them I like these kind
of videos because then you can actually
see the products that I'm using up which
is quite rare for me to finish products
but occasionally I do and I keep them
all in a bag collected them for this
kind of video i'm wearing my fairy
jumper dress today which my boyfriend
hates he thinks i look like something
from monsters inc and I wear this so
sorry if you guys hate it but I love
it's really cozy so um yeah I'm gonna
start talking you through the empty
products that I've used up first thing
is something i haven't actually used up
it was my product originally it's the
keels orange flower and lai chi skin
softening body cleanser and I was given
this bike heels at a launch of their
news or fragrances and I put it my
shower and I just didn't really end up
using it when my boyfriend absolutely
loved it I can't remember why I didn't
really love it yeah i think the smell is
just too strong for me because if i want
to wear perfume and this is just too
strong on my skin I way from really like
that I asked him what he liked about it
and said it kind of ladders up really
nicely feels really nice on his skin he
really liked the smell this one's orange
flower light she is very kind of like
it's very floral and quite overpowering
I'm not sure why you like this very
manly I do think it feels nice on the
skin there like Kiehl's products so this
was launched with their fragrances and
yeah this is all finished all gone rich
is a big fan of this and the next thing
is another bioderma I think I have one
of these in every empty empties video
already learned my next one and I've
tried this month to stop using this on
my face sometimes when I'm lazy I use
this one custom wall and take off my
makeup on my face but it's really not
very good for your skin not because I've
got bad stuff in it but it's just a bit
stripping and it's just lazy and Oscar's
cleansing so I just sticks through my
eyes with this or I try to at least
unless it's like being a really late
night and then sometimes I'm a bit lazy
I finished a couple of neon products as
well and you guys know I'm a massive fan
of neon I really highly recommend them
and i recently bought my mom's about
for her birthday she loves that loves
them as well first thing I finished
which I'm absolutely gutted about is
this a real luxury organic body squab
and this is by far the best body scrub
I've ever used it's a sugar scrub and
it's kind of like it's sugar in loads of
oil and you use it and it really
experienced skin but it also leaves this
amazing like oil on your skin and it
just made your skin feel amazing I
absolutely love these nasai use every
single drop it's completely empty Oh
smells like a spa I'm always amazing i'm
going to buy it i think it is worth kind
of saving for and splurging a bit if you
like feel like treating yourself because
it's incredible and I've tried other
body scrubs and nothing is as good as
this and so yeah this is a real luxury
oh and I reckon they come in a few
different sense but I absolutely loved
this so if you know people that like
scrubs this is a really good person and
the pot lasted me ages like three or
four months maybe it depends how can you
use it um it's so good and that other
neon product this candle I've kind of
clicked emptied my now and I scraped all
the wax out as you don't need to neon
products that's thing they burn kind of
like oils so when it goes to the very
last bit you can just pour out into like
being something don't put it down the
sink that's not a good idea and this one
is the restore inspirer which has
jasmine ginger sandalwood and I can't
remember what the smells like finished
it quite a while ago and my favorite one
is the one which I have behind me
normally which is the Harmonized 10
that's like a really nice Christmassy
smell and I think I like this or I like
them all but that one's my favorite but
the best if you want any unkind all the
best things to go and sort of try and
smell them yourself or get they have
that is cute kits with like four mini
ones that's a good way to try them if
you're like new to the brand yeah this
is a really good pot to keep as well
I've been keeping some of my lipsticks
on my desk in this and I know miss
glamorazzi has occurred tutorial on her
YouTube of how to like cover these and
glitter and create cute little pots the
next thing what should I talk about are
you trying to use like samples up that
you get a little like random samples
because I think there's such a good way
to find your products so i think i
mentioned that my last video i've been
using a lot of samples this one is the
John masters organic honey and hibiscus
Harry constructor and I don't know if I
have much to say about this I don't
really remember how it feels and to me
that's probably a sign that I didn't
love it because if I did I would have
gotten bought it and he's just like a
mass conditioner but nothing to sort of
rave about it really but I thought was
worth the try so if I've never tried
John masters stuff so it's nice to try
and I would try more stuff never you
ever pull ups different i also finished
a lipstick finally at never finish
lipsticks but i had this one on my desk
for ages and i really wants to finish it
estee lauder pure color crystal nude i
bought this ages ago I remember like
what job I had when I bought this as
well I was working it like a music place
and these lipsticks stink I can't stand
them they have such a strong artificial
smell I really don't mind that I
lipsticks and it was quite a nice pretty
pink and went on quite nicely it wasn't
it was very new color so it wasn't like
offensive it was easy to use up but yeah
I probably wouldn't buy an estee lauder
lipstick straight away and just because
of the smell I'm but with lipsticks and
smells but ya didn't love this smell but
the color is very nice and I know it but
crystal baby is a really nice lipstick
as well so the color and quality of
products I would recommend this but you
should go and smell them first if you're
funny with smells like i am i also
finished a Bobby Brown corrector in like
this this is another thing that's always
in my empties video I might clear this
out and use it but lip balm in if I feel
like it but yeah I've got another one of
these straight away I love it just a
pink salmon colored curr and concealers
behind your eyes to neutralize dark
circles which I always have so that's
really good and i also used this which
is a doctor luhan's and line smoothing
complex high potency treatment mask
um it says it's got our Geralyn I can't
say that word now a vitamin a green tea
panax ginseng and algae algae and it's a
disposable hydro gel mask so it comes in
like this big packet oh it's just one
disposable masks and you're supposed to
put it on after you cleanse tone dry
your face and you basically take out and
it's like it's quite thick it looks like
like a fake face and you peel off the
back and you put it on it's like this
thick gel mask but it's like a mass
that's all in one not like it's not like
product oh it's really hard to explain
and has eyeholes for your eyes and nose
in your mouth I think I put on Instagram
photo and be wearing it so I'll try and
put that picture in here if I could find
it it's really scary looking it looks
like sent from a horror film um it was
quite enjoyable to wear how long do you
have to leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes
I just kind of lay in bed watch TV it
was quite enjoyable to do quite
enjoyable to where I didn't see like a
massive difference in my skin but then
again I don't have like any problems on
my skin so it wasn't really much to look
out for a bit dry dehydrated skin but
they weren't like any breakouts to clear
up or anything so I'm it was nice it
didn't make film massively hydrated
afterwards I probably wouldn't buy it I
need find out how much this is because
this was sent to me this doctor learns
mask with like a couple of nail things
which I loved I really like the doctor
luhan's nail strengthener I think I did
a blog post on that and so up at the
next thurs below but yeah I wasn't blown
away by this mask unfortunately and also
his disposable I feel like that's a bit
of a waste but it was quite fun to do so
have you tried it I'm gonna finish I
finished an embryo lease finally this is
like the most longest lasting
moisturizer I don't remember when I got
this it seemed like one of the metal
tube so it's kind of like breaking and
snapping now yeah that's completely
empty now I've squeezed out every last
bit it's the M release Lake REM
concentrates m moisturizer which is good
as like
every day morning moisturizer to wear
and your makeup because it's just kind
of a plane unscented on fragrance
whatever and good for all skin types but
I just know I'm kind of enjoying using
my origins moisturizer at the moment I
think for a morning moisturizer I want a
bit more from it I still like the idea
of having on scented because logos and
your makeup it should be a bit more like
natural but I wanted to do more I felt
like this is little jest it's like put a
bit of moisture and do your makeup and
that's kind of all it did I probably
wouldn't get another one of these um i
would buy other stuff from the brand
next I quite like the brand so I'll
probably see what else they do yeah i
probably wouldn't buy that again no
there's just a few more things another
sound port is this is the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer I'm always like
trying new primers especially because of
something quite hard sell for like from
the counters so when you get a little
sexy like this is good to try I didn't
like this it was very kind of silicone
II like greasy feeling and that kind of
primer which you guys know I prefer this
off Norma see a water primer or like the
NARS ones which much more like creams
this just feels I don't like that funny
silky feeling and so I know that that's
not a primer for me um and then two more
things one is glam glow oh I've got a
little sample like this I actually have
the full size now so i'll be doing a
blog review or mention it no video
sometime soon um it's quite hard to do
reviews on mosques because i put the
ball in the evening so it's quite hard
to take photos but i'm trying to figure
that one out at the moment so this is a
Hollywood paralegal celebrities use this
mask and it's tingling and exfoliating
mud mask it is bloody tingling and
exfoliating I put this on its call it
green tea in it so it kind of comes out
looks like a mud mask that was like bits
of leaves in it and it literally tingles
so much the point where I was tweeting
like is this supposed to happen i was a
little bit worried it didn't hurt but it
was like a strong tingly feeling um but
then after a while I got used to it it
died down and when I took the mask off
my skin
felt amazing just so soft and I just
wanted to try it again my hair this tiny
little song so I'm looking forward to
trying the full size and this is a
really good sample size so i don't know
if you can buy these online or how it
works at the samples i don't know where
you get them from are trying google in
put some information below but yeah
really cool product i'd recommend trying
that and then the final thing is Jemma
Kidd light Isaiah foundation SPF 18 I
finished this and it's quite a sad time
to finish this because I think I can't
like have fun but i'm pretty sure Jemma
Kidd makeup is no more gone and it's
quite sad because this was really nice
and the highlighter was really nice as
well on the lips days there were loads
of things that really nice I kind of had
like a love hate relationship with this
foundation I've got it in 03
light/medium I literally sometimes this
was like my favorite foundation in the
whole world and then all the times I
felt a little bit cakey so I think it
depends at the time of year but I had a
tiny bit left so I just thought I'll
wear it for like a week and then it was
finished so it's gone I can't recommend
it because I don't think you can buy
anymore but if there's any left on his
face and care how to sail and there were
a few shades of this in there so so if
you can't get it I work because it's a
really nice foundation and seeing that
the whole brain is being discontinued
trying to get my hands on one it's a
real shame with german kid makeups no
more because I mean I tons of stuff so
that's all my empties for this month I
hope you enjoyed seeing them and hearing
what I thought about them all let me
know what you think about me including
like samples just because I use them
quite a lot I wasn't sure if I should
include them or not but I guess it's
kind of like finishing a product so let
me know what you think and I hope you
all had a great weekend thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
