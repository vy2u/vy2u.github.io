video where I go through all my empty
products i finished and tell you what i
thought of them and whether i like them
or not and i have loads here i didn't
realize i collect them all in this big
bag and i didn't realize i had so many
so this probably should be two videos
but i'm going to whisk through them and
a lot of them are kind of things you've
seen already anyway so the first one of
course is a bioderma finished another
one of these I know you guys commented
on my last empties video saying that I
go through these very quickly but I used
by dinner every night sometimes in the
morning and I used a lot of it because I
like it but I've already got another one
that I've gone on to so no panic yet I
haven't run out the next product is a
sample of the origins brighter by nature
SPF 35 correcting moisturizer and I
really like this actually it smells
really nice it comes out really white
when you first put on your face it kind
of makes your face look a bit white but
it sinks in and you can't notice it
after a few minutes and it's SPF 35
which is really good so if you're
looking for an SPF moisturizer I would
recommend this one I think it's really
nice and gentle on your skin but I have
quite a few moisturizers on the guy at
the moment so I won't be buying this i
just don't really need it at the moment
the next product is another moisturizer
and it's oilatum natural repair face
cream this is really nice and you get it
from boots and superdrug it's really not
very expensive and it's just a really
simple plain fragrance free moisturizer
which is really nice to use under your
makeup I know Pixiwoo kind of users all
the time when they're not using embryo
lease I kind of prefer my origins
moisturizers that have a nice sent to
them and they feel like they're doing a
bit more because my skin is quite
dehydrated but if you just need like a
plain old moisturizer for the mornings
then this is a good one i also finished
a sample of origins dr. weil think it's
dr. Weil and mask which I really liked
actually it's quite nice for sensitive
skin it felt very calming I got kind of
two or three guys from the sample so
it's worth going to an origins counter
and getting a sample if you want to try
anything they give you these little pots
and you can kind of palm
into the pot yourself so that's really
good I think I've got quite a few masks
on the go at the moment but if I finish
a mask any time seeing then I will
probably go by this because it was
really nice the next product is my
mephala nail polish remover and this is
the nail polish remover I use when I
have glitter on my nails because it has
acetone in it so it's a bit stronger but
I find that it doesn't hurt the nails
like some acetone nail polishes do my
nails always feels still quite strong
and healthy after using this and I
really like it and it does the job well
so I'm definitely going to buy another
one of these and you can buy them in
boots and superdrug it's just the mavala
brand so I really like that i also
finished a dip tea candle and this is
one of the little ones which is called
bay and this lives on my bedside table
it's a really nice fresh smell I have
the perfume that goes along with it and
I like this for the bedroom because it's
quite fresh and it just kind of makes
the bedroom smell clean and nice and I
really like it and it's not kind of a
stuffy smell at all I definitely don't
need any more candles right now if you
saw my candle video you'll know why but
X I finish candle i think i'm going to
buy a bigger one of the these because
along with the fig one from dipti this
is my favorite sense i also finished
like in most my empties videos and osha
enjoy our recovery and there's some four
bits because i basically cut them in
half when i'm done to get every little
drop out and actually i used everything
I could when it was one and when I cut
it in half I got I put it into a little
pot and I got two more washes out of it
so definitely worth cutting it up if you
use these because there's loads of
products in there that because it's such
thick shampoo conditioner kind of stays
at the bottom and it's too hard to get
it out and but I love love love this job
my conditioner I've already bought some
more my mum and dad both use this now as
well I've got the whole family hook and
just lovely oh gosh just a lovely
shampoo and conditioner really like this
the next is my keels ultimate strength
hand self and I mentioned this in my
2012 beauty favorites really really nice
hand cream and I'm definitely going to
buy another one of these will by my
first run for my friend
me this one it's a really nice kind of
unscented hand cream that does the job
well and probably my favorite actually
definitely my favorite hand cream I've
ever tried couple more things for hair
I've got the joy coke a pack and
reconstructor and this is kind of like a
mask a deep conditioner kind of product
and this smells incredible it smells
like strawberry banana milkshake
actually think a lot of people hate us I
think it's really nice and I quite like
the packaging as well there was a lot of
product in here I've been like nearly
finished this product for a long time
and I've had it for about a year I
bought this after Fleur spoke about it
on her channel I think last year so
there's a lot for us in there I don't
personally love it I won't be
repurchasing it I didn't I didn't hate
it but I feel like it wasn't thick
enough for my hair it didn't quite do
enough i prefer kind of the OSHA and
Moroccan oil masks and just a bit
heavier mas it was a bit thin and I feel
like it kind of helped my hair
temporarily moved for a day but in the
long run it didn't really do much for me
but a lot of people love it so maybe
worth trying to get a sample if you can
I'll sure they do samples I've got a
mini sample here of the joy code purple
shampoo so maybe they do a sample of
this worth kind of having a look around
and see if they do I also have this
little mini thing which is byte resume
is platinum strength instant rescue
shots I love the idea of this it's
basically a shot of conditioner it's
kind of the same thing as joico it's
like user instead of your conditioner
and it's just like puts loads of
moisture into your hair and again soon
as the joy cow I think I just got really
difficult hair and it wasn't quite like
strong enough for me but it definitely
gave good kind of temporary moisture so
this would be good for like a night out
if you just need a shot of moisture in
your hair and just wash your hair and it
feels really silky smooth I mean for me
I only really lasted a day but that's
quite if you need it for like a wedding
or special occasion then it's quite a
good idea and i also think people have
hairs in better condition than me this
will work really well I know Gemma from
Joe's backyard loved it so these are
really nice and I like that less small
you have to like commit to a whole big
bottle you can just buy a few of these
then I have the soap &amp;amp; Glory clean on me
creamy clarifying shower gel um I
finished this because it was just in my
shower but I didn't like it and I won't
be repurchasing it I felt like the smell
was a bit too kind of fake and like
sweet for me and I know it says
clarifying so I should have known but it
makes me a bit too squeaky clean I feel
soft when I come out the shower not kind
of like eeeee that's so not a big fan I
love the phone call from safer glory
another thing for hair I finished the
person read dry shampoo this is the mini
travel bottle and well that's really
loud I love this dry shampoo I did kind
of my top three dry shampoos or so I'll
link that below and this is the most
expensive of the other ones i liked
which were vo5 and resume but it's
really nice it smells like a nice hair
salon and it doesn't make your hair
white and it really works and i feel
like this lasts longer than most dry
shampoos I think it's nice lady little
trouble versions you can buy Percy read
on a sauce and i really recommend this
stuff is really nice couple more things
the first one is from roma therapy
associates it's one of their small
little shower and bath oils that even if
you can see that it's so small this is
the destress mind I've got a whole set
of bottles I think it's really funny
that this is the one that I've run out
of first so obviously the one I use the
most because when I do get stressed
there's normally kind of a mental stress
overload when I just feel overwhelmed so
many things going on in my head so this
is a really nice one and the
aromatherapy says it's always incredible
i'd definitely recommend that you need
like one tiny drop and fills the whole
bath and the whole room with amazing
sense this still smells so strong they
i'm going to keep this on my desk just
give it a little like sniffing finish
stressed ever i said like a crazy stress
head but this is really nice I love the
oils they make a skin feel amazing and
the scent is so strong and relaxing it's
just like having your own at-home spa
and then the final product is from NARS
and this is a powder it's in the color
flesh and you won't be able to see it
but it looked like that and I've had
this for ages I bought it like last year
I won't be purchased this because I
really like my Rimmel stay matte powder
which is translucent
I definitely prefer a translucent powder
rather than colored one because I don't
need it for coverage I just need it to
make my makeup lasts and kind of stay
longer so I won't be repurchasing this
but I did like it and if you want a
palliative with a cup of color than I
think nas one's a really good you guys
know I love NARS i'm happy with kind of
a cheaper rim or one for me because i
don't really use powder that often
anyway so that's everything all my
empties I hope you like seeing kind of
what i thought of them they're getting a
bit samey now I seem to be repurchasing
like bioderma oh john and just talking
about the same things but few of them
and new so i hope you liked seeing it
anyway and thank you for watching I see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
