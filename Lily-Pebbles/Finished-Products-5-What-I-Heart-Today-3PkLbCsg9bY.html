video I was kind of torn with to do this
video or not I know some people find
these videos really boring but then I
know a lot of people actually quite like
hearing which products I've gone through
and what I thought of them so I'm going
to do it anyway hopefully you guys will
like it so I'm going to quickly get all
the way the ones that are featured
before that kind of go through all the
time I finished a mini bioderma this one
I took to Thailand with me and so it
lasted about two weeks this is the
smallest size mci finished one of those
i also finished another bourgeois and
one second magic nail polish remover I
love these things but they do kind of
they get a bit gunky quite quickly they
don't last that long I always know it's
kind of nearly finished when it starts
getting a bit I get black bits on your
nails and it feels a little bit slimy in
there and once you use glitter in there
it's kind of done you have glitter all
over your nails every time so I do still
I def I'm still going to repurchase one
of these because I really like you I
think I already have actually be a
finished one of those i also finished
aveo5 refresh me quick dry shampoo I
featured this in my top three dry
shampoo blog post which i'll put a link
to below i really like this actually it
smells really nice and fruity um he
really liked actually i wasn't i kind of
forgot that i finished this i'm using a
Toni &amp;amp; Guy dry shampoo at the moment but
I think when I finished that one I'm
going to get another one of these
because it's cheap it's vo5 and it did
the job well I was really impressed
there actually the next product is from
Clarins and it's there suncare oil free
lotion spray I use this when I was away
in Thailand as well I really liked
actually it's a clear spray but it's not
oil is oil free obviously and then it
just works really well it hasn't the
pump didn't break you know sometimes its
prey creams you have the right angle it
funny positions to actually get it to
work I was really happy with this and it
actually made me feel really nice and
moisturized as well the next product is
from my bathroom and it's the Neal's
Yard be lovely hand wash this has been
going for ages actually um I got said
this and I just put it in my bathroom
because it's just hand wash I don't
really like have that much
preference over hand wash I don't love
this one it's very clarifying so I found
that my hands felt really like squeaky
clean afterwards I always have a hand
cream nearby anyway so I normally use
that afterwards I wouldn't repurchase
this because it is a bit too clarifying
for me but this I think some money goes
to charity goes to the be lovely
foundation or something like that so I'm
it's still nice it smells nice having I
can remember I just for that up my nose
the next product is something I really
didn't want to have to keep the empty
packaging for but I did for this video
and it's from dead sea spa magic and
it's the salt brushing I think I got
this in a GlossyBox ages ago and it's
kind of a lemony citrusy body scrub and
it comes in these little sachets i
really like these actually it's really
easy instead of have to scoop it out of
pot it was something easy that comes in
sachets and i just used all over my legs
and before shaving and exfoliated my
legs really well and yeah I really like
sort of dead sea salt things so I like
this identified repurchase it I have
quite a few exfoliating products on the
go so I don't need to repurchase it but
i would recommend it i also have a few
make up bits i finally finished my NARS
Laguna as you can see there's nothing
left in there well there's tiny bits on
the edges but i don't think i can
actually reach those i bought another
wall appears on the way back from
Thailand in the airport because it was
cheaper so I had that anyway but I have
actually started using it yet because
I'm trying to finish up my joy a bronzer
first which I don't love but it's good
enough to use i luv Nanda Gounod
recommend it's my favorite all-time
bronze I really really like it i also
finished a soap &amp;amp; Glory super cat liquid
eyeliner this is without a doubt my
favorite liquid eyeliner i really like
it it's just like a felt tip pen but i
haven't actually worn black liquid liner
in ages so i haven't had to repurchase
this but if I kind of got into that
again and I would definitely go for this
one and because I think it's really good
lasts really well and it's really black
black yeah I haven't won a liquid liner
since I finished this one i also
finished a laura mercier foundation
primer this stuff has been going for
like two years or something ridiculous
oh i am going to cut the bottle open and
get every last scoop out but haven't
done that yet I've got a laura mercier
radiance primer that i'm using at the
moment so
happy with that one but when I finished
that I might get another one of the
those of regular ones because I love
it's my favorite program it's kind of
more of a water-based primer than a
silicone one but I really like that it
feels really fresh on my face and it
makes I make up going really well and
yeah really like this i also finished my
makeup forever smoky lash mascara i used
to obsessed with this mascara but uh
since then I found my clinic and extreme
volume whatever it's called mascara and
I love that one so I probably wouldn't
get another one of these I've got loads
of mascaras I need to work through they
kind of expire the quickest i think it's
three months you can keep mascara for so
i definitely don't need to approach this
but as you like it actually it's kind of
it gives quite a bit of volume not that
much length but it's quite gifted volume
and just like in every day mascara i
really like this off i also finished HD
browse brown beta all the writings
rubbed off this which is basically just
a clear brow gel i do have another
backup anywhere that I've moved on to
it's not the best it sorts of keeping
your eyebrows in place but what I like
about this one is it doesn't leave any
white bits and it doesn't mean you i
browse go too hard I'm still on the hunt
for the perfect eyebrow gel if you guys
know of any i bought the illamasqua one
officer loads people recommended it but
it does the same thing it leaves white
bits I think it's cuz i got really dark
brows like any sort of white bits really
shown me so i'm still using HD browse
one and I do really like it and then the
last few bits all from dipped teak such
a sad day when you finish products from
diptyque is expensive but they're all
kind of very similar i finished the
Philosopher's oh gosh I'm dropping stuff
everywhere i finished the Philosopher's
perfume of absolutely love this perfume
and this is in the old packaging they've
changed the muscles now and they think
they've made them oval I actually prefer
the old packaging and so I'm shame that
they changed it but oh it's just the
best smell I've literally tries to get
every last drop out of this it was like
nothing coming out now this is basically
a fake perfume and I can't decide
whether to get another one of these or
to get the Joe Malone fig wild fig and
kill it then I'm going to get another
one of these or the german-owned wild
fig and cassis perfume which is quite a
different smells this one but they're
both fig face and unless you can't sides
at the moment
just have no fig perfume and I'm missing
it in my life and I really love it this
is my favorite dipti perfume if you want
to go have a sniff and then kind of go
alongside that I also finished my fig
dipti candle I would do this one so
quickly I'm i bought this really
recently I think and I've just had it
burning on my desk and yeah it's
finished now which is really sad but at
least I have a nice jar now i think i'm
going to put my eyeliners and this
because I've been looking for a cup to
keep my eye liners in but yeah I might
get a lot of these it depends if I have
kind of a shopping day and just feel
really splurge and i also finished some
dippity candles as well and it's a bit
silly to buy candles in an expensive
store like dick teak but these are
really good i kept one just to show you
they're like the really long matches and
they're really good if you need to light
candle and kind of if the can was near
the bottom you don't burn your hand or
the lighter I actually really enjoyed
using these but I don't normally buy
matches I not sure if it's worth money
or not but it was fun to use them and
that's all my empties so I hope you
enjoyed hearing what I thought of them
which ones i'm going to repurchase oh
