first impressions video and I don't do
these that often I haven't done one in
quite a while but as you guys know I've
been in LA and I did a lot of shopping
I've got lots of new products to try so
today I'm actually gonna be doing the
first impressions of the lorac Pro
palette and I know I'm very late to the
game but you know I like to sit back
when there's a height I like to see what
everybody thinks before I invest and
also this thing's really hard to find so
I've only just got my hands on it now I
haven't tried it I haven't even really
researched or looked into it much apart
from knowing that so many people love it
so I'm going to be doing at first
impressions but before I do that I've
also tried a few other products that I
bought in LA today so I thought I'd
quickly give you like quick first
impressions first thing I've got on is
the Too Faced hangover replenishing face
primer I just love the name of this when
you're hungover your skin is so dry and
all you want is like shots of hydration
so this really appeals to me even when
I'm not hungover it just makes me think
that it's gonna be very hydrating and
nourishing on the skin so I gave this a
go and it's really nice it's like a
cream primer it's not as kind of wet as
the Laura Mercier it's definitely not a
silicone Ian slippy like a lot of
primers it does say silicone free and
obviously I don't know yet how it's kept
my makeup on but I know that the base
applied really nicely on top of it I've
also got on today the Sonia Kashuk
perfecting luminous foundation I picked
this up at Target I don't like the
packaging because it's like plastic like
I feel like if that was squishy you'd be
much nicer I picked up the shade vanilla
zero 2 and it's a perfect match for me I
think it looks quite glowy and nice on
the skin but it's not too wet and I
found that it kind of sets on the skin
which I quite liked i blended it in with
my Bobbi Brown buffing brush and it
applied really nicely I think it gives a
really nice natural light finish it's
not too glowy
it's not as luminous as I would have
thought it would be but yeah I actually
really like it like now looking on
camera it's even more glowy than it is
in real life and yeah I'm definitely
gonna use this again I'm also wearing a
new blusher this is from Precision's
formula and it's the powder palette
multicolored custom blush for brunettes
again I picked this up in Target it's
aimed at brunettes which I really like I
don't like the packaging it's very
plastic it's very young and girly that's
what the blusher looks like and
underneath it has a section for a brush
and a mirror which I never use these
bottom sections so I would have
preferred slimmer
gene but I really like the blush it's
one of those kind of it's got a few
different pinky shades in there and I
think it's it is the perfect pink for
brunettes it really brightens up the
skin gives a nice flush to the cheeks
and I would definitely continue using
this I really like it I'm also wearing
on my lips the L'Oreal lat shiny full
coverage lip color and this is in shade
209 as you saw in my video I was meant
to pick up the ylim act ones but I
actually picked up the lack ones oh my
god is like a tongue twister so these
are shiny but I do really like it
actually Fleur said she liked this and
she was right it's really nice
it definitely is full coverage you
hardly need any it's very strong pigment
of color and it is quite shiny for me
but I like I think it's a really nice
nude I think it suits me I've been
wearing this for like three days now in
a row and I think it's really nice it's
very comfortable on the lips the only
con I would say is that the smell is a
bit like those L'Oreal lipsticks and
it's a bit of a granny smell I'm not
sure I don't know why I said this a
granny smell because my grandma smells
amazing so it's not a granny smell it's
like a stale powdery old vintage makeup
smell that's what it smells like and I'm
not a big fan but I feel like it's not
as bad as the lipsticks and I can deal
with it because I really like it okay so
let's talk about the palette and before
I forget this is I'm gonna have to do it
in dollars because I see anywhere I can
compare it to other things because I
bought it in dollars this is $42 I think
and I think in America that Urban Decay
Naked palette is $54 so it's a little
bit cheaper than the Urban Decay Naked
it comes in like mapped packaging and I
don't love Mac because look it's already
grubby and I haven't even used it yet
but what I love about this is how thin
it is I mean look how thin that is is
absolutely crazy it's so good for
traveling I always say that about
products and then I never use them to
travel with but it really is so thin and
even if you're not traveling just to
store that I mean it's beautiful I just
don't know how they got it so thin so
you open it up and it has a mirror
inside of course and then it has 2 4 6 8
12 14 16 18 imagine if I counted that
room I'm really scared of my maths 18
shades oh my god it has 16 shades I'm
really not good at math like terrible
with numbers I think I have that like
numerically dyslexic thing anyway 16
shades are really
like I should recount that the entire
top row are matte eyeshadows and then
the bottom row are shimmer eyeshadows
and as I said I haven't done any
research so this is all just like my
genuine first reactions oh I like that
you can fold the top back that excites
me so there are a few shades kind of
this end of the palette that I'm not
sure I would use the white is definitely
not for me I've heard that the cream is
quite good all over the lid but I don't
tend to use matte cream shades and then
the LT pink like I'm guessing that
stands for light pink that's also a not
very me shade slate is like a grey
shimmer I'm not sure I don't really use
grey and blacks there is a matte black
which is good for liner but if I use
eyeshadow as a line I tend to go for
kind of the dark Browns like the
expresso so I'd say there's like four or
five shades that aren't really for me
but all the others look really nice
maybe a pop from nude
okay so there's like six shades I still
think the majority I would definitely
use I've heard that they're very
pigmented and creamy and so I'm gonna
give summer go today I haven't really
thought about what look I'm gonna do but
I'm gonna try and use as many shadows as
I can so although I'm sure some of these
you could just put all over the lid and
just leave it there I'm gonna just try
and like use as many as I can just for
the purpose of this video Oh before I
start actually I forgot to say that it
also comes with an eye primer it's like
a tiny mini lorac behind the scenes eye
primer so I'm gonna put that on just
because it comes with it so they
obviously recommend you use it this
foundation is like a little bit Creasy
I've already blended in my eyes already
in it just creased again I'm so tiny bit
on the lid it's quite like a silicone II
eye primer quite light as well actually
I think this is a little bit light for
me because it kind of I like it when
it's just skin color but this is a
little bit lighter than my skin color
yeah not my favorite eye primer it's a
little bit tacky as well a little bit
patchy hmmm not sure I'd use that again
okay so maybe just for the purpose of
the video although I don't normally do
this I'm gonna start with I might try
that cream shadow and just put it whoa
that is really pigmented I just like
tapped my brush and it went everywhere
this matte packaging is gonna get messy
I'm just gonna put the cream all over
the lid I'm kind of tapping the shadow
off of my hand before applying it
because I can feel this it would
probably have a bit of fall down because
it's kind of getting all over the palate
okay so I'm gonna use light bronze
because I tend to put a kind of light
gold all over my lid so yeah you
definitely I think need to kind of tap
off the excess either on your hand or
just like in the air like tap the brush
like that light gold is nice that's a
very me shade okay now I think I'm gonna
put a bit of the gold in the center of
the lid this is a very kind of yellowy
gold quite intense but it looks like
it's gonna be very pretty so I'm just
gonna kind of tap that into the center
of the lid quite a chunky shimmer but
it's very brightening that's nice okay
now I'm gonna take pewter I don't like
that name at all it's like topi shimmer
and I'm gonna put that on the outer part
of the eye like the second half of the
lid that's quite a smoky shade actually
it's a bit darker than I thought
and take one of my rmk brushes these are
so soft I bought two of these before I
went away it's like the best thing I've
ever bought and I'm gonna take move
which is a matte mode color whoa the
matte shadow is a way more pigmented
than the shimmer I'm gonna take a lot of
that off because that's quite a lot for
art and I'm gonna take that into the
crease to kind of define the crease I
really like plumbing shadows shades and
then I'm just going to use my Bobbi
Brown brush Bobby Brown brush try and
say that fast
and then I'm just gonna blend out the
edges I'm gonna use a bit of sable which
is a dark matte Brown I'm gonna add that
to the outer part of the eye build up
the intensity a little bit they blend
together very nicely I'm gonna take that
save with shade under the eye and then
normally I'd probably use a black liquid
liner with a look like this but again
for the purpose of the video I'm gonna
take a little Mac 263 like eyeliner
brush and I'm gonna use and then Wilier
for express so instead of black I'm
gonna use a little bit of expresso which
is like the really dark matte Brown and
I'm gonna press this along the lash line
so it looks like an eyeliner now as you
really like doing this I don't do it
that often because I'm lazy but it looks
really nice these are the sorts of eyes
shadows that I wouldn't apply wearing
like a white shirt but I didn't want to
get dirty because I can feel that they
do kind of fall down quite a lot
if you're not that great with eyeliner
then I definitely recommend trying to
use a matte eyeshadow because you can
kind of be more relaxed and messy with
it okay then I think I'm gonna take a
tiny bit of champagne and put it just on
my little finger and just tap it into
the inner corners of the eye and now
just kind of open the eye and act as a
little highlight or I'm gonna put on
some mascara my clinic high-impact
extreme Volume Mascara
and I'm also gonna put on a bit of the
clinic lower lash mascara as well okay
so that's the finished look that I kind
of just made up now and I really like
actually the shadows are as creamy as I
expected so they do have a little bit
more fall down than I would have liked
they're a bit more like powdery than the
Urban Decay Naked shadows which I still
love I don't know I can't pick a
favorite yet because I haven't used this
enough I can tell the packaging is gonna
get very messy but I feel like there's
so many options it's quite exciting I
feel like I could easily make so many
different eye looks with these shadows I
really like this look actually it's a
bit more smoky than I usually wear it
but I hope that that was kind of helpful
to you guys if you haven't got this
palette yet I feel like everyone already
has it but I'm always late to the party
but I'm glad I waited to hear that
everyone really loved it before
investing because now I know that I
probably won't be disappointed let me
know what you think of this look that I
created and if you have the lorac Pro
palette what do you think of it what
your favorite shades are and let me know
if you don't like it be interested to
know if you don't like it and why I hope
you guys enjoyed this first impressions
video and I'll see you on Sunday for my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
