going to be a super quick video I've
never done a first impressions video
before but I went to Space NK today as
you can see and I spotted that they had
the NAS mat multiples which have been
quite hyped up it's like a new launch
for them so I picked up two shades one
contour and one blush and I wanted to
just basically have a look at them and
try them out on camera for you and show
you my first reactions and then I'll
probably revisit them properly on my
websites but for now I'm just going to
take a look so it's pretty late like
half a at night I've been out all day
but I spotted them in space okay so let
me just grow out an out bag I'm
averaging around because there might be
some other stuff in there whoops and so
I got al Thai and Lao Lao oh my god
they're really hard name to pronounce so
let me go for the contour one first
which is alt I think it's good and this
was there's three contour shades and
this was the lightest one I was
surprised actually how dark they were
the lady served me had light skin really
really dark skin and she said that the
lightest one would be the only one for
me because the others already dark so I
picked up this one ended like this and
these are 30 pounds which is expensive I
picked up two because I wanted to review
them for you guys but it's definitely
something to think about clean purchase
because it's not cheap so this is the
first one this is the contour shade and
you can use these as far as I know I
haven't got like any info before I found
out in space in K today and you can use
them just as they are or you can use
them wet which makes them kind of more
sheer I might start by applying on the
back of my hand and then using my finger
so this is a contour shade so I'm going
to use it like under my cheekbones and
one with like my temples maybe down my
nose you can even use this with an
eyeshadow brush
actually so the fry part of my finger
I'd apply it around there by the way as
you guys know I'm no makeup artist so
I'm just an average girl giving you the
go just like anyone would so I'm going
to take the Real Techniques contour
brush because it's quite small good to
blend and just blend that into the skin
it's quite an orange shade it's very
warm this one that's like the first
thing I've noticed but it's nice and
bronzy blends nicely you can kind of see
if you blend it into contours with your
cheek it does give some nice depth on to
my temple by the way what I'm already
wearing at the end of the day so I'm
wearing a kind of makeup from the day my
blush and ones are kind of worn off but
I am wearing base and like everything
else so I'm applying on top of my makeup
normally what I would do is do my
foundation and then do this then it's
quite nice actually so what you can also
do is mix it water and it makes it more
sheer the lady in space and kr8 water
straight onto the product I've got here
it's not proper water it's the Clarins
fixed makeup which is add or freshly
missed like the quarterly beauty elixir
it's just the first thing I grab to my
bedroom and I nobody want to spray it
directly onto the product because I feel
like I don't know I don't like the idea
of that so I'm going to spray so onto my
hand just one spray to make it a bit wet
and then I'm going to use my finger and
mix that in on the back of my hand
let's see what's happens with it I don't
like the idea of applying wet product on
top when I've already done my foundation
and but I wanted to see what it looks
like definitely applies way more sheer
you did it like that
that's nice actually it's more subtle
when you mix it with water it's a bit
more of a pain to apply but if you have
patience you kind of feel like it blends
more in with your foundation when you do
it that way okay so that's the contour I
feel like if you spend a lot of time
kind of playing around and really
working on contour in your face I mean
you just done it quickly now I feel like
that would be really nice actually
I think contouring in general is for the
more patient makeup wearers who really
want to like you could really contour
your nose and like I said and put it in
the crease of your eye but I just have a
quick kid to show you what it looks like
so I also want to show you the blushed
shade that I got and I got lau i think
after you say it it's the one that
immediately caught my eye
it was definitely safe option it's like
a rosy pink color and there was a
brighter orange than the lady it's
basically trying to convince Peter buyer
because it was beautiful and she showed
me it mixed with water and it was when
it was sheer it was really perceived but
I just know that I'll get more use of
this one and it wasn't cheap so I went
for this one in the end it is a really
pretty rose pink so I'm going to apply
it dry on the side and I'll apply wet on
this one so again I'm just going to use
my finger because I don't think the
shape of these are that great for
applying straight on they're not rounded
then they have an edge so I find that
bit awkward so I'm just going to tap it
onto the apples of my cheek and if you
use your fingers but I quite like using
a brush with cream with blushes and I'd
really like that these are matte because
you won't get kind of glittery shimmery
face or anything like that so that's
just a little bit on there that's a
really pretty show that you're really
like oh so that's just a little bit on
there show you and now I'm going to
apply a wet and see how it compares and
she showed this to me on counter and I
don't love the idea of kind of wet
blushes because I could just imagine
spreading them all over your cheek and
like getting really red cheeks but it
also kind of reminds me of the Josie
Maran cheek she'll a jelly
is wherever they could so that's mixed
with a bit of water it's definitely more
sheer oh gosh what water running down my
arm this is what I mean it's a bit less
practical it's nice that if someone is
more like a wash color rather than like
a book really like this shade I'm going
to stop there I could go on for ages
showing you and I really need to like
how to play around with these and apply
them properly but my thought power I
really like them actually they obviously
had a big hyper on for a reason they are
kind of exciting launch there's three
quintal shades two darker ones and one
lighter and and there's four blushes
from my remembers like this rosy pink
one an orangey one a kind of more baby
pink and I can't remember the other one
was but they're all really nice I like
them I think they were really nice for
spring and summer really good for
traveling as I always save and I don't
ever travel but I really like the
packaging and they will get grumpy like
most Mac products but I think they're
good and they are fed 2 pounds you can
get other similar products from Kiko
number 7 do some now but if you are
loyal to NARS I'm pretty loyal to NARS
and these do seem really good I'm
looking forward to trying them properly
so that's it for now sorry if I forgot
any details this is the first time I've
done a video like this but let me know
what you think of first impressions
videos they are scary to film because
you feel really like on the spot to say
what you think but right here and now
but it's quite fun as well so let me
know in the comments below if you like
this kind of videos give it a thumbs up
if you did and yeah see you in my next
video bye
I knew how much I missed ya know
everybody knows I ain't never gonna let
you guys yell oh good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
