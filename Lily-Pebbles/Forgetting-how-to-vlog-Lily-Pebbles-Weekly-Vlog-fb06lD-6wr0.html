and I've got a full day at home so I'm
going to utilize that and I'm going to
film lots of videos I've got my makeup
storage and collection video to film but
I just need to get ready for the day
I've only just woken up so I need to do
my skin get dressed make the bed all of
that shoes I bought loads more pillows
from H&amp;amp;M home to put in the background
of my videos so rich gets so annoyed we
let you have one two three four five six
pillows our bed this is my standard
uniform until I need to change my top
filming random t-shirt choice of buttons
so I feel my videos in a different
bedroom because I need somewhere with a
bit of space for the camera and some
light this room has big windows so I am
just going to kind of dress the bed I
hate the backboard on this bed but I
kind of cover up with all these millions
of cushions so I'm just gonna sort that
out now and and set up all the lighting
and cameras and then I go and do my hair
change my top and then I should be ready
to film
I'm just playing around the settings on
my camera because I have to kind of
reach I haven't got a place where I can
just leave my lights up on camera so I
have to reset up every time I can never
quite get it the same as last but this
is kind of how I have my setup at the
moment I have a light here that kind of
lights the bed but I really need another
one to go here I think tanya is actually
going to sell me one of her spare lights
would be which would be amazing so
ideally want one there and then one
there as well because this side of the
beds bit dark now okay my hair is done
and I'm really happy I've just used my
straightness like I always do but
sometimes it just works better than
other days so I'm happy with my hair and
I'm put on a pretty Tanya burr spotting
as you dropped it
sparkling dewdrops wow that's a hard
word to say and I put that on I like it
first time wearing this shade I need to
kind of sit down get into position play
around and then get started
okay I filmed and now once I finished I
have to do the close-up the close-ups I
mean so what I do is I basically stand
here I have my kit lens on now which is
easier and I have my little screen there
and I kind of hold the products hip here
and I get them in focus and I have to
record each one I just phoned my makeup
collection and it clicks so long I think
I forgot like how crazy is to film this
or videos my mouth is so dry from
talking you need to get a drink but I
think it'll be a good video I hope now I
need to go and pull the files and that's
always a scary bit where you see like
how it will came out and you have to
piece it all together I'm gonna be doing
a lot of editing this afternoon and
needs to take some vlog photos though I
might just import these and then take
some blog photos okay I'm just going to
take some photos and I'm going to use
this big whiteboard again as a
background
where I started with a full battery
that's how long I've been going for it's
lunchtime and I'm starving so I'm going
to drive to my nearest M&amp;amp;S to get
something for me and my sister
oh my office is such a mess and I try
and not show you my desk it's actually
embarrassing but I got them some like
rainbow salad from M&amp;amp;S I'm just going to
eat my lunch and then I've got two
videos to edit and six groups of photos
to like edit and sort through I'm going
to try and get a lot done this afternoon
it's now coolest too so put so about six
six thirty give you guys a sneak peek of
my makeup collection video oh I think it
looks so pretty I'm really happy so far
I'd say I'm about halfway through
editing my makeup collection video it's
definitely time for a person cake okay
taking me two and a half maybe three
hours to edit to my makeup storage and
collection video but I've done it and
I'm really happy so now I'm gonna
explore tit after Eve edited video
doesn't really stop there because you've
gotta upload in fill in the description
box and schedule it and put it in a blog
post and there's like a million things
to do but I'm so happy I finished
editing and it was very kind of there
were no dramas it went as I wanted to go
so I'm happy about that just edit in
another video great screenshot there as
you can see I'm a little bit overexposed
my face is a little bit too bright which
is annoying but you never retell these
things until you get it up on a big
screen okay it's seven o'clock and which
just got home so I think I might step
away from the desk now I haven't stood
up in a long time my knees unfilled it's
awful but I've got a whole day home
tomorrow as well which I'm so happy
about cuz I'm getting even more done I
don't often get to spend the whole day
at home and I obviously get so much work
done because it's just me so when I'm
not working no one's working so that is
great I don't know what I'm next gonna
vlog and I'll see you guys then I'm
gonna head downstairs now what Charlie
oaks eat some dinner and probably take
my laptop and carry on with work
fallenness not gonna lie I work so much
better in the evening I'll see you guys
on the next date that I vlog whenever
that would be hi everyone it's Saturday
and it's about to cut aparts to now
actually but me and rich Oh
a bit of time to spare and then we're
gonna go meet Deb's and Gemma and their
boys and we're gonna have a nice kind of
tea
afternoon tea cake and tea very English
with them should be nice they don't
serve food after three that's why we've
got sandwiches rich thought it was
happening lunch were actually going for
tea and cake and yeah I'm not sure what
else I've read ETS space and K I need to
get an orb a dry texturizing spray that
is on my list of things I need to get
every time I do my hair I have like
nothing put in it and it just gets so
flat so I'm missing that spray and
here's some more of that
you
we just bought a box of pork scratchings
from this like market seller look how
good these look oh I love pork
scratchings
there's my Space NK bag I got big obey'd
right x-rays and spread never got one of
the big ones of course that's decisive
and a so no assault people yeah
because an esop hand wash they didn't
have the exfoliating one which is the
one I really like well my parent sees
that one it's really good but we just
got there like normal one and it lasted
me ages last time and I want my friend
so I'm going to a baby shower tomorrow
and it said no presence but I hate
turning up empty-handed and everyone
else is baking so I want to get
something little like for her because
everyone always buy stuff for the baby
and so I bought her a mama mia nipple
bomb from Oliver bonus which i think is
both useful and hilarious and someone
needs to look out for her nipples I'm
gonna try look at these these are good
no not very
I'm just gonna eat a massive baking
these are gonna make us so thirsty rich
right safety first before pork
scratching listen to that crunch yeah

probably really gross but they're really
good
