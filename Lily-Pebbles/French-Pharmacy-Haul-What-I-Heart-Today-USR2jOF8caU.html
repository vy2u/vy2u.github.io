who'll feed my Paris been in the South
France for the weekend and I gave them a
massive list of things to get me not
really thinking they actually would and
they got most of it for me so I'm really
happy just so you know in case any of
you sort of go in there wondering what's
available they were in the South of
France and the pharmacies they don't
actually have everything a lot of the
things they had to order in so if she
went my mom went the first day she was
there and then picked up some of the
things on the last day and so it's not
quite as good as Paris but they have a
lot of things and lots of pharmacies so
I'll show you everything I got this is
the bag or came in there's so much stuff
I'm really excited to try it all so
first thing and the most important thing
that was top of my list as the Bioderma
Crowley an h2o makeup remover because
this is the makeup remover that I use
all the time and I can't live without it
so I was nearly running now it's I was
getting a bit nervous so she got me two
more big ones that should last me a few
months obviously I've already raved
about how much I love those also another
sort of thing that I've already spoken
about is the chordally beauty elixir
I've already got another big one and two
small ones but I wanted to get another
one just in case and I think it's a bit
cheaper there as well so they got me
another big one of these before I came
up with a list of everything I wanted I
did a bit of research
I watched loads of YouTube videos read
as a blog post a couple of videos that
are really helpful with Lisa Eldridge's
which I'll link below and I think Ruth
from a modern recommends or centered one
and I think she does all actually spoke
at this this product and this is the
nukes Rev de Mille already pronounced a
ultra-comfortable face cream so this
comes in a massive pot which is like the
big version of the lip balm I showed
it's like there's a glass pot and in
photo looks like this it hasn't got much
of a scent actually it's also quite
refreshing but not a strong smell and
this is just a day cream basically it's
got sunflower oil argan oil sheer
in it and it's really not doing really
nice day cream that sort of soothes and
replenishes your skin this is actually
available from phil unique as well for
2250 you are in the UK and you wanted to
get it but I'm really looking forward to
trying that another nooks product that I
asked for was the Revd Emil lip balm in
a stick I've already got the one in the
pot which is the one I'm always raving
about and I love it them and this is the
one of the sticks so I'm looking forward
to trying this
I heard it's not as good but sometimes
you just don't want to be sticking your
finger in hot so it's good to have this
in your handbag and actually got me to
I'm not sure why I'm gonna find out
whether she wants the other one or I
don't know those two in the bag so yeah
I'm looking forward to trying that
another thing I asked for was the sort
of mini and release moisturiser I've got
the big one that actually Nicola bcat-6
recommended a while ago and last time I
parents of the France I asked them to
get it and I love it I use every morning
under my makeup and it's just a really
nice sort of natural no scent
moisturizer asked for them anyone I
don't think this is actually the mini
version of the one I've got
it says moisturizing cream with orange I
don't think the other one I have is with
orange but I'm looking forward to trying
this as well and it's just like a
smaller tube like that it's a nice of
mattes tube and yeah it's just this for
normal or dehydrated skin and let me see
if it actually smells of orange it
doesn't not orange e so I was like quite
refreshing see how many of us trying
that and it's small enough I can take it
away with me on Wednesday this video
might go up after then but I'm going to
Berlin so I'm going to take this with me
and give it a go I think this is the
thing that Lisa Eldridge was talking
about it's the Bioderma Hydra Luger it's
enough I said that right which is a
moisturizing cream for dehydrated and
sensitive skin it's quite hard to find a
lot of the Bioderma products in the
South of France I know in sort of Paris
and nice I've been to nice and they have
like the whole range there but sometimes
in southern France you can sort of find
these everywhere but this is these sort
of things are harder to find but they
found me this which is really good um so
yeah this is coming
like a nice little bottle like that with
a pump and it's just a nice light cream
for dehydrated and sensitive skin so I
haven't got that I'm not sensitive skin
but I think it is quite dehydrated so
I'm looking forward to trying that and
see what it's like I think it'll be good
for like the mornings under makeup
that's quite light and then this product
I didn't actually ask for but apparently
the lady in the pharmacy was just raving
about it and saying it's so amazing so
my mom bought one for herself and for me
and it's the NYX self tanning
moisturizing gel for face and body I've
already said told you how scared I am
effect hands this is basically it comes
in like a nice little cheap like that's
as fruits and stuff from the front so it
makes me think that it's gonna smell
yummy and it basically says on the back
in just two hours this self tanner
delivers an even golden and
natural-looking sunless tan that suits
all skin tones enriched of mango and
macadamia oils it instantly moisturizes
the skin it's vanishing gel texture with
a sweet sunny notes glides on easily
without leaving streaks and allows you
to get dressed immediately after
application reapply daily to obtain the
desired color intensity so it goes on oh
yeah you can see that it goes on like a
yellowy creamy color and then after two
hours you develop your tan but you can
get dressed straight away it doesn't
like leave your legs wet or anything and
the tan doesn't come off on your clothes
so it sounds quite good it smells a bit
it smells like mix between mango and
play-doh it's like mango play-doh that's
exactly what it smells like
Tan's knows enough so yeah I'm gonna try
that I'm gonna give it go on my legs
because then if it all fails like the
weather's not good anymore anyway so you
ever have to see them and then if it
works I'll try it all over so I'll let
you know how I get on with that scry
excited to try that
the final thing actually my mom bought
for herself and then didn't really like
it so she's giving it to me which means
I probably won't like it but it's the
quarterly mineral tinted moisturizer and
I will really sure about this I try it
on my hand basically when I put it on
it's quite an orange color and as you
start rubbing it in it gets really
orange but then if you kind of keep
rubbing it just goes it's like quite a
nice tint so it could work I think it
hasn't got like any coverage at all
doesn't seem like it it's really really
sheer so I'm thinking maybe it will work
under a foundation it kind of like I
don't know if you I don't just tinting
the skin a bit darker or maybe if I'm a
holiday by the pool it would be a good
product I don't know I'm gonna give it a
go and see what happens
with it but yeah just says apply in the
morning use off the day cream for dry
skin or directly on cleansed skin for
normal combination skin
and so I probably miss not that
moisturizing but it's a nice little
packaging I'm gonna give it a go what
the hell and then that's it but the good
thing about French pharmacies is trying
to grab them all and give you loads of
samples or any buy stuff so I've got
loads of things to try these two I've
actually tried before their little
cordially look how cute they're coming
that were like triangles this is the SOS
thirst-quenching serum which I actually
have and this is the very source
moisturizing sorbet if sensitive skin
which I have tried but I haven't got it
so it's going to use those up this is
the quarterly vine of body butter so
that'll be nice this is the quarterly
nourish nourishing body lotion give that
a go this is the bio beaut by NYX high
nutrition hand cream with natural cold
cream I've no idea that means pioneer
trician hand cream with natural cold
cream I don't know cold cream is it's
for dry chapped and damaged hands I love
hand cream so I'm gonna give that a go
if you don't like any of these because I
don't wanna have to buy more stuff
so and this is the nukes clarifying
cream mask or were really looking
forward to trying that I love masks if
that's nice that I can actually get
nuclear that's dangerous and by I've got
a couple of fire buttes by nukes comfort
oh exfoliat comfort Olien with red
berries yeah two of those as a mat
exfoliant I'm gonna try those as well so
that's kind of every
thing um quite a lot of stuff actually
I'm looking forward to trying them all I
love trying new products and specially
especially French pharmacy brands see I
hope you enjoy seeing all of that and I
will let you know how I get on with all
of them if you've tried any let me know
what you thought of it I love hearing
other people's opinions on things that
I'm trying as well so thanks for
