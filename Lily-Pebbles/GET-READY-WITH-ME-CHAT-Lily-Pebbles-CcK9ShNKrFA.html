really well I thought I would vlog today
because I haven't vlogged in a little
while I wasn't planning on it but then I
realized that next week's video Sunday's
video is my March favourites and so many
of you commented saying you miss my vlog
so I thought I'd put up a little bonus
midweek vlog I'm actually not doing
anything that interesting today but I
thought we could just get ready together
and chat and catch up I'm just gonna
start doing my makeup and putting on a
tiny bit of the Smashbox primer Iser
I'm just putting a little bit on mainly
for hydration because I'm actually gonna
be using the new charlotte tilbury
primer today which i've tried out a
couple of times i didn't think that i
would like it but I kind of do it's the
Hollywood flawless filter and it's a
really weird concept because it's
colored but it's not really a foundation
I think it's just meant to give a little
bit of coverage I don't think there are
that many shades which is a shame but it
does kind of sheer out so I feel like
you can use a shade that isn't your
shade and it would work anyway it's got
this massive dopher applicator which I
love the concept but you don't really
get much product when you use it it's
like a little bit frustrating to use but
I put a little bit on my face like that
and then when I rub it in you can see
it's like the most glowy primer it
really leaves like a really lovely glow
pan you can like put it under your
makeup or over your makeup just use it
as like a highlighter and parts of your
face you can mix there's quite a few
different ways to use it like it really
makes my skin look very flowy there
seems to be quite a mix of opinions on
yay more videos not about the book and
then people being like I can't believe
you've stopped talking about the book
already so just to let you know I
haven't stopped talking about the book
I'm just giving you guys a little bit of
a break because I went really hard like
normally on publication week you just go
really hard and like talk about the book
I'm elite they lead up to publication
week so I feel like I had two three
weeks of just only talking about the
book so for your guys sake and also for
mine because I want to do other stuff as
well I'm just kind of getting back into
normal videos but I'm still reading all
of your comments about the
if you follow me on Twitter and
Instagram you'll see I'm like sharing
retweeting and all of that good stuff so
just doing some normal videos for now
really I am using the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I just looked
at my jaw thinking like what should I
use and I haven't used this for ages I'm
just going to use a little bit because
it's quite a heavy felt was not heavy
but it's more medium coverage I am
actually out for quite a long time today
I've got a meeting at 3 o'clock at the
NED which is a funny place I think it's
like a Members Only Club it's a bit like
Soho House but for bankers it's like in
Bank and it's like much more smart it's
very fancy and haven't got meeting there
and then I'm gonna go work from gleam
afterwards because tonight I'm going out
to dinner for my sister's birthday it's
about there today it's her 40th but it's
just crazy to think my parents have 40
year old child she's 10 years older than
me so whenever we reach like milestone
birthdays like my 20th was her 30th and
etc so yeah 40th is a big one we were
going out for dinner tonight
we're going to a place called itchy buns
on Wardour Street I haven't really heard
about it I think rich might have
recommended it so I hope it's good my
lips are a little bit sore today as you
can see this lip balm the large pros a
one has massively been helping in terms
of keeping them moisturize and it
doesn't burn when I use it
it's the sysop last one but obviously
it's not going to completely fix my lips
I wasn't expecting it to do that they
get particularly bad when I'm stressed
or making decisions which I'm doing a
lot at the moment because of the house
sometimes I like chew on my lips which
obviously makes them worse it's a really
bad habit okay I'm just gonna work this
fundation in well so I got to chat to
you about thinking about getting a new
tattoo and I'm very excited about it
I've been potentially booking in a day
today I didn't think that I'd want
anymore for quite a while
so if I haven't had a new one since it's
probably been 2 or 3 years I need to
check out my videos the last one I got
with these arrows which I go up can you
see them they're the day after my friend
Esther days hen she's been married for a
few years now so it must've been a while
ago and I thought I don't need any more
I don't know why one I didn't wear
once a and then Susie from Hell October
introduced me to her tattoo artist who's
called G or Georgina I don't know what
she likes to be called I haven't at she
met her yet and I just love everything
she does I love her style of tattooing
so much that I would literally get
anything like as long as she does it
they're so beautiful but I really really
love the flowers that she does so I
think I'm gonna get some flowers I'm not
sure I've been like trying to draw not
on my arm to have a think about it but
I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen I'm
just gonna put some concealer on really
loving this actually it's from
bareMinerals
it's called bare Pro this is in fair
light neutral really lovely creamy this
is actually I haven't actually looked at
the prices so I'm sure this is cheaper
than by Terry so if it is it's a really
good cheap for the by Terry because it's
quite similar great like hand back
concealer as well yeah so if that tattoo
happens that is very exciting because I
love getting new tattoos and I just love
her style of tattooing like really
lovely thin lines and if that happens I
will definitely vlog it
I've been going back to the NARS Laguna
bronzer the moment I put this NARS
palette it's got a few things in it and
this is the Laguna bronzer I've gone
back to this because my butter bronzer
from Physicians Formula is a little bit
too dark I think I always tend to like
over apply it
I am potentially looking for a new
bronzer so if you guys have any
favorites let me know because that's one
thing I'm never like sure of what I'm
using every day but Laguna's are really
like classic one and then I've also been
using this from Bobby Brown which is
their I think this is the limited
edition pretty powerful pot really ships
like a cream blusher I like using this
because it makes my cheeks look really
hydrated and then I could also just pop
it in my handbag if I need to I'm not
going out tonight and my blusher
disappears I've been loving Instagram
again recently really got back into it
and there was a time where I was like oh
my god I've got nothing to post ever but
suddenly I feel like I'm enjoying it
again so if you don't already follow me
on instagram i user names just Lily
pebbles I always say that just Lily
pebbles it's not just Lily pebbles it's
at Lily pebbles well so I recently
received the new nos highlighters
arrived
blog post about these although I really
find it hard actually to review products
in a blog post I haven't done it for a
while and I attempted to do it and I
just realized it's really hard to like
show it compared to video where you can
actually show what it looks like it's
difficult so actually I thought if I pop
it in this video today then if you read
the blog post you can watch this video
and see it in action and that might make
the blog post a little bit better but if
you want to read it in blog post form
and see some photos of the products kind
of close up and the range of colors
because there are loads of different
shades and I'll link the blog post down
below but this is Fort de France I don't
know why I'm doing highlighter now
before I've done anything else but I
fancy it and they're really lovely
highlighters definitely using the wrong
brush what am i doing this is the morphe
m50 one okay I hope that you can see
this it's not too heavy it's a really
subtle lovely highlight which is why I
like it I think these are great for
people who are a little bit scared of
highlighters they give a nice Sheen
without being too much
really really nice comes in loads of
colors okay let me go back to the order
I normally do things and then do my
eyebrows just using my benefit I have
this amazing mirror rumi oh it's like
seriously magnified so I've been
enjoying using this for my eyebrows
we're getting really close to starting
the house renovation which is really
exciting lots of decisions to be made
some things I find really easy some
things I find really difficult deciding
like bathroom tiles
I know it's I'm finding it as a control
three confined units just feel like I
want to be organized by everything but I
know that when it comes to it I can't
build a set that with some things he'll
just give us like a two weeks notice and
then we have to get the wherever is we
need and that really stresses me out
because I want to make sure I'm getting
the best or like exactly what we want
and I think I just need to let go of
control of it because I think that's
just doesn't happen I tried to be as
organized as possible with the things
that are in my control and everything
else I think I just need to be quick and
making decisions because that's how it
works I think the overall project is
going to take about
twelve weeks maybe so twelve weeks of
living at home with my parents I'm going
to use the Urban Decay Naked petit heat
palette I've been using this almost
everyday I've been using the shade hot
spell which is this one here for those
of you wondering why we are moving back
in with my parents
it makes the building work faster
because they don't have to tidy up every
day and because we're having our
electrics redone and then if they like
rip up the floors it's just so hard with
furniture and with us here and it's
going to be absolutely dusty and awful
everyone I throw the tubes had their
house done up said that if they could if
they had someone to stay with they would
have so we are taking the opportunity to
stay my parents spare bedroom I think
it'll be a little bit difficult to work
and stuff because I wouldn't have my
usual set up and my usual things around
me but it's just for a short period of
time so I will absolutely make it work
it'll be so exciting to get the house
done it's just a really nice warm
eyeshadow and I think that's all I'm
gonna do not let me go too heavy I'm
just gonna add some eyeliner for mascara
I'm gonna use the new benefit mascara
which I've heard some really mixed
reviews about some people say that it
kind of falls all over their face and
but that never tends to happen with me
with mascaras so I'm probably a really
bad example of that I have like dry eyes
so I definitely have no like grease or
oil around there oh it's a bad girl bang
mascara this is the one that there was a
lot of coverage about I quite liked it
it's like a plastic small brush it
definitely kind of makes the lashes
longer and very separated I mean I think
no mascara is worth that amount of
height but it's a nice mascara I like it
I wear it a little bit clumpy compared
to others I don't personally mind that I
just think if you're used to waterproof
mascara as this won't be for you but if
your lashes are pretty easy like mine
and it gives nice lashes okay now I'm
going to do my hair so many of you
commented on my hair in my last video I
realized once I was editing
my hair looked ridiculous because I had
it half up but because I was just facing
forward you can see that it was half up
I hate that about our videos that you
can only see what you can see you can't
like see the back of my head or whatever
so because it was half up but you
couldn't see it everyone was literally
like where has half of your hair gone it
looks so flat and Limp and awful and
yeah it did but definitely not worth me
filming for because it's just hair so it
was a bit annoying I was like I look
ridiculous but it's fine it should have
been more I was talking about them what
I look like plugging in my straighteners
these pink ghd's are so old and ratty
and I have new ones I have the really
nice new ones which look like this but I
find that they're just never as good as
my like original ghd's they've changed
the shape let me see if I can show you
this so you see I mean these are so
gross you see how these are really flat
on the edges new ones are much more
rounded and I find that they don't grip
together as much which for someone who
has curly hair really needs it to be
straightened well I find it takes much
longer a little bit frustrating keeping
these new ones in case my never like
glow up or anything but I just can't not
use the original ones they're the best
so I started and forgot to show you guys
close watching Alana's video and so I've
just done one what I've done is I've
tied half my hair up now that it's
straight I take about that much hair
clamp it about halfway through twist it
back quite tight and then slowly pull it
down and that is how I get to my waves
I'm just gonna sit down here and do some
work this morning I've got a few kind of
personal add mini stuff to do and I want
to email the girl about the tattoo and
then I've got a blog post to schedule
and quite a few old random bits to do
I'm gonna eat my breakfast
peanut butter cup of tea and then I'll
catch up
you guys in a bit I'm currently trying
to find a photo and I'm in hard drive
health and it's just messaged me she's
like I miss you she's been away in
Vietnam for a week so she's that every
now we need to talk this always happens
when one of us goes away when we get
back we have to have like an hour
conversation on the phone so yeah maybe
this morning won't be as productive as I
thought it would be I just chatted to
Ana for 45 minutes it was really nice to
catch up the further she had a really
nice time but you're happy about think
I'm going to see her Wednesday we're
meeting about the podcast I'm so excited
I really enjoyed doing the season one of
our podcasts so can't wait to do season
two now I need to post instagrams so
I've just been doing some emails talking
to my friend Jay about the blog redesign
and now I need to post my second juleps
Instagram so part of the work I did the
Dulux I did the video I saw and I did an
Instagram and some stories and now like
couple of weeks after the video I'm
going to do another Instagram so this
has all been like pre I took the photo
done the caption when you work with
brands you kind of agree the caption
together and I've got it in my mosaic Oh
app so I could just click on the photo
and press post now and it will take me
to Instagram and then I could just like
paste the caption and it's done really
nice to be kind of organized like that
with instagrams so I'm gonna post that
now it's this kind of photo of me in the
room if you can see which I really like
which take that photo and then I've got
to finish doing my emails I've got loads
of emails that I didn't get to on Friday
because I was doing other stuff so I
need to catch up with that
today's lunch is Heinz tomato soup which
I always eat I don't know what to eat
because we always seem to have these in
the house it's really probably the least
exciting lunch ever but it's quick also
I always have these they are croutons
even getting them from most supermarkets
I think they're like tiny hutongs we
always have these growing up I'll show
you when I put them in the secret but
they make it crunchy and they are so
good ok look at these croutons I go a
bit wild warning they are so young okay
I'm gonna head into town I've just
changed my top to this kind of pink
sparkly top it's hand wash only so I
haven't worn it for ages because it got
dirty and rich very kindly washed it for
me he is the best so I'm wearing it it's
kind of a different shape to jumpers I
normally wear it's a bit tighter so I
feel very dubious in it I kind of like
the color and I fancy a change just
gonna see if these boots go with the
outfit and then I'm gonna head to the
NED that rhymes
these shoes are very old but they were
Topshop and I feel like they always do
shoes like this they were the ones that
you just buy on the hanger but they're
so comfortable and I always get
compliments on them so I would say they
are one of my best purchases really
because they were not expensive
okay I've been to the net serrated vlog
but wasn't really appropriate but I had
a really good me team had a virgin pina
colada and it was glorious I felt like I
was on holiday I've got myself in Leon
fries because that tomato soup did not
fill me up as suspected and now I'm
gonna head into gleam and really do some
work there this afternoon before going
out for my sister's birthday this jumper
makes me look like I'm not wearing
anything
hell it should it naked in the camera
right now
everyone's kind of going home in the
office but my dinner is until half 7:00
so I'm just going through my peer box
I've got to show you guys a few bit
these are from makeup forever this is a
liquid highlighter and these are skin
the blurring tints that one looks like
that'll be my show it shaves so I'm
going to try those too this is aroma
cleanse by phase cleanser makeup remover
from deklay or and it looks really good
so it's suitable for sensitive skin and
stuff so I'm going to give that a go
okay I was the last one that gleam I
have to leave so they could actually
look up but I'm walking over to so hope
we're going to achieve buns
I think that's with could sounds a bit
dodgy I think it's Japanese I'm gonna go
meet my sisters and everyone else coming
finish dinner

maybe like burgers like asian burgers
I'm really felt I know we're all very
thirsty okay we are gonna head to
