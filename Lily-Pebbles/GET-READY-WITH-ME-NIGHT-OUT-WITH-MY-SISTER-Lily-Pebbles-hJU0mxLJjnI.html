well I just realized it definitely won't
be morning for you and your watching
this is probably a Wednesday evening if
you're in the UK but hi welcome back
thanks for watching today I'm gonna be
filming a vlog which I just love doing
I've got a really nice day planned quite
a bit of time working at home but then
my friend emma is coming over to record
a podcast with me for her podcast which
is called the Emma guns show definitely
go check it out I will link it down
below not sure of my episode to be live
yet probably not but I will tweet it
Instagram it and stuff when it is so go
check it out her podcast is great so
that's gonna be really nice having her
over although I haven't really bought
anything I've got tea I should have
bought cake when we went to Terry de
Gunzburg house she had lots of cake I'm
a terrible host might run out and buy
some cake but really looking forward to
seeing Emma and then I'm gonna be
getting ready because tonight I'm going
to the Cosmo blog Awards which I think
now is called the Cosmo influencer
Awards but I will chat more about that
later really exciting but that's
basically why I am makeup free my hair
is half tied up I feel like I need to
point that up because last time I had my
hair like this everyone thought my hair
had like massively thinned out it's just
tied up and today's video is sponsored
by Braun you guys know I'm a massive
born fangirl I've done a few videos with
them before and I've got a few more
lined up for this year so I'm really
excited to be partnering with them I'm
gonna be chatting to you about a couple
of their products and talking to you
about why I love them and how I use them
so I probably start off doing that this
morning I'm going to put on some like
minimal makeup because Emma wants to
take a photo with me and then I'll
probably just like top up and up and
make it appropriate for tonight I'm
gonna be wearing a dress tonight so I
need to get my legs in shape they are
they they haven't seen daylight for a
while so definitely need to sort them
out okay so let me start by talking
through a couple of the products that
I'm gonna be using today let's move over
to the bed okay you guys know by now
that I am a massive fan of epilating
it's really completely changed my whole
hair removal process I mainly use it on
my legs and on my arms and I love it
nearly schwarber so this is the born a
silk Apple 9 skin spa with the senso
smart technology so this is what the box
looks like I'm gonna open up and show
you guys I've just
ripped this off this epilator is amazing
because you can basically do for at home
treatments in one device it also comes
with this adapter head so you can either
use it as an epilator or if you put this
on and then use one of these brushes you
can also use it as an exfoliating brush
I love epilating because it's so fast
and so precise and it can give you up to
four weeks of smooth skin which is
amazing it's it's changed my routine in
terms of time I don't have to go
anywhere I'd have to go to a salon or I
don't have to be removing my hair every
day it just lasts so well on me so if
the Sun suddenly comes out and I want to
wear a skirt I know my legs will pretty
much be in good shape I also think
epilating allows you to get even the
shortest of hairs and because of the new
like scent so smart technology it allows
you to epilate at the optimal pressure
so you won't push too hard and damage
the skin I know people are worried about
the pain of epilating but seriously is
not that bad at all like the first time
you do it it's always a bit weird cuz
he's done what its gonna feel like but I
wouldn't do it all the time if it was
that painful I'm gonna show you guys
after isn't gonna like demonstrate for
you and you'll see it's really not that
bad actually let's go to the bathroom
now and I'll quickly show you guys how I
do my legs and then we'll come back and
chat about the other product which I've
recently been trialing and really
enjoying use my little lobster shorts
but gotta have the legs out for this
okay this is how I usually epilate my
legs if I'm not doing it in the shower
I'll arrest my phone here so I can watch
a YouTube video and then I dropped my
leg up across the bar this is definitely
the most flattering angle I've ever put
on YouTube and then I'm just going to go
for it I just always my top tip in terms
of pain would be to just keep it up
don't let the hairs get too long that's
how I find the best way to do it is okay
so if occurs Braun know how much I love
my epilator they also recently sent me
there IPL hair removal system this is
basically what it looks like it's the
born silk expert v IPL hair removal
system I've already got open because
I've been using it for quite a few weeks
now this is what it looks like and
before this I had never used an at-home
IPL system
for so I was very excited it looks very
snazzy
indeed so when I got this I thought I'm
gonna try this on my underarms because
that is somewhere where my hair grows
back faster than anywhere else and I
have to like work really hard to
maintain hair free underarms so I was
like if this works and that will change
my life I've basically been using it
once a week and I think it's been about
four weeks now it's really easy I just
shave the area make sure there is no
hair there pat it dry and then I just
simply use this on the area I was really
surprised at how much this does not hurt
at all I found it really really easy to
use especially on a small area like my
underarms so basically how it works for
those of you who are interested it has
this think would scent so adapt
technology which basically gives out
these little pulses of light it doesn't
how many eighty per second and it
continually adapts and reads to your
skin tones so that it's completely safe
it's got two modes press and release
which is the one that I used for my
underarms or it's got gliding mode which
is especially good for kind of bigger
areas like your legs because it will
just continually go while you kind of
glide it up your leg and it's really
easy to use they've also got a gentle
mode which is really good for more
sensitive areas or if it's your first
time using it and you want to just start
with something slow I haven't yet tried
it on my legs but apparently it takes
just 8 minutes and it can give you
visible permanent hair removal in up to
12 weeks which is amazing you just have
to remember to keep it up and actually
do it every week for that course and if
you feel like you can't do that you
can't keep on top of things and it is a
Braun app which will help you with that
so I will put the details for the app in
the description box down below along
with everything else that I've discussed
the epilator
the IPL machine I'm really loving using
this as I said it's been quite a few
weeks now I could definitely see amazing
results so I will continue to use this
and update you guys on how I'm getting
on I'm now going to do my makeup as I
said I'm gonna do a really minimal
makeup so that I look decent enough for
the podcast but so that I can add more
on later before I go out are you ready
for the speediest minimal makeup look
three to one primer foundation concealer
bronzer blusher
eyebrows
touch of cream eyeshadow tiny bit of
brown eyeliner a bit of natural mascara
hair down and that makeup should be
really easy to add to later on when I
want to make it more like evening
appropriate I've changed into something
a little bit more appropriate that isn't
lobster pajamas and I think I'm gonna go
to my local cafe and get myself some
lunch like a bagel so that I'm not like
hangry doing the podcast and you won't
hear my stomach Rumble and then maybe
get some like cake and stuff okay
I got some paint what two slices of
lemon drizzle and sorry I don't need to
see my boobs to like raspberry tarts
that look delicious
and I got my salmon and avocado no the
salmon and cream cheese bagel and I got
one too Emma just in case because she's
coming at lunchtime and I know that kind
of anxiety around doing something around
lunchtime and not knowing where you can
fit in eating lunch so just in case she
turns up starving
I got her salmon and cream cheese bagel
as well this is the lemon drizzle cake
this is the raspberry tart the six was
really good so I'm just waiting for Emma
to arrive and looking forward to it it's
been a little while since I did all the
press for the book so I think she's
gonna be asking me about but it'd be
nice to chat about that a bit more also
if you guys missed it on my Instagram
stories I I thought now it's been a
while most of you guys you wouldn't have
want it spoiled have probably read the
book I kind of Trance it through the
book a little bit further so I've added
that to one of the highlights on my
Instagram under the fYI if you want to
go have a watch I've put out some
flowers my friend Hannah of my 30th got
me a six month subscription to a flower
company so they just keep on coming it's
such a nice surprise every time I've got
a candor and my book and I think this is
where we'll sit and do the podcast every
row will have fancy equipment and I'm
gonna tuck into the cake and we're gonna
chat and I said I will share and we're
just going up since this videos going up
I think it will be live actually so I'll
put the link on a podcast down below if
not our tweeter Emma's just gone and I
forgot the kind of vlog I was gonna do a
time-lapse but I completely forgot sorry
that was so good I really enjoyed that I
was quite nervous actually I'm always a
bit nervous when it's like an interview
but I shouldn't have been because she's
so lovely and we could have chatted for
hours
I think it's gonna be at least an hour
long so if you want to go have a listen
definitely do because we spoke about
lots of different topics that may be
stuff that I haven't spoken around here
I really enjoyed it I spoke a lot about
the blogging industry and how it's
changed and things like that
I feel very tired this happens when Anna
and I do the podcast also when I was
doing like interviews and press for the
book this kept happening I think when
you just talk a lot it's quite like
emotionally tiring I know that sounds
crazy but I need to just take a minute
because otherwise I wouldn't have the
energy to go out tonight I've sorted
through my inbox so that is good I think
I'm gonna take an Instagram photo
because I haven't really got one to post
today and I'm really enjoying Instagram
at the moment so I don't want to let it
slip oh sorry I'm gonna take a little
flatly photo
that was a prime example of when you try
and force yourself to take photo and it
doesn't really work
I felt quite like inspired by doing a
pink themed photo and so I kind of got
everything together and tried to do a
flat lay and it wasn't really working
I'm feeling like a little bit impatient
I tried to take it for quite a while
went through some photos edited them and
then when I just sat down here and kind
of looked at everything from this angle
I realized it would make a much better
photo from here so I just took one and
that's turned out to be the best photo
so I think that's a very good
photography lesson right there okay it
is 5:30 I've got an hour so I'm going to
start getting ready and my makeup is
looking okay my eye area is still so dry
I have this constant wrinkle here from
my eczema which isn't great and I also
need some lip balm on so tonight is the
cosmopolitan blog Awards all of the
cosmopolitan influence rewards which I
wish they weren't called that and the
reason I am particularly excited to be
nominated for influencer of the year I
mean these sort of awards things it's
always very nice to get acknowledged
it's fun to get like an actual award if
you win but you know it's not really
what we live for I think we've had to
learn with our jobs to give ourselves
like a pat on the back rather than kind
of expect people to acknowledge us and
give us awards so it's not really for
that reason but the Cosmopolitan blog
Awards started in 2012 which is when I
started blogging full-time I'm just
gonna kind of like top up my makeup
wasn't chatty to you guys so they've
kind of like been on this whole journey
with me but I have never been nominated
or invited I remember Anna and like
milli and the girls used to always go
and I was like so jealous it looked like
so much fun and I've just never been and
this year I'm nominated for influencer
of the year which is really cool and
crazy and there's some amazing other
people nominated Anna is nominated so
obviously I'm actually rooting for Anna
because
that would be amazing if she won she
can't come tonight so I'm kind of hoping
she does win so I could be like woo Ana
for her but whoever wins I still be
really fun night outs like a proper
sit-down dinner
and I'm taking my sister as my plus-one
because I thought rich might find that
kind of thing boring and I think she'll
love it
she loves like glitz and glam so we're
getting dressed up we're gonna go it's
gonna be a fun night kind of irrelevant
of whoever wins what so it feels very
nostalgic even though they've changed it
to influencer Awards it's funny because
on Emma's podcast just now I spoke a lot
about why I don't like the word
influencer and she really liked the word
content creator online content creator
so she's like I'm gonna go with it I'm
like yeah let's make this a thing I'm
just bronzing up my face I think I might
do a little bit of contouring why not
only really contour from going out in
the evening and I just put it right
under my cheekbones think I'm gonna wear
my Alice and Olivia dress which is the
one I bought for my friend Hannah's
wedding and a war in New York as well I
don't really like buy new outfits every
time I have an event and it just seems
silly prevent wear like smart clothes
that often it seems a bit wasteful
really so I just kind of wear the same
thing every time I have a small event
which I'm totally okay with because I
think that's what normal people do they
re wear clothes only on the Internet's
people have like a new outfit every day
so I love that dress and it's like silk
kind of dress I think the only problem
is I never have any nice shoes so I
always ruin my nice outfit by not having
any nice shoes to kind of complement in
them I just feel so awkward in heels it
just feels so on me I've never found
like the cool pair of heels that feel
like me I'm gonna put on some
highlighter okay I am going to put on
some warm brown eyeshadow I'm gonna take
my brown eyeliner and go quite heavy
above my eyelashes and underneath as
well and this will just make it look a
bit more evening
look compared to why not normally where
I'm just gonna like line it and then
smudge out with a brush it's time for
hair I'm gonna do my usual thing because
I can't really do anything fancy with my
hair
I'm just gonna put in sections and then
just using my straighteners I'm gonna
add in some wave so I think I will put
you guys on a time-lapse because
otherwise this will take a while you've
seen me do this before sorry I had to
take a bit of a pause from vlogging
because I had to charge my camera
battery because it's running a bit low
but I've basically got dressed now this
dress is my Allison livia dress I love
it for so many reasons you can be as
bloated as you want in it it's made out
of beautiful materials it's very
comfortable
it looks beautiful I love the kind of
length of it I like that you can wear
any old black knickers and you can't see
basically all like comfort related
reasons I decided not to turn my legs
because I was going to and then I
thought the rest of my body is pale it
would look weird why do we all have to
be tanned all the time it's okay to be
pale sometimes so I've just left them as
they are but obviously there was no hair
on there anymore so that's good
I'm gonna wear my Chanel bag I'm wearing
boots because I feel most comfortable in
boots it definitely changes the look it
makes it a bit more like rock chick look
is that still a thing which I'm up for I
I feel weird in like strappy heels I
don't feel like I can be myself and I
like to feel confidence so I'm wearing
black boots I think it goes okay and I'm
also wearing my new earrings which are
from whistles
but she would have seen in my whole
video so that is my outfit for the
evening pretty hungry but apparently
it's a sit-down dinner so that's good
before I go out I'm actually gonna put
some coconut oil on my tattoo that is
what G my tattoo artists recommend
putting on which said the ingredients to
the tattoo you cream it on you see users
change so she's like coconut oil will do
that's something everyone has in their
cupboard so it's been a little bit itchy
because it's kind of rubbing on my dress
I just feel like that would be the
sensible thing to do so I normally just
like warm up a little bit in between my
hands and then just put on a really thin
layer I've got to see make sure my hands
are clean I kind of warm it up in my
hands which is really funny cuz
depending on the time of day sometimes
it turns into an oil straightaway and
then either
time's it goes a bit pasty I normally
have to let my kind of body heat warm up
a bit yeah when I put on my arms it
normally turns to an oil a little bit on
my tattoo try not to get it all over my
dress this is what the tattoo is looking
like as it's healing it's getting a
little bit darker and it's starting to
scab it's nice for it to heal I hate
that itchy tattoo coming I'm just at Joe
Joe's picking her up we're gonna get an
uber she's wearing my needle and thread
dress so Joe is taking so many selfies
because it's a rare occasion that she's
going how she's like proof I need proof
I always try really hard not to be early
to things it's not cool I was I wants to
get here at 7:45 which is like somewhere
between 7:30 and 8:00 when it's like the
reception but it's 7:20 and we're like

so we're actually here before
very uncool I stupidly didn't wear a
coat and it's quite cold and I didn't
realize how far we have to walk there

stockings all about we've made friends
