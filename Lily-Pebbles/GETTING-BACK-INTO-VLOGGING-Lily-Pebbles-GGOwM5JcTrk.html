weekly vlog I haven't done one of these
in a while and excited to be vlogging
again it is Saturday morning it's a
lovely sunny day me and which are just
like puttering around the flat actually
we're about to eat sushi and it's 1022 I
think that's really gross I basically
had friends over last night and got so
much sushi I completely over ordered and
have loads left over and we're really
hungry so we're just going to eat it
even though it's kind of like having
sushi for breakfast this is the sushi
situation right now and it looks great
you haven't been in a video for a while
Oh looking fresh toilet brush yeah these
are the pickled cucumber of dreams they
are incredible today we are going to
Greenwich which as a Londoner I'm
ashamed to say I have never been I don't
know why rich has been for work soon
I've never been to Greenwich and there's
a gallery they're called now gallery I
saw it on high now and apparently
they've got a really cool exhibition on
where there's like loads of flowers
hanging from the ceiling I don't really
know but I mean fact you do is very
different today I'm just kind of bored
of doing the same thing but the time so
we get a head always Greenwich like 14
five minutes away maybe walk around
there explore I think I'm going to take
my big camera with because I want to
take more photos actually I saw a video
from Steve's Booker I'm going to link it
below if you guys don't already know
Steve he is a great guy really cool
youtuber and he did a video where he
walked around a plane I think he's going
to do it weighs traveling around the
whole world but I'd love to do something
similar for London he kind of walks
around different areas taking photos and
capturing that area and then he kind of
puts some certain photos into the video
and I don't know if all of you guys are
interested in photography but I just
love an excuse to kind of practice my
photography more so I might take my
camera out with me today and if I take
any good snaps I'll kind of insert them
into the video and show you guys I
really want to try and take more kind of
non-working photos less kind of like
outfit photos and more photos around
London and stuff so it's big and it's
heavy but I think I'm going to take out
with me today I'm taking all
honeymoon photo albums over to my
parents to show them this morning before
we go out I got these on some paper
chase Anna told me about them years ago
we both use them for all of our photos
they're eight for just brown and they're
self-adhesive as a Hosea so you can just
stick them wherever you like I actually
print my photos in five by seven so I
really like them and they're big and
then on the side I just use my label
maker to label what they are I hope you
don't mean discontinued every time I go
to Paper Chase
they never have them I was a flex hunt
them down so please don't buy them
because I need them
Thanks we have two albums one with like
our safari photos and I love them
because cute on tortoise frequent events
open up military finally gonna you know
run off
we come to Greenwich Park
everything's up coffee is going to go
home you walk around
trying out a hazelnut chocolate
9950 Starks irony was the first ship
sprinke over so very appreciative
because I love to look around the gift
shop and I'll say another kid this is
why would have wanted hearing I
connected hearings and badges of a set
the finger series I think you don't see
on YouTube that's me and rich to Titus a
really annoying arguments and I we wrote
in bad moods but with Mike it's like
getting over and I left quite quickly
and moving on we're now go into a
gallery called now gallery and I really
hope it's the opening in my clothes at
for like half an hour there's a cool
exhibition on there that I read in time
out we're going to go check it out in
our families this artist called Rebecca
Louise law to sum up all these like
Irish flowers over how long I'd have
seen how they like change over time and
that pulls us here and paid 11 pounds
apart
oh and that's war for that oh yeah we
don't get my head 9 by your ugly person
to do that
I got a Newton sugar why so we went all
the way to signed it change our you
rocky person we went all the way to
Greenwich to go to this exhibition and
if you're new Greenwich go check out why
wouldn't those worth traveling all the
way because it was a bit boring and we
were all there
what's that behind your head round the
ring is a blogger she lay and
[Laughter]

Maastricht you are when your baby - the
baby acts of milk strength
I know me you're eating a chocolate

nice can you not do you know stabilizer
yippee Nandini yeah yeah yeah I'm going
to get rich to film me to see if I still
do kick up remaining for more than five
I'm checking in because I don't know
what I've slogged it'll go a bit crazy
when I went to Joe's animals it's
logging practice so I don't really
remember what I said in what I have said
I'm sure when I come to editing I'm
going to be and always myself for
reversing everything I've said but we
should have got the tube today I think
driving brutally scales London has made
it kind of very tiring and stressful and
we felt like it wasn't worth driving
that far for but it's kind of could see
new area I don't know like those piles
been assured though which I really light
like the market in the high street I
don't know I'm glad we did it but we're
already tired now we're heading back
home we've booked to go see beach in the
Beast tonight which I'm really excited
for it looks like a really good remake
and I'll do it like one of my favorite
to see first when I was young
somehow I couldn't disguise come along
with me and how I did that he like heaps
musicals and anything it's a classic
classic Disney I chose a classic this
because I feel like it but you're never
you're never going to admit if you like
it of course we're going to say very
high God isn't lost we properly will
have dinner before soon are we're just
discussing whether did you take away or
to go to cool new restaurant there's a
place in Islington called the Chinese
Laundry which I kind of want to try or
we just like eat a person anarch's is
one of those ones or you can get food
and drink so just having to think about
that we realized that if we went home
that we're both a bit like pletely so if
you weren't home to probably end up like
sitting on the phone for never getting
up again so we're just going straight to
instance and we're going to check out
this place was the Chinese Laundry I
really hope you get a table because we
haven't booked but it looks really cool
it's quite like a small menu and it's
meant to be like if you were to go to a
Chinese family's house and it's like all
sharing food and I don't know but if you
look at the website looks really cool
so we're going to head there now get
some food cause there's a sore throat no
but something else I have that sensitive
good just go a really busy week so I do
not want to be getting ill what we'd be
the only ones out getting dinner this
early but it's really really busy on off
the street and run for it hello
why is it closed
serious fire down out on the roof oh
sorry for February I mean what are the
chances
how unlucky oh wait what the hell else
I'm sorry oh sorry it's such a good high
sierra which again at the restaurants
all right so I needed shops and
restaurants like one after the other
here we've come to the Facebook is is on
reading the preferred name an exquisite
in market we are quite early it's time
that was my goal you actually doing it
what you hear that way
that was actually a really nice little
Thai restaurant on up the street we're
now going to this anymore
we're going to be really early actually
we can get a cup of tea beforehand
Beauty and the Beast
I'm just excited I having to sit on ages
either it was this in a model bit early
so we are having a couple you need a
mile or guys a week see everyone it was
monuments and I got Mitchell Christmas
fun kind of about the demon comes out
minstrels water shots on how to be timid
not on the bed oh my god guys Beauty and
the Beast was epic first of all it was
everything I wished for and more they
kind of tell you more of the story like
more of the background of the story it's
extra songs it's brilliant it's so worth
the hype it's actually bigger than the
hype like I just I know it's very
different means in la-la land but
because Lowell allows like being the
biggest film recently it's even better
than lala land Emma Watson was brilliant
I think she has the most beautiful
singing voice I loved her and there are
some other people in it he did really
expect to be in it and they're great as
well and I'm here I lost every there
wasn't one thing about it I would have
changed I loved it so much
what do you actually think about could
you do it will you like that kind of
thing I did not get bored she didn't get
bored that is a review from rich now I
really loved it and it was so great that
I had a girl sitting next to me but
there were an ugly mean I had a girl's
it makes me he was so emotionally
invested
I was give us a like the best thing
about these whole ideas like over the
best thing about the Disney remake is
that it's like seeing your childhood
come to life because we all kind of if
you are in my age we all live through
like beating the beast and what's the
real jungle book like they're classic
then you literally seen them come to
life and it's the most amazing thing the
girl next to me so emotionally invested
she liked the whole soul she's like oh
I am at the edge of the cover look never
seen anyone like that Lisbon well you
know it was a little bit distracting to
kind of making me jump out of my skin
because she was gasping so much and
crying and it was hilarious so I might
want to I think I'm going to see again
so I feel like fully concentrated but
yet Oh totally see again I thought it
was brilliant I'm over the moon I'm so
happy about it that's the best film I've
seen in years
by far I think Emma Watson is such a
great human being I can't go for the
girl with tops rigid favorite thing
about the cinema with the gasoline
gardening seviche is now 11:30 p.m. and
we left the house this morning at 11
a.m.
so we've literally been out all day and
I keep laughing it really unfunny things
which means I'm a bit like delirious
over a couple snow also I thought a
couple of your skin care bit because my
skin had been so so dried that it's
because I came back from holiday or what
was going on I keep noticing and my
makeup like really creasing and stuff
around my eyes so I picked up the ankle
gel erotic serum because I had this
before and it's like the most hydrating
serum ever it's basically just a
hyaluronic acid pretty sure cause you
remember now and it's so so good I
picked up that and then I asked Caroline
if she recommends a moisturizer that if
she recommended a cat Berkey vitamin C
intensive face cream so I've been using
those two together for the last three
days and they have already massively
helped the hydration in my skin and it's
feeling so much better so that is a good
thing I actually now like look forward
to do my skincare you know and you have
like a new product that you're enjoying
so I'm going to now take my makeup off
do my skincare routine and sign off for
the evening I'm actually having quite a
nice day tomorrow as well I'm seeing my
friend Hannah for brunch and tomorrow
night racine Deb's and pool for dinner
