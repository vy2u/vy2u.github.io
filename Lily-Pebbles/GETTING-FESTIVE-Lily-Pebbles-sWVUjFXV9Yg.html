the 2nd of December and I got vlogmas
FOMO everyone starts putting their blog
misses up and I'm just like I fancy
vlogging I'm not doing vlogmas but I did
say I'd try and do a few extra vlogs
where I can so I thought I'd blog this
weekend maybe excuse if I look a bit
funny
I've got really infected I long story
short my kind of eczema turned into a
cut because I aged it so much and the
cut turned into an eye infection so this
whole left eye is just not having a
great time recently but anyway this
morning I'm going over to see my friend
Hannah I actually gave her the
manuscript to my book early before it's
even been edited because I wanted her to
read through it I wanted to have a
different perspective on it to make sure
I didn't kind of miss anything big out
or whether anything kind of really
offended her or if she thinks anyone I
spoke about would be offended anything
like that and I also just think it's
really nice because she's that sort of
friend to me who would read through my
book before I publish it so she did that
on a work trip last week she had a
couple of long flights where she could
read it and I'm gonna go over there this
morning and she's gonna give me her
feedback just like a little bit scary
actually because this is the first
person who's read it he wasn't my editor
so I'm a little bit nervous but she did
say she found me quickly yesterday just
to say she loved it but she's gonna give
me more details today so I'm going over
to do that here haven't got many plans
this weekend which is nice actually
we've still got so much to do around the
house I really need to empty this box
I've just it which always has a go at me
because I always like nearly finish a
job but then don't and this box has just
been left here so I need to go through
that I'm wearing this jumper today which
is from next and then if you can see it
but it's like a cream white jumper with
these cute little bobbles on I really
really like it it's really soft and it's
kind of high neck I have it in red as
well I'm gonna go downstairs see if
there's anything for breakfast oh my god
I'm actually really really late so I was
gonna open my advent calendar I've got
the Liberty one and the Jo Malone one
but I think I'll do it when I get back
by the way guys these are the best
things I've ever owned if you have
someone you want to buy a really nice
Christmas present for these are the
August Lipper's there from fig leaves
but they have like a proper soul so
they're kind of just like shoes to wear
around the house I absolutely love them
I'm obsessed I'm taking a banana with me
for the road
yep I have magic Christmas on full-time
at the moment it's weird to be driving
to Hannah's because we have always lived
we grew up living next door to each
other and then we both moved out we
moved two minute walk from each other so
now to actually be driving there is a
bit weird but it's like a 15 minute
drive so it's fine oh my god it's so
cold in here I just quickly popped in to
wait chose to get some eggs and avocado
and toast to have for breakfast at
Hannah's with Hannah obviously and
picked her up some flowers as well to
say thank you let's put together a yummy
breakfast for us thank you don't show
you my dirty kit I won't
okay I rush back home I'm now with this
one and we're heading over to my parents
house we're going to go to Putney and
we're going to have some lunch and then
we're going to a place called
Arlo and Jacob it's a really nice safer
brand and repair to their showroom which
is there and test out one of their
snugglers which is what they call like a
loveseat and also even look a chair for
my office they very kindly invite to be
down to show to have a little look so
we're going to test out some sophism to
be fun we're actually happy with our old
sofa which we got from multi-org we
thought when we moved we'd have to get
bigger one but for some reason it fits
perfectly fine I don't know how we fare
that so for enough flat but it seems
sort of like growing or something and I
think now that we're facing the TV it's
not uncomfortable in the flat were you
like always have to look to the side so
we're really happy with our multi or the
sofa we're just gonna get something a
bit more interesting and more a
statement piece forward the loveseat
concept basically the Jukes head which
is right by the river there's loads of
people rowing you can watch other rowers
which is really cool just by the river
we're gonna walk over that bridge to the
Arlo and Jacobs showroom I want these
windows oh my gosh safe heaven we're
looking at this chair we're trying to
side between this velvet all the rows
very hard because we have a pink pouf
coming and we're gonna have navy walls
eventually snuggler and I saw online I
really really liked it was just as comfy
as I'd hoped it was
and I think we're gonna get it in like a
really bright blue velvet and look what
we just found rude health cafe I didn't
even know it existed
I'm gonna go see what's inside I got a
locker because I wanted a hot chocolate
but they said that it's really rich not
a fan of rich hot chocolates fabulous
business markets we're gonna have a look
yeah it's Christmas tree time there's a
snow machine
here we're home and I've opened my Dairy
Milk advent calendar which my sister got
for me and you just managed to pick out
from her so I had two days to open which
is exciting and now I'm gonna open my jo
Malone and Liberty advent calendar let's
see today's actually the second this
vlog is gonna go up a little late
where's number two number two is up here
Oh orange blossom this is a good one to
mix with other scents
that's right excited I'm gonna put them
back and keep them in here okay I'm
gonna open up my Liberty one number two
is here today in the Liberty advent
calendar I've got a Dermalogica daily
super folio rich it's gonna love this
I don't really use products like this
but ritual okay we're having baked
potatoes for dinner very glamorous it's
X Factor final I think my friend might
be on Strictly tonight I heard a rumor
around my family and so I'm gonna go
wash my hair because it's very greasy
and Oh morning it's Sunday
we're in same jump resister day but in
rent also we woke up very excited this
morning because I like 8:30 the doorbell
went and our Christmas tree has arrived
we got a Christmas tree delivered this
year which is great because our car
isn't big enough to carry one anyway and
the lovely people at pines and needles
offered to send us a tree I mean we were
gonna get one anyway but it was just so
exciting because they supply like all
the celebs with their trees and stuff
but we got a seven-foot tree and we got
it to come with lights you know you can
get pines and needles to decorate your
tree as well but I love decorating the
tree so I just got them to come with a
stand and lights and I haven't actually
seen it yet cuz I was upstairs rich went
down to do it but it's the perfect
height rich we can just cut the back and
hopefully it will like slot in way
better in that corner it's still gonna
stick out but I love it oh my god the
lights look great
we're gonna be so careful though cutting
it and not cutting the lights we need to
get a tree top but I hate the skinny
part at the top of the tree it freaks me
out but they they put lights on this you
oh I love it it smells oh no it smells
so good
what good tree I'm heading out now
because I'm going to my friend s Jays
for brunch with our friend Jenny it was
her 30th maybe like a month ago we
missed it but we've got a present to
give her so we're having a little
birthday brunch and then I'm gonna come
back oh I need to go to John Lewis to
change our tree skirt because it was too
small for our massive tree and I need to
buy a Christmas present for someone and
then we're gonna decorate this absolute
monster over here rich is convinced that
the people who delivered the tree are
elves because they came in they did it
all so quickly and they asked for tea
with loads of sugar you know how like
little elves like really sweet things
he's convinced yeah yeah oh yeah I'm
gonna have my advent calendar where's
number three no man I'm actually I'm not
gonna block this I feel like everyone's
blocking their advert calendar and it's
getting really boring already oh my god
in the Liberty one today there's an
hourglass lipstick that is amazing that
is such a great one look it's like a
travel-size crunchy thing we finished
eating and we're facetiming quiche it's
like 7:00 in the morning for her if
brunch was really really nice and now me

the tree skirt and then go to another
shop as well we've put the new John
Lewis Christmas tree skirt on it looks
so good
and I'm gonna decorate the tree I can't

34th Street on the TV but I might put
some Christmas music on all my

pretty
so like something kind of subtle battery

so are these and also there's some like
droplets in the white company got a
couple of these from Liberty and I've
put the year on the bottom so we can get
some nice ones every year these are also
the white company these are key key K
and so are the snowmen there should be
some snowmen somewhere yeah like they're
I haven't got a topper I'm not sure if I
need one on this tree might get one I
think then it's really nice and with the
base as well very happy with that okay
