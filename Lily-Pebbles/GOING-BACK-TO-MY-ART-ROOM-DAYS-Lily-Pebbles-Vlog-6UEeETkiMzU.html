morning today and we're up pretty early
actually for a Saturday 9 o'clock now
we've got off at 8 because we're going
to a place called carousel it's own
restaurant in Marylebone in London and
they do these kind of workshops every
now and again and I was invited to go
and do one with a plus one so I actually
was going to it my friend Esther day but
she couldn't come so which is coming
with me and it you get lunch at carousel
and then it's pottery making workshop
I can't wait I've always wanted to make
pottery like on one of spinny things it
looks so satisfying looks pretty hard
but I really want to make of ours if
they'll let me and rich is going to come
he wants to make a mug I also most like
is this girly thing or can my husband
come and they'll like it's fine so I'm
just picturing like ghost is going to be
very romantic they told us not to wear
clothes we love which is hard because I
love with my clothes but I'm just
wearing like a white t-shirt actually
that's probably not good I do
I think whatever I wear will probably
get clay on it and hopefully it'll come
out in the wash so I'm just grabbing a
bit of breakfast now and we're going to
chew bit into town but is the work
towards from like 10:00 till 3:00 it's
really long we work go to park for that
long so doing something a little bit
different today which would be nice and
I'm going to bring you guys along with
me we're in town it's nice and quiet
on Oxford Street it's 10:00 a.m. how
much you looking forward to making your
month
I'm really excited actually I hope they
let you make a mask if you can set on
this idea a few days now you make one
what kind of monk I'm thinking okay
you can't die no one without handle like
a Japanese queen yeah I like those guys
I want to paint a gray room round the
clock and then like I don't know if it's
into same theme I hope it does I want to
make like the bars like silver bars is
buying like anthropology and there's
like a bit rough around the edges and
not perfect
that's my plan I'm really looking
forward to lunch there as well so
welcome to to learn we've got 20 minutes
okay take 20 minutes if then I literally
turn left the cut through so Google Maps
intelligent mind if I do is carousel you
need to get downstairs
these are the colors pick from
after the campaigns across I'm stinking
going to the dusty roads to much - well
how you feeling about this well Jenna
would make choices supposed to be doing
is rolling out this play to get used to
it a little like Jessie I think I'm
going to make a hard to myself and the
past around Emily my grandma the bus
they coming up speculation on watching
Oh
dr. by making some coasters this
offering precious events or profound
failure to make don't you wait
applause
don't you
Oh
you're on
so I made this little thing as like a
practical one and then I'm going to
attempt to resolve this of the luggage
instead to carousel laureates fill my
lungs but I had a delicious bacon family
that I pitched the bread lovely drew so
yummy and some yummy luckily it has now
Oh
veteran attempt ever the second thing I
made little mark and really happy about
that was really fun I mean it was like a
full-on day workshop I feel like I
wasn't one of those like some accounts I
used to go when I was a kid she said I
was very good at it she said I was a
natural and I just did also go on wish I
had one of these wheels and when I left
is like you should really think about
getting or under suspect the imagine
like no rumors or floods can have a
little pottery clay wheel it would be
going though one day just a dream it was
actually really nice so right now you
can make your own bowls a finger this
Irish yeah I made a bath my grandma is
not only ready for two weeks and her
birth it would have been by then I don't
mean think that through it wasn't made a
plan top to myself smarter and see all
the random things it was really really
enjoyable apparently they're like
stopping doing all kind of pottery
ceramics cool I think they should bring
it back it's so calming and you can't
look your phone what to do in it so I
just think it's great to let me try it
what do you work stopped if you haven't
yet we're going to wander back up stalks
the surface via a few shot I just came
with M&amp;amp;A and I found a jacket and it was
actually I was looking for like a long
trench style camel it's like a little
bit more Brown than I would have liked
but I think it's cool maybe I'll show
you when I get back which is trying on a
black denim just
never worn one before we're going to be
and if you can pull off you own jeans
and I love you can do it jeans but let's
see riches on the handful of coffee
we're going to one of his favorites in
London workshop they do good apple
muffins tubes we're going to go into a
detox kitchen for a quick cute shop I've
got for a bright and beautiful with
beetroot celery carrots and thank you
present and j.crew and they have such a
good soups or the cuties though who
described as good so so similar I don't
know how much is 128 pounds
this is denied you chew on my book right
and this is the one from j.crew so so
similar I could find I really like the
one in yellow that's really cool
seriously considering getting the yellow
one so I would never ever like buy
designer bag in a bright colored cebiche
scared so this is like similar to my
Gucci office but my favorite bag
actually a big buff that might fit my
big camera and it's yellow very happy in
sunshiny hmm which is the new DG which
is Isis genius and I didn't realize it's
like world Mother's Day or some makes
that all the records pendant record
shops that people like having partied
outside absolutely crazy outside the
shop
what's going on outside here
we're walking down Piccadilly Circus to
get them achieve their because I'm
secretly hoping that crosstown donut is
open inside they are the best oh not
right guys I am home and today it's felt
like a really long day actually it feels
like days ago that we did the pottery
class because we kind of came out
carousel is near Selfridges and we
walked up Oxford Street and just went
into all the shops that we fancied along
the way to get to Piccadilly Circus but
we actually did quite a lot shopping we
weren't planning on doing it at all
which was in like a really weird patient
mood which is different and he doesn't
anything now we're like when I used to
try and clothes he'd just be like you
know or like no and now is that yeah we
like that and I don't know if it's a
good thing because I end up buying
everything so I bought quite a lot of
things but one of the things I bought
was a coat from M&amp;amp;S house the first
thing I got today I mentioned it to you
guys earlier I've been looking for a
long trench coat for ages and I saw this
one that's a bit different and I love
the shape of it I'm just not sure if I
love the color or not I really really
like it I'm going to try it on for you
but the reason I'm not sure is because
it's a bit more Brown it's less like
camel and it's kind of more brown like
I've actually brown missi poor they're
limited edition range such good quality
is quite fake which i think is a good
thing because there were some like
thinner trenches I tried on and Zara
it's definitely more like spring summer
coat I'm not sure this is too thick
first of all they didn't have my size
which is probably a 10 or 12 this is an
8 but it does fit me so though now
wearing it with a jumper definitely
feels closer than when I was wearing it
with a t-shirt this one looks like I
really like the shape of it put these
little singles on the shoulders and just
cuddle up hell I don't know kind of roll
up the sleeves and it's really long
which i think is really cool I really
like the pockets like really big pockets
with these body kind of circle things I
like that that's kind of the back to
concerned of the colour and the sickness
of it whether it's too thick the warmer
it gets am I actually going to wear it
I'm going to trial again tomorrow with
some other clothes and make a decision
not sure I bought some really cool bits
from j.crew I got the bag in yellow and
I got a red and white stripe atop and
this really nice kind of beachy jumpsuit
I thought would be gifts what I'm going
to listen in
a month tonight we're going to go to
some sushi with some friends oh I got
know about mrs. Jess as well sorry I got
this dress because I saw Jean wearing it
and it looked like the most flattering
dress ever I got it the medium it was
quite fitted but I kind of liked it it
showed us my waist a little bit so I got
that too anyway we're going to sushi
with some friends I haven't had sushi in
ages some ridic first for that I'm going
to pop into my parents first to swap my
pure box that's about all I've got to
