a chatty makeup routine get ready with
me style video because tonight is the
glamour Woman of the Year awards I'm
going with Manuka doctor and some of my
blogging YouTube friends so I'm really
excited for it I've started to get ready
early as anyone o'clock I'm getting
picked up at 5:00 but I thought it would
be nice to just casually sit here and
get ready with you guys but I am using a
few new products I've got Jacqueline
Hills new Becker products here that I'm
gonna try for the first time and yeah
I'm wearing a needle and thread dress
which is a navy blue really embellished
dress so I'm just gonna do like glowy
skin a lot of highlighter and then like
some kind of smokey eye and a nude lip
I'm gonna start by putting on some lip
balm because my lips actually really
sore at the moment ever since I went
camping they've been so dry and I think
I'm gonna tie up my hair as well because
that is gonna get annoying by never look
good with my hair tied up so just ignore
this please I love these like invisible
hair ties they're so good I've already
got a little bit of fake tan on from
last night and I'm gonna start with the
Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow which is a
really nice glowy primer you just want
my skin to it really hydrated so as much
glow as possible primer done and for my
foundation I'm going to use the Tarte
rainbow of the sea foundation with my
damp with Beauty Blender I'm really
really enjoying this foundation at the
moment I'm just gonna give it a little
shake I usually put about one pump on
the back of my hand and then dust it all
over my face I might put a little bit
extra on just so it lasts the whole
evening I absolutely love the finish of
this foundation and then I'm very gently
and slowly taking my time to just really
bounce that into the skin and blend
a little bit onto my eyelids as well
I've got a little bit left on my hand so
I'm just gonna go over some areas that
you do with a little bit more coverage
now I'm going to take my Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and this has so
much coverage in it I love it it really
finishes off my base perfectly so I'm
going to apply that under the eye quite
a lot under the eye down my nose around
my nose on my chin and I have blemishes
and then I'm going back to the sponge
and doing exactly the same thing just
patting that into the skin
when I'm going under the eye I just push
it in using the pointed corner and take
it over my lip so it's all blended even
let me know what you guys think of the
white background I've never done this
before in a video but if I need a change
today so let me know what you think of
it I'm now going to set my concealer and
foundation with the road I'll instaglam
compact the luxe banana powder you know
take it this a bit on my brush and just
sweep that under the eyes very lightly
so don't move everything around too much
a little bit on my chin okay now I'm
gonna go onto my face I know people
usually do eyes first but I prefer to do
my face so I'm gonna start with if I
could open it up bronzer this is from
Too Faced and it's their milk chocolate
Soleil bronzer I'm just gonna warm up my
skin a little bit so it matches my body
well then my dress is long sleeve but
I'm gonna have my legs out
just taking out on the outer parts of
the face
it's very subtle but it just warms up my
skin a little bit before I'm going to
contour I'm now gonna take my Kat Von D
shade and light palette and using the I
think the far left lightest contour
shade I'm going to contour the cheeks a
little bit more
I'm now going to use the Becca champagne
pot put in the cream version I am going
to use a powder as well but I just
wanted to try this out because I just
bought it for Sephora and arrived
yesterday so this is part of jacqueline
hills new champagne pop collection she
started with the just champagne pop the
highlighter and ashes brought out a
shadow palette a face palette a liquid
highlighter and this cream highlighter
and I love the Becca cream highlighters
they're really good if you have slightly
more mature skin when your skin starts
to age Korean products are so good and
this highlighter is just beautiful and
subtle so I'm just going to try this out
and then I'll put more on top afterwards
so I'm just running my finger in there
and then just tapping it on to the tops
of my cheekbones and I find that the
cream formula really meshes into the
skin so well I think this could act as a
really nice base actually to make sure
my highlighter lasts my nose so that is
the cream highlighter and I would
definitely recommend that if you are
slightly more afraid of highlighters
this one's a bit more subtle okay now
I'm gonna take the Jaclyn hill champagne
collection face palette I'm so excited
to try this out
it comes in beautiful gold packaging is
absolutely gorgeous picture of
Jacqueline on the back so I'm just gonna
open this up and show you guys up a
palette looks like it is white and it
says back Becca Jaclyn hill is so pretty
and it feet you can see compared to my
hand and inside it has three blushes a
really shimmery pink blusher a more
nudie brown blusher a bright pink and
then champagne pop which is her original
highlighter and Prosecco pop which is
her new one it slightly more yellowy
they I'm gonna just put a tiny bit of
the pink one just see how pink it really
is first of all
they're very pigmented you really don't
need much tool I'm going to use some of
the shimmery pink one I think that looks
so pretty I'm going to take that
slightly higher
and then using the slightly smaller
brush this is the morphe M 501 that that
I bought when I was in New York but I'm
so glad I bought it it's incredible for
highlighter I think I'm gonna mix
champagne pop and particular pop why not
and taking that onto my cheekbones oh my
gosh it's so glowy I feel like if
there's ever a time to go overboard with
your highlighter it's probably tonight
so I'm just going with it
like the blusher didn't blend out that
well for my brows I'm going to use some
of the new benefit brow products I'm
going to use the precisely my brow
pencil which is quite similar to the
sort of shape I usually use it's got a
spoolie on one end and a little thin
pencil on the other so I'm just going to
brush through my brows I know that my
brow hairs are really long they always
have been but if you trim them it makes
it overall Brown look thinner so I try
not to unless there's any that are
really really much longer than the rest
so I'm just filling in the front part of
the brow
I'm then going to use benefits Ready Set
brow which is a clear setting brow gel
and I always like to do this step as the
hairs and my brows are quite long so
they tend to move around okay let's go
into the eyes and then start by priming
my eyelids with the Urban Decay primer
potion they shouldn't need priming
because I've got concealer on there and
powder but I haven't used these
eyeshadows before so I'm not sure how
much they crease I'm gonna put a tiny
bit of this on each lid for my
eyeshadows I'm gonna use the Becca and
Jaclyn hill pie shadow palettes I really
like these long eyeshadow palettes
because they're really easy to put in
your makeup bag and in this one you get
you get five eyeshadows they look like
this the one very light and shimmery
probably won't use that one as much
maybe in my inner corner
this one looks gorgeous for all over the
lid a bit like map all the glitters but
more it kind of looks like champagne pop
as an eyeshadow a light mode which would
be lovely for the crease a warm Brown
again for that outer part of the eye or
the crease would look so nice and then
the kind of dark plum these are all
colors that I would absolutely wear all
the time I'm very exciting I'm gonna
start with the champagne pop kind of
color is it actually called good
champagne toast that color fits them on
the brush and tap it off they feel very
creamy and then apply that all over the
lid that is a really nice color I'm not
getting much full done either they apply
it really nicely
did same on the other eye
I think that's such a nice shake I'm
gonna take the middle movie shade and
apply that to the crease and outer part
of the eye
then I'm also going to take some of that
brown
now taking a big fluffy brush I'm just
going to blend out that edge this brush
has nothing on it so it's just for
blending don't know whether to take any
of the dark purple shade I feel like I
should take a little bit just want to
see what they will like you know a
little bit of this amount of corner
I like the color of this one doesn't
apply quite as smoothly as the others
but that does add a nice deep nurse and
then I'm going to take some of that move
color underneath the eye I always like
to add a little bit of eyeliner so I'm
taking my favorite eyeliner I can't use
anything else at the moment because I
love this too much it's the Mac
groundbreaker
eyeliner I feel like I must be coming to
the end of this soon I'm gonna apply
that very close to the lash line but it
will just give a real thick lash effect
this is the Charlotte Tilbury legendary
lashes which is not great if you have
hay fever or your eyes run a lot but
it's so so good for giving thick long
lashes so I'm just gonna coat that I
mean hardly any effort is required with
this mascara it's incredible I wish I
could get this effect with the
waterproof mascara but every waterproof
mascara I've ever tried has just been so
subtle on my lashes it makes them look
so thin I can never get that sort of
thickness with a waterproof mascara so
I'm also gonna take a tiny bit of the
Clinique lower lash mascara I like to
kind of press it into the lashes rather
than stroke them down because always
they get too long so I wanted to wear my
Kylie Jenner lip kit in Kok okay no
candy K but I'm actually sitting on a
table tonight with Kourtney Kardashian
which is so exciting I just thought oh
my god if I have to take my lipstick out
and reapply feel like that's so cringe
to be like using a Kylie lipstick when
her sisters seem right there I don't
know why that just feels really
embarrassing to me so instead I'm gonna
go for the Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat
lip pencil and the Anastacio pure
Hollywood liquid lipstick I'm hoping
this won't budge all night sometimes I
just want to get a bit of a white streak
inside but because it's new just quite
easy to wipe away and reapply
I'm slightly over drawing on my lips
but really what the liner does is just
tidy up the outer edge ok liner done and
now I'm just going to apply the liquid
lipstick this one's really watery so I
like to do it in like two thin layers
it always comes out very nude at first
and then it dries down a bit darker
so look how crazy nude it looks it looks
far too pale for me first and then when
it dries it dries a bit more down I'm
going to spray on a bit of the urban
decay makeup setting spray I always feel
like when I'm wearing as much makeup it
gets a little bit like heavy and this
just slightly yusin's it all a little
bit okay so that is my makeup done and
now I need to figure out what to do with
my hair
it is a high-neck long-sleeve dress so I
could have it up with like bits coming
out and just not very good at doing hair
things so it won't be anything fancy
then maybe I could do like a couple of
Platts and a low bun and then a few bits
or I could curl the whole thing and just
wear it down okay I'm just gonna attempt
something so I'm going to leave a bit of
hair at the front kind of hard to do it
without a mirror a bit of hair there
and keeping those bits for the front to
lead out
okay I'm just gonna plot these bits back
normal plot nothing fancy
I'm taking out the hair at the back and
as I pull that a hair back I'm taking
the hair bands out of the plats I'm
aware this is nothing fancy I'm terrible
at hair and then I'm just twisting that
into a bun on the back and then I'm
going to take this out so now you can
see the plats on the side that's and
then I'm just gonna split this into a
few pieces I'm going to curl them away
from my face using my straightness so
I'm just twisting it away from my face
and gradually pulling it down
and then the back pieces I like to just
kind of keep behind my ear and the front
pieces and kind of hang I don't know
what does that look like think I'm going
to leave it like that for now and let's
see how it looks with my dress and then
decide whether to keep my hair like this
or not sorry that was like the worst
hair tutorial ever hands up I am NOT a
hairdresser I am terrible with her but I
hope you guys like the makeup I'm going
to paint my nails and toes now because
they are bare and they need some nail
polish I decided to go for a bluey gray
color to complement my dress and I
started by using the Sally Hansen base
coat before applying nails Inc winter
lilac which is one of my all-time
favorite nail polish shades
I applied two coats of this before
setting it all in place with the Seche
vite top coat
I took with me my Topshop clutch and
inside I had my keys my phone and
charger my mirror my travel card and
cards my liquid lipstick and my vlogging
camera this is my needle and thread
dress I really love what it looks like
the arms are slightly uncomfortable but
I think it's worth it such a pretty
dress and I paired that with my Topshop
heels okay I'm ready and the cab's gonna
be here any minute now so I just thought
I'd show you the full outfit so I've
left my hair how I did it I feel like
it's fine it works I've put in some new
earrings that I bought the weekend which
you can't really see so I'm gonna get a
cab to the London Edition Hotel and
Anna's actually staying there so I'll
probably pop up to her room first and
then we are having drinks with Manuka
doctor and then going to the awards and
having dinner and sitting on the same
table as Kourtney Kardashian and I think
it's gonna be a really fun night so I'll
definitely try and get some clips for
you guys and I hope you enjoy coming
