get ready with me for a date night and
I'm doing this video with very exclusive
which is a brand new website if you
follow me on Twitter or Instagram then
you may have seen around a month ago I
did a photoshoot with Fleur Ali and
Victoria and we had a photo shoot with
ranking it was the most incredible day I
swear I will never forget that day
ranking is an incredible photographer
and we got to dress up in very exclusive
clothes and do a little Posey thing I
haven't got around to printing the
photos yet I am going to but I will
insert a few here so you can see because
I was really happy with them it's kind
of different to my usual style but it
was really fun to kind of play dress-up
so very salut Civ is a new site and it's
mix of luxury fashion and they have
beauty as well the whole website's very
chic and clean is very my style very
easy to navigate and they kindly sent me
some beauty bits to use in this video
and also lent me some fashion items so I
can show you we rolled wear to a date
night I was actually really impressed
with the delivery they use collect plus
so it's free delivery and returns and it
came in this really cute little bag with
like bright pink which I like and the
beauty stuff came in these little things
that have like bubble wrap in them
that's such a random thing to point out
it's obviously my weird kind of OCD in
me but they kept them all compact and
they didn't break and I was just really
impressed with that randomly so as I
said I'm gonna be doing a get ready with
me for a date night and I'm wearing a
dress which is a little bit different
for me so I really hope you guys enjoy
this I'll see you in my next video and
cue the music
