different video today so let me explain
I'm in a hotel room in France and I
thought I would show you guys my kind of
morning routine I just got off the
shower I've got dressed I've done my
hair but I haven't done anything else
I'm going to show you my morning
skincare routine and my fave simple
summer makeup routine so to uncover the
bathroom I'll go do it
I'll just keep my finger I'm just going
to kiss up my hair I think I always use
in the morning is by derma on my eyes I
don't really know why I do turn into the
morning but on my I like to use just
like a water solution so if you look at
this on contrapositive men just we put
my eyes in the evening I like double
cleanse other and I'm usually Clinique
take the day off
cleansing although you better get rid of
my makeup and then I go over the second
trend but in the morning it just like to
cleanse once I mean some day that it
evens cleanse Baisakhi praia dona at the
moment i'm even with lucky a milky
journey cleanser which is really nice
because it it's kind of like off year
one but a bit less oily it can't explain
it's a very simple cleanser and I really
like it in the morning
I'm not sure why I feel like this kind
of use my skin like a little bit more
glowy I don't know what's in it that
makes it glow but to pay for Oscar to
feel a little bit lighter and you might
be feeling really fresh okay my next
step in the morning is a hydrating serum
at the moment I'm using the dot is
because bounce soon I really like there
are a couple of things I'm not sure
about it you don't get much product in
there so for like I'm already nearly
finished it I got it like a couple of
weeks ago it is very similar to the
ordinary hyaluronic acid which I get you
get a lot more for your money
this one is a little bit more glowy a
little bit more like gloopy and formulas
the only ones much like filler so more
watery but I do really like this our
destiny retouch that I've been using it
in the morning an amazing it is next I'm
so excited about so that I picked up
when I was in New York is 5.2 yacht and
it's the Sarah mijin so this is a cream
there's three productive gel as a liquid
and Abba cream I got the cleaning
formula promises to be cream and this is
so great I be needing it mainly in the
morning because I suppose a bit of a
richer one should over a nightly who
definitely use this for both it's it's a
very simple moisturizer but I call
different like so silky smooth on your
skin it's so crazy hydrating 100%
investor will show that every year's
can't rave about it enough can't get it
in UK but Sephora do ship
internationally so I would definitely
recommend giving it from before I really
love it I don't want any to get every
single day because I'm going out and
quite bright outside then I will put a
layer of SS ask my moisturizer at the
moment I'm using a glossier invisible
shield this is very different any other
SPF of try to usually use the lowest
okay one which is more of a cream thumb
cream and this one is more of a gel it's
very thin iPhone 5 silicone maybe not
unexpected as they should be but you
know it says it's SPF 35 so it should
work and I put like a nice thin layer
like my skin while I'm here I think I've
talked through the product er here but I
don't use in the morning the Clarins
instant eye makeup remover in the
evenings get rid of my eye makeup even
though I have pretended in oil
honestly it I like to remove my makeup
in different steps so I get my own a
couple of first then I did first lensman
I do a second if I'm can't be bothered
and then this is the go Co climbing most
drivers rich which I use in the evening
I mentioned in my haul that it kind of
made my nose go read and react like I
started using it but I completely
stopped around my skin that would be
adjusted and it's just a really nice
very hydrating moisturize it seems to me
you
I'm obviously using my favorite
cosmetics CC cream it's just so easy I
use it at home and when I'm traveling I
mean it really is the only foundation I
wear these days just really light and
glittery next up is the milk flex
concealer I really really love this
concealer I don't know if I got a salty
one or something but mine is empty I've
almost finished it after like two weeks
so I'm going to order another one from
Sephora and see what the deal is but as
long as it just hasn't got like tiny
what a product in it I would really
recommend it because it's a really
lovely concealer as always my Too Faced
milk chocolate bronzer at this point I
always like to do my brows so I've just
realized I fought with me the Becca
backlight primary filter and I forgot to
put it on and I don't have any kind of
highlighter so I'm actually going to
just use like a dot of this and just put
on the top of my cheekbones because it's
basically two types of glowy sorts of
highlight anyway I love a liquid
highlighter I just think it looks so
natural on the skin especially when
you're out in the Sun I select how do we
highlight this would look too much so
blusher and you missed on some benefit
which is California
it's very peachy pink but I really like
you I've been wearing it a lot in summer
well in sane literally just not like
summer good for my eyes and you've been
met Anastasio caramel eyeshadows I
really like this is one of those is like
the new Real Techniques brushes that
like softer things ever to touch your
skin just putting like a really light
layer so and these two silvers brown
eyeliner just on that outer corner okay
to mascara is very extremely because the
weather so hot so I'm going to use my
Clinique high-impact extreme volume
mascara and then just one layer of the
Clinique high-impact water Christmas
gonna just on top to kind of seal it in
I don't use the waterproof wine on its
own because good thing it's as good to
me once Christmas cards I like a bit
more subtle and then I have a few
lipsticks with me like a nude and a red
as you've just got to nude and a red but
I think I'm just going to leave my lips
so now maybe put a bit of lip balm on
sometimes I just like to wait to see how
I feel like after do my makeup so that
was my kind of morning skincare and
makeup routine at the moment just to let
you guys know obviously I changed my
skincare routine up quite a bit and
these are just the things I've been
loving at the moment doesn't mean that I
don't still love the things that I've
recommended before like the off your
native cleansing gel to ordinary
products there's so many other things
that I love at the moment this is my
little edited routine and I'm really
enjoying it so I'm very much good to go
for the day I'm just going to follow
some of the clinic's virtue oil body
messes like an SPF 30 I'm going to put
that on further out in the Sun I'm gonna
grab my ray-bans these are my little
blue foldaway
somewhere else is going to throw those
into my handbag I think today we are
going to explore some lavender fields
which would be really nice so to keep
Islands fulfil me for being a little
videographer I really hope you guys
enjoyed this I'll see you on Wednesday
for my next video
