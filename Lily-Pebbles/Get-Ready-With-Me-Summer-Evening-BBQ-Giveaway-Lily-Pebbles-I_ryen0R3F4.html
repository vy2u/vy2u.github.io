I'm going to be doing a get ready with
me for a summer evening BBQ start off
I'm just gonna tie my hair up and then
get on with the base which is gonna be
the soap &amp;amp; Glory SPF 50 this is a really
nice lightweight SPF and it works really
well as a moisturizer for foundation I'm
going to use the Charlotte Tilbury
light wand oh it's really gorgeous
lightweight light enhancing and has a
beautiful finish I'm going to use my
favorite NARS concealer in vanilla and
just place this under the eyes on my
chin and around my nose
I'm gonna use a mix of fingers and my
Real Techniques setting brush to blend
it in
for a bit of bronzer I'm going to use my
body shop bronzer in shade 2 this is a
really nice matte bronzer so you can use
it for contouring or for a nice bronze
all over
for blusher I'm using my favorite
benefit blusher which is coralista in
some really pretty peach
to neaten up my brows I'm going to use
my hourglass arch brow definer and just
fill in the front parts and then going
to set it in place with this not so
clear brow gel to make sure my eyeshadow
last all evening because it is going to
be warm I'm going to use the Urban Decay
primer potion all over the lid
and to brighten up the eyes I'm going to
use a nude eyeliner just in the
waterline where things can sometimes get
a little bit red so now on to eyeshadow
and I'm going to be using the Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette and if you want to
win this stay tuned because I will be
doing a giveaway at the end of the video
first Shane I'm going to use is nuna and
I'm going to use this all over the lid
and then going to use the shade liar
which is a quite a similar shade that
this one is shimmery
smoked it up a bit and then used factory
which is a darker shimmery shade and
just use this in the outer corners
and then I'm also going to take nuna
under the eye
and then use dark side with a small
angled brush as an eyeliner
you can hold a cotton wool pad under
your eye to prevent any fool down for my
lashes I'm going to use the Maybelline
falsies big eyes mascara and this is
really nice because it's a two-room one
there's one brush for the upper lashes
and then the other side has a smaller
brush for the lower lashes for my lips
I'm going to use my favorite nude
lipstick which is Mac patisserie and
this works really nice at the smoky eye
layered on top I'm going to use my Tanya
burr lip gloss in cheek
sometimes I like to go back and blend
the eyeshadow in just a little bit more
and that's the makeup done for my town I
use the sachet pray Express tan is the
first time I've tried it and I'm really
impressed so far
I'm then gonna use my DHD straightness
just to add a bit of movement into my
hair nothing too curly Jess it's not
polka straight look at that face pure
enjoyment can you tell I didn't I can
through my hair I'm also going to use a
bit of hairspray to set it all in place
and try not to choke so that's the hair
and makeup done perfume I'm gonna wear
is the Joe Malone with sage and sea salt
and this is a new launch that's coming
out in September and I'm completely
obsessed with it and from my outfit I'm
wearing my Oasis two-piece the theme of
the night was green so this is pretty
green
