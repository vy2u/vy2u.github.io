me video a weekend edition so I really
hope you enjoy it
the first thing I do after brushing my
teeth is head downstairs breakfast
and on this particular day I just
fancied a bit of toast and peanut butter
and it's Skippy all the way it's the
only one I like
they then head back upstairs for a
shower and on this day I wash my hair
using the Fito clarifying detox shampoo
to get would have put up build up and my
L'Oreal ever reach conditioner which is
really good to add any moisture back
that's been stripped out after coming
out the shower I use my Kiehl's creme
default soy milk and honey whipped body
butter which is amazing in luxurious
it's then time for my morning skincare
routine and on this day I kept it pretty
simple using my radical hydrating
cleanser my caudally great water hydra
neuron for a serum and origins ginseng
as a moisturizer whilst I'm waiting for
my hair to dry naturally I just checked
my phone for any Twitter updates or
Instagram I then just straighten my hair
using my ghd's
then it's time for makeup start by
clipping my hair back out of my face
and then take my Neutrogena SPF 55 and
use it as a primer as well
foundation I'm using vital EMU aqua in
b20 which is a really lovely foundation
and I can use my hands to blend it in
and it gives you really nice natural
finish but with good coverage
for concealer I'm using my makeup
forever full cover and just using my
ring finger to dab that into the eye
area or just keep pressing it until it
blends if I need to I sometimes take the
Real Techniques brush to just blend it
in and then if I need any more I just
add a bit with my finger I'm also taking
that down my nose around my nose where
there's some redness and onto my chin
and just blending that out using my
finger bronzer I'm using my NARS Laguna
and publisher I'm using my Tarte
Amazonian clay blush in natural beauty
it comes out really bright on camera but
it's not that bright in real life if you
do want to blend it in though I just use
my bronzer brush that was using earlier
and just go it over it to set that one
in place I use my hourglass ambient
lighting powder in dim light and there's
a really soft brush from Real Techniques
I then use my Mac brow sets to keep my
eyebrows in place I'm growing them out
so they're a bit crazy at the moment and
my Smashbox lid primer over my lid just
to keep all my eyeshadow in place
before I start my eyeshadow I'm going to
line my waterline with this Rimmel nude
eyeliner and this is really good to just
brighten up your eyes and get rid of any
redness and for my eyeshadows I'm going
to use this wet and wild palette and I'm
going to use this shade all over the lid
this brown shade in the crease and this
highlight shade in the inner corners I
like to use a more defined brush for the
crease and it's really easy to just work
it in and make the outer corners
slightly darker I'm also taking this
under the eye for a bit of definition
then using my finger I add the highlight
color now for mascara I'm going to use
my Tom Ford ultralink mascara I really
like this it's just so easy to apply and
gives really long lashes but they don't
look too over-the-top
and for my lips I'm just using the baby
lips on Maybelline and cherry and it's a
really nice red pink it's lovely to
bright still really moisturizing and
good for the daytime and that's makeup
done
for perfume I'm gonna be wearing my dip
teak for the circus which is a really
nice fake on my nails is nails inc Queen
Victoria streets and my rings are from
River Island I'm also wearing my Michael
Kors runway watch which is from ASOS
these are my comfiest ever boots from
Hudson I wear them all the time and I
actually really like that they're quite
distressed now
so that's me ready and wearing my
ray-ban Wayfarers my Topshop leather
jacket my Topshop dress and my Michael
Kors bag
I really hope you enjoyed this thanks
for watching and here's me trying to
wave but failing miserably no do that
again but sorry so I've got five or six
beauty favorites this month and then at
the end of the video I'm going to talk
about a couple of random favorites so
don't forget to watch too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
