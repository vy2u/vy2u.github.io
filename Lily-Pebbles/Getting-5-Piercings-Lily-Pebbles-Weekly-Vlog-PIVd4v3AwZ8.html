dirty hair is tied up because I'm going
to the hairdresser this morning so
excuse me for that but I'm just going to
get ready for the day and I thought I'd
show you what makeup I'm doing I'm in
the mood for doing nice makeup do you
ever just feel like when you feel a bit
gross I've had like a really weird week
so far I just want to play around and
make my makeup look nice especially
because my hair is not nice for my base
I've used the makeup forever radiant
primer in yellow Estee Lauder CC cream
mixed with the NARS sheer glow my
concealer I've used the H&amp;amp;M concealer in
vanilla which I quite like not the best
ever but quite good like cheaper
talented to the urban decay one and the
makeup forever for a cup of concealer
and then I set that all with my Chanel
powder just because my skin too can be
weird the moments this will give a
little bit more coverage my color I've
used soap &amp;amp; Glory soda powder bronzer
tart and blusher in exposed and the
Becca Jaclyn hill champagne pop
highlighter for my eyes I'm going to use
the Tom Ford quad in orchid haze which
is a beautiful like light pink and
purple shades then use this clinic Brown
muscle food slimmer sable eyeliner on
the top and the bottom and the Clinique
high-impact waterproof mascara and on my
lips I'm using Mac fast play which is
very pretty
okay so this is what my makeup looks
like today my hair still terrible I'm
going straight to the dry by dry by I
think it's called that I feel my when I
get there it's more to the street and
nail to the circus I'm going to give a
quick wash and blow-dry because you
probably know if you follow me on
snapchat I had a mole removed but my
back yes but I don't have five stitches
so wish my hair is a bit of a pain and I
just thought it would be easier and a
good opportunity to try it out oh my god
I've just realised that this plant is
proper dyeing crap I need to water that
okay so I'm going to cook you breakfast
and then go
I'm taking these pills at the moment you
have to take 4 times a day you have to
eat before you take them so I'm having
to eat 4 times a day
I don't even normally eat breakfast at
all so I'm literally forced feeding
myself this vehicle
I'm so not hungry yet ok I'm ready to go
I'm wearing this coat always to get with
the brass code but it's in my Zalando
video a white compy jumper black jeans
flat boots because I need to be
comfortable and my strawberry of
Scotland bag I'm very much looking
forward to getting my hair blue out and
feeling clean ok the tube was absolutely
packed it's horrible but I managed to
find a stylist magazine which made it a
bit more bearable I'm just trying to
find the hairdresser and then I'm going
to sit read a magazine and have someone
else wash my hair which is just the best
thing
really okay I'm out and I'm very happy
my hair looks like me which is basically
what you want really and I felt very
Rapson in there you know you go to
hairdressers and it just was a hair on
my lens again you know you get to
hairdressers and it's a bit manic and
loud and hot I hate that about
hairdressers and that place is
completely relaxing they're really
friendly and nice I do find that blow
dry bars better if you have naturally
straight hair they don't always get
curly hair because the whole point of a
blow dry bars is really quick but curly
hair isn't really quick so that's the
only thing won't move us the road but
yeah I'm really happy with the finished
look and the lady was really nice and
it's in Topshop and I've been looking
for these Steve Madden boots everywhere
just leave go online up
but I need new black and Topshop custom
they come in all sizes America somewhere
i6u speech I'm now I'm just going to
walk along to Bond streets because I'm
going to the Chanel spring/summer press
event or just spring maybe and it's so
weird to be looking at spring products
when isn't even Christmas yet but they
do it so far in advance because
magazines were pretty fun I just went
into the Phoenix on Bond Street store
through the beauty department and it was
to put a blog in there but they've
redone the beauty department that's
amazing like the most relaxed nicest Mac
clouds ever and it just moved everything
around put on a really nice place is
very pleasurable to shopping so if
you're ever near Bond Street go to the
big fittings there but I actually think
it might be better than myself just
physically now forgot to vlog I just
went into spacing K to get the laura
mercier setting powder I really want to
try it the loose one and a mini or
bowdry texturizing spray for my handbag
now I'm going to walk back up dose
there's something at the - poem I think
I might try and find Christmas jumper
along the way okay so I just got home
and I've just really randomly booked in
to get my ears pierced it's afternoon at
like quarter past 5:00 I don't know I've
been thinking about it for ages I used
to have my ears pierced I used to wear
like dangly earrings and then that kind
of phase in my life really passed and I
hated wearing earrings for ages and now
I feel like earrings are back in and
kind of wearing studs are quite cool and
I feel like when I get married I might
want to have like some really nice
earrings in so I'm gonna go get my ears
pierced and my ticks my friend Mars he's
like the only other person I know that
works for herself at the moment and she
said she can be free like five o'clock
so yeah they said I have to pay bit
extra if I want gold studs and I think I
really do because I'm really not a
silver person I might also get this one
changed to be gold I'm bit scared
because I'm the sort of person my ears
get infected quite easily it was such a
pain last time I got and Pierce but I'm
just going to go for it it's like 225
pounds of things I'm going to get I
think either two on
Loeb or three on one and two on the
other I don't know I'm excited so silly
because I have to leave them in six
weeks and I've got so much coming up
over the next six weeks and girl it
really silly with like these like you
know you get those special studs when
you just get ears pierced
I don't know rich thinks I'm mad I just
text him and he's like why are you
trying to put more pain on yourself you
have stitches in your back the legs
still hurt from working out you've got
cramps at the moment I'm like I don't
know but I want to go excited I like
being spontaneous sometimes I've got a
bit of time and so afternoon before I go
and have the piercings and I need to go
down to my local Waitrose to pick up the
John Lewis order I didn't realize that
you've all decided from John Lewis and
they send it to your nearest waitress to
pick up I think that's genius I actually
ordered its baby's birthday tomorrow
didn't know what to get him I suddenly
feel so old the fact that I have no idea
what's like in with the kids these days
I asked Bailey and he was like something
to do with a minion also I couldn't even
know what that is so I decided to get
him a telescope because he's obsessed
with a man on the moon
advert on Lois ad I showed him the clip
on YouTube and Jojo said she came down
the next morning and he was just
watching that advert on repeat so like
on a loop so I got him a telescope like
a proper one kids won but it looks
pretty decent so I'm gonna go pick that
up I need to go to the bank I need to go
and get some Christmas decorations it's
a bit annoying I hate it when people
start prepping for Christmas too early
but because I need to fill my Christmas
gift guides I have to get Christmas
jumper and something to make my video
look Christmassy so I'm hoping that home
base will have some kind of tree or
something that I can put behind me when
I film my Christmas gift cards this
looks exactly like what I need
hello like such a Christmas keno like
buying loads of Christmas decorations
I've spent loads of money on this so I
hope it looks good oh my god my little
Christmas tree back there
I think it's pretty cute actually and
but I do want to get proper Christmas
tree this year so rich is going to be
like why do you have two Christmas trees
but maybe I can give this one to Bailey
going to the bedroom or something so now
I need to go back home and try and
figure out carry all this stuff this
stuff until up by myself I'm just
watching Kasey's blows whilst I hoped my
own paws I was just like setting up some
Christmasy stuff to kind of get an idea
of where I'll sit and I think tomorrow
I'm going to have to just play around
and figure it out but I really like my
little tree outs which is spiky it's
hurting me and these are lights I think
I went too extravagant on the lights
these are like proper industrial lights
but that's a little cushion as well so
let's see what happens of that this is
the present I bought Bailey and let's
turn it the right way around telescope
it says you can probably like see into
the Stars and stuff so when it comes
back a stand I think he'll love it
hopefully so I'm going to wrap that up
now how old is that boy
my body's really young what age is this
408 plus perfect he's going to be six
hey I'm just gonna have some pizza bread
and how much to make sure that I've got
a full stomach when I get me is pissed
that I faint I tend to do that this is
such a weird thing to do but I always
when I open like things but pizza bread
I put it in a sandwich bag because
always if you leave it like that I
thought these bits always hard and
crusty so it's better for like seals and
then it stays fresher for longer so
Scindia I feel like that's such a mom
thing today I'm not a mom okay I'm in
Camden
- Deb's recommended it's where she
always goes to her piercings not allowed
to film masses here hi she's gonna hold
my hand and then I have speak to you
afterwards okay
piercings done three on that side two on
that side and you changed that one for
gold on as well and it did hurt but it
wasn't like terrible I didn't faint like
I did once well now I tells make sure
they don't get infected I remember last
time they got really infected so I'm
gonna try to do that but Mars had a
great time and learning all about the
different periods education there are
some really interesting using what that
people come in and ask for one is called
the triangle and I'm not going to tell
you what it is you can google it if you
really want don't I would not recommend
a little work we're gonna go now I think
I'm gonna take master Yamcha which is
like my favorite favorite place for tea
come back in my car and yet as I was
saying I don't know what I just said
there but it was a really nice
experience to kind of joke around with
him but the guy who owns it causes a
really nice guy and he's been there for
ages so I would really recommend going
to cold steel here's Pierce if you
encounter an order to get anything
pierced my highlight is really showing
in this car light you know I'm gonna go
home now rich I told rich I'll get my
ears pierced um I think he just thought
one in each so he might kill me
hopefully he'll be alright with it um
yeah she didn't have to pierce the kind
of first one because I had them pierced
already I just haven't worn earrings in
like five years
and he said he could just get stuck
easily through that so it kind of felt
like I was just getting three piercings
but I'm excited to have them I think it
suits me nobody know I start the chicken
thighs out too late and they haven't
defrosted and I hate I hate the
chicken in the microwave freaks me out
so we're just gonna go for
tomatoey pasta instead I'm just kind of
flying off the onions and garlic I'm
going to add in some chopped tomatoes we
have a very simple boring dinner but
then tomorrow we can have a yummy
chicken thighs we've just discovered
that the affair season two is on catch
up on our skybox
we're so excited about this so it's just
making tea and we're going to watch like
three episodes
maybe if we have time I'm gonna end the
vlog here well I'm gonna end this day
I'll vlog another day I'm not sure when
Bailey's birthday tomorrow so we're
going to go and have tea I'm going to
give him the present one of my piercings
is looking a little bit bloody so that's
gonna be fun cleaning that tonight and I
will see you guys on another day night
