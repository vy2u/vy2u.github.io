didn't vlog yesterday sorry I had a bit
of a day off my hairdo but I didn't do
much I filmed a video just caught up
with work because I was so ill on
Thursday I didn't realize till the next
day how ill I felt but I felt so much
better yesterday I feel fine now and
back to my normal self so I'm really
happy look who's home nice to have him
home and we're gonna have a fun day out
today today I really want to go to
snappy snaps because I want to basically
look this is our cupboard full of home
videos like look at that it's ridiculous
I've got all my birthdays when I was
little like my first second third fifth
school plays like all this funny stuff
and considering I'm still best friends
now with all my friends when I was like
three four or five like he shares J
Deb's Hannah I've known them ourselves
about three so they're all on these as
well and just think they're so funny and
they're gonna like die said we don't
have a video player anymore
at VHS so I can't watch them we just
about still have a DVD player so I'm
gonna start putting them on DVDs
gradually it's so expensive as snappy
snaps but if I do like one every now and
again I feel like it'll be easier so I'm
gonna pick one now and I think we may go
to snappy snaps get that put on DVD just
get some lunch
I want to go shopping because we're
going out tonight for my friend's
engagement party my friend JC who I
lived it at uni I lived with two boys at
uni and one of them is engaged which is
amazing and we're gonna go celebrate but
I haven't got anything to wear and
neither does rich we don't go out and
the evening that often so I haven't
really got any small clothes so we might
go to a few shops as well I'm gonna get
this one which is my sister's grief
school play my fifth birthday my
cousin's first birthday and my sixth
birthday that'd be funny and then these
are like a few holidays Hilton Head
Florida and Antigua 94 so either be
funny too I reckon it'll be about
hundred pounds for all of that maybe
even more let's see I'm wearing quite a
bit makeup because we're going out
tonight as I said and I do
I hate having to like take my makeup off
and start again so I've kind of built a
good base so that later I can just kind
of top it up that's hopefully the plan
it's got a coffee from ginger and white
single shot laughter so I think manage
was did you get with soy milk please
this is my favorite house ever look at
the pretty lavender she does it that's
not laughing - I can't remember so he
dropped the videos in - snappy snaps but
they're not gonna be ready today I think
they're gonna be ready like Tuesday it
takes quite a while they really do it
real time there's videos like three
hours long so I thought that boy is
getting really told of there's nothing
in whistles and anything so in like this
is why I bought red lentil honey they
taste is so good and they're like really
healthy snacks so so I buy something cuz
they be sitting there all day evident if
so good I had tulip and Canadians they
do really nice luncheon stuff
I was really yummy and really I got it's
like you ain't even fancied avocados
host and a little dippy egg and it was
perfect if we're not gonna hit
Selfridges I know we do this a lot but I
love Selfridges our photos got
everything we need which we look for a
nice shirt on a child some sunglasses
and really want some of those what they
called no with the mirror
polarized yeah fish no fish I know wish
I imagined fish eye sunglasses they're
like like mirrored Chloe I yeah you know
the fly eyes got like that Reaper you're
just making stuff up now I want to get
some of those or just try them on for
fun really and maybe find out tonight
who knows I love bit of Selfridges
browse in there it's definitely my
favorite shopping center should we
Center so what is called a department
store in London a lot of lipstick pouch
they keep in my handbag and actually
after their long calm trip they gave us
a couple of lipsticks I think these are
Lisa Eldridge is two favorite shades
three five four and two one two today
I'm wearing two one two is really nice
that's like neutrally pinky beige we got
a space literally elbows over this is
their go space outside this is giving a
great day rich the parking angels heard
us
you guys have to wish to the park in
angels and you're trying to find some
it's Park in London and it was
Dave no I'm still looking apparently the
map itself just has so I'm just gonna go
they have it they have to lipliner and
they had Mae lipsticks I got both right
exciting rich found all saints mercy
rich it's a classic these are just a bit
of a TMI quickly but I've just spent the
last no I tell it 45 minutes I'm trying
on bras in the Selfridges department if
you struggle that he had his headphones
in if he struggled finding bras I would
definitely recommend the self in this
bra section because they have all the
different brands in one place then you
go into the changing room and you just
press a buzzer if you need to helps
you'd have to like go out at the change
room in your bra which is always really
awkward I have quite big boobs and it's
so hard to find
nice bras I know everyone always says
these like there's like Freya and
there's other brands but they're kind of
more hard harder to find I think so
anyway I just really wanted to get some
nice new bras and it turns out I am this
ridiculous size which I want to tell you
that no bras come in that size so I
ended up getting to granny bars and then
one pretty bra which doesn't actually
fit but I just really wanted it because
it was a really pretty blue trying on
bras is just too depressing and
frustrating and I wish I had small boobs
so I could just go to like Urban
Outfitters and buy a pretty bra and not
care about support that is my TMI rant
of the day now we're heading home looks
really hot this car
we're heading home and I'm gonna spend
the afternoon at home and painting my
nails getting ready for tonight okay I
have all my nails stuff in here and I'm
gonna paint my nails this was a gift a
lot ago so I don't know where to get it
from before anyone asks but this is
where I keep the way now stuff cuttable
nail polish remover base coat I think
I'm gonna paint my nails like a bright
orange --red this is nails inc Victoria
Beckham um because I'm wearing I have
white top and black jeans I think so I
think now looked really nice I didn't
paint them very well but that's what the
color looks like it's really pretty
orangey red okay time to get ready for
tonight I'm just gonna top up my makeup
recall my hair get changed and then we
gotta go I'm excited I haven't like gone
out and not driven ie being able to
drink for quite a long time really and
it's with like old friends I haven't
seen for years so I feel like it could
potentially be a quite a good night and
I don't know how much blogging I'm gonna
be able to do it is someone's an
engagement party although I know they
won't mind so maybe there might be a bit
of vlogging I'm not sure I think we're
gonna go get some food first as well as
I'm around Shoreditch putting on the
hozier album then your three minutes to
find a playlist already put on music and
getting ready together it's like uni
night out but this is max or lip liner
by itself I really like actually but I
think I'm gonna wear mer over it so I
got that - okay I love this combo it's
amazing okay so this is what I'm wearing
this is the new top I bought from
Topshop it's got like a split side
longer at the back and it's quite loose
a really light material it's got a low V
which I think it's quite flattering and
I'm wearing three necklaces my cos one
my whistles one and my Kate Spade one so
quite light lots of necklaces I tried to
buy one today but I couldn't find any I
liked um I am loving Mac saw and mer
lipstick that's it closed up I really
like it I just kind of haven't read done
anything to my and kind of just put
their concealer on and contoured a
little bit I'm just gonna wear black
jeans and heels these heels I think I'm
not really like a dress skirt kind of
person this is my way of being smart and
so hopefully it'll do I don't have like
a nice little jacket I've got a leather
jacket it's got silver hardware though
which is really annoying but I think
that's where that and bag wise
I mean I've got like her so I can either
take this which is Aspen or London which
I love this clutch bag but it's it's
quite big and I feel like that's might
get annoying all night so I could take a
little whistles one which is back there
