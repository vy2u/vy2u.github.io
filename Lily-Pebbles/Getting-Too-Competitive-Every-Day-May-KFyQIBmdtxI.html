I'm just gonna film highlights
throughout the day so that I can also
film some of the weekend so right now I
am about to go into Pilates
hope you enjoyed all the non snippets
from today highlight ups today was a say
opening his birthday present because he
actually really enjoyed opening the card
and kids never enjoy it opening cause he
was really excited about the card which
I thought was very sweet it's Saturday
now and Kate just had a baby girl if you
don't hear I'm saying Kate like she's my
friend Kate Middleton as in like
Princess I don't know what's your first
for us Dutch it just had a baby girl
watching the news is very exciting and
you should have a girl like a perfect
family boy or girl I'm now at Gemma's
and we're just gonna have some light
lunch to carry up all this stuff for
lunch I'm gonna make some tortilla chips
but I just cutting up wraps and Sur
triangles and putting them in the oven
for like five to eight minutes maybe
they're in there making some sweet
potato wedges and just having lots of
random stuff and I've got Parma ham from
obsessed at the moment I keep eating it
just out of the packet Gemma's making
guacamole looks good great is this
coriander with don't worry
that's fine fit in no-nobody and I'll be
fine a changed person no I just think
any still they everyone when I make
recommend us and everyone said accompany
you didn't put cilantro in
get that post with coriander in American
I don't like coriander but I think when
it in guacamole I can deal with it
because of the lime and stuff well it's
not too coriander eating they were
really tough back
so I'm just taking Hannah to HomeSense
she's never been and as I said it's like
TK Maxx but for home stuff says really
cheap they don't always have like four
of everything
I think salmon so I'm excited to look at
home stock would you need a lot laughs
well let's see Hannah's already excited
about him oh nice
that's very you oh it's perfect sighs I
shared something change this is the rug
that Hannah likes for her lounge I think
it's really nice it's 73 pounds and
that's amazing you can take it back if
it doesn't fit I think it's so good I
think it's gonna be really cozy I wanted
to get Hannah removing in prison but I
hate when people just buy something blue
they don't one and then they just have
crack in their flat that it needs so so
finally we're gonna get a glow
everything because I think Holloway for
the red globe type people and they've
got cool globes here I wish you could
get John I know a space that was quite
like well looks like really intelligent
keep finding things we like and ask for
the prices like these really good tables
they're on wheels and they're there they
belong doing sit there like part of the
furniture quite a few hours later and
we're just paying at home soon and we're
gonna to try and figure out how to get
this giant rock into the car without the
help of rich or isn't here and this
giant amazing lamb like so
pivot pivot we have so much stuff in
this car but we were asked to get it all
in
you got this giant rocking by ourselves
and so proud of us they're such
independent women
Hannah's returning chali and then we
have to take it home and try and get it
her car and then I have no idea how
she's gonna get it home kinda always
they've got instead of drawers from my
house there's rich he's gonna help us
bring all the heavy stuff into Hannah's
flat that's rich walking on the road
with a giant rock I'm definitely the
most helpful girlfriend look how good
the rug looks this isn't her coffee
table this is just here for now the
temporary mystic City nice that and the
glow to me rich got her looks really
nice on the shelves happy it's such a
nice time with Hannah today it was
really good to spend some time with her

new flat just so happy about it and we
just put it all together and it all

man Jon Snow Maiden I'm Ned Stark's
youngest daughter are you
no idea no I did forgot to do the
highlight of my day
highlight today was spending time with
my best friend Hannah cousin I could see
her that much we are up crazy early for
a Sunday I woke up at like eight five
seven or something painful
because my nephew ACA was birthday on
Friday today is his birthday party now
my mental sister thought it would be a
good idea in May plan an outdoor
birthday party
means really nice idea we are going to
Epping Forest which i think is kind of
near Essex and she was to do like
marshmallows on the fire and my treasure
hunts Aysen loves being outside so it's
right over stream but it's London I mean
it's the UK so it's pouring with rain
like we've really pouring rain I don't
know if you can see this there's a lot
of windscreen white backs going on here
so we are on our way we have our wellies
on and raincoats on I'm kind of dreading
the idea of having to stay outside of
the rain not big fan of rain
I really hope it stops raining the unit
does it's gonna be wet on the floor so I
don't know what the plan is but we're
all kind of just going along and doing
what my sister says they feel in this
morning hopefully ASA I think he'll love
it anyway you know kids love muddy
puddles thanks to Percy Pig whoever's
willing Peppa Pig so let's let's see a
car it's a full of pom bears and cakes
and pinatas let's go we just arrived at
the field and we're just trying to find
out whether we're gonna stay in the car
park or drive onto the field we
literally got car cleaned like a few
days ago so rich is happy about these
logs here this is where we're gonna
spend a Sunday afternoon boys it's not
the tent by refusing to leave the car
because it's really heavily raining so I
think I'm gonna have to blow up balloons
in the car that's gonna be my job okay
I'm gonna go up all of these wait oh my
well there's 10 20 30 balloons that I
think I'll do them all so let's see how
many I can do problem is I can't tie
balloons I can't do the knot so maybe I
never used to be able to
yes this is a much better job and being
in the rain I would feel a bit faint but
luckily have my mom to help me tie them
up covered in balloons we've tried to
swap jobs because I'm feeling a bit of
faith I try again
all right Papa gazebo here and humongous
tent here I better go finish drying up
those beliefs ooh hey so we got to put
all the balloons in here I'll be fun
