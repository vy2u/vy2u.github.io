be fun and I'll see you guys then good
morning guys here just to catch you up
on my weekly snippets it's day two and
I'm now in Euston station it's been a
bit of a mental morning my cab was
running late and I thought we were going
to miss our train and now I feel really
really sick because I get really bad
motion sickness anyone else yourself as
a motion sickness well know how it
really kind of messes you up for the
rest of the day pretty much sounds a
little bit better
I'm just waiting Hannah it's running a
little bit late to live spit further
away our train is boarding I think she's
going to make in time doesn't leave
another kind of it 10 min it's right
we're on the train just what you want
when you're feeling carsick but we
managed to get a forward-facing seat
which is great and by the way I just
love it
new at Anna
and we're going to our laptops out and
do some work I mean we've got like a
two-hour journey be good to do some
catching up
then we're going to be in Manchester
we've arrived in Manchester and I'm
really happy to be off that train I had
really bad motion sickness but I feel
much better now at mark and I know if
you guys hate me moaning then
fast-forward to one minute but for any
of you to do something with motion
sickness I have some tips for you all
right is the butter
hey wait we're getting on the bus I'm
gonna keep logging first tip grapes
really help they're so refreshing they
stop me from feeling sick - put your
headphones in listen to music probably
what should be three fizzy water really
good and then if things are really
really bad force herself to sleep
because when I'm asleep I stop feeling
sick and breathe into your nose and out
through your mouth and really like
visualize the air going in through your
nose out of your mouth it really really
helps out of love for different
seriously this is good so we're here
we're going to go find somebody to have
some lunch okay I forgot to vlog but we
did a little bit of shopping before we
actually got into a viewer who directed

a hotel tonight because it's luscious
Christmas event tonight and they very
kindly offered to put me a hotel so I
said why not I don't think I've ever
stayed in a hotel in London before
something very weird obviously I'm a
Londoner but it's a really gorgeous
hotels but number 11 Cadogan Gardens so
I'm on Cadogan Gardens now I'm trying to
find a hotel and I think when I get
there I'm going to film a little
skincare video in my room and then the
last event is tonight how beautiful it
is on the outside it's got a flag it's a
peaceful building I can't wait to see my
room oh my god guys I was trying to play
it cool when the guy showed me to my
room
but look at this okay so the door is
like absolutely giant and then you walk
in and I have a little lounge with a
huge TV and like a desk I'm I wanna live
here forever okay and then bedroom look
how beautiful this is huge bed and then
here oh it's like the cutest little
dressing table I knew I should have
bought more stuff to film I knew it'd be
nice and in here is the bathroom I
haven't even been in it yet I was so
nice look amazing like bath and sink ahh
this is like the nicest hotel I think
I've ever stayed in it stayed in and
which is coming later he's gonna
absolutely love it I seriously don't
even know what to do with myself I have
a video to film but I'm like walking
around like oh my god so I've just put
on some music so I always like to have
music playing when I'm in a hotel and
I'm unpacking my stuff for the night
I've got a really deliciously yummy
little candle burning and I'm just kind
of getting my stuff out but I feel like
the luckiest girl in the world tonight
here now in my dressing gown a makeup on
because I'm filming the skincare video
and it's actually taking me hours this
video would have already been up when
you see this vlog so hopefully it came
out well it's really taking me a long
time and I feel like I've gone to bed
and woken up all in the space of a
couple of hours so I'm just about to
finish that video and then I'm going to
make myself look hopefully presentable
again to go out tonight
okay I'm dressed and I'm going to do my
makeup because I am actually going
somewhere later and this is why
with me for the evening my burberry
Foundation solar powder bronzer
Charlotte Tilbury sculpting kit frat-boy
the bomb blush I'm a bit of Mac powder
tart mascara oh my god I'm trying this
and there other mascara and they're both
incredible why had I not tried top
mascara before The Naked 2 basics
palette basics - Anastasia brow stuff
NARS concealer Mac plum full which I'm
loving at the moment and this is a clear
brow gel not massively fond of it though
and Charlotte Tilbury concealer and the
Charlotte Tilbury eyeliner I think I'm
quite liking short - at the moment
clearly this makeup bag is from Trish
McEvoy as well and I love it I've just
been getting ready and doing work for
the last couple of hours and applied to
emails and stuff I put so hungry I don't
want to leave because going out I don't
really know where I am and whatever so I
looked on the room-service menu but like
there anything that was semi affordable
was some pizza bread look how good this
looks
oh my god I am so hungry I'm going to
demolish this like tomato salsa and like
olive paste mmm which is just left works
he's gonna head here he is going to love
this room
and so off lock when he gets it what do
you think pretty nice how ridiculous is
this room I found up to the door so I
said I was like oh we're gonna go
through it - this inside a wall as I
said no this is the door it's like two
of you yeah um I got some pizza bread
room service because I was too hungry to
wait for you right so we're just headed
outside see and I think we're gonna go
to the Lebanese place that we know and
love - jeans all round
rich is dropping me off at the lush
store where the event is tonight
apparently going to be giving us cozy
pajamas
this board that I'm going to vlog here's
the lush spa and Kings Road I'll see you
back at the hotel
mister have fun watching TV and smoking
out
and get him into my pajamas in a spa
treatment room tellurian I'm in my
pajamas and I love them and they were
heated with a hot water bottle that I'm
holding on too tight and I slippers on
this isn't the best day and I'm never
leaving me
Oh
the last store place of ours at me
if you're walking past the studying what
the hell is going on there could look
sparrow we're the most random I ever
just walking back to the hotel they're
all still enough pajamas right and we
look a bit ridiculous but we don't care
I just had the best time at last we were
there for like nine hours and everything
just smell amazing and I learnt all
about the treatments I didn't really
know and it was great so yeah I'm just
going back hotels find rich she's
probably very bored right now right just
before bed I'm having a lush bath of
course I had to I've put in like
everything but this one is lovely and
green and I had the lavender purple one
so I'm going to have a lovely bath and
go to bed and I'm very happy about that
sorry guys I'm back again I'm back into
my pajamas off for my bath but I just
realized that I hadn't really finished
the vlog properly or said well I've been
doing all evening and I was completely
blown away by this lush event and I
haven't been like the biggest lush fan
ever listen products I really really
love but I'm not one of those kind of
hardcore fans and the treatments they do
are really amazing and I can't wait to
kind of go home and look into them more
and research them and like one of the
cheapest you get these pajamas to wear
and they're heated and it's amazing um
so yeah they showed us all the new
Christmas products that are going to be
out I think on the 3rd of October so it
should be out by the tennis blog goes
out and so we've like the favorite
products everyone loves that little
penguin stuff I think yeah they're
really nice for Christmas so that's kind
of all I wanted to say but I'm now going
to have my cup of tea and go to bed and
I think I might finish my vlog here
because not really doing much Thursday
Friday I'm just going to kind of do some
work I think Monday Tuesday Wednesday
was very exciting this week so I need to
catch up on my work and but I hopefully
you enjoyed this kind of three days log
