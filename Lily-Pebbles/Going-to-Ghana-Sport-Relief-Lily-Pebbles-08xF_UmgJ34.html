noticed from the title of this video
since we last spoke I've been to garner
and back it's literally crazy only a
couple of weeks ago comic relief asked
Anna and I if we wanted to join them on
a trip to Ghana and obviously we jumped
at the opportunity so it's been in the
talks for a couple of weeks now but I've
just found out that I'm definitely going
to garner with comic relief I just feel
so lucky to be able to do something like
this and I can't wait comic relief is a
uk-based charity so some of you may not
have already heard of them but if like
me you're from the UK is likely you also
have fond childhood memories of their
two famous campaigns sport relief and
red nose day the charity has been around
for nearly 30 years helping poor
vulnerable and disadvantaged people turn
their lives around they run projects in
the UK throughout Africa as well as in
other countries around the world this
year it's Sport Relief terms so to
coincide with international women's day
on the 8th of March they flew us out to
go honor to see where some of the money
raised in previous years is now going
comic relief are currently supporting 20
organizations throughout garner so on
our trip we would get to see how a
couple of these organizations work
morning I am going to go on a today it's
pretty early in the morning we might
also come until nine-thirty I'm just
kind of waiting around now I think I'm
ready I put my huge rock side there a
smaller exact there but quite of stuff
by you stick with my camera equipment
film video this video say that really
excites if gonna go via Lucy's to pick
her up and then we're going to the
airport so off I went and with me came
Anna Holly Lucy Jeannie and Lucy
so he planned it wasn't too bad actually
six hours Mia normally makes me really
nervous but it went quite quickly and we
watched films and stuff and we just got
off playing and in hot this is so hot
you could feel the wet heat so we're
going to go get our luggage now after a
six-hour flight we arrived safely got a
bit of rest and then we were up at 4am
start the day we had a lot to pack into
two days and what you get to get started
so here's day one morning it's four
thirty in the morning and I'm ready to
get back on a plane so he jumped back on
a plane but this time to head north of
Ghana to tamil a where we would meet a
group of ladies who have been able to
start their own business thanks to sport
relief and the local organization tree
aid the drive was amazing and despite
being really tired i didn't want to
close my eyes for a minute and miss out
on the incredible view I couldn't
believe how many strayed goats there
were like miniature goats walking around
but it turns out they're not stray they
all have owners and they roam around
during the day but they've always come
back to their homes in the evening like
cats and not going to lie I really want
a pet go now so after a few hours in the
car we arrived at the first project so
we took our one-hour flight to tamil a
which is like the beauty of the Lord
region and we have been driving for a
good few hours now to get further north
which is where they're making the sheer
butter and we are here now it's like
midday and it's so so hard but
we're looking for words medium for now
this village doesn't get many visitors
from abroad so we were greeted by pretty
much the whole village and the kids ran
out of their school lessons to come and
see us and they were all so ridiculously
cute we spent a bit of time with the
kids first and they just loved us taking
photos of them and seeing their photos
in our camera and it was so nice to see
they're like huge smiles and how much
they enjoyed them after a little while
the kids were told to go back to their
lessons and we finally get to meet the
group of ladies that we came so fast to
see so we sat down to find out what they
do how they do it and how the support
helps there's about 30 women in this
group and they all make shea butter
which they then sell on throughout
Garner and i'm sure most of you guys
have heard of shea butter before because
it's really well-known in the cosmetics
industry because it's used in a lot of
skin care products it's known as
Africa's gold and it's made by roasting
and crushing shea nuts into a pace which
is then washed several times these
ladies make it day in and day out and
they couldn't be happier about it the
money and support from tree 8 gives
these women training machinery and
equipment as well as trade and business
skills for selling we had a chat with
them to find out a bit more this lady is
a Ganza and she's been making shea
butter for around six years she has six
children and is a widower she told us
how she was able to learn a skill and
earn an income which meant she could
feed and educate her children as well as
giving them a school uniform being able
to work for herself and earn her own
living gives her incredible independence
and security that she wouldn't otherwise
get we spoke about how she used to have
to carry water to earn a living and when
we asked her if she's happy now this is
how she replied this group of women are
really tight and they pass their skills
on to each other which is kind of the
whole point the support that sport
relief a tree aid give is great because
it's something that could be passed on
to others in their village to their
children and can keep developing and
helping other women and a living show me
by taking ghana is used for
of things and these women prefer to use
it for cooking but they also use on
their skin and wow they had the most
amazing skin this lady told us that when
she uses shea butter for cooking it
makes her feel healthy inside so then it
was our turn to have a go at making
stuff it was actually really hard but at
least we provided some entertainment
they found it hilarious how bad we were
killed we also met Vida here who as well
as making shea butter has learned the
skill of weaving tu vida and the other
women she trained to make beautiful head
scarves and it can sell these in the
markets the process of weaving is a bit
like making a giant friendship bracelet
but it's not easy ana had a go was
everyone's gathered round and watch the
funding helps them buy the equipment and
supplies that they need as well as of
course teaching them the skills and
training that they can pass on vida has
trained 10 women who are all now
training other women and that's exactly
what it's all about so he spent a bit
more time with the kids and we even got
a little dance before we left just
before we left one of the women came up
to the comic relief girls and just
thanked them and said how happy they are
with the support they're getting it was
just so nice to see their success and
independence before we left we bought a
tub of shea butter this is what it looks
like and it smells so good so then we
headed back we tried the traditional
Guardian dish red red for dinner and
then headed to bed okay so we just got
back to our hotel and we have spent the
day as you have seen up north it was
really an amazing day a little bit
emotional on the way
go lie but it was just so nice to meet
these women who were just really
inspiring we had a crazy car journey
back on the bumpy roads so day two it's
five in the morning day two and we're
going to get a flight back to a crawl
the capital and meet a couple of
projects then we got back on a plane and
headed back to a crowd the capital of
ghana we had two projects to visit that
day which are both supported by an
African women's Development Fund or a
wdf which is supported by sport relief
the first place we visited was the
central market in coffee idea this area
in particular has a really high
percentage of HIV and AIDS so it's even
more important to give these women a
chance to earn a living this is Theresa
14 years ago she received a grant to set
up her own shop after working as a
seamstress for many years last year she
set up a new even bigger shop in this
market was able to take on staff to
train this lady is Vida and she's
completed one year of her training and
has two more to go before she could set
up her in place the funding allowance by
machinery and fabrics and received
training that can be passed on the
sewing machines cost the equivalent to
around 40 pounds and it's an essential
before the women can start training the
fabrics we saw was so bright and vibrant
and beautiful and even though the market
stalls custer rounded by all the hustle
and bustle of the market it seems
somewhat like calm and it just seemed
like a really nice space that they could
just sit and train and learn and
practice their skills so we worked our
way out the market and you went to visit
another dressmaker this is where we met
a few women including for censure who
told us how she works two days a week
selling ginger in the market to help pay
for her sewing machine and supplies she
told us how the trade skills she's
learned not only helps her with her
dressmaking but also selling
in the market I had a chat with gifty
who's one of the grants officers a wdf
and she was telling me how learning a
vocation like this can get these women
out of really bad situations and for
those living with HIV or AIDS it can
mean a way that they can afford to pay
for their treatment or medication some
videos skills
Michael credits so they support each
other I said memory paralysis don't wear
my knees I used to support each other
after spending a bit of time there and
chatted to the ladies we jumped back in
the car headed back and ate lunch on the
go we then arrived another slightly
smaller market in an area called a
shyama we had come to meet Virgina who
owns this hair and beauty salon Regina
has also received support from wuaaghh
is able to rent her salon for around 15
pounds a month the funding helped her
train for three years which means that
she can now wash braid style and color
hair as well as apply makeup on her
customers she can also pass on these
skills which she is doing with her
current apprentice who's training is
being funded by the organization we
stood around and watched while she
created her masterpiece and it was
amazing to watch Regina has genuine
talent and her business will keep on
developing and hopefully she can benefit
even further from the program and
eventually have all the tools she needs
in her salon Anna also had her hair done
whilst we were there and I think she was
pretty happy with the results throughout
day two we were joined by Abdullah who
is a previous comic relief employee who
lives in Ghana my name is semana
abdoulaye
I am resident of family
he's incredibly passionate about the
projects it spoke to me about the
difference the support can make on the
local communities that we visited he
spoke to me about the importance of
being part of a group of women how they
can support each other have a voice and
influence change within their
communities for those affected by or
living with HIV and AIDS it's a way that
they can support each other and access
medication without being objected to any
stigma or other challenges come back to
a hotel just kind of the shower freshen
up very quickly before getting on a
flight home I can't believe this trip is
over already it's literally been two
days of madness we have packed so much
in and woke up so early and it's been
the most incredible experience I think
I've ever had I've loved team garnet as
a country I'd love to come back
definitely and also seeing the projects
that comic relief are funding it's
really amazing and I can't wait to go
home and kind of look into them even
more and tell you all about it we packed
a lot into two days but for such a short
trip I learned so much met so many
amazing inspirational people and just
had an incredible experience growing up
in the UK I've always known about sport
relief but actually being able to see
firsthand where the money's going and
how it's developing has been a really
incredible experience the thing is is
it's not about throwing money at people
that don't have any or giving gifts it's
about teaching them skills that they can
then pass on and help others as well
it's not about changing one person's
life or one family's life it's about
giving them the opportunity to help
their family and other families in their
community and everyone can benefit from
the ripple effect it was great to see
how the money from sport relief can help
the local organizations get up and
running and keep them running
independently I'm going to add in loads
of links in the description bar below so
just click see more to see all the links
I'm going to add in some information
about comic relief as a charity and

coming up really soon I'll also link
