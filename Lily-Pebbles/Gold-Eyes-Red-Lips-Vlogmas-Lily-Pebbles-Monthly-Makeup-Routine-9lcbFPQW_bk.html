monthly makeup routine now I am sorry
there's no a weekly vlog today but it's
for good reason I've given myself the
week off logging because I've changed my
mind
and I'm gonna do vlogmas I made this
whole announcement this time last month
about how I'm not doing vlogmas this
year and I was gonna do snapless instead
but I've given myself a month of
November to think about it and I've
changed my mind
you guys were really disappointed I
wasn't doing it I kind of secretly was a
bit disappointed that I wasn't doing it
I was gonna just give myself some time
off but who needs time off vlogmas is
just too fun and really hard as well but
it's fun so I'm gonna be vlogging every
day up until Christmas day I haven't
really figured out if I'm gonna upload
like I did last year Monday to Friday or
every day I think it's just gonna be a
bit more flexible this year but
hopefully you're going to see loads more
videos from me in December and I'm still
gonna have one main video a week as well
so look out for those I think one week I
actually have two main videos so I
really hope you guys don't miss those so
today I'm gonna be doing this makeup
look it's a red lip kind of perfected
skin I always think it's weird and
people say that basically saying that my
skin looks perfect which it doesn't but
you know what I mean that's all kind of
Goldeneye and I'm just gonna go to the
next clip where I'm wearing no makeup
and I hope you guys enjoy it okay I was
gonna do a voiceover and just do my
makeup and then do a voiceover but I
think I prefer watching videos people
just do the makeup and talk then you can
get their real like initial thoughts on
the products they're using and stuff
also I'm not using any studio lights
today it's just natural light so
hopefully you guys can see the real
colors of all the makeup that I'm gonna
be using first thing I'm going to use is
a face oil which is a bit different I
don't normally do that before my makeup
I do it in the morning my skin is just
feeling a bit tacky and dry at the
moment this is from I still don't have
to say this brands sit press site press
I've been using this so much
it's a beauty elixir too because I'm
about to do my makeup I'm only gonna put
like one or two drops I'm just gonna
apply that to my face smells amazing
this one and that's just gonna add some
moisture back into my skin allows my
skin just drinks up all the makeup and
also as you can see it adds a really
nice glow as well to the skin I'm then
going to use the makeup forever
radiant primer in the yellow
I've been using it a lot recently I
can't really tell if it's doing anything
but Jaclyn hill
always uses their and her skin looks
amazing so I'll probably be able to tell
when I watch this video back whether
it's doing anything because I haven't
filmed with it yet the lady in the store
said that it showing me used under the
eye because it's yellow so it kind of
counteracts the dark circles but I've
been using it all over just to add a bit
of radiance I really need to layer up
the glowy products at this time of year
all right as my skin just looks so dull
in case you're wondering if my ears are
red I just got five piercings yes they
might keep knocking my ear okay so for
foundation I'm actually gonna be using a
new one from Chanel which is so exciting
this is coming out in January so sorry
if that's annoying for you but I'm
giving it like a proper go so I could do
a review when I talk about in a video or
blog post it's part of their lab age
range which is the really nice powders
they have I think the whole of the lab
age range is just about being able to
wear it all year round very natural easy
to wear products I'm a mix of two shades
which is really annoying I always find
this with chanel foundations 20 does
suit me but when you put all over the
skin Oh makes me look a little bit too
pale and then thirties a little bit too
dark so I'm if there were it was a 25 I
would be at 25 so I'm just gonna put a
pump of each a half pump of each on the
back of my hand and mix those together
I haven't actually properly tried this
on my face yet I tried it yesterday at
the launch but not my face I put two
pumps of that on the back of my hand and
then I'm just gonna tap it onto my face
I love the smell of Chanel foundations
it's quite heavily scented so if you
don't like the scent and that must be
really annoying but I really like it
mine's you like being on holiday in
France okay so I'm just buffing that in
with my Bobbi Brown buffing brush it's
such a nice like natural foundation
blends in very quickly doesn't cover
like a lot I've got a few kind of red
marks here on my cheek and I can see as
I blend it over its not really covering
it up but the makeup artist from Chanel
that I met yesterday we're saying how it
can be easily be layered so I'll give
that a go today I'm just gonna buff in
this first layer okay so that's the
first layer you can see it's really nice
and glowy
probably two glows people with oily skin
but
I love it I'm gonna do another layer
which feels weird for me I never do this
but I want to see kind of the sort of
look I'm going for today which is golden
eyes and a red lip because I haven't
done a red lip tutorial in a little
while and it's getting festive so for
that look I kind of want slightly
perfected skin I think it looks really
nice with a red lip so for the second
layer I'm kind of dabbing it in more
than buffing it just so I don't move it
around too much yeah the second layer
applies really nicely definitely adds
quite a lot of coverage so if you have
the time for a layering foundation it's
nice because it gives you the options
you can have like one layer for the
weekend two layers for what oh my gosh
look at that I love it it's so glowy and
fresh okay I finally got my hands on
another Urban Decay Naked concealer I
have been missing this stuff so much I
haven't had one for ages and this time I
picked up the shade medium light neutral
I feel like every time I go I get
matched to a different shade there's
definitely a shade missing that would be
perfect for me this one might be a
little bit too dark I'm just gonna apply
a little bit under the eye oh my god
I've missed this concealer I could
already feel how great is it just got
such good coverage without being too
heavy and I'm gonna blend that in with
my Real Techniques setting brush which I
always use yeah this this concealer is
probably a little bit too dark but the
lighter one is too light I'm just gonna
Pat that under the eye see with this one
unlike the Charlotte Tilbury one that I
use a lot I don't need to go in with
like the makeup forever full cover
concealer afterwards because it covers
my dark circles this is such a good
concealer okay so that's foundation and
concealer done and it is very dewy so
I'm gonna set it in a little bit with
the powder and I actually recently
picked this up and I'm really excited to
try it properly it's from Laura Mercier
and it's her translucent oh no it's the
universe or setting powder so there was
a loose powder in translucent and then
this one and I couldn't be honest on the
difference but I went for this one so I
hope you made a good choice I'm also
going to use this brush which is
functional and it's like one of those
duo fibre ones just so I apply a tiny
bit because I really don't want to put
too much on I'm just like tapping it
into the lid oh no that's what happens
when you use natural light okay the
lights gonna mean move
around a bit I think but I'm sticking to
my guns I don't want to use Judeo light
for this okay so putting a little bit on
the brush and then tapping it off and
I'm gonna apply that under the eye where
I really need to set it it may look like
I'm piling it on but this brush like
hardly picks up any product it also kind
of sets my eyelids so there's no kind of
concealer creasing on there do you can
see it doesn't take away any of the glow
of the foundation it would just set it
in certain places which is exactly what
I wanted
okay next I'm going to bronze up my face
of it for this I'm using a bronzer from
H&amp;amp;M Beauty this is the sheer tan Solar
Flare bronzing powder this is really
nice I'm just gonna apply it it's kind
of on the tops of my cheekbones up on my
temples down to my chin slightly on my
neck so this is just kind of warm up the
outer part of my face for a little
highlight I'm going to use my hourglass
palette this is the one with three
powders in it and I like to just mix
them all together I think that's really
nice just on the tops of the cheekbones
it's more subtle than the Becca
champagne pop which I've been using a
lot it's just more of a kind of subtle
glow I'm also gonna use a quite a subtle
blush because I'm gonna have golden eyes
and a red lip and this is from Mac it's
blush baby I haven't used this in a long
time and I absolutely love it it's a
very pretty kind of light move pink
blush I'm just gonna quickly fill in my
brows with the Anastasia brow Wiz you
don't need to see this I do the same
thing in every video okay so I want
really pretty golden lids not much
eyeliner a little bit and mascara and
red lip that's what I'm going for so I'm
gonna start by using this hmmm I shadow
because I've been using it so much this
month I absolutely love it it's in
batchi dama
I don't know how you pronounce that but
let's go with that and it's just a
beautiful golden shade so I'm going to
take quite a lot of that on my brush
it's so pretty and I'm just gonna apply
that the lid this would be lovely
just by itself it is so so pretty the
formula of these
so good and then I'm gonna take my tart
tartlet eyeshadow palette which I've
also been using a lot this month I feel
like these monthly makeup routines are
kind of a peek into my favorite so I'm
sorry if I repeat myself in my favorites
but I'm using the products that I've
been using a lot so this is an entirely
matte eyeshadow palette which is great
because I love matte shadows especially
when I'm wearing a red lip because I
think shimmer glitter and red lip can be
a little bit too much it's find a
Christmas but we're not quite there yet
so I'm gonna take the shade wanderer
which is like a nice Corky Brown and I'm
just gonna apply that into the crease
and outer corner very subtle I don't
want to kind of smoke it out or anything
like that if you want like a really
subtle blend these are m'kay brushes are
great for that okay and then I'm just
gonna take a smaller zoeva brush take
the same shade wanderer and take it
under the eye very small amount so it's
just really subtle so that's all I'm
going to do for the eyeshadow it's
really really subtle and pretty and then
I'm just gonna take the Charlotte
Tilbury rock and coal liner in bedroom
black and I'm gonna put that in my eye
in the top and that just kind of will
make my lashes look a bit thicker
without wearing a heavy eyeliner to
weigh it down I'm not sure I'm gonna be
able to do this on camera so I'm just
gonna like turn around do it here and
come back to you because these are what
I've done is I've put the Charlotte
Tilbury bridge in black inside the eye
and then I've taken a tiny amount of the
Tom Ford liquid liner and as you can see
I've just lined the eye but so so close
to the lashes I haven't done a flick or
anything so hard you can hardly see it
it just kind of defines the lashes a
little bit more and I'm sorry I couldn't
film that but anyone that can do liner
one-handed whilst holding a mirror is
just a wizard I'm gonna put on loads of
mascara I'm not trying anything new
today haven't I tried any mascara in
ages because I'm pretty content with my
mascara wardrobe at the moment this is
the Clinique high impact extreme volume
and I probably actually need a new one
of these but I might have a backup
somewhere I like to kind of brush it
through the lashes quite slowly to
really give it the length and the lift
from the roots I think when you have
quite a subtle eye and not much eyeliner
on big lashes look really nice
and as you guys know I don't really wear
false lashes someone else is doing my
makeup then I will but I don't tend to
use them on myself okay so those are my
lashes done and then we're gonna put a
small amount at the clinic lower lash
mascara on just kind of even out a bit
my lashes are quite long so it can look
a bit top-heavy if I don't do this okay
so now it's just the lips and if you
watched my vlogs you would have seen
that I wore this red lipstick couple
weeks ago I'm wearing it a lot
especially this time of year is my
favorite red lipstick it's Charlotte's
Hillberry red carpet red hurmat
revolution lipsticks it just so I feel
like I can just trust them it won't kind
of smear around my face they won't come
off when I eat or drink or do anything
and they feel comfortable in the lips as
well I'm gonna start by using the Mac
cherry lip liner this is slightly
lighter than the Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick but once you apply the lipstick
on top you can't really see I just find
it much easier to apply a red lip when
you have a kind of guideline around your
lips already so I'm just gonna line the
lips and I can't really talk whilst
doing this so sorry for the silence I
love this lip liner it's so soft you can
hardly feel it on the lips I do quite a
thick line so that when your lipstick
wears off you're not left with just a
line around your lips I also use a lip
liner to kind of draw in a bit more of a
Cupid's bow that should be alright but I
can always go back in afterwards and now
I'm gonna apply the lipstick the square
but let's make it really easy to apply
straight on to the lips you don't have
to use a lip brush you can if you want
so that's the red lipstick done I think
that's the makeup done - I might put on
a bit of this Urban Decay makeup setting
spray it's a little bit and that kind of
fixes it all in place and adds a bit
more glow I really like this makeup look
actually so this is the finished look I
really hope you guys liked it I'm really
sorry for the light going up and down
throughout filming very annoying but
