try not making me loud clunky sounds hi
guys welcome back for today's video I'm
going to be showing you a graduation
makeup look and give you a few tips I
graduated from uni I think four years
ago now I can't really remember I think
it was about four years ago and I think
now is the sort of graduating season in
the time you might be a bit off for this
video because everyone graduates at
different times especially in the UK I
think some people do it in July but mine
was like October and some were February
the next year so who knows it's around
this sort of time I think graduation was
fun but it was so far after we'd
finished uni it was kind of just really
nice to see everyone but I was kind of I
think I had a job already by then and I
was bit over the graduating thing but
it's definitely a really nice day that
you are definitely going to remember so
it's nice to have your makeup done
nicely for the day and you want to look
back at photos and think yeah I was
happy with my makeup that day I wore a
Topshop white kind of floaty dress I'll
insert some photos of my graduation here
somewhere I got told off for not wearing
a proper collared shirt because my gown
didn't pin on to it properly but I
didn't really want to wear sure I wanted
to wear a nice dress I had my hair
straight and down because you have to
wear a hat so definitely don't do an
updo because you will get there and have
to take it down so I had my head down a
lot of my friends had nice curls in
their hand that look really pretty and I
can't remember what was on my nails
probably something blue I was very into
blue today I have SC maximilian strauss
her I think it's called which is a
really nice kind of gray green that
would actually be probably quite nice
for graduation so this would be my
graduation nail recommendation so I'm
going to talk you through the makeup
look I'm wearing now and give you some
tips along the way so graduation is a
very long day there's lots of sitting
around and waiting I guess it depends
how big your uni is but mine took
forever and we are on first my friends
so we had to wait the whole time for
everyone else to go so I definitely
recommend using a primer because it will
make your makeup last a lot longer the
one I used my graduation is the Laura
Mercier foundation primer and radiance
so this is just a really nice kind of
water-based primer it feels really nice
on the skin and it also gives like a
nice glowy radiance to the skin which is
a nice
I've added benefit as well so I just put
a small amount of that all over the skin
and then for foundation I'm going to use
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I wear the shade 4.5 this is
a good foundation pick because you're
going to be taking a lot of photos will
probably take a lot of photos during the
day and this has no SPF in it so if
you're going to get the professional
photos whether use a big flash you won't
get that sort of pale ghost face in all
the photos I didn't actually pay for the
proper photos I remember saying like I
could just take them myself which I did
they were so expensive such a cheapskate
but anyway this is a really nice
foundation I'm just putting a small
amount on this I don't want to kind of
cake on too much foundation and I'm
using my Sephora brush just to buff it
all into the skin and it leaves a really
nice kind of natural finish but it's
good coverage as well I want to brighten
up my under-eye area so it looks nice
and fresh I'm gonna look awake in all
the photos so I'm going to be using the
Charlotte Tilbury
retouch a concealer and this comes in a
pen a bit like the wise sell one but
it's much better coverage doesn't have a
funky smell I really like this I have
the shade to fair took me awhile to
figure out the right shade but two is
definitely my shade and I just apply
this under the eye and blend it in with
a brush and it blends in beautifully and
doesn't crease up throughout the day and
just adds really nice light under the
eye then for the rest of my face I'm
going to be using the Make Up For Ever
full cover concealer I use shade 5 this
is amazing because it's waterproof it's
really long-lasting and it's got really
good coverage so it's good for long days
and for photos so I'm just using this on
my chin around my nose on my nose and I
also use tiny bit of this under my eyes
now everyone says not to use under the
eyes even though Make Up For Ever makeup
artist said to me no way don't use it
under your eyes I kind of like it I
don't ever like a makeup rebel
apparently I think a tiny amount just
here where you get really dark circles
it's fine it doesn't get dry on me it
looks fine so I think if you want to you
can I'm actually running really low of
this that is terrifying to set all of my
foundation and concealer in place I want
to use a powder as well this will look
really good in photos and again will
make your makeup last throughout the day
powder I'm going to be using is the Mac
mineralized skinfinish in light plus and
using the small Charlotte Tilbury brush
just to get under my eyes or my forehead
around my nose on my chin all the areas
where my makeup starts to disappear
first this powder sort of invisible
it's not translucent but you can hardly
see it on the skin it just really
complements the foundation concealer now
before I start the rest of my makeup I
want to use an eye primer I like to put
it on now before I do my bronzer and
blush and stuff so it gives it time to
set on my eyes before I do my eye shadow
I'm going to use the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion this is just a
really good one that everyone seems to
like and it does the job my tip would be
to not put too much of that on though
because I think if you put too much on
actually makes your eyeshadow crease
which defeats the whole purpose before I
continue one of my tips would be to wear
makeup that you usually wear don't use
this time to experiment new looks just
do the makeup that suits you because you
don't want to look back at photos and
think oh gosh that purple eye shadow was
a big mistake I'd also say don't do
anything too kind of trendy because it
will really show the time your
graduation was and when you look back at
photos you'll be like oh that was so
2014 so although this might not be the
most exciting makeup tutorial it is
going to be a very kind of natural easy
to wear look because that's something
that I were a lot if you always wear a
bright red lip and wear a bright red lip
just do what suits you I always look
really pale in photos so I'm going to be
bronzing up my face using the soap &amp;amp;
Glory solar powder which I always talk
about it's my favorite bronzer I'm going
to use both shades just swallow my brush
around in the pan and use it all over my
face at first just to add a little bit
of bronze to my skin and then I'm going
to take the Charlotte Tilbury brush and
just use the matte shade to contour a
little bit I think contouring looks
really nice and photos I just do a
little bit of my cheekbones and it kind
of adds a bit of definition to the face
now this is the blush that I actually
wore my graduation because I was
obsessed with benefit coralista
throughout the whole of uni the smell
actually really reminds me of uni I love
the smell so I'm going to use a little
bit of this on my cheeks it's a really
nice peachy Coralie blush and it's so
pretty I absolutely love this and I just
think it really makes you look very
awake and fresh okay so now onto my
brows and I do this after the bronzer
I'll always my bronzer brush gets all in
my eyebrows and it ruins it I didn't
actually do my brows at my graduation
because I only started doing my eyebrows
about a year ago but I'm going to use
the hourglass brow pencil I love this I
just use it to fill in the small parts I
need I'm not doing anything over the top
no huge bowl of brows because I don't
want my graduation photos to look silly
and then
to set it with the blink clear brow gel
I can't really remember which
highlighter I used in my graduation I
definitely used one because I was really
into highlighters at uni but for this
tutorial I'm going to be using the Kiko
radiant touch creamy stick highlighter
in shade one hundred and this is so nice
it's a cream highlighter so I just use
my fingers and apply it to the tops of
my cheekbones slightly down my nose on
my Cupid's bow and under my brow and it
adds a really natural highlight and
because it's cream it just kind of
blends in with your skin and looks
really pretty
I think wearing a highlight is nice
because in all the photos you look
really kind of fresh and glowy
okay now under the eyes and as I said
we're a look that suits you and for me
that's a brown kind of neutral eye so
I'm going to be using the Charlotte
Tilbury color chameleon in amber haze
these are amazing I have three different
shades they are basically just eye
crayons but the formulas so nice and so
long-lasting she's made those different
shades to suit different eye colors so
if you find it hard to know what makeup
suits you she said like amber haze is
for brown eyes and then there's another
one for green eyes and all the different
eye colors so this is really nice I just
kind of apply a little bit to the eyelid
and blend out with a brush but you can
also use your fingers I didn't put too
much on because I just want kind of a
sheer wash of color but you can build
this up if you want more I personally
wouldn't want to wear too much of a
heavy lip for graduation so this is just
a nice wash of brown you can just use a
nice dark brown eyeliner for this look
but I do that quite a lot and at the
moment I'm loving black liquid liner so
I thought I would do that look instead
I'm actually going to be using the Tom
Ford liner that I spoke about before
it's so expensive and the soap &amp;amp; Glory
one is just as good so use that if you
want a drugstore alternative but this is
the one I'm loving at the moment it's
called the eye defining pen and it's got
two ends one slightly smaller and one
slightly longer and I just find this so
easy to use I can't really show the
cutaway of me applying it that well
because I have to put my face right up
close to a mirror but when I apply black
liquid liner I basically just follows
the lash line all the way around and
then I just lightly flick out the end
it's really just trial and error to see
what suits your eye shape I just kept
trying messing up try and messing up
until I got it and now I just kind of
know the shape that suits my eye you
might want to pick a waterproof mascara
for your graduate
day I don't know you might get bit teary
for many reasons maybe you're sad to be
leaving your friends or your parents are
crying because they're so proud and it
makes you cry I don't know I didn't cry
my graduation but awards risk over it's
probably a good idea I'm going to use
the Max Factor full slash effect mascara
which is nice and gives a nice volume
not my favorite ever mascara but it does
the job okay now moving on to lips and I
wouldn't recommend a bold lip unless
you're wearing a really long-lasting
formula like the Sephora lip cream
because graduations are really long and
you see you're sitting in this kind of
big hole for ages and I don't remember
seeing people kind of like reapplying
their lipstick you don't really have
time to do that so unless you've got a
really long-lasting formula I'd go for
something more neutral that if it does
rub off it's not the end of the world
that's why I wanted to do kind of nicer
eyes because the lips aren't that
interesting I'm going to be using Mac
Shanghai spice which is kind of a new
one for me I've got it like this year
and it's a really nice soft peach and
it's a bit different to the sort of
nudes are usually wear but I think it's
really pretty and I've just kind of been
pressing that into the lips reapplying
pressing it in dabbing it my fingers
because I think that makes it last a
little bit longer then you don't have to
add a gloss but I actually wore this lip
gloss at my graduation it's Mac boy bite
so I thought I'd put it on for all the
times sake
but very similar dupe for that is Tanya
burr lip gloss in afternoon tea just a
really soft kind of pinky nude so that's
my graduation makeup look done so here's
a little summary of my tips don't wear a
foundation with SPF in it if you're
going to have flash photography wear a
look that just looks normal to you and
that's something you wear all the time
I wouldn't go for a bold lip unless it's
a really long-lasting formula because
you just won't be able to reapply it
make sure your nails look pretty because
when you're holding your little
graduation thing in photos you're going
to want to have nice nails don't do
anything too on-trend in your makeup
it's a bit like passport photos you
don't want them to look old in five
years time so hopefully that helps you a
bit and congratulations to any of you
guys who are graduating this year the
next year is going to be very hard but
very exciting for you and although unit
is so much fun I think it gets even more
fun once you leave if you enjoyed this
video let me know what you think of this
kind of natural but I think quite pretty
makeup look I'll see you guys in my next
video
