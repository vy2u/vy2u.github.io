and it's greasy and frizzy and
definitely do a wash I normally spend
the last day before I wash my hair with
it tied up in a messy bun and whenever I
film with my hair up you guys always
compliment me on my makeup and it's
coming a bit of a pattern and I don't
think it's a coincidence when I tie my
hair up because it doesn't look as nice
as when it's down I really try to focus
on my makeup and making my skin look
flawless and I normally wear a bright
bold lip as well so I thought for
today's video I would show you the sort
of makeup I would wear when my hair is
tied up and to mix it up a bit as well
I'm gonna be using all new products so
products that I haven't used before in a
video mine is kind of a few like
concealer and brow products that you may
have seen already but most of them are
new to me so I hope you enjoy this and
the first thing I need to do is tie up
my hair because I get kind of frizzy
curly bits underneath I tend to kind of
twist my hair like that and then just
tie it up into a messy bun and use loads
of care of your grips to keep all the
frizzy bits at bay so now my hair is up
let's start with the makeup and the
first thing I'm going to use is
something I've been using this week and
I really quite like it's not makeup its
skincare but it's something I keep by my
makeup because it's kind of like the
first step before I do my makeup
it's from the body shop and it's there I
concentrated it's one of those little
metal roller balls that's really cooling
on the eye area and I think this makes
applying concealer really nice and I
always get puffy eyes in the morning so
this is lovely you don't even really
need to rub in because it's not not much
comes out it's just very cooling now I'm
going to use the Clinique even better
foundation and I'm using the shade 0-5
neutral and this has SPF 15 in it I've
never tried this before well I've been
using it this week but before then I've
never tried it and I really quite like
it it's not I don't know why I just
shook it it's not watery like this
chanel back to lumi aqua it's kind of a
bit thicker but it's just a really nice
kind of natural foundation so I'm going
to squeeze a bit out onto my finger and
apply it straight onto the face it has a
really nice texture
you could probably apply this with your
fingers as well but today I'm gonna use
a brush because I recently picked up
this Bobbi Brown full coverage face
brush which Anna said was amazing and
I've been looking for a buffing brush
type thing my Real Techniques ones I go
through so quickly so I wanted like a
really good quality one so I've really
been enjoying this and I'm just gonna
blend it into the skin it's really quick
and as you can see it's nothing too
heavy it's just kind of like skin like
foundation I really like this brush and
I especially like that it's small so
it's really good for traveling
I hate when the brushes are really long
when they're really hard to take away so
as you can see the foundation is quite
dewy it definitely looks more shiny on
camera because I have the lights on me
but you can powder it down I personally
quite like gooey foundations so I
probably won't powder this then for
concealer I'm going to use my usual NARS
creamy radiant concealer it's just my
favorite no need to find any others
personally I'm just gonna put a bit of
that under my eye around my nose and on
my chin you can use your finger to blend
that in but I like to use the Real
Techniques setting brush I think this is
like the perfect size brush for
concealer and I don't see people use it
that often but personally it's my
favorite so I'm just quickly blending
that in and this can see there's really
hard to see on the skin once you blend
it in it's not cakey or drying at all I
usually take a tiny bit under my eyelid
as well because my eyelids can be
slightly dark and this kind of
neutralizes the color it also works a
little bit as a primer before eye shadow
what tends to happen though is I'll get
a little line of concealer so before I
do my eye shadow always rub it in my
fingers just to make sure there's no
concealer left on the lid I'm now going
to use the Charlotte Tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow which is basically a
contour kit with a darker contour shade
and a highlight I recently spoke about
the Kiko contour palettes I think which
I really love it's very good affordable
version of this but they are so light
different I hadn't tried this yet when I
recommended the Kiko one and this one
definitely is much better in the quality
of the products but the Kiko one is
great as well I really like them both
today I'm going to use this one and
their products a really nice beautiful
formula I'm going to use the Charlotte
Tilbury brush that goes with it you can
buy separately and I'm gonna take a bit
of the contour shade and then just use
this in the hollows of my cheeks I'm
also going to take this up to the
temples and slightly down the jawline
same on the other side in the cheekbones
up to the temples and down the jawline
as you can see it gives a really nice
kind of sculpt to the face gives it a
nice shape and it's very natural it has
got a bit of shimmer in it but it's
nothing kind of too glittery the
highlighter that comes with it is
absolutely beautiful I'm gonna put a
little bit of that on the tops of my
cheekbones on both sides such a pretty
highlight shade for blusher I'm gonna
use this one from the balm which is
frat-boy
I recently got this from Phil unique and
everyone when I tweet about it everyone
said oh well that's my favorite blush
ever there seems to be a very popular
one I really liked the little thin
packaging it's very pigmented you need a
tiny amount and I'm gonna pop that just
on the apples of my cheeks very lightly
because I'm wearing quite a bold lip I
don't want to have too much blush on
before I do my eye shadow I'm just gonna
quickly fill in my brows using the
Anastasia brow Wiz and the blink clear
brow gel just gonna brush up all the
hairs so I can see the shape and then
fill in the front parts here and here
slightly on the arch is where I'm
missing a few hairs and then setting
them in place with a clear brow gel is
probably one of the most important steps
in my routine because my eyebrows like
to move a lot throughout the day okay so
for my eyes I'm going to be using a
really new exciting launch it's from
Urban Decay and it's their Naked 2
basics palette when the Naked basics one
came out I wasn't interested at all four
of the shades were really really pale
and I just everywhere pale eyeshadows
but then this one came out and I thought
it looked way more up my street there's
a light shimmery highlight shade and
then these these two kind of base
colours which are quite light and then a
slightly warmer Brown another medium
brown and then a darker Brown that's
really nice for liner they're all very
cool toned which isn't normally the
thing I go for but because I'm wearing
quite a bold lip I don't personally like
to do very heavy eyes and a bold lip at
the same time so this would be just kind
of a nice cool wash of color to go with
the bold lip so I think I'm going to
take this kind of warmer brown shade
cover all over the lid to start with the
shadows are really pigmented as always
with the urban decay I'm always so
impressed with the quality of their
shadows especially as these are all
matte shadows all but one and matte
Matt can be slightly tricky sometimes
but these are really nice I hardly put
any shadow on the brush so as you can
see the colors really pigmented which is
very impressive
so that's really nice just alone but I
think I'm going to put a little bit of
the shade primal in the outer corners
which is a slightly cooler tone Brown so
I'm just gonna put this in the crease
and then take a really big fluffy brush
and just blend that out so there's no
kind of harsh edges this is quite an
important step as well I always think
I'm also going to take that shade cover
so kind of slightly warmer brown
underneath the eye just something I
always do just because I think it suits
my eye shape anyone who can put
eyeshadow under their eye without
opening their mouth I have no idea how
you do that I'm now going to take the
darkest shade undone which is like a
really nice charcoal gray and the Mac
263 little angled brush and I'm going to
use this as a liner and I really like
how this looks it's not as harsh as a
black liquid liner and it's kind of just
a little bit more interesting than brown
coal liner so I put the pointed part of
the brush facing out when I'm doing the
outer part of the eye and then I turn it
when I'm doing the inside and I find
that the easiest so I think that looks
really pretty and a bit ton of Victoria
Beckham esque and then I'm just going to
make sure I look down this the mirror
make sure they even this one needs
slightly more of a flick that should be
right now after mascara I have two new
mascaras that I've only got today and I
have no idea what they're like they're
both from Barry m1 is the extra volume
black mascara showgirl and the other one
is extra lengthening black mascara
showgirl so one of them is like a big
kind of fiber fluffy brush and one is
one of those smaller kind of more
plasticky ones ah I don't know what to
use to I want length or volume today
think I'm gonna go for the length one
let's give it a go and see what it's
like it's quite nice but this is quite
natural as well maybe I'll try the other
one on the other last
see how they compare it grips the lashes
nicely but it is quite a natural finish
let's try the other one this one's a
much bigger fluffier brush this was
slightly Messier but I kind of prefer
the finished look I'm gonna go over
these ones again both yzma scores are
quite nice though for like an everyday
lash look I haven't tried berry I
mascaras before and yeah I'm kind of
impressed with these they're not amazing
but they're definitely not terrible so
now for the best part the lipstick and
I'm gonna be using the Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick from her map revolution line
and this is a whole new range of matte
lipsticks that she's released the thing
with matte lipsticks is matte basically
just means non shimmery non glittery no
Sheen it doesn't have to mean drawing
and I think that's what she's kind of
touched upon she's made matte lipsticks
that are creamy and hydrating and easy
to apply and easy to wear so it's
perfect if you're usually put off matte
lipsticks these are really nice to put
on this one is in lost cherry which is a
really nice kind of bright pink it's
like a pinky red it's not something I'd
usually go for what's kind of Coralie
but as soon as I'm doing the whole cool
toned eye thing and trying some
different stuff today why not
I'm gonna apply it straight from the
bullet first she's got this really nice
kind of square shaped bullet but then I
might use a lip brush as well just for
the top of my Cupid's bow it doesn't
drag the lip at all when you apply it
it's so creamy I think I'm gonna use a
lip brush I've got the Real Techniques
lip brush here which is really good it
has this little like retractable thing
when you use a lip brush of the lipstick
all you have to do just swipe it on the
bullet and then just go for it it's
really easy and then when I do my top
lip I like to rest my little finger on
my chin to keep my hands steady and then
to supply there you go I think that's a
really pretty lipstick color it's kind
of like a bright pinky coral so that's
the finished look my hair up makeup
tutorial I like glowy skin bronzer
highlighter lips eyeshadow I do it all
because then you are distracted and not
looking at the greasy ball on the top of
my head let me know if you found this
interesting or if you discovered any new
products I know I did I really like some
of these products that I used thank you
so much for what
and I'll see you guys in my next video
