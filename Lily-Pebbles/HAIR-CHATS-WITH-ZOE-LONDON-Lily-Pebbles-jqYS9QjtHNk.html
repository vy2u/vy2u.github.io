with Sue and actually no names so long
four years maybe more
I reckon more than that name means that
we actually met before like blogging and
all of that we were interns at the same
company and we both know I'm ago I mean
bondage and yeah now look us you know if
you guys don't already know Zoey's
YouTube channel go and check out I'm
gonna link it down below
she's clearly very cool she has no hair
but no reason to you must check out her
videos no but she makes really cool like
creative videos and after this I'm gonna
make her teach me how to edit because
she's amazing thank you bye y'all is
that I go check out there but yeah we've
known each other for a while but we've
never filmed together I know I thought
that I'd do a hair related video I have
really greasy hair today I need to wash
it which is unfortunate and I've really
bad roots but very cool hair I was like
I need to do a hair video as owee
and you guys are always asking me
questions so so this is a good time to
do it
so I've come up with some questions it's
not really a tag although if you wanted
to make it into a tank you are more than
welcome to first question describe your
current haircuts in color so right now I
mean it's kind of washed out to be
honest with you because I put blue in
and it fades out to this color which a
lot of people are like I love it like
there's Pat yeah tell me I'm like it's
just really faded you like it really
yeah I do and right now I'm really into
like violet so I'm like I'm gonna put it
violet I think after this but yeah right
now it's kind of this washed out blue
and I always have a fringe I've had a
fringe ditching my whole life I went for
like one of those things you know and
they like to scan your skin for like sun
damage and I literally had nothing there
my current hair color is balayage which
is a bit like ombre used to be but it's
just like a different technique they
take really small pieces of hair back
comb it paint on the color and then they
leave it that it put foil on it so it's
a bit more subtle so that's what I have
and the cut they normally cut it just
below like collarbone and I have been
shorter but
it's kind of longer and she normally
uses like a special special scissors to
like thin it out a bit because it just
gets a bit like puffy yeah okay so
what's your most embarrassing hair
memory slash hair look oh my god I feel
like when I meant that when you had red
hair like dark red hair dress yeah
I think that was because I did a bad
bleep job it was trying to cover it up
so I was like that'll do but yeah I've
done some really dodgy like I want to
bleach my fringe so much that it just
fried and just stuck up like this I just
all fried and I was like oh just sort of
like kind of style that it was not a
good look at all and that yeah I've been
guilty of cutting my own fringe a lot my
old passport picture I used to like go
like that like I had quite a little way
more experimental with your hair so
you're bound to have like more yeah
mistakes I think at the time I said I'm
like I hope my worst was I used to go on
like some account for like two sometimes
sometimes a month or two weeks or a
month and my hands are so cold I it's
gone if I'd like to had it natural I
would have had to take not drinking like
five bottles of hair mousse with me just
to like man the times I have to wash it
yeah and then after mousse I have to use
on my hair or have to so I used to get
it braided like salons and sit there and
I'd literally come out bite my whole
hair break in sometimes it was like
cornrows and I just looked ridiculous
and I have so many photos of me as a
teenager of my hair and braids like
loads of tiny grades I like to yeah
relocate them although they Monica from
friends but without the shows amazing
yeah that was definitely my like biggest
hair mistake what are your current
favorite hair products so I totally fell
doesn't necessarily bring any questions
that's like y'all know what my favorite
half brother didn't think about this but
but right now I can tell you that I'm
loving there's this L'Oreal mask
I think it's extraordinary oil it's so
good it's in like a little bronze I can
describe it so like a bronze pot like
that and it's like six pounds or
something I'm boots
yeah I love it I want to see them like
my fourth pot in like as
many months I just you put on in the
shower leave it wash it off yeah kind of
mask yeah yeah I'm gonna leave it on for
about like five to 10 ish minutes I get
a bit bored do I know I don't have any
shampoo mask cause I can just carry on
yeah good yeah well I like to have a
lush bath and I'm we doing the lush bar
nice yeah pampering so that and then I
also use bleach london silver shampoo
yeah because if i didn't it go really
green so i think a lot of people think
you can you just use it on blonde hair
two-tone blonde hair like silver gray
yeah i use it on my blue and it stops it
going green yes a mine similar like you
said this is shampoo and conditioner i'm
actually mentioned this in my monthly
favourites i weren't going about it but
it's says it's for precious blondes but
i use it so i think if you've got any
kind of blondes it's a purple yeah ssame
yeah it ups it going copper and brass
thief my hair is always prone to go in
orange and I'm also loving the L'Oreal
mythic oil that I always talk about that
as well it's so so good I like it not on
my hair when it's wet
oh do you yeah and then I let it dry
naturally and it yes stops it going
crazy frizzy and dry hmm really really
nice and the Kiehl's cream with silk
groom and my hairdresser no matter what
hair just I guarantee even if they're
not meant to be using Kiehl's products
they always use this it's just like a
really nice kind of textured cream that
like Ryan's my hand my wet hair no I put
on like also chasing my hands okay like
frazzled
I like run this through it just smooth
it out yeah really nice I bet smells
good as well killer stuff always smells
amazing not well no I think that's why
it's not like holiday really well
holidays my good man what's your most
worn hairstyle like just earrings and I
guess so not like that's just no
business my new hair yeah anywhere like
Dutch mm I love that stuff I don't do it
myself
I really seat here yeah so I'm like oh
my god we're on holiday and I was like
getting George to do it for me I don't
think you can do it well washing rocks
Horace's YouTube video we had that
in the bathroom Vega smells like right
listen to proxy and do my hair like that
he was like a girl
yeah that I mean I love that stuff but I
only did when I go to see somebody but
you do it so yeah what do you do
yourself I have to wear like a little
top not just a little bit my hair on the
top yeah or maybe I mean right now I
just pull it up into a ponytail
yeah really quite creamy my most worn
hairstyle is probably when I use my ght
ghd's so just like curl my hair all that
loose wave yeah yeah because it just
looks like it drops really quickly but
then it just gives like a texture to the
hair that isn't like dead straight yeah
and if I'm trying to be fancy I'm really
bad at hairstyles but I do like to Dutch
claps there and then like a bun at the
back you can do it where you like weave
it all into the front of you yeah if I'm
not good enough to I can't do it behind
I've just taught myself how to do it and
it kind of it's something you can be
messy with yeah it's just kind of as
long as it goes that way yes right
exactly
what do you love about your hair and
what do you not love bite where mmm well
I love just coloring it in general I get
absolutely hooked to dye my hair and I
like as soon as I got beaching on what
color could I go and but the fact that
you have hair that you can die yeah I
mean yeah we're very fortunate yeah I
mean it always used to be a lot thicker
than it is now but it's still I mean I
have to go to the hairdresser and I like
I'm surprised your hair so long because
of how colored it is normally yeah you
know with brake off so I'm very lucky
that I can color it better yeah I mean I
think my favourite thing is honestly I'm
just addicted to dying dying it like
just random colors I'm always buying
hair dye online that's like colors I'm
never gonna use my you want them just in
case maybe one day I'll be like bright
yellow yeah what do you not like about
your now mmm the fact that my roots grow
so dark you have naturally like those we
know hair
yeah yeah my eyebrows parts think of
things I like about my hair but like I
guess I liked the color in cut at the
moment like when it's done
but obviously I don't like the texture
of my hair like I could go to bed with
dead straight hair and wake
it's curly it's like she matter fact the
people can like wake up and leave their
house like my blow like and people say
that but wearing that show I'm like but
it's not natural because unless I am I
don't use diffuser and curl it it's just
like frizz hmm
so yeah the texture of my hair do you
not like if you could swap hair with
anyone whose hair would you want that's
hard
I'm actually I know who-who you the
first I try and think about this celeb
but I think it's quite hard to tell
whether it's their real hair or not so I
don't want to risk it
I'm gonna go with someone who I know has
good hair yeah Anna she does have good
hair I mean I like the color on my hair
I wish I could have Anna's hair my
colour difference
Anna's colors luckily it's like very
natural but yeah I just don't suit dark
hair but the quality of her hair like
she commits so very thick isn't it you
know it doesn't ever go big way she can
just wash it like and it will just dry
naturally and it's straight there any
other like people who die their hair
really cool ecology I love Chloe no
guard okay I don't know she is like a
model she's always dying ahead like
rainbow colors I think I dunno yeah he
walks in there she show yeah she's just
really cool and she's like I don't know
I feel like there's some colors I really
don't see where she seems to see every
color imagine if I had your color hair I
would love to see that what hair do you
see yourself having in 20 years and I
added this question in for you because
I'm like would you have blue hair yeah
gonna be in 20 years
48 yeah 47 foot 7 yeah we have like
ground on or 48 when you like a grandma
you have like a blue really yeah I'm
living my whole life up to that moment
where I can be like I've waited for this
blue-rinse forever yeah I think like
George's mom was asking me she was like
well you have to be there when you get
married I like yes
say yeah I think I will you know for me
it's quite normal now
yeah my mom says to me like this is your
normal color hair and I'm like mom
thinks it's normal
yeah then it's more change it quite a
lot there yeah I switched up like shades
of blue yeah I feel like I've already
done the chop I feel like when people go
old and they always cut the hair short
but I've already done that so I think my
hair will say similar like judging okay
so yeah I think you'll always be like
shoulder-length in like brown whatever I
can't imagine going back to long again
my hair's not like good enough quality I
always think when you get to a certain
age you have to be like a certain person
to pull off long hair I love short hair
I'm constantly tempted to let gotta just
go for it yeah okay final question where
your favorite places to get your hair
done the last couple of times I've been
to the Percy Andrea so long that's
really nice yeah I just love I don't
read I'm very fortunate that I get to
see actually a degree but the Cylon
itself is incredible yes I just got this
amazing atmosphere that's just like you
don't feel worried about getting your
hair down the tools so it's like I like
it there were some I've been I went to
blue tits a long last time I'd
definitely go back there again they do a
lot of like fun colors cool which is
good but yeah
Percy and we just go up yeah I get my
hair done at Harrison's but I also love
going to dry by these good dry bye is
that the one in I think doesn't feel
like it's on I'm not the one in savages
no it's more to the street Oh more to
mystery in London and it doesn't like if
you hate hairdressers if you hate like
hair just as always loud and hot it's
like not like that at all it's so calm
everything is like copper marble and
pretty nice yeah and like just getting a
blow-dryer nails darkness so no I mean
it just feels like you're hanging out
with mates yeah natural so I really like
it then I think I'm gonna add like a
quick question in because you just
engage any of my viewers they're like oh
I want to dye my hair like you have any
tips for like if you want to do it
you're actually so he's got loads of
great videos about doing it
yeah I normally film every time we
change my hair color yeah I normally
film put it as a video I think people on
my channel are probably sick of seeing
me dye my hair when I watch them I'm
always surprised that actually looks
easier than I would have thought your
kind of a bit like no I do I need to
just slap it on yeah but yeah I think
it's so much easier than people think is
and also I think like you should just
not be afraid I mean obviously be wary
of bleach because that can damage your
hair and obviously you need to read up
about it makes me test it on your hair
first because if you don't you could
have disastrous consequences and I don't
want to be responsible for that but
actually putting color in is so much
easier than people think I'm like brown
hair will take like your hair would take
peak yeah definitely I always wanted
pink tips and I was younger you should
do though like mm yes anyway there's
other questions I hope you guys enjoyed
hearing about our hair product stories
all those car things don't get to go
check out Zoe's channel we are also
filming a video for her channel which is
a Q&amp;amp;A like Twitter cute yeah we're just
