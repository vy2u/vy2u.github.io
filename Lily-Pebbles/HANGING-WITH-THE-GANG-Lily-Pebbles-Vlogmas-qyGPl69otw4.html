I am just doing my makeup ready for the
day I actually wasn't going to vlog
today but then I woke up like really in
the mood to vlog so I'm just going with
it
it's Sunday the 11th of December and I
am starting the day with breakfast or
brunch with my friend Hannah and rich is
gonna come along too not really sure
where we're going yet but we just want
some kind of breakfast just doing my
makeup I kind of need it to last until
tonight I should probably use a mirror
after breakfast rich needs to go to
Spitalfields to pick something up from
Anthropologie I think that means
something Christmas present related that
he ordered online and I think maybe this
afternoon I'm gonna help my mom decorate
her Christmas tree
and then tonight we are going to a
restaurant called Palomar with some
friends we might actually go to the
recorder leg cider Lodge first I've been
there twice already but it's so nice to
go and like hang with friends and have
some hot cider I can't go over how
delicious that hot cider is it's
literally like hot Robina but alcoholic
which is amazing so I think we might go
there first cuz they none of them have
been there by the way to any of you who
kind of don't watch my beauty videos
you're wondering what the hell I'm doing
right now this is the Real Techniques
complexion sponge and I use this to Pat
in my like tinted moisturizer or
foundation and I know it looks like an
effort but especially for people with
like mature skin it's so worth using
this I run it under water squeeze out
all the water so it's quite damp and it
makes your foundation like really sit in
the skin nicely so it doesn't just like
sit on top gives you a bit of glow and a
bit of like fullness to the skin so if
you do have time very worth it last
night rich and I stayed in and we got
Turkish takeaway and we ended up
watching Good Will Hunting
I'm normally when I see people that I've
watched quite a lot of films and I'm
always really surprised when like
hasn't seen a classic film like ET I'm
still horrified that she hasn't seen ET
but we've never seen Good Will Hunting
and people always talk about it and I
don't know why I haven't seen it
sometimes if I'm not sure what the films
about I'm a bit like oh I don't want to
watch it if it's scary or something
badly we watched it on Netflix and it
was so so good it was like Matt Damon
Ben Affleck wrote it apparently in like
six months
it was like one of the earliest films I
think Matt Damon won an Oscar for it oh
my word it was brilliant and Robin
Williams was in it which just made me
cry because I love him and it's so sad
that he's gone but yeah if you for some
reason haven't seen that film like me
it's it's one of those things you always
forget to do it's so good I would really
recommend watching it while we're
sitting here chatting no I am not
pregnant
I keep getting comments on my videos
because I I've been a bit like under the
weather this week will happen but you
know I've just been not myself and
people keep saying I think you might be
pregnant
guys it's not very polite to speculate
I'm not pregnant I'm not trying to be
pregnant not that is anyone's business
but imagine if I was if I don't know
much if I was trying to get pregnant and
everyone was commenting saying are you
pregnant
it wouldn't be very nice so I've learnt
in my older age not to speculate not to
ask people just kind of let people do
their anything I'm having to put on
extra concealer today it's one of those
days okay I think I will fast forward
the rest of this makeup routine and come
back to you when I'm done
my makeups done the lighting in here is
so bad this is where I have to do my
makeup every morning like standing in
this corner but the windows like over
here I need to get some kind of like
maybe like add a light bulb to go above
my mirror because I pretty much just
make up when I'm doing my makeup I can't
really see anything I'm doing Oh while
I'm at my desk look at the Apple pencil
holder thing I'm so happy with it it's
this little thing and it just stands in
there and it means I'm not gonna lose it
and I love it
genius spending the day with Deb's
yesterday made me want to crack up my
trainers again she's always wearing
trainers and she just looked so
comfortable all day
morning morning thanks des at 11:00 down
here can you tell a Christmas joke rich
heard you had a bit of a day didn't you
yeah you told me in the middle of the
night oh the same to do with the film
have a think we're gonna go pick up
Hannah I'm gonna drive because I
actually quite like driving this
courtesy car feels really like growing
up we're gonna have some breakfast I'm
really hungry we're really really happy
today rich like a meal positive Lily's
back back when will she ever hear
waiting day I'm pretty play I'm so
obsessed with the blush color so my
coats kind of blush my jump is kind of
blush and this pink color with grey it's
just it's just lush did you say that was
really good rhyming rich that's funny
pink blush and gray is lush looks a bit
weird down here with the trainers and
jeans but we can style
we're here I'm with Hannah
happy birthday Broncos mrs. Claridge my
present which is lovely but I'm still
not gonna let you pay but thank you
anyway yeah
I thought today I'm seeing my Christmas
jumper by my mother I mean it's really
adorable
it's too sunny to vlog we just had such
a nice breakfast of Hannah she bought me
breakfast for my birthday which was very
sweet of her
we're gonna go find some kids to play
with not like random kids
I am nieces and nephews yeah let's go
find some family members no one's
texting us back there this isn't a good
start
I'm at my sister's house it's a bit of a
building site at the moment cuz they get
in the bathroom done and honey's invited
me into her bedroom to see Gigi the cat
knows easy
Oh Gigi okay not as easy sorry Gigi she
the friendliest cat ever how many
colours how many colours does she have
on her honey brown black yeah he's so
cute shuri's what's wrong she always

sit on you see how did she like that I
bet she likes when you go like this
Jojo got her Christmas tree today so
they're gonna decorate it let you have a
whole day of tree decorating can you see
what's in here
Oh George always wanted to buy these
this morning and exactly what they're
gonna be you know the letters I'm in

there's an H and a bean that's the B
where's the age age whoopsie you go I
really want to find an Ellen and arm
I love these tree ornaments these tree
decorations are so Jojo literally the
most blingy like tacky decorations look

more there are more family members here
I'm at mom and dad's now I haven't even
taken my coat off yet because I wants to

also got their tree here so there's lots
of tree decorating going on today I
think Carly's about to make some mulled
wine looking at some mince pies and this

just gonna have a really quick 20 minute
power nap before we go out tonight
because I'm shattered I've just woken up
from my nap and I'm like really cold and
tired but I don't want to wait too many
layers cuz I always make that mistake
and then I'm so hot in the restaurant so
I'm wearing this top because it's
actually quite thick but the arms are
short so I'll wear like my long gloves
under my coat
it's kind of festive and birthday ish
just black jeans and boots really I'm
gonna like top up I should only I will
top up my makeup maybe I'll put a bit of
concealer on my my spot there you don't
look very wrapped up let's go it's such
a thin jacket
I mean look at me hat gloves scarf fairy

if Lions are always hot but I imagine

he like radiates heat now on Southbank
and I'm aware this is quite boring vlog
footage of you guys because I've been
here twice already but you know and you
really like somewhere you want to go
back and it's LACMA so I can't just like
avoider imma get one Christmas don't
they want like Christmassy and they're
gonna love it under them have been there
I can't wait for my hot cider it's so
yummy rooster said to that lady food on
the stairs as he said it he fell off the
stairs
nice fall maybe we can get a good table
inside but I feel like it's gonna be
even busier than the other two times
that we came I've been joined by friends
welcome to vlogmas sighs and they just
brought me birthday present
they got me these amazing clubs from
whistles they have like they're like
fingerless so I can still use my phone
and this necklace can you see can you
see yeah you can so pretty I love it
we're walking over what bridge is this
bridge was it cause it's an swinging
bridge oh it's not the swinging bridge
oh I would want to go on a swinging
anyway
no bridges my favorite oh sorry this is
not Gemma's favorite bridge but it's so
pretty
we're walking out of there walking the
restaurant so home
I'm not really sure what this is the
little girl kitten okay we're here at
Palomar I'm all very hungry
really really yummy dinner loved it we
had like the problem having a birthday
in December we have my Christmas meal
but it's actually really good cause
didn't have to order they just bought
loads of stuff and it was really good so
now we're gonna head home chilly and
back home after a really lovely birthday
dinner with my friends really good food
I just wonder how you guys wait where is
it it's my bag somewhere I know a lot of
you guys have been sending me lip balm
recommendations I don't know if any of
you understand when you have really
really like sore lips I feel like
there's nothing more frustrating and
people being like hey we tried eight
hour cream I know everyone's trying to
help but I've literally tried like all
the obvious lip balms I was ready to go
to the dermatologist but then I thought
today let's just try a couple more
I bought the Lucas pawpaw cream because
my friend Deb's loves it I tried a
little bit of that but then I thought
I'm gonna give this one a go because
they didn't want to have to use my hands
because obviously it spreads a lot of
bacteria so this is the Bioderma
stick hydrate so moisturizing stick is
basically cold and so far so good like
while it's are so cracked on the edges I
haven't been able to like eat food where
I need to open my mouth wide because it
hurts so much but my lips feel so much
more flexible now and like less tight is
that tight feeling that I hate so much
so far this is really good so I'm gonna
give it like another day tomorrow maybe
I don't need to go in the dermatologist
if this fixes them I don't know how it
long-term the solution is but I'm
seriously impressive this lip balm so
far all the ones I've tried and I'm not
joking I've tried like over 20 lip balms
maybe this one is the best so far it's
just just making me a decaf tea because
I always find when I come back from like
a night out I can't just go straight to
bed until I whine down a bit I'm gonna
go take off my makeup and then Monday
and Tuesday it's the next two days I am
working from home I have no plans other
than work I'm so excited I want to clear
out my office I want to wrap Christmas
presents I've got so much work to do if
what so many videos to fills I can try
and get ahead for Christmas and yeah I'm
feeling like hopefully I'll get like a
really good like two solid productive
days and then Wednesday I've got a
really fun day planned I think I'm
seeing Anna
so I will vlog again then my thought of
the day is that in this very very cold
weather we're having in the UK right now
and maybe wherever you live if it's
really cold as well in London
particularly there are a lot of homeless
people and I walk past a lot of homeless
people especially where I live and kind
of everywhere really if you're passing a
supermarket if you're passing a style
box or acosta get them a sandwich get
them a hot drink I think at this time of
year like hot drinks and stuff a really
important maybe something to consider
my thoughts of the days are getting very
deep at the moment I think that's all
just putting his clothes away we stink
of fire because we're sitting by the
fire outside a lodge so all our clothes
now smell
how're you feeling about the week ahead
yeah not my chassis are you ok cuz it's
oh gosh bedtime socks a bit if you guys
haven't seen my last video I will link
it here and a button if you'd like to
subscribe as always I will link my
