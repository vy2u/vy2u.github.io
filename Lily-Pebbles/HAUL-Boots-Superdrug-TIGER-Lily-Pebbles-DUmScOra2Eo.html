did a spot of shopping yesterday with
anna and i thought i would show you guys
when i picked up I went to boots and
superdrug and tiger which is a shop I'm
obsessed with so I will start with the
beauty stuff for you Beauty holics out
there and I'm gonna start with boots so
the first thing I picked up is something
that Anna and I like to call a black
vest top sestri topcoats one of those
things you just have to keep
repurchasing and it's not that exciting
to buy but when you run out you just
need another one like a black vest
stopped so this is a top coat if you
haven't heard of it already this is just
the best top coat out there it dries
really fast it prevents any sort of chip
in for a really long time and makes your
nails super glossy and it's just the
best top coat whenever I go skip my
nails done in the salon and they don't
use this I'm always really upset because
I know my nails are gonna chip after a
couple of days and then I also spotted
this little set at the bumble and bumble
stand and it's the mini set of their new
invisible all range I've already spoken
about this range I really like the
conditioner and the primer and this set
comes with all three products the
shampoo conditioner and the primer and I
thought this is really good for when I
go away in September and it's just so
cute I couldn't resist this little zip
bag as well come in really handy if you
don't know about this range is super
conditioning light weights but really
moisturizing on the head ok so now I'll
show you what's in my superdrug bag
another black vest stopped I needed to
get another border on nail polish
remover really boring purchase but I
freaked out when I went out of these if
you don't really know what is going to
happen suddenly take your finger and
it's covered in like red from your old
red nail polish and then you need a new
one so I rushed out to get one of these
and I love when they're brand new and
they're so nice to use this is just the
easiest way to remove a nail polish if
you haven't seen one of these already
which I'd be surprised if you haven't
it's just phone with a little hole in
you put your finger and it's soaked the
nail polish remover so it's really quick
and easy to read a nail polish still on
the subject of nails and I know I don't
need any more nail polish I'm completely
addicted if you saw this photo on my
Instagram and then I posted this photo
afterwards I just have a problem with
nail polish but I saw this little se set
and I had to pick it up it's their color
icons and it's so cute i love the little
mini sets they do it's such a good way
to try new colors i do have mint candy
apple already but that's a really nice
small size if i want to take away with
me and then fifth avenue which is like
one of their class
ready orange shades and Mademoiselle
which is a light pink and I don't have
either of those two so I really wanted
to try them and it's this is such a good
little set I think this is one of their
newer ones so I'd quickly go grab it if
you're interested another nail polish
purchase I told you I have a problem and
this is a repurchase its models own
beach bag and the reason i picked up one
of these I haven't finished my other one
but i know i will is seriously my
favorite nail polish off the year is
part of their colors for tan skin
rangers and i never see this anywhere so
hard to find it's always sold out so
when I saw it I wanted to grab a backup
shade because I don't know if these will
be around forever and I know this is a
shade I will always love in the summer
it's just a really nice bright orange
coral it looks so nice on your toes and
your nails and I absolutely love it so
I'm happy to have a fresh one I thought
I'd take a quick look at the makeup
stands and I stumbled across these
products and Maybelline style that I
haven't tried before this one is the
master smoky shadow pencil and this is
like a big kind of chunky crayon that
you can use eyeshadow and then the other
end there's a little blender brush so
I'm looking forward to trying that if
it's good i will let you know but i do
love wearing cream eyeshadows it looks a
bit kind of two pencil e it might be a
bit drying but hopefully it's really
creamy I'll give it a go I think in the
same range as that is this master drama
kohl liner and I love a good dark brown
eyeliner I wear them pretty much every
day when I want not wearing black liquid
liner so I definitely like trying
drugstore ones i really like the Rimmel
ones but i don't think i've tried any
from maybelline so i'm looking forward
to giving this a go and i'm sure we'll
end up on the blog or one of my videos
if I like it okay now on to the exciting
stuff now there was a tiger store where
we went and I absolutely love tiger it's
really hard to explain but everything's
really cheap they do stuff at the home
and just random bits and pieces and I
always find myself buying everything
when I go so this is a big bag that i
got and i'll show you first of all the
most exciting thing now I saw this rug I
don't need a rug I really don't but one
day am i and I really really liked it
and it was only seven pounds so I picked
it up it looks like this it's huge well
it's actually not that huge but I'll do
a little cut away to show you the actual
size I really like this because it looks
like something you can anthropology and
normally anthropology these would be
like hundreds of pounds so expensive but
this was seven pounds and I think it's
so nice and I think it
make a room really cozy I love the
colors and I just I love this style of
light interior so I'm really happy with
that purchase I also randomly picked up
a tray this is the smaller size they had
a big one a small one and it's so cute
school this fruit on its got like
watermelons bananas pears oranges and I
absolutely love the print I thought
would be good for taking photos of
products on for my blog also just to
like maybe put some perfumes on I think
I look really nice in my room and when I
move out i will take this with me i also
picked up some cotton wool pads because
these are only a pound each and i really
like the package Amos just something a
bit fun for cotton wool which normally
really boring and hopefully these are
really soft I haven't actually tried yet
but they have a cute little print on
them I just think there's a really nice
and it was only two pounds just a few
more things from tiger I got a couple of
birthday cards I'm one of those people
who always pick up cards when I see
college that I like because you never
know when you're going to need one
someone's birthday my forgotten or
anniversary so I just got these this one
looks like that which I thought was
quite cute and then that one as well
which is more of a birthday one and then
finally I picked up these giant paper
clips I love paper clips that weird
thing to say but I have so many pieces
of paper on my desk I like to just be
able to put them all together and put
them neatly in one place so I have a lot
of giant paper clips already but these
are really cool these do you have
burgers on them so there's burgers at
the tougher than this giant paper clip
and then this one has mustard and
ketchup and I think these are so cute
and so fun and they were really cheap as
well so I am happy i picked those up but
that's everything from this random
little haul of mine i hope you enjoyed
seeing why picked up and it was that
glamorous or that exciting but i just
came home from shopping last night and
thought I want to film a video and show
