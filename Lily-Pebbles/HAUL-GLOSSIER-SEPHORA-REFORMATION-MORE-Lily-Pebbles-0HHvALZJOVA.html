having a nice Sunday morning I promised
you guys a haul from my trip to New York
if you haven't yet seen the vlog it went
up on Wednesday is literally on my
favorite of lo Anna and I have so much
fun in New York and we did a bit of
shopping as well so I thought I would
show you guys what I picked up while I
was out there
I got a birth beauty stuff a bit of
style stuff actually more Beauty than I
expected I didn't go with any kind of
list I think I'll start with style and
fashion and then move on to beauty a
shop I always like to go into when I'm
in America is Steve Madden you can get
Steve Madden in the UK but it's not that
easy to get hold of I love the crown
because they do half sizes but also the
shoes just suit me I always manage to
find at least one pair that I love when
I go out there these are slides I call
them sliders but I think Nick would
slides they're a really nice soft
leather with this like blush pink and
then a black elastic going over the
middle there really can't please because
they've got quite a thick sole in there
quite robbery and because of the soft
leather they stretch really nicely they
don't well at all
they did these in black as well but Anna
and I both agreed this colour suited me
best and I really really liked them so
I'm glad I got those I went into Urban
Outfitters which is a brand we can get
at home I always like to have a look
because they usually do different things
in America than they do in the UK this
was on the mannequin I literally took
this one off the mannequin because there
weren't any mediums on the shop floor
it's a really nice blue and white
stripes for a soft cotton shirt and on
the mannequin it was kind of done tied
up with high-waisted jeans which I just
thought it's really cool nothing special
but I just saw it and liked it I also
went into Reformation Reformation
Reformation don't we know how to say it
but it's a brand of heard quite a lot
about they do some really beautiful
dresses and I went and have a look
around I wasn't really planning on
buying anything I think in terms of like
the tee dresses they're something you
can definitely find in cheaper shops
like Urban Outfitters they're pretty
much identical if I didn't feel like I
wanted to invest in any of their dresses
but I did see some really nice t-shirt
and I was just laughing at me so much
because she said I should have got a
t-shirt that said I went to Reformation
and all I got was this boring white
t-shirt because I literally walked out
the shop with the cheapest most boring
item in there but it's just a plain
white t-shirt especially like slightly
cream-colored now I look at it but you
know and you just find a good white
teeth or a really nice weight to it it
fits really nicely it was like $25 I
just
you can never have too many good white
teas actually I don't really have what I
love in my wardrobe so I thought that
would be really handy to have because of
that actually all the star stuff
expected to buy more clothes while I was
there but I just didn't see anything
else that I loved I went into made well
couldn't we find anything you only to
the point in buying that much like
summary shows we haven't got any more
holidays planned so let's go on to
beauty I went to CVS and you will see in
my vlog that I picked up this it's a 10
person 10 miracle instant repair
leave-in this is such an old-school
product that used to get all the time
flies to recommend it this is like a new
one I think I haven't seen this before
and I just love a leave-in conditioner
it says it's good for instant detangling
prevents breakage extends color-treated
hair as shine and personally when you
have hair like mine you can never have
too many of these kind of products we
also went into what's it called
Rickie's which is I think like the
American version of our Sally's it's
like a trade beauty shop we were just
looking around I'll show it Annika she's
never been into one before and there was
a massive huge display on the back wall
of the wet brush I've even a wet brush
for like four years now it's my absolute
favorite like the tangling brush but we
only really have like one type in the UK
I'm pretty sure and there was so many
options there was like the eco-friendly
one like so many different shapes and
sizes depending on what you want it for
this one is the texture Pro wet brush is
gold it's really good for textured hair
like mine but also what I liked about it
is that it's long I use my mini wet
brush when I'm straightening my hair and
it's not really the right kind of brush
for that so I thought I would get this
one because it's like somewhere between
a normal brush size and a big like
paddle brush which I don't really use
the straightening so I thought that
would be good to use when straightening
my hair okay so next me I've got a
massive glossy a bag and a massive
Sephora bag I think I'm going to go
first with the Sephora so if you want to
see what I bought from glossier watch
till the end it's so much bigger than I
thought I haven't been before in a long
time to be fair but I think I did get a
little overexcited okay the first few
products perform at this brand which I'm
highly recommended I've never heard of
it before
IG k it's called it's a haircare brand
packaging is so cute and the oh my god
edges are so cute that's so new everyone
in New York says everything is so cute
it really made me laugh the names of the
products are really fun like jet lag
this is the invisible dry shampoo
use this once already and I really like
it a lot of these products I've used I
put them all back in the packaging just
for the sake of like an old-school
beauty haul I thought it'd be fun but
yeah jet lag is their dry shampoo I got
a mini because the big put are quite
heavy and big to travel home with and I
thought I'd give it a go if I like it
I'm going back to New York in September
really nice dry shampoo doesn't show up
white on my brunette hair that's nice
this is from the same brand IDK if
there's smoke and mirrors its
conditioning cleansing oil so it's a
conditioner which you use in the shower
but it's an oil conditioner and it's
cleansing and slightly terrifying and
but it's really conditioning at the same
time I've used it once as well like it
so far my hair feels soft nothing to
report it was nice to use I like the
kind of pump it's kind of like a gel oil
it doesn't come out and go everywhere
sometimes I find oils quite hard to use
in the shower this is very easy to use
oh my god this Anna and I got so so
excited by this we both needed a new
solid beauty blender cleanser so if you
guys use any sort makeup sponge it's
basically a solid soap that you just
kind of rub the sponge around in water
and it cleans it really well then we
solve this I actually posted this and we
got very excited is the blender cleanser
solid pro so it's a 5.3 on solid
cleanser so it's much bigger than the
original it is black I think it's got
charcoal in it so inside comes with this
little things you want to rub your
brushes on it's basically a massive
massive so it's just a really big
version of the original because I won I
guess really so quickly so I'm excited
to use that we really like jumped around
in the corner of Sephora when we found
this oh this I actually got from Ricky's
sorry it's my Sephora bag but this is a
brush body and I thought this would be
really good it's basically like a little
and we get it out oh God making such a
mess you like put it on your finger and
then you can just use it to wash your
brushes on I know that Real Techniques
do one and that's much bigger but I
found it a little bit awkward to use and
I thought something little would be much
easier just because I find that when I
use my hand to clean my brushes my hand
goes really why and Sophie and I just
don't think this gives my hand so I'm
going to give this a go here back to
Sephora I wanted to try out some things
from milk which is a brand I don't know
much about but everyone talks about it a
lot so I just thought I'd go to the
counter with like a fresh view and not
really know much and just try out the
product to see what I'm naturally drawn
to
love try and concealers this is a flex
concealer and I gave it a go at the
counter and it looks really nice and
I've tried it once or four and and it
was really nice so this is what it looks
like I got the shade light to medium
comes a little shoe and then in a
squeezy tube but when you undo it it
actually has a doe foot applicator which
obviously makes it so much easier to use
it doesn't really have one of those
things that catches the product does
anything I noticed but the concealer
seems really nice it wasn't like cakey
on me it looked very kind of glowy and
fresh I'm definitely going to continue
using that really liked it sorry the
sun's going in and out but I'm doing
like a casual vlogging setup again wait
for me out somewhere I also got the face
gloss this is such a weird idea for a
product by get it it's an all-over color
'less gloss that delivers high shine to
the skin and I think I would use this
for tops of my cheekbones when I don't
want like a colored highlighter and
mainly I think I'll use it on my eyelids
like over an eyeshadow or even by itself
I think like a glossy eyelid is really
nice and I guess you could use a
Vaseline or something but I feel like
this is made for that purpose so it
won't just kind of smudge all over your
face I have one from Kevin O'Connor but
it's very like shimmery gloss the type
of Glossop's with like this or in it and
this is just a clear gloss I thought
that'd be really cool to try but I don't
know yet how like sticky is and how
annoying is where I haven't tried it I
felt a bit different so there's the only
few things I got some milk so I thought
there weren't any things that kind of
stood out to me I looked at the cream
bronzer but it looked too like muddy and
just too big for me so those two from
milk come looking for trying
oh this isn't from Sephora either
everything's just in my Sephora bag but
this is actually from the hotel that we
were staying in in Brooklyn it was the
one Brooklyn Bridge hotel I think the
brand is kindling because that's what it
says on it but this is the smell oh look
at their own okay so it's one hotel
brand I think that's percent sheer musk
an earthy tree Moss eucalyptus leaves
salt sea seda wood and transparent oak
wood at one with nature
so they pump out their own smell into
the hotel it's incredible and then we
found out that they do their own Candle
of the scent so Anna and I both rushed
to the shop to buy one it's a very
pretty like white frosted glass candle
eye smells so good it's so like earthy
but fresh
very unique oh my god I love it so much
skinny wanted candles I don't want to
burn I might save it like a special
occasion but comes in this cute little
bag I'm very happy about that
back to Sephora again this is a bit of a
rogue purchase it's the doctor yard plus
Sarah midden Sarah Madden
I got looked at this and was like mmm I
like him was erisa and then Anna was
like oh yeah lots of people recommend
that I think Caroline likes it and
that's all you've got to say to get me
to buy something I had this and another
moisturizer in my basket and I ended up
great for this one it comes in a gel and
a liquid and a cream and I got the cream
version and I just tried it on the back
of my hand and it seemed like a really
nice like simple moisturizer I love that
it comes in a tube like this and it just
felt like in my hand I haven't used it
yet because I bought one from Grazia
that I've been using but yeah that's
been really nice so looking forward to
just having that I feel like I hold
moisturizers you can never have enough
you know the little kind of oil of doom
as you're checking out before that has
all the travel minis I always like to
look there to see because we just don't
have many like minis in the UK it's not
something we do I know space and care
trying to do more of that but I saw a
clinic take the day of cleansing oil in
a mini and just thought that would be so
hardly when I'm traveling I love this as
like a first cleanser just to get all my
makeup off and then I go back in with
like a gel or a bomb but that is such a
cute little mini to have and then I also
got another catch luminous dewy skin
mist because I finished this just before
I went to New York it's a lovely like
milky glowy finishing spray I wouldn't
even say it's a setting spray it's more
like a hydrating glowing spray you can
use it first for like moisture or if you
want to do it to put your makeup I
wouldn't do it if you'd like done a full
face and you don't to mess up your
makeup because it is very wet but I love
it like a finishing like glow spray I
picked up a garbage sugar lip scrub some
bites mainly because when I was on the
trip my lips were really dry and I
wanted to use it I do get dry lips and
I've only got lip scrubs I love at the
moment so Continental pot and I really
like no gob a lip balm it's a this is a
very like runny lip scrub I would say
it's not too harsh which I like I tried
it when I was out there and it works a
treat I'm going to keep that at my
skincare stash here two more things from
Sephora
has got a hunt for this because Ana
picked up the last one the Anastasio
Beverly Hills I shadow in caramel
there's a lovely viewer of ours who came
to our map Meetup and she was wearing
just this eyeshadow all over her lids
and under I know mascara no eyeliner
anything she looks incredible by very
different coloring to her but I just
still think it's a really nice like warm
brown eyeshadow let me get out show you
guys it's just lovely like as it says
caramel eyeshadow so we went on the hub
for that and I'm very happy I found it a
wall that wall out of the way and really
liked it the first before we went into
we went to the Urban Decay counter just
to see if they had the new native heat
palette and it wasn't on display so we
didn't even ask and I think it was like
the last day we went in just for us to
get the dry shampoo and I just said to
one of the ladies do you have to make it
heat palette like we just assumed she'd
say no it's not out yet actually I think
amateur it is not out yet is it and she
went yeah it's in the drawer and they
basically just don't have a display yet
for it so she open the drawer and there
were so many Urban Decay Naked heat
palettes I'm so excited I know everyone
like hopes up new Urban Decay palette a
lot but I haven't felt this way about
one of their palettes quite a long time
like since the original Naked palette so
this is an expansion of their naked
collection let me show you inside
I think the PR said she was going to
sell me one but I just couldn't wait
because I don't think we have some in
the UK yet this is what the actual
palette looks like I really like the
packaging kind of looks like 3d effect
quite heavy but I don't really tend to
travel with these sort of palettes
anyway I just love the shade range in
here I'm sure you guys have seen this so
much already online but it's just full
of really nice pretty warm eyes shadows
today I'm wearing this one with that one
and that one I think I think I would
pretty much where all of these platform
maybe the lightest one I don't tend to
wear like bone shadow colors and this
high life is not really for me but I
absolutely love all of these shadows and
I can't wait to play with it and wearing
them today and I think they look really
nice they come to the brushed I never
use I kind of wish the shadow just came
in like a smaller packaging without the
brush but very happy I got that it was a
very exciting day we were literally like
no way she's like yes whereas it was
very funny I think you have to be there
okay so that's everything from Sephora
and now I have a massive bag of glossy
of products to go through I first
discovered blockier when it just
I went to New York my friend Gemma's any
of you've been following me for a long
time you may remember I think if logged
and I did some stuff on my blog we went
to the show room it was when glassy I
just had like five products and that was
all you could get and I bought them and
I think I was quite disappointed and
then the mist
I felt did nothing the bomb I wasn't
that into the priming moisturizer I
thought and it was all just very basic
so I kind of lost my experimental glossy
area thought it was really hyped up but
it had just launched I think since then
the brand has been developed so well
it's a very like trendy skincare and
makeup brand and the whole shopping
experience is very unique you go into
the showroom in New York and you kind of
tick off on a list everything you want
it's literally a showroom and then you
go to the till and they put everything
that you've picked into these that cute
little pink bubble wrap bags and it's
all just very cool and different but the
products are also really good I think a
lot has changed a lot of those original
products still exist and they're they're
not for me I don't love the mist I don't
love the priming moisturizer I have
changed my mind about the balm calm so
let me show you what I got I also
watched a few reviews online I've like
seen Caroline's and Anna's Ingrid did a
review recently I just watched loads of
videos so I kind of knew what I wanted
to try I did go a bit crazy so I got
three of these of these bags they're
very handy to keep for traveling so let
me just pull out whatever is here in no
particular order this is the priming
moisturizing priming moisturizer rich so
I've tried the original crime in
moisturizer didn't like it just thought
it was really boring there's nothing to
my skin heard so much about this this is
more of a luxurious face cream it says
it's definitely thicker and more
moisturizing I love how this feels on my
skin and I love how it makes my skin
feel is that the same thing you know I
mean I like applying it and I like how
it makes my skin feel afterwards
although very strangely this makes my
nose area all around here go really red
when I first apply it and I can't figure
out why the redness does tend to go by
the morning I haven't tried using this
yet and the morning just because I don't
want to go out the house of the red face
or red nose it's so weird it's literally
just my nose and these like bits Nick's
in my nose very strange bye do you like
this I'm going to kind of keep trying to
Alan see what happens this is something
I really really wanted to try because
everyone's been raving about it the
milky jelly cleanser it says its
conditioning the face wash I was very
skeptical about this just like it just
sounds weird like a milky and I really
use like milky products but it's
actually more of like a gel to oil it's
very similar to the Askia one maybe a
bit more like simpler I'd say like less
heavy a bit lighter really really like
actually and I bought one I was going to
buy two just in case I loved it which I
do but I think gloss is coming to UK
soon and you can buy online so yeah I
really like this I'm definitely going to
continue using it also I would use this
as a second cleanse not as like a makeup
remover what else is in here
oh I got a badge when you go to the till
it glossy er you can buy like jumpers or
badges there's like a few merchandise
bits and I got a little badge that just
says that you can really see but it's a
little like pink G and I've got that
nice on my denim jacket also in here are
two of the generation G sheer matte
lipsticks I think I've got 3 is one on
one of the other bags so they come in
these little boxes this one is like I
think this is like the personally one so
it is a sheer color which I really like
it's very easy to wear yeah this is like
a slowly purpley pink color very pretty
if you're a bit scared of lipstick these
would be great for you this one is cake
which is the one I'm wearing today it
doesn't really show up on my lips that
well I think it's too similar to my lip
color pretty nude yeah I have to like
put it on I put quite a few layers for
it to show up on my lips I'm not sure I
would repurchase that one just because
it really doesn't do much my lips but I
guess it does like even out the color a
little bit
ok next side I got both of the masks I
wanted to try them both I've heard good
things about both of them this is the
moisturizing moon mask this is a
hydrating mask says for on for 20
minutes and take off it looks like the
kind of white cream I've tried this one
if weird because some people are like oh
my going to make my skin look amazing I
didn't feel like it did that much when I
first tried it I'm going to keep using
it and see if I notice a difference in
my skin I feel like I always feel that
way about moisturizing mask I'm never
sure if they actually do much to my skin
this is quite similar to the origins
drink up hydrating mask thing I love the
name though moon masks vocal and the
other masks I got is the mega green's
galaxy pack this is more like a green
clay mask which is really good if you've
been a little bit spotty if use this one
as well
is nice I put it on with a brush not
realizing that she has like exfoliating
beads in it so it's probably quite nice
if you rub it on with your hands or wash
it off with your hand so you can
exfoliate at the same time as like doing
a mask yeah I really like this I would
use again it didn't leave my skin
feeling like sensitive or anything yeah
I've got the other lipstick in here
which is zip and this is the red one and
I actually said to Anna on this trip I
really want to find like a red lips that
you can just put on without and look in
the mirror I think this is going to be
that lipstick it's like a sheer red but
it's matte so I hate glossy red so
that's good okay also in here are the
balm calms like I said I tried this
originally when it launched and I was a
bit like I don't really get it it's a
bit like Vaseline in a tube but Alice
did to me recently that she likes it
because it's almost like a matte lip
balm and once she said that I was like
oh I need to try it again and she's
right it is like a matte lip balm so it
has a kind of slippy nurse feel like a
silicone lip balm like Vaseline or
something but it's kind of matte so I
think it really flatters my lips like
now I've tried it again I really like it
I got the plain one just so I have in my
handbag but they also now do flavors
this is the coconut balm calm these come
in like fancy packaging and this is the
one I've been using loads I haven't
really used the plain one yet I've
already used so much of this coconut one
and it just it might feel like being a
child I have a coconut lip balm from
boots oh it's so so yummy they do have a
good birthday cake one which is like a
little bit sickly and they have a mint
one which is nice cotton balls maybe
strawberry or something but yeah I
really like those okay only one whore by
the philosophy of stuff okay in this
last bag is two product first of all a
serum they have quite a few serums and
one of them like I've had quite bad
reviews online one of them's not really
relevant to my skin
this one was anyone I really thought
like called out to me is the superb and
hyaluronic acid and vitamin b5 serum so
it's really good for skin like mine
which is dehydrated and dull and I said
she really liked this I love the name
Super Bowl and try not to think about
the name and the packaging it is quite
small and I've heard people say that you
get a tiny amount of product in here I'm
really liking it be fasting is very
similar to the ordinary like cotton
balls cool bit like the hyaluronic acid
serum is very similar to that so if
that's easier please get hold of I would
getting that but I'm definitely going to
use this and I've been enjoying using it
so far and then finally a product which
is brand new for them as one was very
excited about it in the showroom I
really like the packaging of this in
like a clear plastic slightly pink box
this is their SPS this is the glossy
invisible shield daily sunscreen it's as
broad spectrum SPF 35 35 it absolutely
fine you don't need to assisity on your
face
it comes in a very easy-to-use pump and
it's almost like or it sort of loads on
that so annoying it's like a clear gel
which is really nice I've been using the
rush Jose and beli oz cream which is
great when you're on holiday but for an
everyday Sun cream it is quite like sun
creamy it's a very heavy cream and it
doesn't your skin a little bit white
this is completely sheer it's not greasy
it's not sticky it's a lovely lovely
formula so I think they've done really
well with that
you said that I asked your primer and
before your foundation I really liked
that probably should have up to you but
it's coming to UK soon so I was just up
then is that everything that is
everything I do I bought some really
good bit I'm so happy with my purchases
and I'm really excited to like start
using them all I feel like I used to go
and hoard things I just didn't need I
try to really think about what products
I wanted to try and what I would
actually enjoy using I think these
things will fit into my collection very
well so I really hope you guys enjoyed
seeing my bought in New York as I said
if you haven't seen the vlog please go
have a watch I loved it and also if you
haven't seen my how to throw a summer
party video I put that video up whilst I
was in New York and something funny
happened to the algorithm in YouTube it
took like eight minutes to show up on my
profile so I feel like something dodgy
went on and really low views I know it
was an odd video but I put so much
effort into that video I planned it for
months and I loved it and all the
comments are amazing thank you to anyone
who's watched it but if you're kind of
put off by add videos please please give
it a chance because I think it's like
one of my best videos and I wouldn't
want you guys to just not watch it
because it's an ad I think you should
give it a shot because you might be
pleasantly surprised I'm really proud of
that video so I would love it if you
took the time to go and have a watch I'm
now off to the gleam summer party which
is why I more like dressed up summery
and I have loads of makeup on thank you
guys so much for watching please don't
