doing well today today's video was meant
to be a sit-down video about how we are
planning our home renovation and it was
gonna be really informative and full of
tips but didn't if you can tell I feel
so weirdly like mellow today like I was
filming this video and I just thought
Instagram I'm saying like what do you do
when you film in a video and you just
don't feel very sprightly and I feel
like everything I was saying was so
monotone like it is now that's where we
kind of want to spend a lot of our
budget on the kitchen I don't know I
wasn't feeling it and whenever I film a
video that I don't feel like it's the
best it can be
I always just kind of want to stop and
stop forcing it and someone messaged me
saying like don't do a sit-down video
then just like take a break have a cup
of tea maybe do a vlog it feels more you
so I'm going to take her advice thank
you to whoever message me that but I
haven't done a vlog like this in ages
just because there's been so much like
personal stuff going on like with the
house and I don't know I'm like a bit
more reluctant these days to share so
much of myself I just think the internet
world has changed a bit and it feels a
little bit more judgy so I'm a bit more
afraid if I'm honest of like vlogging as
much as I used to but I also really
enjoy blogging and I just thought I
would start this and see where it goes I
don't have to put it up if I don't want
to but maybe I'll just do a bit of
logging over the next day or so so in
that video about house renovation maybe
I'll just share like a bit of it now of
what I was planning because actually it
probably would have made a boring video
just by itself anyway this part is
attacking me I was just talking about
kind of things to think about before you
start a house renovation because I'm
going to be putting up my renovation
vlogs soon so I just thought like to
talk to you guys about what we did
before we started the work and really
what it just comes down to I think the
main takeaway tip from that video would
have been about thinking about your
space and how to make it work for you
like so I'm just going to find my notes
from that video thinking about your
space yeah so like how you prioritize
the space in your house I was saying how
me and rich are really like downstairs
people we love
a really sociable home where you have
people around and you kind of watch TV
together or you people like gather
around in the kitchen watch your cookies
so our house is pretty like bottom-heavy
there isn't much space at all upstairs
there isn't much like a corridor around
the rooms but there's a big open space
downstairs and that's because we
prioritize those kind of more sociable
areas at the house whereas some people
spend more time upstairs in their
bedroom and they want that to be like
the important part of the house and then
like prioritizing the things that are
important so for me I kind of narrowed
it down into three things
practicality because we're hopefully
going to be having kids in this house so
making it practical and not filling it
full of things that are just gonna be a
nightmare when we have kids too sociable
making it so it's a really sociable
space and then three stylists just
because of my job and I work from home
and take photos a lot at home there's
always that like in the back of my mind
I'm thinking like what the light is like
and stuff like that and I'm trying not
to let it control me too much because my
home is more important then taking
photos for Instagram but there's just
little things where I'm like oh that
would be a good space for a full-length
mirror if I need to do it outfit shop I
also then went on to talk a little bit
about finding inspiration and I've
spoken about that before like saving
pictures on Instagram and using pin Ches
to like search for more specific things
like if you're looking for five tile
fireplace Pinterest is a good place to
use and I really enjoyed over the past
kind of year or so ripping things out of
magazines so I thought I would show you
the things that I ripped out of
magazines I use like a sharpie to make
notes and also I find these really
helpful to refer to if I need to like
show the builders or decorators and be
like this is what I mean
so let me show you the things that I've
pulled out of magazines because you guys
might find this interesting
okay so here are well I threw away a lot
of the papers when we moved into my
parents but I had a massive wad of these
that I pulled out from magazines so for
example I put shelving so I like the
look of the shelving in that one bath
tiles we actually are not going with
these in the end but I do really like
those side table positions so like where
it is next to the sofa I really like
dark wall on the back of a bedroom
that's actually a chalkboard wall but I
just like the idea of a dark wall behind
the bedroom sink and I think I was just
referring to like the things that kind
of sit on top
this page it was this shower screen that
I liked it's also really good for
getting actual like brands and retailers
so like pages like this I think it was
more for the brands stools with I'll
into tiles so like the tiles inside the
island I don't think we're doing this
anymore but I like the idea that this
one I liked the the shelves like they
look like just those IKEA shelves but
they've been painted same color as the
wall I think that it's really nice this
I really liked this glass kind of window
so this is the sort of thing that we
looked into and then realize that it's
just too expensive for us to do I would
have loved to do that behind the sofa
between the kind of hallway and our
lounge but it's just so much more extra
building work that we can't fit into our
budget but looks really cool this one I
liked the built-in bench where the
dining table is so I don't think that's
something we could do straight away but
one day we might be able to have a
built-in bench it's all to do is like
compromising what you can do now what
you can save for later again I think
that's just the kind of crystal style
that I like this one I saved because I
really like this kind of clean gray
minimalist kind of bathroom look this
one I saved
I think because of the parquet flooring
again more kind of critter star doors
we're actually going for aluminium I
think they're warmer and definitely more
affordable than steel and then these
pages I think I kept because I wanted to
remember all the brands again like tiles
tile inspiration it's just good for
keeping some brand names for when I need
to buy some more stuff so I often refer
back to those and when it comes to paint
I think I've made a lot of decisions
quite early on compared to most people
I've heard or friends who are doing up
houses who they're builders say like we
need their bought we need the bathroom
in two weeks time and then they go and
like start looking into bathrooms where
I wanted to have all those decisions
made beforehand because I know my
personality doesn't work well when I'm
kind of like rushed into something so
although people thought I was crazy like
picking paint samples when we hadn't
even started the building work it's
quite comforting for me to know that I
pretty much know all of those things
already both paint samples everyone told
me
you paint it onto paper and then put it
on the wall and I didn't listen because
I always felt like the paint looks
different on paper but I got a massive
pad of like a three or something ink
paper and it actually does make a
difference because then you can if you
put blue tack on the back you can move
it around the house and see what it
looks like in different lights paint was
actually one of the hardest things so
far but I think I've decided what we're
having
anyway that is all the renovation chat
for now as I said I've been vlogging
every day going to the house and taking
clips on my phone so I will be sharing
that next week or the week after
probably it's all really exciting so I
don't know why I'm in this funny mood
but I will vlog as much as I can today I
don't even know what I'm doing now I
feel so unmotivated to do anything I
think what I'm gonna do is write some
blog posts because that doesn't really
like require outward like extra Vernis
hopefully you guys know what I mean some
days you just have those days where you
just feel a bit like a mute it's
actually one o'clock so I'm gonna go get
some lunch I fancy a bit of sushi my
sisters working from my parents house
today so I'm gonna go see if she wants
them to excuse the absolute mess but
look I'm back in this room I don't know
if you guys remember it and we want it
so messy so just like changed a few
things over here and I've got a table to
work at and my BT desk here
I just popped out and got sushi for
lunch and eat it downstairs my kitchen
my sister and then I talked with Anna
I saw it hence the stories that she was
awake in vegas hangover so I called her
straight away I wanted to hear about her
night out that was really nice to have a
quick catch up with her I'm gonna now do
some work I need to apply some emails I
need to write some blog posts I feel a
bit of a failure today not filming a
video it's okay sometimes it just goes
out I think I'm going out tonight for
dinner my friend is here he lives in
Stockholm and he's in London for the day
so we're gonna meet him for dinner
I have very greasy hair but I might have
to wash it when I get back you work here
so yeah today's just being a bit more
mellow but good news is we've just
ordered our bathroom and that's arriving
next week which is so exciting I can't
wait to show you guys okay I'm gonna go
out to meet rich and our friend JC who I
live with at uni but I just need to
quickly top up my makeup because I'm
looking a little bit worse the way I'm
just putting on a bit of my own bare
minerals concealer still loving this
concealer sorry for the mess behind me
I'm gonna use a little bit of this new
Chanel bronzer which is the LePage
bronzer it's so pretty it's like striped
it gives a really nice like warm buns
that makes it look like you've got a
proper tan did I say that we're going to
Home Slice which is like my favorite
pizza restaurant in London absolutely
love it I can't wait mmm
having a pizza phages this weekend is
the royal wedding we're having a
surprise party for my friend Esther days
xxx and we're gonna be having like a
barbecue and watching the Royal Wedding
and I'm kind of internet into it I'm not
like against the royal family I'm not
like obsessed with of I'm somewhere in
the middle and I quite like Meghan so
I'm looking forward to that I'm also
wearing the Chanel eyeshadow palette the
juice is very golden glittery but this
top color
I just think it's so nice for like an
all-over eye shadow just topping up what
I had on this morning think what I'm
gonna do is also vlog tomorrow because I
feel like I haven't really done anything
today I'm just having such a weird like
I'm feeling so unmotivated today it's
very strange but hopefully tomorrow I'll
just be in a better mood really enjoying
this mascara as well it's very fluttery
this is the it cosmetics superhero
mascara right I'm gonna drive there so I
better leave
thank you oh my god did you really need
to finish the dinner it was really nice
such yummy pizza really nice to catch up
with old friends as well we were having
proper like uni reminiscing times me me
and all the lads
it wasn't me odd for boys just like the
old times is that guy but gives us a
ticket delivery man delivery we decided
to pop into the house on the way back
from dinner but you guys will see this
in my renovation vlog good morning
everyone it is Thursday and wow I feel
so different yesterday it's crazy like
until you come out of a weird like
moment you don't realize how weird you
were like yesterday I just felt so low
and down and unmotivated and not myself
at all and literally I've woken up this
morning feeling completely different so
I'm really happy about that I haven't
washed my hair yet because suddenly
realized I'm working out today at like 2
o'clock so it doesn't make sense to wash
my hair and then work out so I'm
literally on the road it's so bad
but I've got my PT at 2 o'clock today so
just put it up in a barn with a head I'm
already in my workout clothes and I'm
gonna work this morning I'm gonna get
some blog posts written annoyingly I
can't film a video properly because my
hair yeah I just feel so much better
today it's sunny and I can't explain it
I have lots of like organizing and
clearing up to do this room is a mess
I've got loads of makeup on the desk of
like things that I've been said that I'm
trying and there's like when you open
decay eyeshadow palette actually let me
show you this while it's here that this
is the beached eyeshadow palette and
it's so beautiful I'm thinking about
doing a makeup look with it because it's
quite different to always got all the
warm shadows I would normally wear but
also these amazing blue so they cannot
do the video with that I've got like a
new era grasp powder
Anthony Charlotte Tilbury stuff so maybe
I'll show you guys that in a bit but I
need to sort out this room badly I'm
gonna head downstairs first and have
some breakfast
I spoke to my friend Hannah last night
on the phone yeah that's probably where
I feel bit better as well she's now
living in Australia as you guys know and
the time difference makes it so
difficult to talk we literally spent
like two weeks chasing each other
each other's calls because it's like so
last that she called me at 11:30 my time
so the timings really really tricky I
kind of hate it but we had a really good
call and it was really nice to chat to
her hey I'm gonna get some breakfast one
of the funny things about living back
home is that I get to open all of my
parcels because I've never had any let
PR parcels sent to my home so they
either go to clean to my peer boxes my
parents house my mom normally opens them
and like lays everything out for me it's
really funny but now I'm here I can
actually open them myself so I've got a
couple of things this morning
through everything usually comes with a
little note or the press release saying
what the product is so this is a
Father's Day gift from Yves O'Hare
daily shampoo and crop scratchers don't
know that means this is cute with a
little gift set for your dad okay what's
in this box
let me go get scissors in here in thank
you spa sent me a really nice towel good
timing
going on holiday next week here's the
press release Summer 2018 two of our
best selling products wet skin moisture
miracle and foaming shower bursts
they're like wrapped up in this town
think these are available at boots if I
remember sexy spot I like a shower first
thing that's a contrarian for your
shower and isn't this really nice
Terrell and it's got my initials on it
that's cute a lot of personalized gift
that's actually really good I'm going to
head out holiday with me thank sanctuary
spa that's all that's here this morning
I'll probably get a few more today so
I'll show you those if they come okay
now I need to tidy up this room so I'm
gonna sit you guys down over here
somewhere and oh my God look how tired I
look this is quite early in the morning
and not wearing much makeup gonna tidy
up this room now city for
oh this is so interesting I got sent
this yesterday these are new products
from Ostia and it's the first time
they've gone into tanning this is a
turning mist you meant to spray over
your face and then just let it sink in
and it's an adaptive tanning mist and
then these are drops which you add into
your moisturizer and I love Oski as a
brand so I really trust them so I'm
definitely in for to trying those I
think they'll be really nice and kind of
natural I also got sent mist which I was
very excited about well not necessarily
for me but just the products in general
its son of a beach Umbra spray from way
and the idea is a bit like I don't if
you guys remember Sun in from like the
90s but you spray it in your hair and
then the Sun that will naturally lighten
your hair apparently this has pineapple
juice what else was in here pineapple
coconut water and lemon but I put as an
Instagram and one of my blogger friends
replied being like it's also got
shitloads of peroxide in it so maybe be
careful look into the ingredients before
you use this I don't think would work on
my hair because first of all my head
probably got orange or so my hair is
very dry naturally but if you have like
good-quality blonde hair it probably
will just highlight your blonde bits
better in the Sun but it's a cool idea
and I like the packaging they also set
these sunglasses which are the key and
desi Perkins collaboration I mean I wish
I could get away with sunglasses like
this they look ridiculous on me this is
what's new from Charlotte Tilbury this
is the stuff that came in a safe but
mine didn't open I'd send it back in in
there to send the product back so I
think is a little bit late you might
have seen these somewhere else but she's
got a couple of new like cream blush
highlight palettes which are really nice
it covered this like funky brush which
apparently you're supposed to use
because it's like can you see it like
shapes to your cheekbones you're meant
to go out at that and then put it
straight on which I don't know if that
seems a bit crazy to me but I will give
it a go and then there's also two
eyeshadow palettes as well this one's
got a bit of sparkle in it whereas this
one's a bit more like warmth
this one's really nice actually
transform eyes I really like this
palette and then there's also a new
mascara and legendary lashes volume -
she might made this because I think this
mascara got a lot of negative feedback
I was always actually a big fan of this
but everyone else said it kind of fell
down and smudged everywhere so maybe
this one's a bit more like water
resistant I'm not sure I will give it a
go but I'm always a big fan of her
mascaras so yeah looking forward to try
it all of these new bits especially this
like crazy brush I'm gonna start editing
this vlog so that I can get it ready for
the weekend this is my sister's we're
making lunch salad avocado cucumber
bacon and egg because I'm working out so
I need something protein ok I've caused
my PT's garage and we're gonna workout
in there today I'll try and film some
stuff
feel the cold wind on my face it's all
around beliefs know this is where I
wanna be
I'm skipping stones into this I'm home
oh my god I'm so tired okay my camera
died of battery but I had a really good
workout and I actually quite enjoyed it
if you guys read my blog post recently
on working out and like my relationship
with exercise I will link it down below
if you haven't read it that was anyway
yeah I quite enjoyed it today I just got
the shower and I washed my hair and I'm
just doing my skincare I've got another
bottle of the skin seems to cause a
chain tense' fire because I love it so
much I completely finished up a bottle
I've been using this recently which is
the Estee Lauder day where I cream and
it's a nice gel Okun's very refreshing
and then my clinic see it from West Rosa
which I've so almost finished and pretty
sure or backup of this but I'm loving
this moisturizer at the moment oh so
good to do a skincare after the shower
when your skin's like feeling a little
tight so the first thing I always do so
many of you have also asked me to do a
video on my hair care routine but I'm
too embarrassed because I'll just get so
many comments being like you are killing
your hair because seriously I just let
it dry and then I straighten it I get
your braids Rider
but I washed it with the idk products
which I'm still really enjoying and then
when I come out the shower and you get
the towel for a little bit I kind of
like squeeze it out and then I spray on
loads of this so I'm halfway through
this bottle and I used so much of it
already it's the way it smoothes spray I
really like it so it basically just like
go to town this smells good too and then
I use my wet brush which is the best
thing ever this will get through any
knots I don't like the tangle teezer it
never worked for me this one look it
literally glides through no pulling if
they had this when I
kid it would have been life changing so
I just brush through so if I was leaving
my hair curly I wouldn't do this because
it would just ruin all the curls
I'd probably brush it in the shower to
get rid of the knots and then leave it
when I come out and I would like scrunch
product into it but because I'm gonna be
doing it straight I just brush through
it and it kind of like puts it like kind
of puts all the product through the hair
at the same time then I just leave it
literally like this for about half an
hour forty minutes and I let it dry
naturally and then I just straighten it
and that is it I don't know what I'm
gonna do with my hair next week when I
go on holiday but I'm gonna leave it
curly for the week because one is just
so much easier if I'm swimming in a pool
every day there's no put straight in in
it also my nice honey she's got very
similar hair that I had probably a
little less curlier but very similar and
I'm really noticing her kind of get her
complex just like I did and I want to
try and like to teach her that I came to
have curly hair because I've noticed
it's it's not so much her because she
like loves wearing her hair straight for
special occasions and I said to her
don't you light on your hair curly she
started just like it's straight because
it feels nice which I totally get but
also I've noticed that when her hair is
straight like on her birthday or
whatever people say like honey your hair
looks so nice and they only really ever
compliment about her hair when it's
straight which is really interesting so
I think that's why she thinks her hair
is nicer when it's straight so I'm gonna
wear it curly because she kind of like
looks after me a bit which is very cute
she always like books away matching
outfits with me so I thought if I wear
my hair curly all week on holiday then
she might like curly hair a bit more but
I don't know what I'm gonna do because
the roots are so curly like you could
already see it starting to go but like
crazy up here the curls at the root are
like proper proper curly but then it
kind of like because I straighten it so
much that ends are really damaged so I
don't know what I'll do but I'm only
going with family I'm going away with my
sister and the kids so that we reform
okay I'm gonna end the vlog here because
I'm gonna go do some work and have some
dinner and stuff thank you guys so much
for watching
so if it's been a bit of a random one
but I didn't want to just miss the video
entirely and I thought a vlog was better
than a weird like monotone video about
home renovation so thank you for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
