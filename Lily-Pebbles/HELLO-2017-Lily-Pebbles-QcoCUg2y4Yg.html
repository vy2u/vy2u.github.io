Year's Eve and me and rich are hosting a
little get-together tonight there's a
group of about eight of us kind of
give-and-take there's always a few extra
people's that there's like a solid eight
of us that have a little New Year's Eve
tradition and every year we get together
and take turns to host a little party
we hate going out and you've like one
year I went to the millennium wheel and
it was like the worst thing ever so busy
and so many drunk people and it's just
awful so since that night I've always
said that I want to stay in but I like
acknowledging it I'm actually quite a
big fan of New Year's Eve I get quite
emotional about it I just like the idea
of like going into a new year and I like
to acknowledge it and not just kind of
stay in and do nothing rich and I have
never been able to host before because
our flat is too small to fit eight
people in but this year we are hosting
at my parents house I've just packed up
a suitcase for the night I've done my
makeup but I haven't done my hair I'm
just going to leave it like that until
later I've just come over to Gemma's to
borrow tablecloth because I didn't have
one and I'm wearing my hashtag no makeup
day jumper and then I got here and look
hashtag no makeup day I'm now at my
parents and the first thing I want to do
is prep the lamb we've got a shoulder of
lamb and I'm gonna kind of prep all now
because takes four hours to cook I don't
have to put it into later but if it's
all done I'll just put it in the fridge
with foil then it's good to go I've got
a baking tray here and I filled it with
carrots leeks red onion garlic and
rosemary and I have a lamb shoulder here
that I'm going to put here on top and
then put olive oil salt pepper more
garlic and then that is gonna slow roast
for about four hours
the lamb is all ready to go I'm gonna
wrap it in foil for a bit still quite
early and
I'm gonna put it in the oven later and
it should be really easy to just like
pull apart when it's ready I've also
been making gravlax which is basically
like cured salmon it's this whole
process you do for about three days
where you cover a fresh bit of salmon
with salt and sugar and dill and it kind
of cooks it a little bit it's not
completely raw salmon but it's so so
delicious and then you kind of wash off
the salt and so I did that about two or
three days ago and I'm gonna slice up
now and give it a try I really hope it
tastes good
Salmons in here is like under here we've
been pressing it down with loads of jars
so what it looks like it's out now I'm
going to slice it up and see how it
tastes now the key is to slice this
really thin I have never ever done this
in my life but I'm just gonna go for it
I'm just setting up a party time banner
that I got from tiger so you need to put
all these gold letters on here but rich
we need to find somewhere to hang it
because it needs to be like hot I was
gonna say there but there's no nothing
to hang it on here's the banner party
time the theme we're going for this
year's black and gold we've just kind of
set up the table eight of us I'm gonna
try and make this look nice in a minute
oK we've managed to hang the party time
here I also forgot in my bag of goodies
I thought some like cool plates these
are all from Tiger I've got some straws
oh I've got some Oh which we've got more
handy things like glucose mr. bunting
and some confetti for the table we've
created a couple of surprises tonight
that I can tell you guys because no
one's here yet but they don't know the
first one is a hat game you're going to
think this is really weird but I know my
friends and I know they're gonna love it
I've printed out this bit of paper so
this bit of gold card I'm gonna give to
one of my friends when we sit down to
eat and it says Happy New Year to ensure
we all enter 2017 in style we'll all be
given a special hat to wear throughout
the evening the first person to find
their hat gets
privilege of swapping their hat for
someone else's the last person to find
their hat has to do a shot or a forfeit
happy hat hunting the first clue is
under your chair and then under people's
chair I'm gonna blue tack I've made
these little clues and basically it's
really hard to show you I've like pinned
them all together but the first clue
will lead you to somewhere else in the
house and there's like three clues per
person to lead them to their hat I'll
show you the hats that I bought this is
the first one so whoever gets this hats
has to wear it all night then we have
the brown sparkly hat then we have the
Tartan hat we have the Jamaican hat we
have the gold sparkly hat and secretly
hoping I get this one the furry kind of
grizzly bear hat and Santa's hat so
these hats
yeah they basically have to wear these
hats all night and the clues will take
them so let me show you are like unclip
this one vroom vroom engines go so
that's gonna be by the car keys how do
you like your in the morning so that'll
be by the eggs and then did the postman
come today and that'll be in the post
box so it will be like a crazy
hide-and-seek hopefully one we were
crazy to go find the Hat another little
thing I'm doing is I'm going to blue tag
these to the bottom of the plate so I'm
a halfway through dinner I can tell
everyone to look under their plate and
we've got a few like nice questioning
kind of things here to go through so
what's the biggest lesson you've learned
this year what was the best thing that
happened to you this year
and I made all of these a funny memory
you have from this year what was your
happiest day in 2016 watching most
looking forward to in 2017 your favorite
moment on a holiday or a trip this year
name something you're proud that you did
in 2016 and what's one of your news
resolutions for 2017 so it's just
something like you to do during dinner
so yeah I'm gonna blue tuck these under
our main plates and hopefully no one
will see okay so this is what its gonna
be like under the plate holy that's
really funny they'll never know it's
there
time now I'm gonna stick the first clues
under all the chairs so I don't know
who's gonna get which one this is an
example of one of them no one likes a
dirty dish so that's gonna lead them to
the dishwasher
hopefully just put the lamb in the oven
that's gonna be in there for hours and
I'm now making a kind of Asian slaw and
everyone else is bringing sides and
salads and stuff I'm still cooking away
I've just made a slaw I'll show you guys
in a minute and now I'm gonna make some
guacamole I'm gonna make the guacamole
for when people arrive we've got this
table set up here with loads of drinks
I'm gonna put the crisps out but Doritos
I've got like corn chili crackers kettle
chips limes for the drink
nuts crying about everything the pretty
straws here I love these and loads of
alcohol mainly leftover from our wedding
and some cool beers that we bought lots
of gin toffee vodka just in case I need
to do any shots that would be my choice
now guys look at my hands after making B
treat salads they literally like
incorporate handed out she doesn't even
look as bad on camera as it does in real
life how annoying
luckily I'm having a party of friends
bruschetta Ben's arrived and he's
brought with him some balloons from
Oscars den there we've got black gold
and silver or purple balloons and we've
got them in this corner and we've got
them in this corner and some in the
other room and they look so good and
Rob's connecting the music and Ben's
here I was so disappointed
yesterday yes there's a bit paper on
your plate can use read out to her on
today's she gets better soon she just
sat there read out loud you know yeah to
ensure we all enter 2017 in style we
will all be given a special house too
after an evening the first person to
find their hat gets the privilege of
swapping their hats to someone else's
the last lesson to find that hat has to
do a shot will forfeit happy hat
something
the first clue is unreal urge go
when it seems your hopes and dreams
it's nearly midnight we're gonna to
Spago
