rich hi we have another video together
in so long but I thought today a special
occasion because we're doing a
his-and-hers gift guide obviously as you
guys know christmas is coming up but
also its riches 30th at the end of
november and then it's my 30th at the
beginning of december so this time of
year is always like a big like gifting
time for us as a couple
also if you don't celebrate Christmas
there's lots of other opportunities to
be gifting this time of year so I
thought it'd be cool if I put together a
his-and-hers gift guide I picked out
some products that I would like to
receive and then rich did the same
picked out things he thinks he would
like and other guys would like so we're
gonna be talking through ten gifts in
total we're on a very kindly sponsored
this video so we'd be able to pick a
born product each to feature they've got
a really cool campaign this time of year
that's all about the moments that matter
and gifting kind of salon products so
you're spending less time in the salon
and more time on moments and things that
you actually want to be spending your
time on okay so I'm gonna go first and
the product that I picked from Braun is
the silk Apple 9 skin spa you guys know
I absolutely love epilating I think this
would make a really good gift we're a
very open couple we talk about our
hairiness I would love to get this as a
gift this is such a good product and so
many my friends at desperate striae
plating so I know that they'd really
like to receive it as well this one
comes with two exfoliating brush heads
and also the new deep massage pad which
is so great to use in the shower with
like your favorite shower oil or shower
gel
I've been epilating for ages now I
talked to you guys about it a lot and
it's definitely made my hair growth less
which means that I don't have to go and
get my legs waxed or spend every day
shaving my legs it's completely been
like a massive time saver for me I'm
obsessed and yeah I just I think I would
love to receive this as a gift like a
brand new one what have you picked from
the Braun family so I picked the Braun
Series 9 shaver
it's like Chrome it's got a digital
display and what I really like about it
is the wet/dry feature so it actually
really does work in the shower it's also
got the auto Sense technology which i
think is all about the density of the
hair so if you're like shaving yeah so
for like look I've got like no hair here
and then like long hair here so if
you're basically shaving it will adapt
to where the density of the hair is yeah
I think is really good and it doesn't
irritate I don't I just think it looks
really smart it's got like a charging
base so you can keep it displayed in
your bathroom that's the gift that rich
chose from porn and he has been bugging
me for a new shaver for so long so I
think you're gonna enjoy that yes the
next gift I've chosen is from oliver
bonus they have these new really nice
beauty makeup bags out this is the
larger one it's in a really nice kind of
velvet feeling material with a gold zip
and it's blush pink I absolutely love
this this is the largest size so I think
this would be really good as a traveling
makeup bag or for your skincare and then
this one is navy I mean these are my two
favorite colors at the moment and I
really interval of it as well obviously
is such a blob of cliche and they've put
this cute little like faces on them and
I like this size because I think this is
a really good like handbag sized makeup
bag if you want let your lipsticks and a
powder and a few things you need on the
go if you like touching up your makeup
for the evening like really special real
gifts that you would want to receive the
next thing I've chosen is the J Malone
English oak and hazelnut Cologne so I
got sent this
and I basically smelt it and was like it
smells like a men's fragrance but in a
good way I was like that's amazing I
want you to know you fellas best if
you're a girl back buying for a guy
don't underestimate how much they they
love a luxury fragrance because I think
people would think like German loners
have gift for her but he's obsessed
really good and this is the hundred mil
and I've been using this for about three
four months and it doesn't remake then
you and you need a couple of spray yeah
it's quite strong scent that would be
like a really nice gift for a guy okay
the next gift idea I have for her is a
beauty advent calendar now I really
really hope that this video isn't going
up too late that they've all sold out
they start selling them in like the end
of October it's so frustrated because
please I'm never making like Christmas
content that early but if you can get
your hands on any of them I think it's
such a special gift and it's something
really nice that you can give at the
beginning of the month as like a pre
Christmas present or just as the
Christmas present it it literally is the
gift that keeps on giving
me show you a couple of examples oh my
god hold that yeah this is it's
backwards this is the white company one
which is so nice sorry it hasn't makes
up like skincare and candles and all
kinds of things in there I mean these
are like luxury presents but seriously
every girl would want one of these you
don't mind putting that one down over
there there's even bigger one to show
you I think this is the ultimate of all
the advent calendars this is the Liberty
advent calendar it's not only like
beautiful let me actually open one of
these doors
look how ridiculous this is with like
amazing stuff inside I just wanna spoil
it
candles beauty all kinds of things oh
you can put it down there things work I
know it's really cool artwork like this
is picnic screen so if there are any
left and they haven't sold out and the
white company Liberty jo Malone Elemis
I've seen pretty much most beauty brands
now do them and I think it's such a nice
gift and you can surprise them on the
1st of December with it my next gift is
this water bottle you think but you work
in an office I've been searching for a
big enough container that's glass and
not plastic e that looks good and that's
it like looks good to sit on my office
desk
voila I got that for rich for Christmas
last year actually yeah yeah yeah and I
got one for myself as well and I think
it's my shredder Peter drink out of a
glass container and these are just
really nice ones yeah and I think I mean
if you are really extravagant the
presents than this could be a stocking
filler but I also think this would make
just a great gift by itself so our
business I don't reuse many Christmas
gifts you've actually use that for a
whole year and I use this and you can
tell like yes hey it was great nice
I actually got it from Urban Outfitters
but I will link to everything I'm
talking about in the description box
below my next suggestion for a gift for
her is a book and a book that you think
she would enjoy so I'm gonna suggest a
few but obviously tailored this to
whoever you're buying for my first
recommendation is very appropriate and
it's Tanya Bears new book Tanya's
Christmas I think this is a read
if it probably should be one that you
give a bit earlier because it literally
has like recipes how to cook Christmas
dinner it's also got loads of other
really nice Christmas inspirational
things so if you have someone's birthday
this time of year or if you want to give
an early Christmas present that is a
good one my next suggestion is how not
to kill your plants like for example
this would be the perfect book for me we
have a dead plant behind me right now it
looks really beautiful
and it's basically a whole book about
how not to kill plants I think that's
really fun and then my final suggestion
is one that I ordered for myself the
other day and it's the Rockettes and
George extraordinary interiors I'm
obsessed with rockets and George as the
shopper and I follow the Instagram
account and if you're buying for
someone's ring it into interiors this is
a beautiful book but as I said there are
so many books to pick from so think
about what they really love and find one
that they don't already have and I think
a book is a lovely present the next gift
I've chosen I don't actually have it
with me here because I'm hoping to get
it for Christmas it's on my list is the
Amazon echo it's something I think we
both want my me like came up with this
list together I was like this could be a
gift for him or for her it's kind of a
gift for a couple but Amazon echo you
can either buy the small one dot dot
echo dot oh no all the lesser ooh which
has the speaker so which one do you
think's better I because we've got sonar
speakers don't get the dot if you don't
have pieces already than the Alexa it's
because we have Spotify and we have we
use Amazon quite a lot actually yeah it
should be useful so I'm quite excited to
try it I think if you have someone you
want to buy like a really special gift
for I think that the Amazon dot or echo
or Alexa or any of those things are
really cool and it's something you'll
both enjoy okay my next gift is this
super cuddly dressing-gown before you
keep taking me out mark those fences I
have a dressing gown from the white
company that's more like a towel in one
and I love that for when I come out the
shower and I'm wet I like dry myself
down and then I'll put that on but I
think everyone needs like a Christmas
winter dressing-gown that's just like a
little bit synthetic but incredibly soft
and it will keep you warm I think this
is a bit like Anna's purple
dressing-gown which is
kind of famous on the Internet it's from
M&amp;amp;S really wasn't that expensive it's
really pretty like blush pink and I
can't wait to like snuggle up on the
sofa and wear this I think a
dressing-gown is such a good present for
Christmas looks a warm next gift is well
this is from last year but winds of
winter sets in I get the urge to play
the Xbox religiously and last year I was
obsessed with battlefield one this year
Call of Duty have got their new game
coming out early November and I'm
excited to get it I always think Xbox
games a good present because well I'm
not actually going to use it and enjoy
it well so it's quite expensive it's
like quite an expensive thing to buy
first they are they are expensive the
games yeah also download them online
through the Xbox Live which is also
useful so Xbox Live could be a good
present as well so what was the game
that you recommend for this year's
presents so the new Call of Duty World
War two I think it's called world war 2
I wasn't getting you that by the way
I'll buy that for myself my final gift
is something if you want to get your
girlfriend or your wife or even a friend
like something really special I think a
piece of jewelry is really nice and for
my friend's 30th birthdays recently I've
been going to a brand called Ashley
Clark they do some really nice jewelry
but have you noticed I'm saying jewelry
correctly trying really hard
say jewelry jewelry anyway the ones that
I would recommend is from a brand called
Miss OMA I have a few things from now
I'm sure you guys have heard lots of
people on the internet talked about them
but I just think it's really nice like
mid-range brand I've got this can't
remember a horn I think this is called
the large horn necklace and then I also
have this really pretty like stone
necklace which I absolutely love and
then finally the final one is the
shorter I think it's called like Fang
necklace um yeah it's like a shorter one
and you can layer them all together and
I think it's so special I love wearing
my necklaces and yeah if you're thinking
I want to buy my girlfriend or wife
something special I definitely say check
out my soma they're pieces are really
nice okay you'll find your gift my final
gift is more of an essential gift for
the winter season but I bloody love it
last year these are brand new pair but
last year I got these from Muji they are
gloves that have this other electrodes
magnetic stuff that you can touch your
iPhone or your going on yeah your touch
screen with their basically loves for
people who hate faffing around gloves
like I feel like guys are quite
practical like that they don't want
thick block they're not gonna wear
gloves if they have to take them off it
which I'm they have to use their phone
but these ones have these you can kind
of see the color difference it means you
can use your thumb and your two fingers
to you've got your phone on you well we
should have tested that out they do work
yeah because I bought them for rich last
year and they're really warm as well and
it works like instantly there's no like
delay or like bit of glitches it just
doesn't nice things I think all glad
should have that five so that is
everything for our his-and-hers a gift
