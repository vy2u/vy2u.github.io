today I'm going to be doing a home
office tool other thing I've ever
probably shown you my office before but
obviously if you watch my vlog you
probably would have seen it already but
over the past couple years since we've
lived here
I just been slowly adding different
things to my office and moving it around
and it's now become a space I really
love so I'm going to share it with you
guys and show you where I really spend
most of my time it's in our second
bedroom so it's like a small second
bedroom I've turned into a home office
and I really like working in there it's
very rare to me so you kind of head to
the sofa with my laptop and work there
because I enjoy sitting in my office it
kind of separates the flat up a little
bit for me so when I'm in the lounge
I'm in like relaxed mode when I'm in my
office on and work mode it's right next
to our bedroom and as I've said
previously our flight quite small so
wherever we can and we just add storage
space before bed that lifts up and we
kind of built-in shelves and cupboards
where we can and every piece of
furniture that I buy I always try to
make sure it's got some kind of storage
in it so I'm going to show you around my
office which is just in here so let's go
in so was it you going to see what it
looks like when you're looking into my
office so this is how you walk in on
this side of my desk and my beauty
storage behind me is a kind of gathering
wall and then on this side is my
bookshelf and all of our coats over here
so I'm going to bring those in to have a
look so let's start with my desk area
this is actually a new desk for me when
we first got flat there were things that
he wants to do investing and things that
not so much and I just felt at the time
that shutters and saucers and nice
things in our lounge were more important
so I started with an Ikea desk but I
didn't love it the top one attached the
legs and it felt very kind of like I was
always nervous it's going to fall down
so I've recently got this lovely West
Elm desk and it's so so beautiful it
looks great and it's got storage too
which other said for so important it's
got these three drawers which are used
for kind of stationary bit in this
right-hand drawer I have notebook and
thank-you cards and I've also got a few
DG bits as well and I can sanitizer a
hand cream and
Spray as well in the middle drawer I
have my pens which are from Muji as what
like a letter opener rulers my tippex
mice which I can't live without and then
the drawer on the left is the drawer of
doom where all my receipts and bits of
paper
I don't also do with and bank statements
and it's just too messy to show you
inside it's full of absolute rubbish
then we all have a drawer like that in
our office on that my chair is actually
from Ryman's and this is a chair that in
probably every previous job I've ever
had I always insisted that my boss five
units chair I always suffered from a bad
back and the chair he sits at at your
desk is so so important so although
there are so many beautiful pretty
chairs out there I've just I've always
kind of prioritized comfort and right
back problems first so the chair is not
pretty and actually their arms a bit
annoying simply fit under the desk but
it's really good for my back it's really
not back fences like I said from Ryman's
I'm going to link up below if they still
do it and it's a chair that I sat on for
years at all different jobs this chair
follows me everywhere if I was crossly I
would find a cool way to cover this
chair I'd really like to compel great
chair but I just I haven't got the brain
space to lap up here on the right-hand
side of my desk is the plant it's a new
plant
don't worry for those of you follow me
on instagram stories i didn't get rid of
aloe vera plant we just moved it
somewhere else in the slide things I
rescued it but this is a new one that we
got and I thought it's really like
minimalist there's not too much going on
it's not too distracting they have like
in my vision when I'm editing and stuff
I really really like having plants in my
space I never used to be like a plant
person but I really do think that a lot
of wet oxygen and air to the room it's
just like lift your mood somehow this
isn't a little desktop planter from West
Elm and I have them all over the flat
got big ones and little ones and tiny
tiny ones and then got this bottle which
is from swell I've got sadness just a
nice gold water bottle a China drink
water and it's in hi-def and really
really bad if I fill up a bottle at
least it's there to remind me and this
is sitting on this little coaster from
an apology which I thought was so pretty
it's like pink quartz and with this gold
like outline to it the computer I use is
I max desktop I really like it I just I
liked having two pieces at the same
level is my eye and then you can get a
stand for the laptop but I don't know
that's us never feel the same I've got
this years ago and I don't regret it I
figured out a way now to sync my desktop
with my laptop so I can kind of use both
I can use my laptop when I'm out of my
office and this one right here it's just
nice to have like a proper computer desk
underneath the screen is just one of my
external hard drives the one I'm using
at the moment to edit my video these are
the lazy hard drives they're just my
favorite to use then to the next that my
computer screen is a new lamp again from
myself sorry can you tell of a massive
fan it's just a really nice like copper
simple lamp with the shade I never had a
light here before I find that when I
work late in the evenings it's really
nice to have a life alive I'm just kind
of working with spotlights and it
doesn't feel as great warm then on the
other side of my desk is this stand I
think it's a lot of a bonus and I'm
pretty sure it's for recipes like when
you're cooking but I use this to stand
my laptop and my iPad so I know those
are they're just what I want to grab my
laptop iPad I also had my iPad pencil
which I'm just so paranoid of losing so
I put a little bit Belkin stands and the
Apple Store just sits in there and it
has a little home now on my desk and I
know who owns use it so that's my desk
area I'm pretty sure that anything
underneath my desk I have a rubbish bin
and I have a shredder which isn't
exciting to look at but I love my
shredder whenever I have something to
shred I just get so excited above my
desk is a print from Emma Kate code
losses are cos I absolutely love and it
just says darling just hockey and owning
it and I really love this print just
behind my desk is where I keep all my
beauty put up this self drawers is from
Urban Outfitters it's one of the best
things that will for this flap from a
bit of fact with the delivery but it
looks great I've seen other people use
it for shoe storage and all kinds of
things if you really use it anything the
drawers are a little bit stiff too
awesome
you kind of get used to it there are 15
drawers and in here I keep all my makeup
I might do an updated makeup collection
video if you guys would like me to I
definitely have one half of my channel
from a while ago and
my foundation my primers my lipstick
blushes and bronzers and highlighters
eyeshadow palettes my eyeliners and like
single eyeshadows and then I think I put
at all for my mascara I have draws bits
that I kind of want to try out and then
I've got a drawer for all my tools like
Beauty blenders and hair bands and
compact mirrors and then at the bottom
that kind of get the bits organized I've
got some like plug adapters and travel
things and like hair brushes and clips
and stuff so all of my beauty sub really
important skincare and bathroom related
things but kept in these rules on the
top of the drawer back my Muji acrylic
like double drawer set and this is where
I keep my daily makeup so the software
pretty much wear every day whether I
have to keep going into all the separate
drawers to get different things I'm sure
you guys know by now what my favorite
makeup bits are so they're all kept in
there and then make sure that I've got a
little tray from West Elm trailer to
keep my Beauty sponge on just because I
don't really have anywhere else to put
it I select a nice little home so I
don't use it like two or three times
before I swap it for a different one and
then wash that one
I've got my two favorite perfumes out on
display that's Joey Malone at Green Bay
and eccentric molecules molecule oh one
and I've also got two new scents from
journal and I'm just trying out at the
moment
once perfume one's a hairnets so I just
put there to remind myself to give it a
go I then got all my brushes on display
and this is actually a plant top from
Anthropologie I bought it a while ago
and I asked you guys what the best thing
is to put in it stands on my brushes up
those of you said right let's be more
freaked out saying that I'm going to get
loads of insects if I put rice but that
just hasn't happened at all I've had
this like this ages now maybe throw out
a top crunchiness be careful but I had
absolutely no problem so what loads of
white rice and then and then I just kind
of stick my brushes and they stand up
and this is by far the best storage and
that I had for my makeup brushes so easy
to grab what I need I have quite loss
brushes a publisher's downsize but I
just really like how they look in a spot
so I'm really happy with that so the
size of the drawers I keep these two
tables which I got some have
at which I'm used most the time when I'm
filming one kind of rest my laptop on if
I need to the others to rest like
products all and I notebook for anything
I need to grab and then underneath the
drawers where it keeps the stands for my
life so I've got three stands and then
my tripod which I'm currently using now
just for the left of the doors I have
this lovely lovely plant which I've got
on the weekend is exactly what I wanted
I was a bit worried it was going to come
out too much material smaller but it
just doesn't I think class brings so
much light to the room it's so nice to
have it so look at my new little friends
and they look after and try really hard
not to kill it's again in the same like
Western pop we have one this side and
our lounge with mother-in-law's tongue
in it it just works really well it also
kind of covers the cord for my printer
so I'm really happy with it'll plant and
just fill this little white space here
yeah I'm going to keep moving around the
roots you guys could see the kind of art
gallery wall and print table that I've
got just over here yeah now over in this
part of the room and just a quick
disclaimer and apology I've had to
switch cameras halfway through filming
this video it's been a absolute
nightmare by trying a new camera and
then my microphone went crazy so sorry
if this part of the video is different
to the beginning part of the video I'm
now in this part of the room which is
the chimney breast of the room and
before I start here I forgot to talk
about the round mirror above my makeup
jaws that's actually where I stand and
do my hair and makeup I would love to
sit at a beauty desk and do it there I
currently don't have the setup for that
idea of the room that's something I was
definitely one in the future but I don't
mind standing there doing my hair and
makeup the mirror I don't know where
it's form I can't remember it might have
been Urban Outfitters but I'm going to
have a little search through my emails
to try and remember and I will write it
down below in the description box
everything I talked about leezar be
written there or linked there so
definitely go check the description box
so the chimney breast of the room was
always quite a plain space it's not like
a real chimney there's no fireplace
there just a gap so the wall was always
blank if you guys watch my vlogmas you
would have seen I had a calendar there
for a little while that didn't last long
and now I have this setup which I really
really like these little like IKEA LED
shells we have them all over the flat
and they're so handy they're really good
for putting picture frames on or if you
have one in the hallway you can use it
to collect your lessons and your keys
I've got three on this wall here with
all different things on them so I'm
going to quickly talk you through what's
on those shelves on the bottom shelf
I've got this copper L from Oliver bonus
and then mixer that I've got my InStyle
award which I'm obviously very proud of
it's like an actual award and I also
really like the color of it make sure
that is one of those teeny tiny West Elm
planters with a little succulent in it
and then mix of that is my a hundred
thousand subscriber YouTube play button
I absolutely love that YouTube give out
these play buttons I kind of wish they
gave one out of five hundred thousand
because that's something I can kind of
aim towards they give one out of hundred
thousand and then the next one's a
million and I seriously never ever
expect to get a million subscribers so I
kind of wish there was a five hundred
thousand one but obviously the more
frequently gave them out the less
special they would be so I'm very proud
of my hundred thousand plaque and that
just sits there mixer that is a little
of a bonus frame with a picture in it
from a photo booth with me Anna
my friends Lucy in Georgia and I have no
photos around the whole flat of people
so guys you should feel very lucky if
you're in there but it was a really nice
happy photo and it's kind of
work-related so I really like having
that there make sure that is a little
pot from a shop called
eg G and Brighton which is one of Anna's
favorite shop and the supplement that I
thought that came with that died a long
time ago but I recently reposted it with
this new succulent and I really like it
very simple and then just to the right
of that is another one of Emma Kate code
prints I told you I really like her
prints
this one says so many likes when all you
need is love which is very appropriate
for what I do as a job and I really like
it on the second shelf I've got a print
from Urban Outfitters which just the
green print of catch tire so that adds a
bit of color I really like the print one
in the middle a cotton ball the artis is
called I think it's ham they sell these
in West Elm and loads of boutique shops
I see them all the time and I love
different prints of rabbits doing like
funny things like yoga
and all different things this one the
rabbit is jumping on a trampoline
very simple and black and white I really
like this print and then the one on the
right says sleep eat creates which is a
hanomag London print again very
appropriate for what I do I really like
it and love the foiling this print and
then right on the top of another one
from Emma Kate Co which I'm not sure I'm
going to keep this one here because it
doesn't fit in the frame but it's just
there for now it's like an inspirational
quote and the one on the right is from
Oliver bonus which is new and I love
this one it's a pink heart with gold
foiling behind it so Christy I love the
colors and I've had my eye on it for so
long so I'm really glad I got it so in
the little gaps below where the chimney
can I'd used to be once upon a time it
was always a bit of an awkward gap
I had my printer sitting on the floor
there for a long time but it fell it's
such a waste of space I can never find
anything to fit the space because it's
quite shallow but it's quite cool quite
like something wide and I look for so
long and nothing really worked and then
eventually I found on the kind of new in
section of West Elm one of their bedside
tables so I recently got that and I just
got one bedside table which is funny and
it fits really nicely in there there's
still a bit of a gap around the edges
and it comes out a little bit further
than the kind of depth of the hole but I
don't mind it it just works so well and
it means that I can put my printer on
the bottom shelf my printer is just one
from Canon not great I wouldn't
recommend it and now I've got extra
drawer with more storage space in this
joy that keeps things like camera
accessories I need to grab really
quickly and easily I've also got my
diamond label maker and a hole punch in
there as well because those don't fit in
my stationery drawer I kind of need to
organize this drawer better it's still a
new one for me but it's fine for now on
top of the little bedside table I've got
this pink throw from H&amp;amp;M home hmm homes
you such good throws if you are ever
looking for wanting to go and spend a
fortune it's a really good place to look
I just wanted this to somehow fill the
gap a little bit again it adds color and
it is so that awkward gap and also
shoved on top of that I've got these
fake plants I got from the garden fence
which I thought would be good props for
photo taking so that's this section of
the room and I really like this now it's
like I recently finished it and it just
is perfect so now I'm going to move up a
little bit show you my shelves and
cupboard so when we first moved in
it's really awkward gap to the side of
the chimney breast it wasn't like wide
enough for full-on shells or anything I
think it's because they made the
bathroom which is next door here a
little bit bigger so this weird awkward
gap that I wanted to get like a ladder
shelf unit or something but nothing
really fit there it was about like this
wide where you can see how wide it is so
I actually got a builder to come in and
custom make something I knew I wanted
some shelves then what I really needed
is storage what my camera gear I guess
I'm not like the average person I've got
a lot of camera techy stuff and it's
ugly and it's not stuff I won on display
so I asked him to make the cupboard with
shelves above it I actually specifically
asked for shaker-style which is when it
has this border around the edge and then
I bought my own handle monel door knob
from Anthropologie and put that on and
it's perfect it's very simple it's
exactly what I wanted for this whole
kind of corner of the room so let me
first show you inside the cupboard as I
said this is where I keep a lot of my
camera gear so I've got my Canon 5d my
main camera I've got my white balance
sheet thing I've got an Olympus PEN
camera up there I've got my Bose
headphones
I've got adapters I need my computer
below that I've got lots of LaCie hard
drives which I use a lot I've got my
vlogging camera
I've got my old vlogging camera and then
I've got quite a few of my camera lenses
back there on the shelf and two new
Polaroid cameras one really really old
Polaroid camera from when I was a
teenager below the two shelves that I
kind of specifically asked for there to
be shelves I then just wanted this long
gap and that's where I knew I wanted to
store my life I've got two kind of big
square light and then I've got a ring
light as well it's such a fast to get
these in and out but if I position them
right they fit really nicely and I can
also put my shoulder can there as well
which is like the thing I use on my
shoulder to steady the camera does that
sound everything in the cupboards down
there on this bottom shelf I've got
quite a few folders just for like car
related stuff home related stuff student
loans finance stuff like just are boring
household things but I put them in these
pretty folders font Paper Chase in the
middle here I've got this pink like
treasure chest which is from all of the
boners and in here is more printer
cartridges than I will ever need in a
lifetime
I accidentally ordered like 50 printer
cartridges on Amazon you know you just
can't really see the amount and I didn't
realize how many I ordered and literally
it was like this many so they are all in
there and then below that is minor
Anna's colt beauty box I really like to
keep this just as a memory of the work
that we did but also it's so handy
because inside I keep all of my wires
it's the most disorganized box ever sort
of every wire you can ever imagine but
it's got chargers it's got adapters
phone charges like just so many techie
wires are all contained in this pretty
mobile box on the shelf above I have my
microphone which I use for voiceovers
luckily it's quite good-looking it's
just the white microphone so that sits
there nicely this book stop record a
book stop Carmen bullets cord is from
Oliver bonus it's so pretty it's got
this gold on the outside and then it's
like a cutout stone in this really nice
blue color I've got my pen book which is
a book that all my friends made me on my
hen weekend I've got my old bullet
journal I've got a little photo album
that I use for all my polaroid photos
and then I've got some a4 sized photo
albums these are from paper chaser just
self-adhesive that I use a I never know
and their Browns you can stick your
photos wherever you like I tend to put
my photos and 5x7 so I really like these
and I've got photos from our honeymoon
and from a family trip to Disneyland and
I just use my DiMeo label maker on side
so I know which switch then I've got
rich is really ugly file that he makes
me keep in here and a book where I keep
cut out if I'm ever in like a magazine
or anything like that I just sort of be
a really nice memory for when I'm old
and gray on the shelf above I have
another book stock from Oliver boner and
I have lots of pretty books I won't talk
you through all of them a lot of them
are kind of industry based book not so
much like reading books because I tend
to read if I read a really good book I
tend to pass it on to like my mom or
sister for them to read these are more
books that I want to keep because
they're really pretty and then right at
the top I have my diaries from when I
was a teenager which I won't ever let
anyone read because they're so
embarrassing I've got the spit shield
for my microphone oh else I've got a
johnson and johnson award and
I've got my project life which I did a
couple of years ago I don't still do
project life but I did it for a couple
years and I just love looking back on it
okay that's this corner done and now I'm
going to like swivel around this way and
you'll see what I hide behind the door
to my office okay so if you imagine I've
gone round my room the shelves are now
here this is the door to my office which
we actually had to get the hinges move
because it opened the other way I knew I
went to my desk there so we've got the
door to open this way which annoyingly
means that the the light switch is
behind the door but we haven't really
moved that yet so now I'm going to close
this door and you will see what we hide
behind the door now obviously I would
prefer not to have all of our coats and
shoes in my office this could have been
a really nice pretty corner where I
could have sat filmed videos with the
natural light coming in from the window
but we have nowhere else to keep our
coats are always too small we would have
taken up so much space so I got the same
builder to make this shelf for us which
is above the coat rail I knew that we'd
need a shelf just for more storage I
didn't know what at the time but up
there I keep my camera bag which keeps
his daily rucksack I should have to come
revives my gym bag lots of bags and
umbrellas are like shoved up there we
then have this coat rack and rich
actually made this he got the pipes and
the joints from like being queue or
somewhere I don't remember how he did
this but we needed really like a
specific size I think it was quite
narrow and I couldn't find anything
online so he actually made this one we
hang all of our coats here I have too
many coats I really need to sort through
them but this is where they all live and
then below the coats we're quite a lot
of our shoes live we do try to keep most
of them under the bed but there's just
not room for everything because we've
got so many other things under the bed
as well so quite a few of our like daily
issues that we just need to grab and put
on live under here we haven't got any
kind of shoe racks they just kind of
live on the floor so yeah as I said I
wish that I could make a really pretty
thing in the corner that's ideally what
I would have had but I had to sacrifice
the corner of my office for all of our
coats or all of my coats really I did a
special thing in my office so I go run
this way then I'm just at the door so I
really hope you guys enjoyed having a
little tour of my office let me know
what your favorite part of my office is
it's just a room that I really enjoy now
so I'm really happy
with it and I wanted to share it with
you guys again don't forget to check the
description box for all of the links I
hope you all having a lovely bank
