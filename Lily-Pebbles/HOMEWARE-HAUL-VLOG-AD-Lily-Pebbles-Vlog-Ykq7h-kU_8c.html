morning Fulham very tired this morning I
thought there's a little bit of sore
throat but I've made myself a cup of tea
and I'm going to get ready I'm going to
do my hair and makeup and we're having
some friends over for lunch today so I'm
just going to get ready maybe I'll show
you what makeup I'm doing it's the
weekend so I like to go quite a pipe
dream team and nothing heavy
I'm definitely gonna use the becca
primer been using this like every day
since I've got it a cosmetic CC cream
although I have been using this from
Tarte recently the Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation I really like it
it's just maybe too heavy for the
weekend
also quite enjoying the grow see a cloud
paint so use that and then for eyeshadow
I like to use cream eyeshadows at the
weekend so I might use Mac groundwork or
maybe I'll find some a bit lighter also
really been enjoying the steal mascara
although the packaging gets so grubby
that's always be the plan
if you're clean sponge leaves are gross
I'm actually going to wear the Mac next
to nothing Foundation which is a lot
lighter than it cosmetics I'm gonna see
if I can build it up to like a light to
medium coverage no I'm just not sure
about this foundation it's so like it
almost feels kind of pointless because
you have to give you this of a client
like foundation but if I'm going to give
you anything I feel like I just rescued
it cosmetic so I'm not sure the dobar
just went and I got this delivery
it says dear lily I hope you enjoy my
new collection thank you for your
support with the brand so far including
coming in to meetings and picking colors
lots of love Tanya I literally love just
like gate-crashing Tanya's meetings and
helping her pick eyeshadow colors so
excited to see this collection look how
pretty that is
oh my god she looks gorgeous there's a
cup of pineapple in hand which is very
exciting requested ominous and then
there's a couple of eyeshadow palettes
and a couple of lipstick so I might use
these today I want to see many of the
colors that we've talked by the meetings
made it into the palette so this one is
the my paradise palette that's a
classical this is more sorry for like to
be back more like a bonzi like brown
color and then this one is more this
one's like kind of got a map all the
glitters type one in it and this light
green looks real
nice everyone aware that today but we're
in a red to talk a much without go I'm
gonna play with these now and then maybe
I'll put a lipstick on to just realize
that this on the outside has all the
information so the collection is called
neutral ambience there's two lipsticks
bear hug and Sunday walk cute names and
then the two eye palettes and these are
pretty sure that will available now
right guys let me tell you what the plan
is for today I have my friends Asian
James coming around for lunch and this
video is actually getting sponsored by
collect plus baked on contact with me
and wanted to do some work together and
I thought it was a really great
opportunity because I have this lunch
today and I'm kind of terrified of
having guests round one because our
flats so small always just for like it's
a bit awkward that we're discussing a
magician too because I'm just like feel
like I'm not good enough chef but also
we don't like have all the things that
we need so I thought this is a really
good opportunity to order some bits I'm
missing from our kitchen because we have
a really small dining table so we need
to be able to sit for people around this
table we have like fold-up chairs and
stuff now which is fine but we needed
some likes and few extra bits so I
ordered some things from John Lewis and
the white company which are like two of
my favorite home Wessels I absolutely
love them using collect Plus and I was
really really impressed actually because
I ordered it on the Wednesday and it
came on Thursday and you guys know how
busy I've been in the suite doing
podcast stuff and so I haven't been at
home to accept any deliveries and I just
I can't make sure I'm home between
certain hours so I just use collect
cloths and it went to my local newsagent
and then I pick it up in the evening
when I was back from doing all the
podcast stuff and I picked up like
whenever I was ready I'm sure you guys
use collect Plus before but it's really
really great they work with a really
wide range of online retailers and it
just makes it so easy to click and
Collect and also do returns really
easily so I have three huge boxes here
that I picked up on Thursday I'm going
to open these boxes in a minute and show
you what's inside but I'm pretty sure
it's just got back with some food for
breakfast did you get summoned whew
that's a famine I'm craving this for
some reason we have bagels
if scrambled eggs got tiny bit of other
quarters it wasn't that right and last
and bash it all together I need to like
speed things up because it's going to be
loved soon guys look how great this
looks
buzz is a Qi fancy okay I'm going to
unbox these boxes or show you guys what
I ordered
try not unlike slicing yourself okay so
this first box is from John Lewis $2 box
here so first thing of these stainless
steel skewers set a lot of the recipes
that I look at you need these like to
cook with what I sound like or not
making sense but we don't have them
we've got some like little wooden ones
but it's not really the same so these
are the Weber skewers business the
things that we never thought to buy like
when we first moved here oh these are
nice
quite big I hope they fit oh my god
they're heavy these are gold placemats
I'll show you guys when I might lay in
the table it's quite nice just make the
table look like you having people around
while because normal is just a plain an
empty oh they're not that heavy actually
this is what they look like gold curb
textures placemats and I like round
placemats and then when you put the
plates down there's just like a bit of
pace not showing where I want a cat more
space I think if you've got small dining
tables around is probably better we
shall see okay the next item Jean Louis
is also quite like really hot remember
I've ordered motley oh I got some gold
stripe piece drawers because it's always
nice to give a purpose to the drink just
makes it look more fancy like you've
made more of an effort I really like
these pictures which is looking at me
raising his eyebrows the multi a wrong
move yeah but we've got we've got the
same we've got mint colored ones in the
way that men not as nice as the gold
ones
this is like really practice right oh I
remember what this is we don't have any
kind of like water jug when people are
to water I'd like to go over to the tap
and fill them with tap water obviously
we have like boxes also
Robert some people it might have water I
don't so at all it would be nice to get
like a mr. bottle and some of the jugs
are so big we don't have much room on
the table so this one is really slim and
it says a drop of water on it and the
other side says drink to me this is a
really nice bottle so that video so it
put on the table soon as I put like an
elderflower drink or something in there
and but I think we nice or water ok
moving on
this one's really heavy eek okay this is
a white company box now when we first
moved in here we went to Costco to get
our plates and stuff for the wedding
we did get some new things like mug and
harem but we've got some new like this
for the kitchen but we kept the same
plates and stuff and I don't love our
plate by there okay but there are mint
green so they don't really like go with
everything but still I would get some
new one oh also for dessert then I
wanted to make crumble I normally make
crumble in like this big square thing I
think when you have people round it
quite nicely give everyone a total
individual dessert so from the white
company I always it seems really cute
little like heart ramekin things so it's
so bright in here all of a sudden sorry
these when I actually cook they they're
little heart things and you could have
like a little bit of crumble to yourself
I fear that the boys are going to think
this is a really small portion of
crumble but it can always happen oh okay
so I've got four of those never sleep
and I've got six of these because I mean
hopefully one day we'll be able to fit
six food where I'm safe Steve from the
white company and they're just really
nice right they've kind of got a speckle
print on them and also thought they
would fit really nicely over the
placemat oh yeah it's very likely they
slightly go up at the edge so if you've
got liquid on the plate it won't fall
off but then they're not like a bowl
napkin we don't have any and put in
kitchen towel out just really isn't the
same it's quite nice really and some
people are fine if you want to have a
slightly nicer dinner
archetype thing it has got some nice
fabric napkins these are just great
I thought they'd be nice to press the
cutlery on or that my sister told me a
really good space saving tip for small
dining tables is getting an odd base
beam can ripping off the label and then
putting cutlery and napkins in there in
the middle of the table and need to set
the cutlery out I love that we don't
have any baked bean pins so I'm just
going to lay be about today with cutlery
on these are so nice actually I just
love the white company now I'm gonna
throw away all this rubbish Oh Richard
Gonsalves rubbish this is the ready
steady glow Madeleine she'll cookbook
and I'm going to be making for lunch
over over jeans tube is that a
cauliflower rice I'm going to do normal
rice and maybe a bit of like saffron
powder and hopefully it'll be good and
I'm going to make a crumble for dessert
good again cooking before I go out and
buy all the food and stuff and just
going to quickly set up the table a
little bit I just pulled it out way from
the wall and these look really nice
actually two of these yeah I think that
looks really nice actually there isn't
much space to put a napkin in cutlery so
I think I am going to do my sister's
trick we're going to use these for lunch
anyways I'm going to pull them out into
Tupperware now and then use this
hopefully for cutlery I think in the
middle okay that works out really well
okay we're going to go out we're going
to go and get the food and stuff that we
need I'll come back and I'll set this up
properly afterwards so back to the shop
I got some nice flowers and all the bits
that we need hopefully first thing I'm
going to do is make little crumb which
is there now to bury I can put them in
the oven and they'll be like ready in
ten minutes so I'm using the recipe from
Olivia's kitchen but although recipe
things have changed and when she put on
a website
this one says no almonds in this topping
I really like on them so I might pass
them in you've never tried a module day
you are seriously missing out because
I'm talking about this is all about Oh
gross date I thought they liked prunes
I like no way it literally tastes like
maple syrup mom how did it move syrup
got the top into the crumble here and
I'm just making a filling and then I'm
going to put them in a little little
hard dishes wherever those
here stir their Ruby mm-hmm
I didn't make much of the fruit fit but
it's okay I'm going to fill out the
toppings and hopefully you know it's
lunch it's not dinner
you don't eat loads of like refuse I've
made a bit of a mess but the crumbles
look really cute in these little hot
dishes you know put them in the fridge
and then just chuck them in the oven for
we want to eat them and then keep the
rest of the stocking for breakfast to us
the week if I like if you are good cook
and you'll really calm in the kitchen
and like everything's prepared and
you're ready just chilled whereas I'm
the sort of cook who's like all I need
was the looking and I'm like mental in
the kitchen and my mom always tells me
to just like chill out I said you I am
crazy and everything's like a mad rush I
don't know how to like get my
together I'm just going to try and take
things slow I'm gonna wash the regime
and cut them into cubes I'm going to try
and prepare everything because this may
only take like half an ounce cook they
coming over in which five minutes here
the tables all set
tops of the remote control of my phone
really really like this place Matt
really love the plates happy with the
napkins and putting the cutlery in the
middle
once everyone take their cutlery napkin
you can move that beside got some
glasses out the rice cooking I put some
saffron in there to make it yellow so it
Richard making such a racket over here
and then we've got the aubergine cooking
here smells delish and rich is making
what you're making proud of this one are
you using the water bottles ciders makes
a soft drink in here we have that yeah
and we have mint cucumber then
especially a little bit of ginger let
this infuse at the tonic water
yeah what's your uncle Lucy and James
are going to be here soon I'm going to
welcome them by saying hi sorry I can't
cook and I'll flap too small for four
people just to warn them but hopefully
I'll be on I don't know also look at
these pretty flowers they like to out
and gem alone
and this is the Mercer and cardamom and
kind of goes with the theme of the food
just is looking and smelling good
actually I guess so yeah I gives you
them coming upstairs I'm going to count
along I've served everyone it looks good
I'm not very good at portion sizes
here's all the food and you've got some
some yogurt as well let's go inside
don't be polite you can start with the
crumbled irradiated put them in the oven
for like 10 minutes a treadle coaster
down because I'm just not sure off this
thing that's really hot it might burn
these so crumbles all around it smell
good raspberry and blueberry buckle
basically that guy that was such a nice
lunch it was so successful and we have
such a nice time actually and they hung
out for a while afterwards and we
basically didn't stop talking for hours
and it was really nice I'm so happy that
I got those little crumble bowls or
heart ones from the white company
because they worked so well it's so nice
to like have your own little crumble
instead of scooping out onto a plate so
I'm really happy I ordered those if you
guys need any last-minute bit so like a
dinner party or anything I would highly
recommend collect Plus also it's not
just a London thing they deliver to 6000
stores across the UK so wherever you are
in the UK you can use it which is great
I'm going to honor do some work I have a
lot of work to do and you mean which
we're going to go out but it's now like
half five and I just have a lot to do so
which is going to watch a film I'm going
to get on with some work and I'll chat
to you in a little bit British this game
anyway right that's it I'm doing it what
are you doing with another focus but

stripy like you and I sound chilled me

just a bit sad about it because I

like I haven't seen anyone and I just
get really frustrated and then I end up
taking out and rich but rich very kindly

o'clock rich has just head out to go for
work out of his friends I've got a
personal training session at like half
10 I'm just getting ready and I'm going
to where I got a new Sports Bra form
sweaty Betty I love my Lululemon one but
it kind of makes you feel like I'm
suffocating I don't know if it's too
small or is just the shape of it this
one doesn't feel mega supportive I don't
know I'm going to give it a go
these like clip up at the back they clip
together at the back which makes it more
supportive and I've also got this long
sleeve tops and sweaty Betty it's quite
sunny today but I don't particularly hot
so I'm going to write long sleeves and
see how much I die these leggings I'm
obsessed with some sweaty Betty because
this so so high-waisted and then another
sweaty Betty thing that's like a zip up
if I need it
I'm literally entirely sweaty Betty
today damn it
32 double D is definitely the wrong size
for me I'm sure I try to honor it
install this part here is just like cut
in too much it's not like wide enough oh
that's so frustrating
look how high these leggings go
literally you like that much skin before
your sports bra I just signed high
waisted leggings so Ponte it's actually
really hot today so I'm going to wear
this desktop instead which is also
sweaty Betty you can tie it like this or
if you just let it go it's like a really
nice loose desktop it's quite long on
the back and at the front so you can
work both ways and it comes in black as
well I might get another one so that we
understand that eating rules for
exercise if I eat nothing I feel sick
and when I eat something I fell sick so
I'm just making a tiny bit porridge okay
I'm not going to vlog because I just
want to like get my hair done do it and
it be over and then come back and finish
off my work so I will see you in a bit
