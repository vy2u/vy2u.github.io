all well I'm in a slightly different
location today I hope the lighting is OK
this is kind of the first time in years
I've filmed with natural light so let's
hope it just stays like this for the
whole video today I'm going to be
filming a hall and most of stuff I
bought is from ASOS and most of it is
for our honeymoon we're going to South
Africa and I'm so excited I have never
been we're having quite an active
honeymoon we're doing Safari we're doing
a few days in Cape Town and then we're
driving down the garden route and like
going to lots of different places along
the way and I'm just so excited it's
going to be two weeks I think yeah I
think we're going for two weeks I can't
wait so I had to get loads of stuff
because it's obviously really hot there
and I have no summer clothes
well my summer clothes are just from
like years ago and now are still stuff
that I keep under my bed I'm going to be
taking with me but I needed to add in a
few extra pieces I also picked up some
stuff for now tip it's really cold in
the UK at the moment I need a few extra
bits so let me show you the winter stuff
first and then I'll get a little bit I
bought for our honeymoon also instead of
inserting cutaways of me wearing the
items I'm going to show you pictures
from the website just because I am NOT
summer body ready and it's much easier
this way so I hope you don't mind okay
the first thing is a hat I really needed
a new hat I only had one kind of woolly
hat and it was gray and I was just
getting a bit bored of it so I wanted
one that was black I got this from a
sauce it's just a plain I was mrs. black
wooly hat with a little beige bubble and
I love it I like how it's a bit big so
it comes sag down at the back because my
other hat was really small and fitted so
this is a little bit different and I've
been wearing it everyday since I got it
it's so cold here at the moment so this
is an essential I also picked up this
jumper which I'm wearing now I had a
voucher for a sauce and this is actually
from whistles but I got it on ASOS I saw
Amy from the little man Pie wearing it
and I love her she is beautiful I love
her style I will link her blog and
Instagram below because we don't follow
her you have to she was wearing this and
I just instantly knew I wanted it if
something to do with a navy blue and the
red it looks like school uniform jumper
to me and I really like it
it says darienne which means you're
welcome in French pretty sure if my
french
correct although now I'm doubting myself
I'm going to go with my instincts he
means you're welcome and I just love the
blue red color combo it's so comfortable
I also picked up from a sauce just a
plain black high net long-sleeved top I
just realized I didn't have this in my
wardrobe and I was missing it I just
wanted a plain black top of those jeans
it's nice have something a bit high to
keep you warm this is really soft and
it's slightly splits at the side which
just makes it a bit more flattering I
think everywhere in this a lot since I
got it and then this top if you follow
me on snapchat I think I showed on
snapchat all the sales from this hauls
all the things that I didn't keep and
one of them was an a/d desktop I ordered
it and when it arrived it was actually
in this like shiny sweaty materials I
wasn't expecting so I sent that one back
and then I realized they had the same
top of in a jersey material it's still
not as soft so I would like but it's so
much better so this is one of the ADI -
long sleeve top it's black with the
white stripes all the way down the arm
it's elasticated on the wrist and then
it has a little tiny - logo and I really
wanted one of these to wear maybe when
I'm traveling on the plane or just feel
like home days or when I'm relaxed I
wear a lot of comfortable casual clothes
and I love that ID - has made a comeback
I dressed was huge when I was a teenager
I used to wear the tracksuit bottoms of
the stripes down the side and then I had
like a long period of time where it was
really uncool to wear ID - and it's made
a comeback and I'm really happy because
I was always a fan when I was a teenager
so I'm getting really into Andy - so I
want some trainers now as well okay
that's all the winter stuff now onto the
honeymoon haul the kids are going on
Safari I've been told by a lot of people
that you need to bring light layers
because you wake up at like 5:00 in the
morning and you set out early and it's
not cold but it's that kind of fresh
morning air and it's nice to have in
layers so you can take them off as it
gets warmer I went to H&amp;amp;M and picked up
one of these gray long sleeve tops it's
kind of thin but soft so it's not tight
as bagging you loose and I can just wear
it over a t-shirt I thought that would
be perfect
I also bought this I won't be asked to
wear their Safari because they say you
have to wear like mutual colors but I
got to some Urban Outfitters and I
thought it should be good for the
holiday in general if I want to throw it
over a vest top when I'm wearing denim
shorts or something it's a check shirt
the colors its lilac mint green kind of
looks like a cowboy shirt but I really
like it it's from Urban Outfitters if I
didn't say it's so soft it's in this
really really soft material I really
like it and I know that I'll get a good
use out of it in the summer here as well
I really wanted to get another bikini
and again if you follow me on snapchat
you would have seen me rant about bikini
shopping and I know so many dudes I'd
recommend all these bikini brands for
full of us but one I find a lot of them
are quite hard to find they're in town
they're not that easily accessible and
also I find that bikinis are made for
fuller bust always really boring they
never like the interesting styles that I
see other people wearing that I want so
I definitely wanted to buy a bikini from
a source because I've seen this one I
really liked it the bottoms I got first
absolutely fine what size did I get
let's see I got a 12 I'm kind of at 10
to 12 but I find that bikinis I don't
want them to be tights because then I'll
just like bowls over the top so it's a
high-waisted bikini bottom which I've
never had before but I really like the
idea of high waisted and it has these
really long strings you basically wrap
around around around your stomach I
think it's really cool and different I
don't love showing my stomach off so
it's kind of like covers your stomach a
little bit I really like them got the
bottoms
absolu fine I ordered the top in 34
double D which is what my bra normally
is oh my god it was like this big it
seriously didn't even like cover my
nipple it was so small so I ordered a
few extra sizes it was bigger I think I
went all the way up to like an S or
something and nothing fit it was so
small and it makes me so angry because
it makes you feel a bit rubbish by
yourself when you're constantly trying
on things that are too small for you and
don't fit anyway eventually I found one
that fits it's definitely not the
perfect fit but it's fine what size did
I go for in the end 34 double F
definitely not my size but whatever it's
a bikini top that clips up at the back I
know that if you get one it ties it
easier if you're in between sizes but I
just really wanted this bikini Clips at
the back it has cup and then it does up
to do it up with a bow on your shoulders
and it looks fine does anyone really
like themselves in a bikini and I'm
jealous if you do I
but that fine it fits it works done I'm
never bikini shopping again
the next item is this black place suit
from ASOS I love this I think this is
probably the best thing that I bought
its high-waisted little shorts with
tassels at the bottom which I really
like and then I love how its kind of
high neck and a slightly halter neck
it's just really flattering the shape is
really flattering on me I love a place
suit they're so easy to wear when it's
hot because it's black I could probably
wear it to dinner as well we're going
somewhere kind of casual I thought that
would be really good for having me
another added ass piece I thought this
would be good just during the day and my
denim shorts if we're like driving
somewhere it's quite hot in the car it's
a vest top white with navy blue and then
the logo is this kind of palm print I
thought was really cool it doesn't fit
the best which sorry I think I went for
a 12 in the end and it's like you'd be
under here but I didn't want it to be
tight I think it looks fine it's so
casual and comfortable this top is from
whistles but again I got it from a sauce
and I thought it was the perfect summer
tee it's a white t-shirt with these baby
blue stripes and it has a black W which
I defined a top that has an L I feel
like things never have elves on them
obviously the double use for whistles
but I wish my name began with the W it's
so soft it's like hangs really nicely
it's got a nice weight to it and I just
can't tell you how soft this is kind of
reminds me of something you'd wear when
you're a child which I really like again
with denim shorts or jeans it would look
really nice and I'll wear this a lot in
London as well this top I picked up in
gypsy I think we see a check the label
yeah this was in the sale I randomly
went in there one day I was rich and I'm
actually really bad at sale shopping by
how to look and saw this tried all and
we were both like that actually really
nice I think it would be really good for
the honeymoon when we're going up for
dinner and I want to wear jeans and a
kind of desk top I don't really wear
like plain desktops by themself but this
is like a fancy desk top it's a really
nice blush pink color it looks kind of
plain from the fund has this sheer like
chiffon that hangs in the front which
just gives it a bit more of a smarter
feel and then if I turn it around you
can kind of see that it splits at the
back and opens up but it's got this
other layer underneath so you don't have
back out I hate having my back out who
was I telling this to the other day
every time I go into a Topshop I look at
something and I'm like all that to Vidia
night and then the back is completely
open I just don't like getting my back
out I feel like all closed at the moment
have backless things to them I really
like this I just thought it was nice and
smart casual not going to travel well I
can already tell it's very creased but I
feel like it's one of those things I
could probably hang up in the bathroom
and the shower would just steam it this
is the last item this is a bit like
wacky this is from ASOS and it's a dress
this is definitely something you can
wear on honeymoon summer holiday but I
wouldn't wear this in London it's very
like tropical it's a one-shoulder dress
I've never worn one shoulders one
something that's kind of off the
shoulder but this literally goes from
there under your armpits elasticated
it's really confident made out of this
like soft cotton and then it has this
orange Tassili feature and it's kind of
weird but then it just hangs on at the
bottom it's got this embroidery and the
weight of this stopped the dress like
flying around at the wind which I like
it's kind of a beach dress definitely
more of a casual beach dress type and I
thought it was really pretty and it
wasn't expensive I don't think I think
I'll get good use out of that on any
kind of summer holidays I have so those
other items I picked up for our
honeymoon and a few things too we're now
in London I'm genuinely so excited to go
to South Africa we've booked a lot of
stuff but if you have any
recommendations please leave them below
comment on this video we want to do
everything we're doing like Safari
Franchot wine region Cape Town garden
routes we're trying to do as much as we
can I don't know how relaxing this
holiday will be but it will be an
amazing experience and I love traveling
countries that I've never been to before
