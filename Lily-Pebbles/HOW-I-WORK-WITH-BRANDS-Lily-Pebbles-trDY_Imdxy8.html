this video quite a while ago now I put
on Instagram that I wanted to film a
video about working with brands and be
totally transparent and I got so many
messages from you guys with loads of
questions loads of questions which was
what I was expecting and why I wanted to
do this video I think that times have
changed I think consumers which includes
myself are very savvy and I think that
the influencer world I have talked
before about how I hate the word
influencer but the kind of influences /
content creator world has become a bit
confusing and I think although if you're
in it like me over the years we've kind
of learnt how things work but if you're
just a viewer I think it can be quite
confusing and I've just noticed that so
many people are getting things really
mixed up and very confused and feeling
quite untrusting of the content creators
that they watch so I wanted to do a
video from my perspective talk about how
I work with brands and the kind of
people that I know in my circle this
isn't gonna cover every country it's not
gonna cover it every content creator so
I think the first thing I'm gonna do is
really clearly define how this kind of
space is divided and I pretty sure yeah
British or Britons down here it's kind
of divided into four sections so let me
just do a quick like Casey nice that
style and write that down on a piece of
paper for you okay here we have
affiliate marketing I use someone called
rewards style not someone I use a
company called rewards style and that
includes things like like to know it
which you've probably seen shop pages on
my blog and can any affiliate links that
have a little star next to them that
includes like swipe up on Instagram then
there is display advertising which
includes YouTube ads and ads on blogs
which I actually don't have anymore
so that's my only display ads that I
have brand partnerships which is working
with brands so I'm gonna put sponsored
content and then you have PR which
includes press trips free products
discount cards and I've probably
forgotten some kind of subheadings but
just so you can see as an overview
affiliate display brand partnerships PR
that's kind of how its split so now that
that's clear how those kind of separate
things are defined I'm gonna get on to
the questions which I've split into
three sections the first one being
affiliate and display because there
weren't many questions there it's not
that complicated and I have got notes in
front of me partly because I won't
remember everything that I want to say
also I'm terrified I'm gonna just say
something slightly wrong and then people
are just gonna pick up on that so I've
written myself notes because I want to
do this properly and I want to pop this
video feeling confident in what I've
said so the first question was I just
want to clarify the percentage you get
from someone actually buying not
clicking but buying a product from an
affiliate link I don't earn any money
from people clicking on a link there are
some websites that do that I don't use
it so I only earn money if someone buys
the product and also worth mentioning
that that doesn't include if they return
the product you don't earn money if the
product is returned
so my affiliate I had a look and it
ranges from like 5 to 15% but for me it
rarely goes over 8% so it's really not
that much and I always use other
people's affiliate links because it
doesn't make any difference to the
person buying a product you guys don't
spend any more it just helps out the
content creators that you watch the
expression is I'd like to know how it
works with YouTube ads the ones before a
video starts I'm curious is YouTube
actually able to be a day job without
sponsorship so YouTube ads done by cost
per thousand views so you earn per
thousand views and that's done by
something called CPM cost per mil and
everyone's CPM is completely different
so your earnings will fluctuate
different throughout the year there used
to be like fixed to CPMs but now it's
just completely different depending on
your content the time of year how many
videos you make so many different things
come into CPMs they're too complicated
for even me to be able to explain but
basically you can have ads on your
before your videos during and after I
usually put mine on before and after I
don't put them during I used to
experiment with that and I found that it
it just kind of interrupted the content
I'd
love it when I'm watching videos and
there's an ad in the middle so I'm not
gonna put that up for you guys even if
that means earning more money in terms
of earnings this might help you guys
kind of gauge a little bit but I earn
less from my YouTube videos in a year
than I did when I worked full time as a
marketing manager before I quit my job
to do this full-time
so that's affiliate and YouTube ads the
next section is all about PR public
relations which normally means non paid
for kind of coverage so the first
question is what a brand sends you
something do you always have to talk
about them or is it only when you sign a
contract no you don't have to there's no
obligation to give coverage when a
product is sent to you by a brand do you
ever feel pressured to give a brand or a
specific product a positive review
because you enjoy working with that
brand in general or because they have
invited you to amazing events etc I
think over the years a lot of us have
definitely created relationships and
friendship with the PRS who work for the
brands so in some way you might be less
likely to want to like bash a product
because you like the PR but I would
never I would never like give a positive
review to a product just because I like
the brand if anything I would just not
mention it I get sent a lot of stuff
maybe like five parcels a day with lots
of products in it and most of stuff I
don't mention because if I was just
showing you guys everything it would
just it would be overwhelming so I
usually only show you the stuff that I
like although there are some occasions
where that is different for example I
love paradise it and if you guys saw an
Instagram I tested out that face hand
and I know Jules I think he's a really
good guy it was a really cool new
exciting brand but because of the hype I
felt like I wanted to give you guys a
really honest review and I gave it a
pretty negative review but they dealt
with it so well they emailed me and they
said like sorry didn't work for you why
don't you try this product I think this
would work for you is dead we'd love for
you to meet up with Jules he can explain
to you how to use the product he can
give you a spray tan and they just kind
of embraced it rather than seeing it as
a negative or a failure so I think it
doesn't make a difference in terms of
giving a positive or negative review for
me did you ever experience that if you
gave a rather negative but honest review
that brands no longer send you their
product yes I have experienced that
before with brands it was a bit shocking
at first because I just thought that
that was
that's what the bloggers space is all
about I thought that all brands
understood that but to be honest I don't
need the product I know that sounds a
bit like maybe arrogant but I could go
out and buy a lipstick if I wanted to so
I don't rely on them sending me fraud
free product if they want to stop
sending me products and stop inviting me
to their events that is fine and
honestly it's a bit of a shame because I
think well I probably won't be able to
work with that brand now but if they're
going to act like that then they're
probably not brand that I would want to
work with anyway so it is rare but some
brands take it really personally and
it's just it's not personal it's it's
products and makeup and marketing so how
are influencers chosen to go on trips
and are the trips fully paid by the
companies or do they just pay flights
and accommodation ok so press trips
press trips have been going on for
decades in the kind of journalism world
how it used to work I guess is a brown
would take journalists away and it would
very much be in exchange for coverage
because you have to remember those
journalists are employed full time so
they've got to get permission from their
boss to take time away from the office
and they're there for a reason to give
coverage they're also getting paid
whilst they're on their trip they're
getting their normal salary so it's
slightly different with how it works
with us and I can't speak on behalf of
brands about how I think they pick
people to go on trips I think it depends
on how they see that person whether they
fit with the brand kind of look and
ethos of the brand they look at numbers
of followers usually when I go on a ship
there is a mix of someone who has
millions of followers someone who has a
few hundred thousand and there's someone
who has less as well there's normally
quite a range some brands think about
who gets on with each other in terms of
like creating content when you're out
there I think every brand kind of looks
at it differently but yet the trips are
normally fully comped fully
complimentary the flights are paid for
the hotel is paid for all the food and
drink everything most press trips
everything is free and it's amazing we
all feel very lucky to be invited on
these trips as I said they have been
happening for years and it's just part
of like PR budget the brands have the
next question is when you get invited on
a bloggers trip so they often invite you
to bring a plus-one is that how you
manage is that how people manage to
bring their partners or do they cover
the cost themself Plus Ones are very
rare I I think a pop and isn't
I've never been able to bring a plus-one
usually I've kind of worked around it
because me and Anna will get invited on
the trip together and it's so nice one
knowing you're going away with someone
you know because it can be really
intimidating is exciting as the trips
are you don't know who you're going with
and traveling is a very like you really
get to know someone you're traveling
especially if you're scared of flying or
you get a bit homesick you can be in
quite a vulnerable state so it's a bit
intimidating if you don't who you're
going with and I love traveling with
Anna often brands won't invite us
together because they assume we have
exactly the same audience and so they
they're thinking about it in more more
strategically like why would we have two
people who have the same reach but the
way I see it is that when you're with
someone you know and get on with you
create better content you can take
photos of each other you can film and
vlog with each other it's a bit tricky
if you're not away with anyone you know
because then it's difficult to take
photos and really that is what the brand
wants so it's in their best interests
for you to have someone with you who can
take photos and stuff with you but yeah
rich has a full time job so he can never
come anyway but it's nice when you're
going away with other Creators that you
get on with also to answer that question
I think sometimes people do pay for plus
ones I don't know though because I've
never done that when a brand flies you
somewhere and pays for your
accommodation is that the extent of the
compensation or do you also get cash
payment for the content you produce it
seems unfair for brands to call the trip
itself payment and not pay people for
their time like any other company would
for a work trip so unless the content is
disclaimed as an ad no it is not paid
for the trip is paid for but the content
isn't controlled in any way you're not
asked to put anything specific so yet
often trips are just free and we can
make content if we want but we don't
have to do often a paid for
collaboration will coincide with a press
trip and that's because there's content
there to work from if they're taking you
to an amazing country for a launch and
they also have marketing budget to work
with you on that then often that will
coincide but that would be treated like
a normal job it would just happen to
happen on a press ship basically if it
says ad it's been paid for if it doesn't
and it hasn't how do you not get
overwhelmed with the amount of products
brands send you we do it's it's really
lovely and at the beginning it was very
exciting but yeah it is overwhelming
just because I feel bad about the
product that goes to waste I don't
really like doing giveaways because I
feel like it's a bit like bribing my
audience like I'll give you this if you
subscribe to me and I don't I don't like
that I also just think the recycling
when products are sent in like massive
packaging it just breaks my heart in
terms of the things that can't be
recycled but yeah is overwhelming and I
often like it when brands email saying
would you like to try this product or
this is our new collection which shades
do you think will work for you because
we don't need 200 lipsticks there's no
way I could possibly ever use all of
them but often these buyers just have
our addresses from years and years of
like this relationship and we don't get
asked if we want the product before
they're sent so it's quite difficult to
manage it's really exciting seeing all
the new Beauty launches but yeah it's
it's overwhelming and with that we don't
want to show too much either because we
don't seem like we're showing off and
often content creators get a lot of hate
when they show the amount of product
that we get sent for free do you get
special blogger discounts when shopping
yes some brands give you discount cards
which is probably something people don't
realize because you don't have to
disclaim anything like that I just think
it's a really clever way for brands to
work with people because it encourages
you to be more genuine and authentic
with your purchases instead of being
sent a dress that you might not usually
wear and then feeling like maybe you
have to share it because it's quite an
expensive dress and they sends it to you
even though you didn't ask for it and
you have this like ongoing guilt I'd
prefer to just be able to shop in that
brand that brands shop that I already
like but have a bit of press discount
like I said journalists have had it for
absolute years and yet I have maybe like
four or five discount cards for some of
the brands that I shop at quite often so
yeah that's that's really nice and a
really nice way to work brands I think
it encourages more of a long-term
relationship I've never disclaimed free
or discounted products because you don't
have to and also I think it would be too
confusing disclaiming ads free
discounted there's too many different
things to disclaim I think for me as a
viewer it's important to know songs
being paid to say something but other
than that I think you should just trust
the content creator that you're watching
which is so important I would never
recommend something if I didn't like it
whether it was free whether I paid for
it often if something is very expensive
I'll say I got sent this just so you
guys don't think like Wow Lily started
buying really expensive things and she
doesn't normally
it's tricky but you don't you don't have
to and it's a bit like with home
renovation I've got a few bigger things
gifted in my home renovation means given
for free but I haven't been paid to talk
about it because the brands aren't
controlling the content I don't have to
disclaim that but it's tricky for me to
figure out how to disclaim that just so
you guys don't feel like cheated in any
way often brands don't like people
saying if content creators got it for
free or discounted because then they'll
get bombarded with emails from newer
content creators asking for the same
thing it's it's very confusing you just
have to have an element of trust with
the person you're watching knowing that
they wouldn't recommend something they
didn't genuinely like no matter if they
paid for it or not I haven't really
changed the way I disclaimer since day
one and I think that's the kind of
clearest I can be okay now on to the
marketing section which is the most
complicated and I think what people are
most scared of which is why I wanted to
make this video so I really hope this
doesn't like blow your mind and confuse
you and make you doubt everyone you
watch on YouTube because that is not
what I'm trying to do the first question
is can you explain the process of
working with a brand from start to
finish now I wasn't sure whether to just
talk through this or if it's getting it
very confusing and when to write on a
bit of paper I might do both let's try
it this way first and see what it's like
so a brand will contact either myself or
my agent gleam who I've been with for
like four years or something at that
point if it goes to gleam often my
manager would just message me or phone
me and she'll just like shout a brand at
me she'll just be like made calm I'm
just saying that because my made.com
poof is over there I'll either go hmmm
no not for me or oh yeah I love that
brand and that's kind of the first step
before any money or anything is
discussed if I'm interested they will
then request the product for me to try
yes Lilly's interested please can you
send her the foundation and she'll give
it a go and that's so important for me
that's there if I like it I'm reading
for my paper because it's confusing if I
like it
aa gleam will then request from the
brand their campaign messaging timings
budget scope of work which means like do
they want a video an Instagram a tweet
and then that will kind of get pitched
back to me again if I
all those things or there's a lot of
back-and-forth at that point I then
decide the creative I don't suggest what
will work best for me and my audience
and then there's just a lot of
back-and-forth at that point a brief is
written up and a brief is created mainly
for my benefit so then when I sit down
and create the content I've got
everything in one place and I know what
I'm doing
and that again is negotiated back and
forth a lot in that brief there'll be
like three key messages some social
handles that I need to use and hashtags
and any extra information I need to know
about the product at this point I'm
still not committed to do the job the
job goes into production as in like a
film the video take the photos and then
it goes to the brand for approval and at
this point it's only factual amends so
only if I got something wrong that was
agreed in the brief can it be changed
other than that it's just for them to
see it before it goes live I do any
edits if I need to and then it goes live
and that was a lot of information there
and I'm gonna kind of break down some of
those points in the questions that are
coming up because I know some of you
probably think at this point what the
hell is a key message what do you mean
by factual immense and what you're
talking about when you say you've got a
brief and I'm gonna try and cover all
those things in these following
questions but that is the kind of
overall process of working with a brand
start to finish so the first question is
how do you choose who you work with is
money a factor so as I just mentioned in
the process money comes into it after
I've decided whether I like the brand
and the product obviously money is a
factor this is my job and I know what my
worth is you know I've been doing this
for eight years and I know what brands
spend on other forms of advertising I
know my worth in terms of like what my
time is worth and that's to do with like
what other brands are paying me for my
time so I can compare to that my time is
worth my reach in terms of like how many
people I reach so of course money is a
factor like any other jobs but often
I'll work with brands who have less
budget than I usually work with just
because I love that brand and I really
want to do the job so it's also very
flexible do brands tend to contact you
directly about sponsored content or your
management or do you put an idea to them
about how you could advertise their
product or both I got so many questions
about this which I thought was so
interesting because I've rarely rarely
ever contact brands to work with them
anytime that happens if I've got
long relationship with the PR that I've
known for like four years and I just
want to take to the next step and say
like let's do something more interesting
than just you sending me products and me
putting up my Instagram stories that's
do something I confess my time in and
she's something really cool and that's
probably the only time I ever pitch to
brands 95% of the time brands come to me
at the beginning they were all coming
direct to me and I think when you sign
with an agent at the beginning you feel
a bit like frustrated because you think
well I'm just I'm just putting all these
jobs through them I'm just giving them
their 20% and I could be here without
them but it's always like that at the
beginning and then gradually kind of
shifts and you know I started getting
jobs that other people in my agency were
turning down and the more well-known my
agents become brands go straight to them
so I say now it's an equal amount if
they come to me I put them straight in
touch with my agent and if they come to
my agent they let me know and it's just
a really open conversation do you get to
test out the products that has been
sponsored before agreeing to work with
the brand and do you decline to work
with them if it's not something you like
enjoy or proceed to give your honest
feedback
this step is 100% the most important for
me I always try a product if I haven't
tried it before or look into a brand
before working with them the only
exception I have to this rule is the job
I did with Simba mattresses because the
job entailed the mattress arriving in
this massive box and me kind of opening
it and put onto the bed so it was
impossible for me to try at first
without me then having to like fake my
reaction so in that case if the mattress
had arrived and I've logged the whole
thing and not liked it was something had
gone wrong but delivery had been bad
then I would have just said I don't want
to do this job anymore it wasn't what I
was expected and I'm not happy with it
and that would have been Friday I would
have pulled out and you guys would have
never known about it that's the only
exception every other job I've always
tried product first how do you the
company decide on the amount to pay for
your work so this is tricky sometimes
brands have like a set amount of budget
to work with you sometimes they have no
idea they'll just say like we don't know
what it costs can you let us know
sometimes they come to my agent they're
like we've got this much to play with
and brands constantly shifting their
budget now as they maybe do less
traditional advertising move over to
this or they're you know it depends on
the time of year what budgets they have
but I guess things that they factor in
as
said reach so how big the audiences and
who the audience is if it's right for
them how long the job takes to produce
whether you need help a photographer or
videographer whether you need to do it
in a weekend need whether you need to
stay over the night somewhere to do it
being affiliated with that brand is a
big deal on both sides and my agency
work around like rough rates they have
like a kind of rough rate there's no
such thing as a rate card as such
because like I said it's different every
time I've done so many bright so many
brand jobs where I've done it for less
than my normal amount because I love the
brand and I just want to make it work
and I've done it some times where they
have more budget for influencer
marketing but under charging for a job
isn't really good for anyone I always
think like I could do loads and loads
and loads of jobs in the charge less but
one like we've spent so many years in
this industry trying to convince brands
of our worth so me under charging isn't
good for anyone else out there that's
trying to like charge a set amount but
also I don't want to be doing five ads a
week like you guys would hate that so my
aim is to do less jobs over the year
that are like better quality rather than
loads of jobs for less amount if that
makes sense I think like long term brand
partnerships are where is that you often
talk about working with brands to
integrate the sponsored product
organically in your content how long
does the back-and-forth and I do
development usually take often brands
come to us really last minute I think
they're still trying to get their head
around like working in this space and
often they will come and say we need
this next week or like last week I got a
job on Wednesday for that Sunday so
sometimes it could be such a quick
turnaround which makes it quite
stressful and it means that we always
have to be on hand 24/7 to be like
working on briefs and prepping for jobs
but in total I would say 70% of the time
is spent prepping the job 20% of time is
spent creating the job and then 10% it's
been once it's gone live and collecting
kind of any data afterwards so I hope
that gives you a bit of an overview of
the kind of back and forth it's most of
the time is spent on that kind of back
and forth beginning stage do you
consider yourself being more picky now
in a positive sense when it comes to
working with brands versus when you
started blogging and have you noticed a
change in your behavior
I've always been picky I've always just
thought like would I be embarrassed if
my friends saw this I'm not good at
lying so I've never been able to kind of
lie about anything like that but my
taste has changed and it will always
continue to change so there might be
products that I put an ad video at the
beginning that I no longer like because
my taste has changed or something I
would never thought I would have wanted
to work with but now I like if that
makes sense I think content creators
have the right to change their mind
about things their opinions and their
tastes
but there are definitely more
conversations to be had now because more
people understand the space the next
question is I would want to know if they
just pay you a fixed amount for doing a
video on their brand or is it related to
every purchase that products with your
link and how many views plus the fixed
price this question like sums up how
confused people are so it's very
important to me that there is no sales
pressure none of the work I ever do is
dependent on you guys spending any money
if a brand said to me we'll pay you to
pension on how many clicks the link gets
or how many purchase people make I would
just say no because that means that I've
got a motivation and incentive to sell
to you guys and that is just not worry
about so no it's definitely always a
fixed price that is agreed beforehand
and it's just nothing to do with how you
guys spend your money do you ever
negotiate your fee or cost with brands
when given a monetary offer is this done
by your agent yes this is all done by my
agent both because of time and also like
it's just a bit awkward but yeah if if I
want to do the job I would never start
negotiating on money if I wasn't
interested anyway but if I want to do
the job and I love the product and the
money just isn't right whatever the
reason is yes jobs can often be
negotiated I find that usually if they
know their budget then they kind of
stick with it so yeah that conversation
is done with you my agent and the brand
but it's my decision they'll say to me
this is how much they've got do you want
to do this and if I say no I don't feel
like that's right then they'll start
negotiating it's all it's all agreed
through me first is it possible that you
film a video for the brand and they
don't approve it for example you didn't
mention some points that they think are
important in their product and you have
to do the video all over again okay so
let's talk quickly about key messages
and I'm sure you guys know that when you
watch youtuber videos and there's an ad
often they are
mentioning some like key points whether
it's to do with ingredients or launch
date or how it makes your skin feel
there are key messages and yes maybe
it's a shame that it's not totally
authentic like you would naturally speak
about products but this brand is paying
for the coverage it's marketing at the
end of the day and there's always going
to be key messages that's the difference
between a paid job and not paid job is
that if you pay for it you get specific
messages and those are negotiated I
would never like say something that just
totally felt icky to me but yes often
there are gonna be like three key
messages in a video have I ever had it
where a brand doesn't approve it it's
very rare as the brief is all agreed
beforehand which is something is very
important to me and my agent who spends
so much time on that brief so that we
don't have to refilm often there is a
period of time where I might have to
re-edit because I've said something that
isn't correct normally it's only factory
look factual amends which means that if
I've actually said something wrong
especially if it's legal that is where
they have a right for me to edit if I
was doing an ad for mascara and I said
oh it makes my lashes look twice as long
as they normally look that's like a
legal claim and I can't say that unless
it's true so that's where it kind of
gets a bit tricky but no I would never
refilm I've never in the past had to do
that because because of the brief I know
what I'm doing beforehand the next
question is when you work really hard on
something and then get told but they
don't like it once they review it how
does that work and does it take up more
of your time like I just said I wouldn't
redo it if I didn't do something
factually wrong but it's a bit
heartbreaking as someone who used to
work like in a normal job in an office I
thrive off feedback I have feedback from
you guys which I absolutely love and
live for but then I also like feedback
from the brands that I work with and
often you just don't hear from the
brand's you either do a job it goes down
well and you just don't hear from the
brand's or you do a job and there's a
come back and forth of editing and
getting it right and then you just never
know if the brand is happy or not and I
if I know a brand is disappointed or you
know the process wasn't as smooth as
they had hoped I feel really like
heartbroken because I just don't want
anyone to be disappointed so I find that
quite difficult I love a good like pat
on the back and you don't really get
that from the brand side of
but often I would just ask a brand for
feedback how did you feel that job went
down when in your career did you decide
you're comfortable working with brands
where you ever approached before you are
with a management team if so is the
process the same or different working
with a brand on your own versus
management I was with them pretty early
on before brands dust working with us
properly but I just know that it's so
much easier in terms of time going back
and forth I just wouldn't have the time
to do it and gleam obviously have a
legal team and a finance team which do
all of the complicated stuff I could
never do like contracts and chasing
payments and all of that so it makes it
a million times easier in my opinion as
someone who works for a brand what do
you like when working with brands and
how can brass work with content creators
to get the best outcome for both parties
I think it's just working together on
the creative rather than coming to a
content creator with a finished idea we
want you to fly to the moon wear a red
dress and say this this and this we want
this exact sentence said like it's too
prescribed we know what works best with
our audience of course because we've
been doing this for so many years and we
put up videos regularly and we know how
you guys react I feel like we know you
just as well as you know us it's much
better for Bryan comes and says people
this product would you like to try it
and if so ish we chat about how maybe we
can integrate this into your content
that is just so much better than then
having this proscribed idea I would
never work from a script because you
guys would know that it's not me talking
so just being really flexible with the
key messages and the creative helps a
lot when a brand approaches you about
creating sponsored content do they ask
you to show it in a specific way for
example it has to be in a video or in an
Instagram or did they give more freedom
to fit it where you like I think it's a
mix I'd say probably most of the time
they kind of know what they want but
often they'll just say we want to work
with you how do you think's best and
I'll suggested like for example my
favorite ways to work with brands or on
YouTube and Instagram just because they
are my favorite and I prefer my blog to
be a bit more like a personal
behind-the-scenes separate thing I just
find that sponsored content goes down
best on Instagram and YouTube for me and
for like I would I wouldn't feel
comfortable a brand sponsoring a tweet
anymore because I know how quickly those
tweets just get lost and I don't think
they would get out of it
they want so often I'll suggest
sometimes they know exactly what they
want since you have an agency are you
ever worried that sometimes that can
hinder what brands work with you in
terms of smaller brands finding it
intimidating no because whoever contacts
my agency they will always let me know
whether there's budget whether there's
no budget they're just lovely girls a
really really nice team and often
they're excited for me if a brand gets
in touch who they know that I like like
whether or not it's going to earn them
any income or not doesn't affect whether
they help me they've been helping me so
much with house renovation stuff and
that's not a job I'm not getting paid
they're not getting any money for it but
they're helping me with all kinds of
things so they're not just like greedy
money grubbers any small brand can get
in touch with me directly or with my
brand with my agents and I'll always get
the say on whether I'm interested or not
do you feel put off working with a brand
if they've already worked with a lot of
other creators on a product because
people would just think it's good money
I'm not worried about people thinking
it's good money offering if we're
working on a campaign with a brand and
say we've agreed that we're gonna put
our Instagram up at 1 o'clock on a
Tuesday I'll put that Instagram up and
then I'll see 10 others and I'll think
oh why has the brand done that but often
we don't get told who else is part of a
campaign I'll always ask but we don't
always get told and I just it's not that
I'm embarrassed to be doing it at the
same time I just think wouldn't have
been so much better to stagger it it's
just I think it's a bit much for the
audience to see everything at one time
but that's really totally out of our
control I wouldn't be embarrassed to do
a job that someone else has previously
already done because I think as long as
you like the brand of product that's all
that's important or for me and Anna work
on similar brands or the same brands and
we just have a different approach and I
think it's fine and our audience is
slightly different anyway what do you
think about creators who use very
expensive and hyped up products but are
ambassadors for lower end skincare
brands and I always think do they
actually use it well I think it's
important to note that people can like
high-end and low-end products there's no
like she only uses high-end she only
uses low end obviously we get sent a lot
of high-end products so the majority of
what we use is probably gonna be
high-end because wouldn't you use those
if you got sent them to but you can have
your taste can range like for me I don't
even really think about price that much
when I talk about products it's just how
it
feels and whether I like it or not but
saying that often I've turned down big
jobs like really well-paid exciting jobs
because I don't like the brand or don't
like the product and then I see someone
else do it and I think oh I really hope
that they like it because if not that
it's just Shady but each to their own
you can't control what other people do
and like I said earlier you have to have
an element of trust with the content
creator that you're choosing to watch
and if you feel funny about the content
they're making and then just don't watch
them don't put yourself through it have
you ever started a relationship with a
brand or a deal and had to cool it off
what are your deal-breakers red flags
when exploring a new possible brand deal
yeah I've got a couple of examples which
I won't name for obvious reasons but one
with a brand who I absolutely love and
was desperate to work with for years
they were on my like wish list of brands
I would love to work with now such a
shame and that's more to do with them
just being too big of a company there's
too many like legal constraints they
were too worried about the competitors
being in the background of my videos and
that's just something I can't control if
I'm vlogging and someone's got a product
in the background that is a competitor I
can't like blur that out it's just it's
if brands are too worried about that
kind of thing they need to stick to
traditional advertising because that's
just not what influencer marketing is
about and then the other one they just
had unrealistic expectations of what the
content should look like and they kind
of wants to control it and make it look
like something that was on their channel
rather than considering what fitted with
my content competitors is often
something that brands really worry about
because they don't want to be paying for
the content and then have one of the
competitors kind of in there for free
just for the ride but it's difficult for
us because we know that what we do is
authentic in that we have lots of
different brands and products all at the
same time so that's always quite tricky
to navigate some youtubers add add in
the video minutes before talking about a
product instead of clearly telling
people it's an ad in the title of the
thumbnail how do you feel about this and
why doesn't YouTube take action in terms
of disclaiming ad it is so so
complicated and I hope that I kind of
explained this well but it's very
confusing for everyone there is
something called the aasa' which is the
Advertising Standards Authority and they
set guidelines so even that it's a
guideline is not like a law they set
guidelines on what to do and they're
constantly learning and changing it's
very difficult to keep up is such a new
space no one really knows whereas like
in a magazine it might say promotion in
the top hand corner if it's like being a
paid promotion or in a TV show if
there's like a product placement it
might be on like the credit there's
there's all different ways and how to
disclaim it before the a sa kind of came
about in terms of our space I always
used to write in the description box
this video is sponsored by this brand
just cuz I felt like I wanted to tell
you guys and then when it became more
official
I've add in the title I now put ad in
the thumbnail because the way I
interpret what they si have said and
everyone interprets it in a different
way I interpret it that I just need to
warn you guys before consuming the
content that there is a paid for
promotion in there if the entire video
isn't controlled by the brand if there's
just a small section then I think yes
you can just kind of put it up on the
screen whilst that fits there but to me
you guys have already clicked on the
video that and you've already given me
my view which is how I kind of earn
YouTube ad money or views so I prefer to
warn you beforehand so you can make the
informed decision whether or not to
watch the video yes that means I
probably get less views on an ad video
than someone who doesn't do that but I
think it's more honest so that's why I
choose to do that but basically whether
something is officially an ad or not
according to the a si is whether the
brand has controlled the content so it's
not even necessarily about money
although the way I see it is if you're
getting paid for something it's an ad
and if you're not it's not but it's also
to do with whether they're controlling
the creative of that content I think
just doing this job has shown me like
how much of that there was around before
influencers became a thing that we just
maybe weren't as savvy towards you
weren't as aware you know when you read
celebrity interviews and magazines and
they talk about what's in the handbag
and they happen to have this specific
lip balm that's probably paid for and it
will be disclaimed somewhere but we just
never used to know those things were ads
or like if you're watching a soap opera
and they're drinking a specific drink
that's probably sponsored as well it's
just with what we do we're extra
transparent and extra obvious about it
which is why everyone's kind of freaking
out a little bit I think the next
question is I remember you worked in
marketing before blogging you
became your full-time job has this
affected how you approach working with a
brand or a brand's confidence working
with you I think it's just made me more
professional I would always tell a brand
if I thought that their expectations but
off like once I had a really nice makeup
brand that I love they wanted to work
with me on a lipstick launch and they
wanted sales they gave me like a swipe
up link of Instagram and they said we
want to generate as many sales as
possible and I said I just don't think
this job is right for me or for you
because I know that my audience probably
won't buy a lipstick from a swipe up
link I would and I don't really buy
makeup online I've just I'd see it and
go that's a nice lipstick and then I'd
go to boots and buy it so I wanted to
manage their expectations because if
they work with me and then they're
disappointed that's not good for me
that's not good for them it's not good
for other content creators that they
were potentially thinking of working
with in the future so I think in that
sense I'm a bit more business C in terms
of making sure I manage everyone's
expectations
how do brands measure whether an ad has
actually had an impact well I can't
speak for brands but I think it depends
on the objectives of their campaign
whether that's sales awareness downloads
clicks maybe they've got a discount code
with like a trackable link that they can
look at the analytics but then like I
said often people will see an ad and
then they'll just go in to store it and
buy it and that's impossible to track so
brands just kind of need to be aware of
that I think that it's not always
something you can get analytics from but
I once had a brand come up to me and say
you know thank you so much your link
this was just like a non-paid thing but
your link to our shop sent 10,000 people
to our website he was like no one bought
anything but it was incredible so I like
kind of loved that approach to it he was
like he was just excited to have people
visit the website if they didn't buy
anything I didn't matter it was just
that they were kind of getting to know
the brand and I think that's a really
good approach why is it that you can
accept a weekend away with a brand or
blog that experience showing using all
the products yes not classed as an ad
and that's because they're not
controlling the content there's no key
messages they don't approve it before it
goes live they don't get to like see the
photo before you put on Instagram you
can mention other competitors and
they're not paying you for the content
do you ever feel envious when a brand
approaches a bloggers friend and
you never feel envious in terms of like
not wanting them to get that opportunity
I'm always happy for my fellow content
creators to get every like opportunity
they get the only time that probably
applies if there's a brand that I have
loved for years organically on my own
without kind of all talking to them and
then maybe say like for the first time
they work with content creators and they
don't choose to work with me I'm just
always a bit like gutted that I don't
know just because I think that it's so
nice if I already love the brand but
brands are so different some choose to
work with people who they know already
love the product and then some choose to
work with people who they think will
they're already loving it so we don't
need to work with them let's work with
the people who aren't talking about us
already and I think it's nice for brands
to work with people who already like
their product but every brand is
different
do you brands care more about numbers of
followers or engagement or followers
again I think it depends on the brand we
all know that subscriber numbers mean
nothing because you can be subscribed to
a channel and not watch their videos so
I think they look more views and like
likes on a photo which is more about
engagement really comments and who the
audience is and how they react to that
person's content I think I think
engagement is more important but every
brand is different I think I feel like
I've ended every question with every
brand is different oh my god this is
gonna be the longest video of all time I
hope you guys are still with me what
happens when a sponsored video goes down
badly how does keeping your integrity
versus seeing dollar signs work this is
the final question so I would never work
with a product I didn't like but often
what happens is a job will come in I
like the product tick I like the brand
tick but then their key messages
sometimes a little bit off and that I
find so frustrating because I'm like
here I am being totally honest working
with a brand and a product that I like
but their marketing campaign the
campaign they've chosen
I just don't think will work with my
audience and then it's all about
compromise often I will say to the brand
just you know I don't think this key
message will go down well with my
audience I know them well and I think
that you might get some hate on this
video if we don't change it and they're
just so kind of stuck in their ways of
having their marketing campaign they
like no we want to keep it like that
it's important for our overall campaign
because you have to remember
marketing campaign isn't just about
working with someone in YouTube there'll
be billboard ads magazine ads and they
like all to tie in together so for me at
that point I think well should I risk it
because I'm being honest here I'm
working with a brand and a product that
I like and you can never really predict
how something's gonna go down sometimes
I'm really worried about a video and I
think so there's a lawnmower out there
and I think I'm gonna get hate on this
and then it goes down fine and then
sometimes I think oh I love this video
and I get loads of hate on it so I don't
want to base my like income working with
a brand on fear and predicting how a
video is gonna go down so sometimes and
I'm sure you guys can think of an
example on my channel where I've worked
with the products and a brand that I
like but the key message was a little
bit mmm and negotiating key messages is
really tricky but the end of the day I
think if I go home and I can sleep at
night knowing that I do genuinely like
that product then the rest is just
marketing fluff I always take learnings
away from a job if a job goes down
really badly I will sit possibly with my
managers and say why did that go down so
badly and I will learn from it and think
about that next time I think that we are
doing very well as content creators to
keep things honest and open and I think
it's a really exciting new way of
advertising that I as a consumer much
prefer to kind of seeing a celebrity on
a TV ad using a shampoo that you don't
know if they've ever used before in
their life we have a close relationship
so you guys know you can trust me but
anyway terrified to put this video up
hoping you guys get it hoping I didn't
say anything wrong and I really hope it
was interesting I opening and I hope you
will stick with me and thank you so much
for watching oh my god this is gonna be
like an hour-long video I will see you
guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
