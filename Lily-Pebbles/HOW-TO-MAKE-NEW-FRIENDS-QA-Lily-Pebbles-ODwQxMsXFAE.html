hope you're having a good Sunday morning
sorry there was no video on Wednesday I
have been all over the place recently I
realized that personality trait of mine
recently is that when I'm busy with work
I'm all good I can kind of handle that
and I just get really stuck in but when
something like personal comes the mix I
find it really hard to balance things so
recently I've been planning my
bestfriend pen which was last weekend
and it's just taken over and I find it
really hard probably because I work from
home I find it really hard to separate
like tasks things just start to give and
yeah I feel like I've been all over the
place and then this week I just like me
trying to get back into things I've been
so tired I don't know what is going on I
just don't feel like myself so I missed
Wednesday's upload and I almost missed
today's but last minute I remembered
that I had a friendship Q&amp;amp;A to do for
you guys I asked a couple of weeks ago I
think some questions for QA about
friendship which is a topic that I'm
very passionate about and you guys have
so many good questions took me ages to
compile some I've got like two pages of
questions here and I'm just going to
work my way through them and I haven't
like read them or planned the answer in
any way which means this might be a
little bit rambling but I also feel like
then you get my true like honest answer
on things and it's not to like thought
through sorry if the light goes in and
out fit because the blinds are behind me
okay I'm going to go with the first
question because there are so many and
this one is what do you and your husband
it's still so weird to hear the word
husband well you and your husband think
of friends of the opposite sex are you
okay with him going out for lunch with a
female friend like this question is
probably more to do with your
relationship as a couple rather than my
friendships but I think if you trust the
person you're with then it shouldn't be
an issue at all I absolutely have no
problem with rich going out for lunch
with any female friends or female work
colleagues or anything like that because
I totally trust him there isn't like one
part of me that would be worried about
that I was I think it's important to
have friends from the opposite sex
I've got best friends here guys and rich
definitely wouldn't mind if I went out
with them but I was editing as important
that IDO bus would be invited in both
situations I think if I had a male
friend who are only ever like seeing
without
and I never wanted to come along that
could be weird but if the options there
for an invite I think totally normal
what do you think is the best way of
making new friends I'm 28 and I don't
have a best girl mate or group of mates
I have friends but they're scattered
across the world and sometimes I feel
lonely I'm quite shy which makes it hard
I've never should have to pluck up the
courage to try and make new friends at
my age and there were so many questions
about making new friends next one
I work from home I find it quite hard to
meet people since I'm no longer in
school and I don't have any co-workers
but I'm looking for advice on how to
meet new people so many questions about
making new friends and I think it is
really hard like as an adult to meet new
friends you know you go to school you
maybe go to uni or college and you meet
new people and then when you start a new
job you mean you people worked on that
there aren't that many situations over
here you have the opportunity and I
guess my only advice would be to make an
opportunity wherever you can so I went
to a wedding on Sunday and I sat on the
table with people I didn't know that's
an opportunity to make friends or making
friends through your other friends you
can't force the situation like that but
the best thing you can do is being
really open to making new friends so if
you have a chat with someone and you
feel like there's a little bit of spark
there then I'd go on Facebook go up for
their number like don't be shy to make a
new friends in that way because I think
everyone feels the same and if you feel
like you're going to get on with someone
then make an effort for them to come
your friends or if a friend of your says
like oh I really think you'd get on with
this person then try and encourage them
to set off the time for you all go out
for a meal together or something I
personally love setting up friends so
you might have fun in your life that
also enjoys doing that I once had a
really funny run-in with a girl on the
tube and I just thought she was great
I actually didn't kind of asked for her
number or anything but I really think
that it would have been fine if I had
also social media like you probably have
people who chats you on Twitter or
Instagram and regularly why not try and
make an online friendship into a real
one and see if they want to meet up for
a coffee or something it's really hard
to make friends as an adult but the best
thing you could do is just make an
effort don't be shy just try and have
the confidence were thinking that can
happen as they ends up not being a
friendship but why not try and send in
something
which questions do you like to ask
people that you're just getting to know
I sometimes struggle with small tools
because I think a lot of the questions
that you can ask people are quite boring
and you stay on the surface rather than
really getting to know them it's so true
like the standard questions when you
meet someone are would you do like for a
job which everyone hates that question
like my dad whenever he goes to weddings
he just makes up the answer and tell
people tell people he's like a lion
tamer and stuff just cause it gets so
bored of saying what he actually does
I'm quite lucky for my job quite
interesting now but even then I hate
talking about it because it's just like
I don't know
squid cringe so although you might start
with a question like what do you do I
think the important thing is to listen
to the response and create conversation
from that so instead of saying would you
do for a living and they say I'm an
accountant and then you go okay cool
don't do that don't shut down the
conversation listen to what they say and
try and ask another question turn it
into something more what do you do for a
living I'm an accountant Oh what kind of
company do you work for it's a music
company oh that's really interesting so
do you have any clients that I would
have heard of yeah we look after this
person actually
oh is that sort of music you're into
like create a conversation from it you
know I mean it's it's an effort but
that's how you'll end up on the route to
a more interesting conversation and just
like top line boring chat compliment
them on what they're wearing and ask
where it's from
they might say that it's on whistles and
then you say oh I love whistles it
always starts with like awkward basic
chat but as long as you're really
engaging and you're really listening it
can go somewhere deeper hopefully just
be a good listener I hate when you're
chatting to people and they're just like
their eyes that are looking around
someone else better to talk to that is
just the worst trait ever how to cope
when you realize you and a friend no
longer have anything in common and you
feel like you want to cut ties as it's
just not working for you anymore like
the friendship doesn't have anything
holding it together I'm in my early 30s
so long-term friendships tire out if
that makes sense I think that's also a
big problem for people I've had
friendships my whole life and it is
scary to think as our lives change and
we go in different directions how do we
kind of keep those friendships strong
and I think if you feel like one of your
friendships is kind of fiddly now you
have to decide if that bridge of is
important to you or not if you want to
being friends of that person or you
don't because really you are in control
of that situation if you're not bothered
and you don't really want to be friends
that person anyway and they're not
making an effort and you kind of select
you're not making an effort then let it
let it fizzle out the best thing about
friendships is not like a relationship
you don't have to dump each other let it
fizzle out that happens and it's normal
but if it's a friendship that means
something to you then address it and and
have the confidence to meet up with that
person and you don't have to make it a
confrontational argument just say I feel
like we haven't been as close as we
usually are recently what's going on if
you got anything else going on in your
life like chat to me I want to know and
I still love you and would love to hang
out more so let's try and make this work
I think the more open and honest you are
as a friend the better your relationship
will be also with long-term friendships
if we've known your whole life it's
really important to take an interest in
what they're doing now it's very common
with kind of long-term friendships spend
your whole time reminiscing about the
past but taking interest in what they're
doing now in their job and their new
friends and show that you are interested
in their present day and their future
and not just interested in 10 years ago
how did you feel meeting Rich's friends
and when you nervous it introduced into
your friends we're quite lucky I guess
because you may uni we met each other's
friends in a kind of uni environment
when we were young and drunk and fun and
it wasn't like if we met each other now
it would be more like a formal
introduction I remember introducing rich
to a few people like Jake who was one of
my oldest bestest friends and he's a guy
so I think that was quite intimidating
for rich to meet him and I'd really like
to hug him off as like one of the most
important friends in my life and I think
it is quite scary to meet your partners
friends but everyone loves you your
friends want you to be happy and the guy
the person you're with like know how
much your friends mean to them I think
it's important to tell your partner how
much the friends mean to them so they
know before they meet them yeah I guess
it was I was quite nervous to me which
is friends and I think he was quite
nervous to me in mine
but over the years we've all just got to
know each other better it's not always
like an instant connection and there
might be some friends that you prefer to
see when you're not with your boyfriend
or your girlfriend you
play it by ear and see who gets on the -
how did rich transition into your
already established friend group yeah I
think at the beginning he was quite shy
and nervous and I found it a little bit
frustrating just because I knew how
great he was and I felt like he wasn't
showing his true self if you've had to
stop this video because the people
upstairs and moving out and making so
much noise so I've had lunch I probably
got past you around my mouth and I've
come back and I'm going to carry on with
this video any advice on long-distance
friendship as you have a few friends
that don't live in the UK I think
long-distance friendships are really
really hard actually and as someone who
has no interest in moving away I always
find it quite hard to understand when my
friends decide to move abroad but they
do and that doesn't mean you you're
going to end the friendship so it's just
about kind of accepting that the French
it's going to change in certain ways I'm
not a massive fan of talking on the
phone but if I didn't ever pick up the
phone and then I just wouldn't speak to
that friend ever so you have to kind of
get into a routine of facetiming and
when you do chat it's just a different
kind of chat the friends you see here
it's more of you can kind of get into
things quicker if you have a phone to a
friend who lives aboard in a month then
you have lots of catching up to do and
it is very difficult it's just something
you kind of have to get used to and you
just have to make extra effort to
whatsapp them when you're thinking of
them or send them a photo of something
or a memory and FaceTime when you can on
my phone where it has like the world
clock a heat the time of where my
friends live so it's like New York or
Germany or Australia and so I always
know what time of day it is and I can
keep track of like when's good for them
to talk however think it's nice to like
send a card every now and again if
you're thinking of them or you see a
card that reminds of them you just have
to make more of an effort with the
friends that live abroad I think also
obviously if you can visit each other
that makes a massive difference how to
deal with jealousy in friendships and
comparing yourself to your friends I
think this is something that you mainly
suffer with when you're younger when
you're a teenager for me I thought I
think my twenties I started to be less
selfish as a friend and think more about
what kind of friend I am to others when
you stop feeling jealous
it actually makes selfishly make you
feel better
as a person as well so it's really
important to teach ourselves how to be
happy for a friend even if you're just
faking it and forcing yourself to go on
the road they're happy for you
you kind of convince yourself of it and
you just have to focus on your own thing
and not compare to everyone else I know
it's really easy to just say that I
guess I don't know what vy4 have when
actually changing the way you feel I
think it's something that just comes
with age I feel like for me in my
twenties I just had a shift or suddenly
I didn't feel jealous if something great
happens my friend I genuinely felt happy
for them and I didn't immediately think
oh but that hasn't happened to me
because you just can't it'll make you
feel miserable if you're the person who
is making all the effort to always
connect with a friend at what point do
you stop trying to see if that friend
will still make time to see your contact
you are they really a friend if this is
the case and is okay stop trying to
connect if you feel it's one-sided
so the first time that almost sounded
like she wanted to stop making an effort
to see if her friend still makes the
effort for me that's just playing games
in a friendship and I don't think
there's any any room for game playing
because two wins in the game you know if
you stop trying and they don't try
you're going to feel miserable too so
don't think you should play a game with
it if you feel like your friend isn't
making as much an effort with you as you
are then speak to them worst comes to
worst you end up having a huge argument
you never speak again
but at least you know you tried like I
said don't before don't have a big kind
of confrontational osmond to sit down
and say like feel like you've been a bit
off with me recently is it something
I've done kind of put the focus on you
like is there something I can do to make
this better
I love hanging out with you want to
spend more time with you don't kind of
make it all about them being a bad
friend
but maybe that person does just when
your friendships fizzle out and if you
don't feel the same way
it's a massive shame that people do go
apart I would just say have a chat first
because you don't want to kind of come
back to things piñas later say oh but I
thought you didn't want to do my friend
oh but I thought you didn't want like
miscommunication as the worst thing okay
this girl has quite a few questions how
do you think friendships change as you
grow up kind of thoughts about that
what do you look for in a friend do you
believe some friendships temporary and
how do you deal with it when a
friendship ends what do I look for in a
friend I look for someone that is loyal
that will be
Jemmy when i need them a drop of a hat
who will kind of prioritize me and
someone who will open up to me and trust
me to speak their mind and talk to me
about important things that kind of
private to them and do I see there's
such thing as a temporary friend yet
there for me I think at the time you
don't think of them as temporary but
there's definitely people who come into
your life and you're very close to it
for a short period of time and then you
kind of end up not really talking
anymore and I think that's okay because
that person would have been important to
you for that specific time for those
like for that one or two years or
something and some reason you came
together at that time and you were very
close and then you kind of moved on I
think that's fine I think is really
great actually because I think those
sets or temporary friends can teach you
a lot about yourself and they can help
with the transition of growing up for
those friends you've had your whole life
how do you deal with French at the end
it's tough it's like it's heartbreaking
it's like a breakup there's really not
much difference between an actual
breakup and a friendship breakup other
than there doesn't really seem to be
like an official end to a friendship
breakup it's really tough if you are
confused by it and you don't know why it
happened then I would say speak to them
other than that lean on your other
friends for support I feel my boyfriend
for almost four years now and we've
tried quite a few times to have
get-togethers with all of my friends his
friends my friends mutual friends but
they never quite mix it's not that there
are a lot of people in the first place
usually about eight or ten but it does
feel a bit awkward and it usually ends
up where they split up since their own
groups and never talk to each other and
she basically goes on to say that it
worries her about what it will be like
at their wedding and stuff how have you
got your friends to get along and just
have fun together and what was it like
your wedding my wedding it would
absolutely fine because most people have
known each other for such a long time
and the Nuba people aren't quite good at
like knowing who gets on with whom I
don't try false friendships between
people so you've got ten friends maybe
not all ten will get up but maybe
there's a couple and another couple you
think would really get on so you can
have a dinner with them within my
friendship group there's definitely some
people who are closer with others and I
think it's about identifying which ones
will get on with others and not forcing
relationships that aren't there you can
tell when people meet if they instantly
get on or not and I think it's important
for your friends to make an effort with
each other and if they're not do
that that I don't know that kind of down
to your friends I feel like a very lucky
my friends lovely and they would totally
make an effort with anyone that I
introduced them to if they don't and
speak to them beforehand and say look
I've got these people coming over
tonight I was really appreciated if you
made an effort give them a bit of
warning like the god that coming over
she always seems a little bit off ish
when you first meet her but she's really
really lovely she's like my best friend
she means so much to me I would love it
if you could make an effort to get to
know her if you don't get on that fine
but please just like to try tonight
jobina there's no harm in saying that I
think don't for something that's not
there if your friends really aren't
getting on and just enjoy them as
individual friends you don't have to see
them all together do you think sirs can
be friends and continue an active
friendship I you see each other for
lunch and go for drinks in a market
cetera even though they're no longer
romantically involved
I think this completely depends on the
relationship I'm friends of my ex we're
not like very very close friends he
recently got married and I didn't go to
the wedding but if we saw each other we
could get for doing could be absolutely
fine and rich gets on really well with
him and I get on really well with his
new wife but we were friends before we
started going out there was always like
a friendship there as like a base so I
think it depends case-by-case I think if
you're in a relationship now where you
trust each other completely and your ex
has no intentions with you other than to
be your friend then I don't see why not
like I think ex is a really important
part of your life I shared three years
with my ex and we got on really really
well so there's no reason why we can't
enjoy each other's company I noticed you
have a lot of friends that you know for
a real long time do you find it hard to
make new friends now and do you call
someone your friend easily or does it
take a longer time for someone to earn
that title and there's a second part of
that question because the kind of art of
the first part I am when I first meet
someone I think I'm very welcoming and I
share a lot and someone can become my
friend quite quickly but I also think
that's kind of one of my downfalls
because especially like in what I do now
for work I have had a few examples of
someone where they've become a friends
like quickly and then it turns out that
their intention may be one as pure as I
thought they were but I also am very
well liked
one's not really liked in until they're
in I like to introduce new people to my
friends and family quite quickly just
because I feel like there Nathan get to
know me better once they meet my friends
and family oh I think I make friends
quite quickly I can tell pretty quickly
that someone I like or don't like I'm
quite like judging at the beginning
whether I think that was good person or
not and that to me is the most important
and then once they're right once they're
in I'm a pretty loyal friend I think I'm
a bit crack communication I don't like
to phone my friends out often but I
always invite people to random things
and just be like what are you doing on
Sunday I'm doing this you want to calm
me and rich are a very inclusive couple
we like to mix with friends a lot rather
than just stay like us two alone all the
time any advice on how to deal with a
friend who is dating or married to
someone you don't like and or feel like
they treat your friend really poorly
this is such a difficult one and so so
common
if you thought you're in position don't
worry I think everyone has a friend who
is dating or married or whatever someone
you don't think is great and there is a
difference between thinking whether
they're a good person or not or whether
the relationship is good you know you
can really like a person but just think
they're not right with your friend and
really I just think it's not your place
to say it's such it's such a hard one to
see your friend in a relationship that
you think is kind of toxic but I've had
friends who have been in three-year
relationships with a guy that I didn't
like and didn't think was right for them
and when in a fit ends is so much better
to come out the other end being the
friend who is there and supportive and
not being a friend who's saying I told
you so I never liked it from the
beginning like you just don't want to be
that person because that's not being a
good friend your friend who is in that
relationship has to learn for themselves
you can't force someone to see something
they can't see if you just keep going on
about how much you just don't like the
person it's only going to distance
yourself as a friendship because
unfortunately most people prioritize
their romantic relationships over their
friendships not everyone but some people
do it's very difficult to be in a strong
position as a friend if you don't like
someone they're romantically involved
with my advice would be to just be
supportive just be a good friend
bite your tongue if it doesn't end in a
breakup and it ends in a marriage then
you have to just accept that your friend
is a girl
not going to make their own decision and
you have to be happy for them no matter
what your only priority should be that
your friend is happy if they're not
happy it's quite likely they're going to
go through and get married and stay
married to this person but if they
really think that that's what makes them
happy then you have to just go with that
and accept that it's not your
relationship you have your own life to
deal with and if that means seeing your
friend without their boyfriend or
husband because you don't get on with
him and that's fine just just top
priority needs to be that they're happy
don't make it about yourself if your
friend has hurt you or done something
wrong how do you tell them without being
worried that you might be
confrontational or hurt their feelings
see this is the way you deliver it try
not to be like hot-headed about it and
go in or heated and think about what you
want to get from the conversation if
you're Fraser stands on the top set you
need to analyze the situation and think
is this important enough to me to
jeopardize my friendship because this
could go wrong and they might really be
upset with me
so is this thing that they've done how
much did it affect me if you decide it's
a big enough deal that you want to talk
to them about it then it's just the way
you deliver it I think the way you
handle it stay calm
know what you want to get out of the
conversation give them examples of how
you would have liked the situation to
have been handled better if you just go
in like hot-headed and angry then you're
never going to get what you want out of
the situation because you don't really
know what you want you're just angry so
let yourself calm down about it think
about how you would have preferred is
gone and try and have an adult
conversation and let them know how much
you care about them and love them so
that they know you're not trying to end
the relationship this is the last
question I know this isn't really a
relationship question but it still kind
of counts what do you do if you have a
friend who's really clingy but you don't
like her as she's bitchy and she's not
your type of personality how did you get
rid of her without hurting her I'm in a
very small school and she is in my class
now I left this question in because it's
such a good example of school
friendships there just isn't really a
thing when you're older like having
someone kind of tag along and follow you
around everywhere who you don't really
like but she really likes you it's just
such a school scenario and there's
nothing really you can do because you
don't want to be a whole person
leave you alone it's just all I can say
is account for you is that it's just
such a school thing and this doesn't
happen in adult life people are grownups
they can tell them someone's not as into
them as they are like into you so just
get through school and if she really
likes you that much then that sweet she
might be a really nice person like maybe
she's being bitchy because she thinks
that for being cool is if you feel
uncomfortable with the way she's acting
and sometimes in school I feel like
you'll group together with people and
people like oh you're friends with her
so I don't be friends of you if you
thought you're being good together with
her and you don't like the way she acts
and just say I really don't like just
say like I really don't feel comfortable
when you bitch about people just to let
you know please bitch with someone else
happy to hang out with you but I don't
really want to bitch that's quite a
grown-up thing to do but other than that
don't worry when you leave school
everything changes you might not even be
friends with people anymore and then you
might have a few people that you stay
friends with forever so just get through
school I know it's tough so the other
questions this video it took me hours to
film kadal a lunch break in between but
I love talking about friendships so
important to me so great I posted
opposed to the other day just saying
girlfriends are the key to happiness I'm
sure of it it was national girlfriend's
day if you don't do anything anyway I
hope that answered some of your
questions but let me know if you enjoy
the Q&amp;amp;A I love doing Q&amp;amp;A videos they're
just so chill so let me know what other
topics you would like me to discuss and
I'll get on that I think that's all I'm
going to go over to my sister's now and
have a cuddle with my new little nephew
because he's so cute I should be back on
Wednesday with another vlog and thank
you for being patient with me I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
