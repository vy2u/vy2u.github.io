you so much for all of your questions
for my Q&amp;amp;A video there were like over a
thousand I read through every single one
like the next day and there are so many
good ones so many like thought-provoking
questions and interesting ones I want to
spend a lot of time replying to so I
might have to do like two or three Q&amp;amp;A
but I've picked out all the best
questions all the ones that I really
want to talk about and I am going to do
a Q&amp;amp;A video next week and then I might
even reply to some of the other
questions in follow-up videos and any
that I don't I'm going to try and go
back to the video and reply to you in
the comment section so thank you so much
for leaving a question especially for
those of you who don't usually comment I
saw you all and thank you so much for
taking the time to comment and ask
questions I'm so so excited to film
today's video I think it's gonna be
really good and I can't wait to show you
guys photos I took last week I'm going
to be talking about the leather skirt
today and if you saw my video that I
filmed the dead the wardrobe cleanse and
shop you would have seen the faux
leather skirt from Topshop that I picked
up I've got it here so it is faux
leather and it's a mini skirt and it's
from the Topshop you would have seen in
the video that I originally got a long
leather skirt from a sauce that decided
that I would get more wear out of a
short leather skirt I'm just going to
say leather in this video rather than
faux leather because it's easier so I'm
going to talk you through three ways
that I like to style the leather skirt
I've got a daytime look the kind of more
funky fun look and then an evening look
as well so it isn't helpful to use any
of you want to get your hands on leather
skirt I really like this one because it
has pockets it's very comfortable it has
a little bit of stretch to it and this
is a really really hot day and things be
a little bit sweaty I find that really
comfortable you can sit down in it I
kind of walked around town wearing it I
think it can reward so many ways I found
lots of photos online of other people
wearing a leather miniskirt as well and
I think there's just so many different
ways to wear it
these are only three looks for eyes
styles but there's actually lots of
other things I could wear it with in my
wardrobe I think with a Fanty leather
skirts it really cool something a bit
more like grungy I also had like a suede
jacket
I think you would look really great with
but let me start talking to you about
the three that I take for this video and
first one is going to be the more curved
summery outfit first of all I paired it
with my white converse trainers I love
these I've had them for years I wore
them on my wedding day and they're so
comfortable I really like they look
quite beaten up and I think it
immediately makes the skirt looks so
much more casual I also fill it with
this stripy top from whistles it's kind
of a cream color with Navy stripes and
it's long-sleeve with these long cuffs
as well I love stripes so much and I
think stripes and leather work really
well together as the big stripes in
Converse work well together so it kind
of all pulls into one and those three
items alone looks really nice but if you
also want to wear it as a jacket I
paired it with my Topshop denim jacket
I've had to stand up jacket for a few
years now it's just like the perfect
shape for me to buy like a denim jacket
to be a bit oversized I had one from a
vintage shop that was just too oversized
and it just looked too big on me so this
is somewhere in the middle and it works
perfectly and then to tie in the kind of
blue of the denim I also wore with my
saline bag which I think it's probably
one of my more casual bags I think I
don't know what it is that makes it feel
casual it's public and it's got the blue
on it it's one of the only bags I have
that isn't just black it's a little bit
fun looking as well you can either hold
it by the handle or by the long strap
and I think it goes really nicely with
the whole look this is also a really
good day bag because you can fit so many
things in it so because that outfit
quite day outfit of still wearing comfy
shoes so I can like run around town with
lots different meetings and do whatever
I need to do it's great to have a big
bag as well that will fit my notebooks
and umbrella and everything I need for
today if you want to click to show more
in the description box I'm going to be
linking all the items I talked about but
obviously these are just clothes for my
wardrobe they're not all brand news so
if something's out stocks are not
available and what they're gonna be
putting alternatives also just because I
think you might have different tastes to
me so I'll put like three options each
item if you want to go to the
description box and have a look there
and everything I talked about will be
linked so I really love that first
summer outfit I really like the stripes
I really like the denim jacket and let
me know what you think of that look the
next look at almost 60s inspired it
really reminds me of something my mum
would have worn when she was a teenager
seen loads of old photos of her and I
feel like it just really looks like
something she would have worn first of
all I put on my own
the knee or thigh high boots from office
I'm so glad I got these but I am glad
and got the office ones and not the
Stuart Wiseman ones because I don't know
how much where I'm going to get out of
them I feel like I can wear them with
the leather skirt and with jompa dresses
but I'm not sure what else I can wear
them with so find the ones from office a
perfect because they weren't too
expensive but there's a tie on the back
so if you have kind of skinny legs like
me it's quite good because it's
elasticated so you could tie it off and
they won't fall down they have a little
bit of a heel but not too high so
they're really comfortable and if you're
not massively fond of having your legs
out it's great to wear these with skirt
because then you only have a little bit
of size showing I think it looks really
cool I then wore a couple of tops and I
layered them together the first one is
an old top I have from Topshop it's like
a little cami and it's maybe kind of
silks feeling with a bit of lace and the
reason I wore this is because it's got
this lace panel at the bottom and I
really like when it has sticks out of
tops I just really like the extra detail
and then on top of that I wore this
shirt from Topshop which I feel is very
60s Rises I think it's like a pajama
style shut this sort of collar section
looks a bit like pajamas and I love the
pattern it's maybe with this kind of
colorful floral pattern and this outfit
is probably the most the hardest ones
where out of all three just gonna sew
like to some angles it's not quite
flattering but overall I think it's
really cool outfits only great for going
out to dinner I really need to wear in
the day as well it depends how confident
you feel but I really like you I love
the 65 and also to go with this outfit I
wore my Gucci Soho disco bag I mean this
guy could go with all of the looks I
just love it I recently did a what's in
my bag video by the way if you didn't
see it I will link it above if you want
to check it out again this fits so much
in it and it just goes with everything
this is a lovely soft black leather bag
with a logo but not like the gold logo
so it's not that noticeable
so that finished off that outfit I think
let me know what you think of outfit too
okay finally I instagrammed a photo of
me wearing a long skirt I bought from
Amsterdam with this orange jumper and
you guys went crazy for it it's another
piece that I bought was dead and I
absolutely loved it it's wrong Topshop
it is bright orange jumper and it's got
these huge batwing sleeves like
literally huge and
kind of cropped but it's not too short
and I had a high-neck and I loved it I
love the color on me and it goes so well
with black so for this look I wore the
orange jumper with the leather skirt and
then my top shot heels boots I kind of
wanted everything else to be plain so
it's got black leather boots black
leather skirt and then I also wore it
with my Chanel bag which is this one
which kind of is a vintage style this
again goes with everything but I think
it looks really small and makes the
outfit look perfect for the evening I
think this might be my favorite out of
all the three I'm not sure but I just
love this jumper so much it's very
comfortable if you're a little bit like
insecure about your tummy and your upper
half it's nice because it's big and
baggy but then somewhere this type of
black skirt and show off your leg which
is exactly what I like to do for me it's
a great way to wear some color in my
outfits as well so let me know what you
think of outfit number three I really
enjoy putting these three apses together
