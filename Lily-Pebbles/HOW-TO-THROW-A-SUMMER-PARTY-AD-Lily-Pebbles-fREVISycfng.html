I'm so excited to share this video with
you today because it's one I've been
working on and planning for a really
long time so I really hope you love it
I'm really showing you today how to host
your own summer party now as you guys
know we live in a flat so I actually
have my own garden but my parents have
lived in the same house for almost 40
years so their garden has seen many many
summer parties so I'm actually going to
host the summer party in their garden
today
I'm actually working with Eddie Ann on
this video and you going to know I
absolutely love Eddie as a brand I'm
sure by now you've heard of their Libyan
campaign which is all about being
positive spontaneous living life to the
max and feeling young at heart so I've
taken inspiration from their Libyan
campaign and decided to do this video
but this isn't any other summer party
this is a Wimbledon themed summer party
because it's almost July which means
it's almost mumbled in season I can't
wait if you've been watching my videos
for years you'll know I'm a massive
tennis fan so whenever it's like
Wimbledon season I get so excited not
only because I enjoy watching and
playing tennis but because it's so much
more than tennis from within the vibe
and the atmosphere especially in London
during that time is so so great the food
the drink the smells the hayfever it all
just reminds me of Wimbledon and so it's
a time of year that I always look
forward to personally so I can't wait to
show you what I've got planned in this
video I'm actually going to split it up
into three sections deck off food and
drinks and entertainment so let's start
with decor and I didn't want to go too
overboard this is just my family and
friends they're pretty easy to please
but it's really fun to kind of have an
excuse to dress up a table and make it
look really pretty I found this really
cute red and white gingham tablecloth
and it just really reminded me of
typically like British picnic so I'm
going to be using this I've also bought
these little clips just to make sure the
tablecloth doesn't blow around in the
wind because this is still London we're
talking about and also it makes it just
look a bit higher and neater overall as
this is the one wooden summer party I
wanted to decorate the table a little
bit with some tennis balls I've got my
dad's tennis balls
I nicked from his cupboard and I've also
got these really really cute pink
everyone tentacles that they gave to me
I'm genuinely gonna play tennis with
these balls and I'm pretty excited about
it
I also bought some fresh flowers to
place on the table which I just it would
look really pretty in the setting I've
asked you Ottomans to lay on the table
this little cheer sign from West Elm and
and all pineapple but really I think
most of the deckle will come from the
food and drink and the bowls and the
plates I'm going to be putting on the
table so I don't go too overboard and
fill the table too much I think once the
food and drink are on there it will look
really pretty I have got some jamjars
glasses and also this really cute
flamingo glasses that I picked up from
Ikea and lots of colorful straws and
stripy straws even if you don't think
your guests are going to use straws I
think they're really nice for like table
decoration so let's talk about food and
drink which is personally my favorite
part of course I wanted to do a mix of
savory finger food you don't need a
plate a night and fork for things you
can just pick up with your hands and
also of course some sweet stuff now in
my family we always do mini bagels I
wanted to keep this video real and
that's that's what we would do for like
a family weekend get together we do mini
bagels we cut them in half and then half
of them we do with smoked salmon and
cream cheese but then my sister doesn't
like smoked salmon so we also do the
other half with just cream cheese and a
little slice of cucumber on top and I
really like them they say fresh for
quite a long time but if you can't get
hold of mini bagels or you're not a fan
then you can also just do mini
sandwiches as well which is very cute
very British I think crudité the nice
thing to have out on the table lots of
kind of raw edge and some nice tips as
well you can kind of hand around
now this one might be a bit of a rogue
option but I love dispatches
it's basically cold tomato disease and I
think it's so nice in the summer because
it's very easy to kind of drink to eat
and it's refreshing I like to put it in
shot glasses you don't really want a
whole big bowl of gazpacho soup and you
don't people kind of holding a bowl and
the food and then you just have a little
bit of pistachio soup okay now let's get
under the sweet stuff and the first
thing I think of when I think of
Wimbledon is of course strawberries it's
the best time of year for British
strawberries they're so so delicious so
I've done them a couple of ways of
course a little bowl of strawberries
with whipped cream is pretty standard at
Wimbledon it's got to be done I also
love chocolate dipped strawberries so
all I did to make these as bits as your
breathe into melted chocolate laid them
on a train with foil and put them in the
fridge overnight these are my absolute
favorite favorite things I love them
they really remind me of summer my mum's
made these for me forever they're so
delicious
I also sliced up the watermelon for
people to grab and then just to make it
a little bit more British and as is kind
of like a lunch afternoon tea thing I
put out some mini scone obviously with
those have got clotted cream and I like
the strawberry jam on mine whilst we
dramas good too but let's stick with a
strawberry theme here you can obviously
let people kind of do their own but I
pre done the cream and the jam just to
show you guys how pretty they look
stand
Quadra I've got something alcoholic and
something non-alcoholic for those who
want bubbles I got some Prosecco boom
and then obviously lots and lots of
Evian water I think when it's hot it's
really nice to just feel hydrated and
refreshed
okay let's talk entertainment even when
the tennis is on my family has never
been one to kind of sit and hardcore
watch something we're good it kind of
enjoying a bit of both if that makes
sense so we'll have the tennis on inside
the lounge with the doors open but then
we'll also have music playing outside
just in case not everyone wants to sit
and watch the tenant so I think it's
really nice to have a playlist going you
can make your own on Spotify I was going
to make my own and share it with you
guys but I actually found some really
good ones on Spotify they've got a few
like summer playlist which I'll link
below I also love playing reggae in the
summer and I love the soundtrack to
shift I think that's such a summery
album so after we finished watching the
tennis my dad and I always get a massive
craziness go and play tennis but it's a
little bit antisocial to leave the party
and go and like play a tennis match
which we definitely have done in the
past to get a badminton set my parents
have always had one in the garden
randomly we used to play all your kids
it's really fun and you can get like
four people involved to get the kids to
like pick up the shuttlecock and it's
fun for everyone so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and maybe it
gave you a bit of inspiration to hold
your own summer party I think the whole
point is that you don't have to be at
Wimbledon to enjoy all the feel-good
live young moments and I love watching
Wimbledon at home with my friends and
family so why not make a little party
out of it if you can let me know if you
do hold your own party and please send
me photos I would absolutely love that
and if anyone out there is also a
Wimbledon fangirl like me please let me
know so that I know I'm not alone in
this thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
