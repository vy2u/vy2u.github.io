doing an absolutely massive beauty haul
and first impressions video for you
because I don't know what happened this
came out of nowhere I feel like last
year I did very few Beauty whores
because I kind of just lost interest a
bit I think I became a bit overwhelmed
of the amount of beauty products there
are and I forgot how it felt to crave
buying beauty and then suddenly happen
in the year I don't know what it was
maybe I just took a break from wearing
makeup or something but January came
around and suddenly I was like oh my god
i have a massive list of things I want
to try so I did a haul from Boots Harvey
Nichols Selfridges and Space NK and I
knew exactly what I wanted I had a whole
list and I just splurged and went for it
so I thought today I would do a massive
haul for you guys I'm gonna start I'm
gonna go through it anything which I was
able to try on camera
before filming this video I will add it
in a cutaway so you can see me applying
it they start with my Harvey Nichols
order and yes I made a Fenty Beauty
order I mentioned a while ago in a video
that I wasn't really interested in the
fenty Beauty range because I'm not a
massive Rihanna fan I think I got a lot
of hate for that comment not really sure
why but the range just didn't really
appeal to me that much but then I heard
quite a few people saying some really
good things about the products so I
wanted to try out a few bits I've been
trying to go into Harvey Nichols a few
times when I'm introduced to a new range
that I haven't tried before I like
actually trying it in store but there's
always a massive queue it's like two
people at a time at the counter so I've
never actually managed to try it so I've
got a few things online I didn't want to
go crazy because I just wasn't sure
which products were gonna be for me
which ones weren't the first thing I got
was the foundation because I've heard so
many people talk about this and when I
first heard about this being launched I
wasn't interested because it's called
soft matte long way foundation I don't
really like matte foundations in long
wear to me implies it's quite heavy but
then so many people including Fleur I
think said that actually it isn't that
matte it's quite glowy and it has a
really nice finish to it so I picked
this up I'm not sure I've got the
perfect shade but it is it's quite easy
to shop because they use different
models to show the different skin tones
and there's obviously a massive range in
skin tones which is why everyone
absolutely loves
understandably it really caters to all
which is amazing especially for her
first beauty range I really like the
packaging it's in a glass bottle it's
like frosted glass and it's quite thin I
went for the shade 200 I think quite a
lot the shades were sold out so this one
seemed closest to my kind of light
neutral skin tone I'm wearing the
foundation today and yeah the reviews
are right it's not kind of a really
really heavy matte foundation and I
would say though as it dries really fast
I put a bit up my finger and then spread
it around the face and if I'm not really
really fast it's very difficult to
spread with a damp Beauty Blender but if
I'm fast it does give a really nice
medium to full coverage I'd say it's
definitely heavier than my it cosmetics
CC cream it's definitely a lot more dry
than the CC cream as well so therefore
less glowy but I think for like filming
days or if I have special occasions and
there's gonna be photos taken of me or
an evening event I think it's a really
nice kind of flawless smooth foundation
and I am impressed with it it reminds me
of the Giorgio Armani luminous silk I'm
gonna keep trying this but those are my
first impressions of it the next product
that I got from Fenty beauty was the
kilowatt freestyle highlighter jeera
which I'd also heard a lot about and I
love a highlighter I really like the
packaging it's just a very sleek white
plastic kind of Mexican shape this is
the highlighter mean money and hustler
baby so it's got two in one which i
think is really cool
you've never open this though one side
is a bit more of a subtle highlights and
then this side is much more glittery now
I don't understand this product I've
tried using it so many different ways I
can't really understand what formula it
is it's not quite a cream and it's not
quite a powder I think it's meant to be
cream to powder which I never really get
that formula I've tried using my fingers
but it doesn't really blend properly and
then I've tried to use like a contour
brush and I don't really get any product
out so if any of you guys have any
recommendations of how to use this I
think this left more subtle color would
be more for me the other one's a little
bit quite a lot too glittery for me but
I just can't figure out how to use it at
all so do let me know if you have this
and love it because I'm not sure
massive fan of that one then the next
product I got is one of her matchsticks
I think this is genius she's created all
these different matchsticks that our
concealers foundations contours blushes
they're all like multi-purpose cream
stick products and they they stick
together like magnets as well in this
really cool packaging so that I think is
a genius idea and I think I'd probably
like the contour colors I don't know why
I didn't get one but I wanted to try one
of the blushes and this is the shade
yacht life which I thought would be so
pretty because it's like a coral pink
with this beautiful gold shimmer running
through it I thought would be nice it's
like a highlight blush again I don't
understand the formula it's a very very
stiff cream so you'll see in the cutaway
I really have to put it on very hard
which kind of moves around the
foundation I've already put on my skin
and then to blend out fingers don't work
at all and I'm gonna use a brush I have
to really just keep blending for a very
long time I kind of wish this was much
more creamier so that's a shame I do
like the color but it kind of hurts my
cheeks to apply again if you have any
tips do let me know final product from
Fenty is one of her brand new
mademoiselle plush matte lipsticks so I
think I would have really liked this if
I had got the right shade I wanted a
nice everyday nude and I picked up the
shade color as this oh my god I'm too
blind I can't see it I can't see what
color it is which is very frustrating I
feel old I should just wear my glasses
more anyway the packaging is really cool
for these lipsticks nice and slim and
it's a bit like the glossy a1 on the
inside and when I opened it I thought
that'd be really nice but when I apply
this to my lips it's far too kind of
peachy orange a nude it just looks
ridiculous on me I won't even show you
but like the formulas nice it's a nice
matte lipstick I think I would have
liked it I couldn't really find the
right nude for me
I'm sure she'll bring out new colors all
the time it's a really nice look so if
you can find a shade that you like I
think the Reds in this range should be
really nice okay that's everything from
Fenty beauty so out of all of that the
foundation is definitely the standout
product for me and then I also went to
space okay first thing I got was a
concealer and this is from by Terry I
love the cream stick concealer from by
Terry so I thought I'd give this a go
it's the terribly dense illus concealer
so this is one that just comes in a doe
foot applicator as a liquid concealer
there weren't that many shades and in
store I did color match myself but when
I got home this is just far too light
for me this is shade three no two
vanilla I'm normally like a vanilla or a
custody type color this is far too light
so it's really hard for me to test it
but I've tried it under my eyes and it
feels really hydrating and night it was
just quite expensive so I'm toying with
the idea of trying the shade up or I'm
just not sure fra annoying that I got
the wrong shade that was my fault the
other thing I go from spacing K is the
all Bay at pre beach this is a wave and
shine spray you guys know I love that
all beige dried texturizing spray which
is really nice to add a bit of like grit
to your hair and some ways and I thought
this one because it says at pre beach I
thought it was like a real kind of salt
spray kind of makes your hair feel a bit
icky but I saw someone using it and I
can't remember who I feel like it might
have been Sandra I think I might be
Sandra and she said it's great to add
shine
no it wasn't Sandra oh I don't know who
it was really sorry to whoever
recommended this in their video and I
can't remember but they said it was
great to add shine and hold as well for
when you put waves in I used a bit this
morning but before I didn't use much
because I was worried how it would make
my hair feel and I need to keep my hair
clean tomorrow so I'm excited to try
this out properly it's a massive bottle
all Bay is so expensive I wouldn't buy
the shampoo conditioner because I know
that you can get cheaper shampoo and
conditioner that's just as good but for
the sprays the styling sprays I think
they're really nice and I think they're
worth investing in this product I am so
excited about I made an order via the
fresh website because I couldn't find
this on any other website on like
Selfridges Harvey Nichols anything like
that and it took a long time to come I
feel like it came from France I have no
idea why I'm sure I ordered from fresh
UK took a little wild combos totally
worth it it's the fresh face instant
glow Luminizer
was a short color to get comes in two
comes in like a silvery color and a
Goldy color and I'm usually a gold
person but with highlighters like with
this sauce
the liquid highlighter I didn't want it
to be over the top so I just thought I'm
gonna try the silver one and see comes
it's a little cheap and I love this
there's a few different ways you can use
it you can use it like a primer you can
mix it in with moisturizer to make it a
bit less glowy you can mix it with your
foundation to amp up the glow in your
foundation or you can just use it by
tapping it wherever you want on the face
so I usually squeeze a little bit out to
my fingers and then I just tap it onto
the cheek bones onto my nose or even all
over my skin and it adds such a gorgeous
glow it's not silvery and shimmery at
all it just looks like a beautiful
I wouldn't say natural it's a bit more
than natural but if you like glowy
products where you can actually see the
glow it looks natural in a way that it's
not like a placed a bit of powder
highlight it kind of just meshes with
your foundation and the rest of your
makeup I really like it I'm really happy
I got Ashley I also made a Charlotte
Tilbury order and the first thing I got
was this I was very excited to see this
I didn't even know it was launching it's
the film-star bronze and blush so I have
the film star sculpt and below I think
so it's a contour on one side and a
highlighter on the other and that she
launched with that product it was one of
the first products and it's such a
brilliant palette for contouring and
highlighting so I was very excited about
this it's such a genius idea I love the
packaging of these it looks like an
old-fashioned 20s like cigarette holder
so on one side it's got a bronzer and
the other it's got a blusher and in the
cutter where I'm using the bronzer it is
beautiful it's very similar to the Too
Faced one it's like a mid-tone brown
very easy to use I love that I would
definitely use that a lot the only thing
with this palette is this blusher does
it have a name no it doesn't which does
worry me because I'm hoping that they're
gonna bring out more of these palettes
with different blush colors because this
to me is too much of a fuchsia pink I
would prefer to something more just like
a soft pink slightly peachy pink I
struggle to use this blush I have to use
a tiny amount and really blend it out
but I just love the idea of this product
so I wasn't very excited about that and
I also ordered one of her mattes
revolution lipsticks in English Beauty
because I heard that it's quite similar
to what's the one that I like oh oh my
god what's the lipstick that I like it's
the lip cheat pillow talk
talk I love the pillow-talk lipstick and
this is another similar nude it looks
like you Pinker on me I am wearing it
but I did just eat lunch again a lovely
one
I haven't yet put them side by side to
see what the difference is hmm I would
but the lipsticks all the way over there
I think it's really nice so if you
didn't gone with pillow talk you might
get on with English beauty better okay
next up is boots I think I only got one
thing from boots actually and this was
definitely enabled by Elana Davison
Alaniz YouTube channel is great I will
link it down below so check her out
she's Canadian
she's gorgeous like I actually can't
look at her makes me feel sick she's so
beautiful and she's lovely and hilarious
and I had fun with her when she came to
London recently she always goes on about
this primer it's the smashbox primer
Iser I am fussy with primers I hate
silicone greasy primers I like a primer
that's gonna hydrate to my skin before I
do my makeup because often what happened
azaab brush my teeth and do my skincare
routine in the bathroom by the time I
come back to do my makeup I need a bit
more moisture again before I put on my
foundation and she talks about how
hydrating this is all the time this is
24-hour hydration lightweight blah blah
blah Oh
moisturizer in hyaluronic acid that is
why it's vibrating but it's quite
different to just like say the Laura
Mercier primer which very much just
feels kind of like a moisturizer this
does feel like a mix between a silicon
primer and just a hydrating primer
because it does give you this kind of
smooth feeling to your skin which is
really nice because your foundation sits
really nice on top of it it comes out
like a serum that's the texture comes
out not like a cream and not like a
silicone primer it comes out like a
serum instead of glass bottle I really
like it I'm really excited to use this
going forward actually so thank you
elaborate for the recommendation okay
the rest of the stuff is all from
Selfridges and this is also very much
Alana and a board she talks about this
all the time as well it's the Lancome
mascara in Monsur BIC which means mr.
Veeck in French I couldn't find this
anywhere and I suddenly panicked like oh
my god they don't do it the UK maybe
because it's called mr. big and they
think that's offensive here I like to
all these reasons and then I found out
Selfridges so I'm also just
the first time around it is a mascara
and the packaging is like a big chunky
and the brush is right on my street it's
like all the mascaras that I love a big
fluffy brush this is actually really
similar to the Charlotte Tilbury
legendary lashes which you guys know I
love and it's a great mascara the first
time I used it I wasn't a hundred
percent sure but now I've used it more
and more you could see all my lashes it
makes it really long and voluminous and
it's just as great as she says it is so
she has very good recommendations that
though I was gutted to finish my last
oski renascence cleansing gel in the
travel size last January 2007 I bought
10 on cob Beauty they had the Askia
Christmas crackers on sale for 5 or 10
pounds each and they had travel size
cleanser in so I basically bought all
the ones they had left on the website
and they fit last me the whole year
every time I go on a trip even if I go
away just for the night instead of
taking the big cleanser I take the
travel one so I was gotted that they
didn't do those crackers again this year
because I was hoping to get them in the
sale but someone tweeted me saying that
himself would just do the trouble sized
cleansing gel it wasn't in sale they
were quite expensive maybe like 16
pounds or something by got to because I
use the travel sized ones all the time
and I love that even when I'm traveling
I can use a really good cleanser that I
love comes in this really nice rose gold
packaging actually which I wasn't
expecting and then inside is the travel
size cleanser my absolute favorite gel
to oil cleanser that you guys know all
about because I talk about it all the
time I also repurchased a favorite which
you would have seen in my 2017 favorites
and you will see in an empties that's
coming up it's the ceramide in dr. jart
ceramide in cream moisturizer this is
just so great a really nice everyday
moisturizer in a very easy to use tube
that's just like a repurchase won't
going too much about that and then the
final thing I think that's everything is
a shampoo and conditioner I was running
out of my favorite shampoo which is the
philip kingsley flaky itchy scalp
shampoo I think my friend Ruth
recommended this to me about a year ago
and it's great I get really itchy dry
scalp which makes it look like I've got
nits but it's just a bit of like dry
scalp but it's very annoying because
I've got dark brown hair but this really
does help it helps go
utilize my scalp and stop it being too
flaky and itchy so I got one of those
and then for a condition I thought I'd
try a new conditioner this is the philip
kingsley re moisturizing conditioner i
just thought it sounded good for coarse
textured or very wavy curly or frizzy
hair that is me but i have to make sure
not to use too much sometimes I feel
like conditioner doesn't wash out my
hair properly and then I go straighten
in it feels greasy and that is so
annoying that is everything from my
whole I told you guys I went crazy and
it was really fun and I was so excited
to get my products and it just felt like
2013 to me all over again the only thing
I didn't get which I want is the Daniel
Sandler blush that Sam Chapman keeps
going on about
I would buy anything that girl
recommends and that is next on my list
so I hope you guys enjoy this haul leave
me a comment let me know if you have any
of these products what you think of them
or if there's anything on your beauty
wish list at the moment that I should
also look into I'm ready to be enabled
