for you guys a collective haul is quite
a lot of stuff actually that I've been
buying recently but before I get started
I just want to let you know that I'm
thinking about doing like a Q&amp;amp;A kind of
video without signing arrogant I don't
think that most people have questions
for me but I just want to make my videos
a little bit more interactive I feel
like I talk at you or lots of the time
so if you guys have any questions to me
absolutely anything obviously like
beauty related would be good but you
know whatever you want to ask me i'll
pick kind of my favorites i think i'm
going to do a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you just
pop all your questions below in the
comments and i'll pick out some of my
favorites that would be great so let me
show you what i have bought recently
like I said it's collected this wasn't
all in one go and you've probably seen
some of these things pop up on my
Instagram or my blog or Twitter or
wherever so sorry if I'm repeating
myself but hopefully most of it will be
new to you so the first thing is from
space NK and it's the thing you
pronounce it all bay but it's felt like
or reap and this is the dry texturizing
spray and it's the mini bottle and Anna
and Amelia from Lyon of you see I'm
always rave about this and I kind of
just assumed it for a different kind of
hair to mine but sometimes i like to
make my hair really straight but in the
morning and but then it kind of a bit
flat and I like to kind of I don't know
judge it up a bit and this is really
good for that I just kind of spray it
where I want a bit more volume or
texture and then curve scotch at my hand
and it's really good i haven't used it
loads yet but i got the little one
obviously it's cheaper i think this was
yet 18 pounds so it's definitely not
cheap but it's cheaper than a big one
and it's nice to kind of keeping your
handbag as well so yeah i'm really
liking this so far the next few things
I've got are some bury em nail polishes
and I showed this one in my monthly
favorites but I got a few other colors
as well and the REM jelly high shine
nail paint so I got them in blueberry
grapefruit and pomegranates and I like
them although nail polishes really good
as I said it goes on really thick kind
of like a gel nail polish and dries
really shiny and
absolute you love them and they're like
399 blueberries really fun blue color
pomegranates a bit more grown up kind of
deep raspberry pink and grapefruits is a
kind of brighter baby pink color a
little bit curly as well I really really
like these really recommend them and
then I got loads of lip products so I'm
going to go through those I got them all
at different times but I didn't really
realize i ended up with four kind of lip
for us so the first one I got from the
mac Archie's girls collection and I had
no interest in buying anything from this
collection I kind of saw it online I
just thought not believe me I really
don't like the white packaging but then
when I was in Mac find something else
which I'll show you in a minute and the
lady at the till is wearing this color
and I'll sold it was which told me it
was this and I next time i went to Marco
had to buy it because there was like one
left in stock and it's the Ronnie red
and this is Anna matte finish and it
says red but I think it's quite a kavars
blue red it's it's kind of a pinky red
it's not that red road if you're not i
mean is matt so it's a little bit drying
like towards the end of the day when you
have to reapply it can get a bit dry but
i actually really like this lipstick and
it lasts so long it lasted like six
hours on me which is good because i hate
having to reapply lipstick all the time
so i really really like this color and
i'm glad i picked one up while they were
in stock the next lipstick is one of the
maybelline colorsensational Vivid's i
told you about the neon red I think my
monthly favorites and I picked up
another color and this is 910 shocking
coral and I really like this the first
time I warrior I think I wore this in my
last video actually or not my last one I
think my favorites video but I haven't
decided yet if I like it or not I'm not
sure if the color suits me I'm going to
try it again I really like the color
sensational vivids I think they're
really nice lipsticks and as loads of
colors so I'm sure you can find one that
suits you the next thing is an hourglass
opaque Rouge I talked about icon in my
beauty battle video I think and I has
become another one they're incredible
they're like lip lacquers
and they're amazing and I got Raven
which is a bright bright red and I just
saw this and I was like ah I want I need
an amazing lip lacquers they applied
really nicely with like a bendy brush
and they stay on for ages they kind of
like dry like a tint when you go like
that with your lips I really really like
this so yeah I'm glad I got that in like
a bright red now because icons quite
dark it's quite an even in color and
then the final lip products I got I
really wanted a lipstick my drove you
saw what I tweeted kind of asking if
everyone's recommendations when I was in
westfield last week so thanks I he
tweeted back and yeah I was looking for
a nice lip gloss and I went into boots
and I literally swatched every lip gloss
on my hand I did like the lip gloss test
which i basically swatch it and then I
smear it with my finger and feel sticky
nope if it doesn't then it's a winner I
hate sticky lip glosses so I always feel
my hand of a sticky and towards the only
one I tried pretty much every lip gloss
the only one that wasn't sticky was this
from Rimmel and it's the vinyl gloss for
lunch ously showing you lip gloss I
don't particularly like the packaging
really it's quite big and but I got the
color to 90 be famous and it's kind of a
pinky coralie color and I'm wearing it
now actually I really like it i don't
know what i want to look gloss and ages
but I just really fancied getting a lip
gloss so I got this one and I really
like it actually it's not sticky at all
really nice color and I'd recommend
these lip glosses if you are looking for
a new lip gloss the next thing I went to
get a new mac palette and this is what
it looks like the new mac palettes a
difference of how they work for and you
can get the palette and then you get
insert separately so i actually bought
the insert but then realized i have more
than 15 so it makes sense to just put
them in the bottom is magnetics you need
to put the shadows straight in if you
want me to do a video on my mac
eyeshadow collection i have more than
this as well then let me know in the
comments below and I'll try and do a
video like that but yeah I really like
the new palettes because they have a
clear lid so I took the insert back and
I decided to just put them in straight
like this and i really like these new
palace
they're really smart but I also when I
took the inserts back is because I
wanted to put other eyeshadows in here
and I thought it was a really
complicated thing i bought the metal
stickers that said palettes sell and to
put on the bottom of the eyeshadows but
then I realized that this isn't magnetic
the actual eye shadows and magnetic at
the bottom so now I need to try and find
some like magnetic tape to put on the
bottom of my other departed shadows so I
can put them in here so very confusing
and but yeah really happy I've got the
pallor the next thing is really random
but my friend Emma from milk teeth her
blogs called milk thief actually she
just started a YouTube channel so I'll
link that below and she always carries a
portable phone charger with her and all
of us bloggers are always kind of using
her charger and I feel as about time I
got one for myself and I got the exact
same one as you did I know there are
cheaper ones this was about 40 pounds
which is expensive but it's so good and
I just really wanted a good one and I'm
really happy oh god I think it's worth
every penny from me because my phone
always runs out and it's really scary
when your phone dies in your outs and
you know I just hate being without a
phone so anyway it looks like this its
funnel web site called mobile funko de k
i'll put the link to this one below I
think the brand is cooled come and what
the brand is of this actual one but yeah
it looks like this and you can fit two
leads at the bottom and it just has a
lead to plug into your phone and and you
charge this directly from your computer
and once it's full I think it lasts for
like a week and a half or like two full
charges but I normally just kind of top
my phone up and it's amazing it is quite
big I know you can get little ones that
you have batteries in but for one it's
like computer charged and I don't think
it's that big than that heavy it's fine
for the sort of handbags that I carry
and I'm really really happy I got this
so the next two things are fashion stuff
and I've got this cough from zara my
friend Keisha bought the scarf in black
and grey a year ago and right every time
I see her wearing I'm so jealous i
didn't get it i love it and then i saw
that they had this one and they've just
bought this one out and it's kind of
beige red and orange
is and it's just huge I love the thick
material and then we put on for you
absolutely huge I love these kind of big
warm scoffs I look ridiculous right now
but it's really really comfy and I think
it was 20 pounds so I'm glad I got that
I really like it and then the final
thing is the most exciting I think and
there's new shoes I have a lot of black
boots which I love I normally wear kind
of skinny jeans loose top black boots
that's kind of my thing and sometimes
black boots just feel a little bit too
smart and if I'm having a casual day but
my friend Deb's always where's Mike
lasers lasers I don't know I'm not cool
enough I don't know what the name is but
she looks really good in them but she
has a much more casual style than me and
I think if I wore those they just they
wouldn't go with that black skinny jeans
for example and I where there's a lot
but then I found some trainers in
Topshop that perfect for me let me just
get them out bag I like them because
they're still kind of small but they're
casual because their trainers anyway
they look like this and I really like
them they've got like black leather
detail and I cannot hide up there not
the wedge ones I don't didn't want
wedges because i don't i don't need them
on quite tall and i don't really see the
point of like suffering but in secret no
one knows you're suffering I home
instead they're like black detail and
then they have this black and white
print on the front and the side and then
at the back they have like studs I
really like them they're really on me
like Deb's what's apt me saying she'd
bought the origins overnight mask and I
what sucked her with a picture of these
and we were like yeah you were learning
from each other so it's very unlike
heads by face mask and it's very unlike
me to buy trainers like this so it's
good to try something either and I tried
them on and fell in love with them so
I'm really excited to wear these I got
them in a six and I think they were
there are 55 pounds which is obviously
it's not cheap but prepared to some I've
seen compared to like naik ones and it's
definitely cheaper so yeah I think those
are a really good buy for any to write
be no my throat hurts so yeah that's
everything I hope you like seeing other
things that I bought and please
your questions below for my Q&amp;amp;A video I
just quite interested in what you guys
want to ask me and if there's anything
and I think might be fun to just do a
video like that I've ones to for ages
but didn't really have the guts to kind
of do it in case it came across really
arrogant but hopefully it doesn't and I
just want to do a bit more of an
interactive engaging video whatever you
know what I mean and so thanks for
