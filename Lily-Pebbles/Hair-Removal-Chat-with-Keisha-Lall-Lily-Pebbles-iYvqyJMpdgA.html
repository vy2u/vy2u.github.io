friend Keisha here with me you probably
seen their before in videos today we are
going to talk about hair removal because
it's something that people just don't
really talk about that much and we both
have a lot of experience with hair
removal I get lots of hair we do have a
lot of hair we're both very dark because
you can see yeah and it's just one of
those things other women as a woman are
women you have to deal with annoying a
little disclaimer though obviously don't
worry about having to remove all your
hair it's really you really don't you
could be hairy if you only can but this
is these are just some options if you do
want to go into hair removal I think
you've pretty much tried it all so we
thought we'd go through each one and
tell you our experience let's start with
waxing I think waxing was my first
method yeah because my mum is a
beautician - your waxing as well yes
Keisha's mom as the first person to ever
works me and I started with my lay eggs
and so we have really long legs it took
us like an hour to get through one yeah
Lily I was there watching you I have
this thing when I get waxed I break into
a cold sweat I don't know why I still do
it Keys like ten years later I don't
know what it is I just get so clammy and
it takes forever we might unlock and
Ranger paper yeah it's ridiculous
- I've waxed in the past my legs yeah my
bikini line my help I layer the best for
that my uni yeah let's talk about that
ala minute my other lip my eyebrows so
there's two types of work there's ones
we use the paper strips and there's hot
wax when they like peel off the actual
works yeah so would you prefer so I'm
quite happy to do strip wax for just
like legs and whatever else
hot wax is the best for bikini because
it like the warmth of it opens the pores
so it's less painful and that's quite
sensitive area so yeah I used to always
just district' works because I found
there or just everywhere because I found
that hot wax because they have to pick
off the edges it's a little bit painful
at first it's not as they do it it's not
as painful and I think it lasts longer
so I think hot wax is better it's just
bit Messier yeah I've always gone to
someone to get wet I don't like the
home waxing at Ryder's strips they're so
hot Marisela Tate yeah it's really harsh
and the ones there's something you can
put in the microwave and do it yourself
then you can burn you can burn yourself
yeah I'm more for professionals doing it
the only thing I still wax is my bikini
line I find that the best thing for my
bikini but I've moved on to other things
for everywhere else me too let's talk
about threading I get my eyebrows
threaded and I used to get them waxed
but I found that with waxing because
they just put one strip quite lucky it's
quite blocking I can't get more detail
and also it's quite harsh on that i io
acing areas and I think it makes it more
kind of hooded throwing a threat like
that greatly Dre feels yeah like it we
didn't post a while yeah you could go
stretching the skin anyway so then after
loads of stretching all the time I think
it's going to like sag yeah I do as well
so I now get it threaded I go to the
blink brow bar I love them there and
they have them everywhere there's like
there in Phoenix and they're all over
Selfridges and they have a really good
loyalty card so once you get five you
get one for free so I always get like
free one but it is quite expensive it's
like 17 pounds but is that the one where
you sit in front of everyone
yeah but no one really they're always
quite hidden normally ever looks depends
what you're getting done I just get my
eyebrows so I don't mind I I don't ever
get the top because your mum always told
me not to do the top of my brows don't
know why but I've always listened to her
and I kind of agree I think do you we
just did it yes do it right I always I
think what's happening too late I always
say not the top just the middle and
underneath and I like to keep a full I
don't want to do it too thin full brows
baby I thread my brows and up in it and
I think threading isn't that bad it's
kind of like clocking bitch so fast that
it's gone in my eyes though no no no it
hurts
it's like plucking each individual hair
out and you really feel it but instead
of like pluck is it there really as
we start really never even I've ever
done no and you have to me this really
terrible faces like Oh better yet go
like that stretch the skin I feel like
we haven't really explained what the
reading is when they have oh but it's a
cot
they use these along there to like
string or cotton and I read thread oh
yeah and I think they tie a little knot
sinnet plucks the hair around but I
don't know why it's better than plucking
but I think what it is is like it
follows your bone structure as you can
tell we have really done research this
video we just took you from personal
experience so sorry any professionals
out there think it just like follows the
natural shape of your face yeah so it's
like a nicer pluck okay so now let's
talk about bleaching that was my first
one without the a bleaching was
my first thing yeah there's a product
called Jolin that I used to use a lot
jolene jolene it's not Jolin that's
Jolin Oh a little green pot and you mix
together a cream and like a little bit
of kind of looks like salt whatever it
me know what it is it's like something
like dude I did a lie
yeah all you see is that oh my upper lip
here and on my stomach and back oh yeah
oh dear Lois please nail around didn't
you once probably probably I see that
all the time but now I actually don't
really use it sometimes on my tummy in
the summer I I don't think it worked for
me because I've darker skin I think
actually lighter hair shows up a lot
more I remember I think I started
because I saw like all our blonde
friends and I was like they're like as
hairy as me on my arms they have as much
hair we just can't six it's blonde yeah
so I tried to go down that route it was
like no but also if you ever want to get
laser done you can't really have laser
when you've got lights light hair so
think about that free start bleaching
everything because it will kind of I
think that's why laser doesn't work as
well for me hip have you ever used like
Nair like what I don't always know
removal cream hair in Mac that stinks
I think I did it like once in my all
they did it to me on a shoots the they
put it here and I was like didn't know I
had hair there so she basically saw some
hair there and they put the eMac well
when it was on and it stunk it burnt and
it made me go red yeah I do I really
like those creams are too harsh a thing
skills well because you just can't get a
full you mentioned they use a magnifying
glass on the shoot accuse you bought
this without today to show me
it's the tweezer Minh twelve times new
mirror ok now this just may look like a
mirror to you oh my heart is a bit
different you could take out the
packaging oh the occasion leaves in the
packaging it's the most insane zoomed in
mirror I've ever seen I mean I don't say
don't bikes it might depress you but if
you want to like if you pluck your
eyebrows you want to get really close
it's inside you do have to hold it that
close really addictive ok we haven't
talked about shaving I still shave quite
a bit actually even though I think
parody was shaving it kind of makes it
grow back thicker mm-hmm but I shave my
legs that's all I do because I found
Maxine was too expensive and took too
long and lasers too expensive and takes
too long and those were the only options
I thought I had until I picked Keisha
but we'll talk about that later I love
these little venus snap pop things and
so I shaved my legs which is a bit
annoying because it means I shaved them
like pretty much every day
and even when I do never really looks
that hairless or smooth and I find
maintaining my legs pretty hard
I used to shake round arms until I
lasered let's talk about that in the
minute do you shave anything I can't I
always used to cut myself and also like
you have to be in the shower
you have to make sure it's smooth and
creams and then I can't stand the
itching afterwards I looked you haven't
done it since I was like 15 or 14 yeah I
can't hate it and also shaving down
there girls who do I can't understand
why why would you take a razor down my
dad said oh I could do it I didn't talk
about that in the waxing segment but I
yeah I wax my bikini line because yeah
when I find when people say they shave I
just don't get that at all it must hurt
in America ok but oh I don't get it at
all hard I've never ever done anything
but wax I he knows your mom also told me
to like she was like don't ever well
she's a shaving it grows like so much
thicker and ingrown hairs yeah and also
like I would just cut myself
Oh Kahn yeah so sensitive down there I
works and I think it's fine it's always
a bit embarrassing when you go to
someone but you have to remember that
they have seen a lot of those and
they're just not bothered like that is
like you do have to just get over like
stripping down some use the paper
disposable thongs or knickers but some
just toads or whipper off just whip it
off and then put like keep different
physicians look like hi but just do it
yeah how much nicer it isn't it lasts
longer for me when I wax it actually
lasts quite a long time for oh you do it
as well unless it's going to grow back
so putting it from the follicle so that
after a while just gets weaker and just
goes back miss yeah so now let's talk
about laser laser throwing it most
questions about because I often
mentioned that I have laser so I talk
about my experience yes then you could
have what yours although I don't know
the machine that I use I'll try and find
out and put it in the description box
below
Sonne yeah there are there's three
different ones is very confusing I go to
a salon to get my laser done and I get
my upper lip here and my underarms be
like hey I laser is easier better I
think if you have dark thick hair it's
dark on light skin isn't it yeah so I'm
like the person Trang of the track that
yeah place I used to go it did quite how
it was a bit like a staple gun but place
I go now it doesn't actually hurt I
think the machines are more modern now
and it's just like a hot - light but
they do have to shave the area first
so underarms absolutely fine and shave
them anyway and I can shave in between
and it's so easy it's like I know I've
had I've had like five sessions around
arms and the hairs pretty much gone but
face is very horrible that they have to
shave at first and I will never shave my
face so if to shave in between the
sessions as well no I
cuz mine if I do every six weeks and the
hair doesn't really grow back in between
them yeah I found like people say that
how long until you get results I found
instant results you have to keep doing
it for it to actually maintain but
especially with our underarms I found it
like what instantly um you still have to
go back for more so yeah it's horrible
that shave your face but it doesn't hurt
and it's amazing if you can afford it I
would love to do my legs at bikini line
but leg
legs they said it would take like three
hours and cost like 250 pounds or just
crazy
I pay 40 pounds of my underarms at 40
pounds of my face which i think is quite
affordable compared to some other places
30 pound per session yeah so it's like
80 for both so it's a lot of money still
you can be even more expensive if you go
to like central London a big kind of
places yeah but then no guarantee
results yeah I think I love it though
I'm so happy with mine I'm really not
I've had two sets of laser treatments I
think one icon of this machine but the
other was a soprano XL yeah but these
people do IPL they said it's in such
pain maybe that was your first one it's
like pulse
yeah like kill you never had that yeah
that's quite fearful yeah this one you
have to shave area then you kind of
Robert yeah you just kind of realize
like a chook chook jinx weird drink
that's what every laser ever had as well
as Leila okay now it says by the first
it didn't work because she was rubbing
area and ii would like to do yeah and
then that was it that one I saw more
result but it's not completely gone
areas I had were oh I had like here was
stash and then like that little sideburn
bit I know so bad
and then the Betty bit that we talked
about the lower belly and the lower back
um I was like did you say no is so
annoying cause like for me I found like
I just wanted to invest in the money and
just get it done and gone work because
the time and the money to maintain it
also cuz I wax I don't shave you have to
let the regrowth come yeah it's like oh
I have a shoot tomorrow yeah you have to
remember more Keisha does as a job to
the models oats you have to be like
Greer's and prepares so I just thought
okay let's try and do this permanently
but it didn't work for me
he just hasn't it's gone less it's going
back less and I'm quite happy to kind of
leave it but it's not all gone so Keisha
has files like the works for her which
will bring us on to our next point
epilating
I've never tried it before and Keisha
uses it for your legs legs arms
underarms anywhere anywhere and I've
always been like sure because well
you'll see is there as crazy sound
it looks like a lawnmower basically like
a mini legging but it's what's the idea
it's like clucking but I've only on
something I don't know the mechanics of
it but like you have these rotators and
it catches the hairs in it so it does
like pluck them out and it just catches
it really fast and you just kind of move
it in the hair direction and how often
do you have to epilate you cannot like
do it as often as you want how if it is
small how long do they go back well Lily
hair grows back in cycles so you kind of
have like you do it once but you might
have a few growing back like the next
day or three or four days later and then
you'll have seen like a huge regrowth
like two weeks later or something so
it's all cycle but it's all like shaving
whereas like every day I have to shave
no you don't have to do same because
it's popping just kind of cuts the hair
on the surface or just put blue out so
it gets thinner as well like your hair
just like that I could just leave I see
you in my arms
okay so I've always been put off your
I'm so smooth I always knew put off
because it looks really painful and the
idea of like luckily my eyebrows is
painful so I feel it in my arms and legs
or butt and also I thought maybe it made
my skin quite dry but he sure has really
smooth skin that's something every
struggle with my legs keeping them kind
of smooth when I'm shaving them they're
always bumpy I get like shaving bumps
and stubble E it's just never never good
I want to go this go it's like a really
nice clean removal but you do have like
I would say epilate before do it and
then you can cream afterwards to really
kind of smooth it but you can also just
like do it if you think oh no I need to
get rid of this bit and just literally
do it there and then and it's done I
have an epilator here actually that I
was actually setting as a while ago but
I've never used it because I was too
scared and this is from Braun it's their
silk Eckel v so it looks like this is
what Nepalese it looks like can you plug
it in some plugs into the shaving plug
thing so I'm going to insert a little
clip here now I'm going to give this a
go I don't my legs haven't grown back
enough to try it there I'm going to try
a little bit on my arm
I'm really scared you will see the scary
noise it makes but I'll insert that clip
now okay I don't know if we're in focus
at all I'm going to give this epilating
thing a go so these are plug into the
shaving
in here listen to the sound of this
thing it's basically spinning really
fast it's like little needles like a
yeah I think we should leave busy I'm
gonna end up like explanation my whole
body moving hairless so I will let you
know if I continue to use it after this
it might change my life on my FB like
exposing my legs and arms so anyway I
have a mixture of Shaving laser vaccine
and the threading it is a lot to keep up
with but I think I finally found kind of
a good routine and we would love to hear
like any of your tips and
recommendations as well as you said
