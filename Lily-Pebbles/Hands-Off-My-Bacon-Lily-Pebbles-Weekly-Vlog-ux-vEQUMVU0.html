just got back from Pilates I forgot to
film this morning before I went but
there wasn't really much film there my
legs are killing me there so a key
I'm just doing some boring work stuff
scanning in documents or that my scanner
is not working properly so it's taking
forever but I'm gonna vlog today I'm not
sure if I'm doing anything exciting but
I'll vlog anyway I'm starving because
although I've had as a banana so I'm
gonna have some saucy soul which my mind
got back from France recently put back
almost a completely obsessed with the
lousier album is a who Xia hozier don't
mean how to say it but there's new song
when you sync with someone new it's so
good I love it it's kind of a bit like
reggae and it's just such a nice song so
obsessed I remember listening to us and
Spotify a little time getting to blog
today they know what's wrong with me but
I'm gonna go up to this cookie take a
photo of something for my blog this is
what I need this is a night oil so I
want to take a picture of it tucked up
in my bed but it's blue so that's I
wouldn't stain like hello in a process
I'm trying to get ahead so it's now
Friday and I'm trying to schedule until
next Friday so week ahead and I think
I'm doing well very proud of myself
because I haven't been ahead for ages
I've been doing like the next day's post
the day before which is just crazy
forget ill or something it would be
really bad all right so going to all of
next week's posts so now I am on to next
weekend and I always do a nail post on
Sunday because I didn't know and and
they do a post about the new models own
collection which is fort and hands they
did this last year and I was obsessed
with each bag I think I was cool doesn't
really mess cold sorry at my embraces
and I have dry lips terrible combination
I'm going to try this one out which is
called cocktail hour so I'm just going
to paint my nails even though they're so
damaged already I'm going to paint them
and take a photo so it really does make
my hands it's hand it's not really
showing true colors it's more orange on
camera it's actually quite like a bright
pinky coral pretty nice whoops it's 2
o'clock and I haven't eaten after work I
didn't even realize what time it was I'm
gonna go downstairs and see what there
isn't there's probably nothing I don't
really know I'm graph to whip something
up came downstairs and saw this someone
is making the granola wow this is really
fancy it's got all different stuff in it
I have no idea what this is I'm guessing
it's either rich or my mum someone
healthy I'm gonna be really a healthy
and have a bacon sandwich bacon sandwich
in ages and I'm kind of craving it and
you're anything really weird but I like
to do my bacon in the microwave when
it's streaky bacon like this which is
just like thin strips because it made to
go really crispy and I like I like
baking away the Americans do baking
especially at hotels which is really
thin and crispy English bacon if you
guys don't know is normally quite pink
and fatty and I don't like that so if
you put either microwave for 4 or 5
minutes lay down a plate it goes really
crispy and you just kind of get rid of
all the grease with the kitchen towel
and it's
I have it with ketchup and this is a
really bad lunch but happening okay
bacon sandwich with ketchup done that
actually looks like it's getting really
good and excited really Matthew this
Friday which is actually working on
today hello my name is making this
manhwa take on what is that right great
with coconut butter this is the healthy
half of our relationship you know you're
jealous of this they come on nigga back
look at that don't even think about it
okay we're just gonna make a coffee now
because I've got sent this really cool
coffee and I thought to show you it's
from a place with packed coffee and they
send you coffee either like ground
coffee or coffee beans and they also do
a little filter thing and you know what
I'm like with coffee I'm not sure this
is my kind of thing a bit firstly the
rich would be like so we've got a couple
of flavours this one a poached pear and
dark chocolate that one is chocolate
chip cookie this is so cool and where's
the little drippy thing yeah so you put
that on top of your car and go on rich
what you do and how you put filter
filtering come on here
we tried by is this when you have a
chance to go off
I was joking one at a time yeah okay say
stupid man
and then I'm guessing you're gonna pull
the water in and it kind of filters
through United 494 water I'm gonna go
back to work upstairs
sorry that might make you dizzy all that
spinning okay it's a bit later and I'm
feeling it a little bit tired but I'm
gonna head to the supermarkets I need to
pick up some bits and got a few people
coming over tonight and I'm gonna make
guacamole but I think we were just gonna
get pizza so haven't got much to get but
I'm gonna go get some back from
supermarkets and I got a key bit I got
ID'd for wine that was really exciting
27 so get an ID it is always a plus I
think it's cuz I'm not very much makeup
I got some wine I got this one because
it has my name on it clearly and it was
a red wine it really know anything about
red wine but this is Shiraz which i
think is what my parents drink so I got
that one I got some juices this one is
pressed pineapple peach and passion
fruit also god I love this stuff this is
like pina colada but without any alcohol
in such as that coconutty pineapple and
some lemonade cuz I think Anna likes
lemonade I got homers and olives and
then I make some guacamole carrot sticks
a cucumber to dip in stuff to make
recommend these whipped interesting
multigrain mini tortilla chips and write
your salted tortillas that they were
made without wheat and a gluten-free and
give those a try we are planning on
having pizza though so that will kind of
make up for the whole gluten free wheat
free thing and the rest is all to make
life remotely so I'm gonna make that a
bit I'm gonna make broccoli now so I put
those alive for days and you've cherry
tomatoes which are here and
red onion which is anything yeah garlic
which is yeah a bit soft
okay I'm gonna start by cutting all the
avocados open and putting them into the
bowl
I find the easiest way to get the
avocado out I used to try and peel off
the skin is like a big scoop spoon and
scoop it out
didn't you bottom OD have red onions in
it I really like it they kind of bulks
out a bit more mix it a bit that's my
dog choking makes it a bit bulkier and
yeah I think it tastes really good so
I'm just gonna cut out I'm already
crying I hope I read literature to peel
the skin off so this is gonna be a big
cry I can tell so ah so stinky so many
tears I've been doing normal onions with
red onions just kill me one for the
guacamole one for me okay welcome oh
he's done and I put a bit of lemon in so
it doesn't go Brown and also so it
tastes good so pepper to finish off
tomatoes red onion I'm not gonna pretty
Chilean because I don't think Ana really
like spicy food you're not sure about
the other girls Lusine Chloe around my
dog has got this choking thing at the
moment it's pretty bad I'm just gonna
give it a try and see my frugal okay Ana
Lucia Chloe here now and Ana I was like
everyone hope you have a drink and Ana
like only drinks at Marissa's she's
literally pour all the ingredients show
us how you make it what's this little
this is lemon and sugar this is probably
like the most horrible way to make it
like you're not is that clear displaced
apart and like little cherries and stuff
I've now completely lost kind of the man
said to me miss denim oh you old enough
to buy this and I was like haha
and here's like caring though you are ID
please they're me serious I was like hey
we'll come back to you and it's made I
forgot to vlog the pizza
pretty much eaten it now but we had two
giant massive pizzas and we're watching
the grace Helbig show which is on e
we're just watching gogglebox and I'm
gonna make a cup of tea soon but I've
kind of forgotten to vlog all evenings
I've been rubbish but I'm gonna vlog
again on Sunday I think I have no plans
so I'm sure it's gonna be a great blog I
will see you guys morning guys it's
Sunday today and I was meant to wake up
and wash my hair but I didn't wake up
early enough and I just can't do it in
the morning so I'm gonna wait till
tonight and just look ridiculous all day
although I don't know why I can't get
away with my hair up I just look like a
man but I always see people with a hair
up and they look fine anyway I have no
plans today but I know that rich is
watching the football later so I'll
probably be coming home later and
washing my hair then but I don't know
what we're doing today I've actually
going out and getting something nice for
breakfast but it's like 11:00 or at
least
I need to get ready yesterday I picked
up the lighter shade in the urban decay
you can see less of this one is light
warm because the fair one was just too
like too pale for me so I'm hoping this
one is better than this one which is
light neutral which is weird because I
think Nietzsche was better but this
one's slightly darker give it the one on
the right is the neutral one the one on
the left is the wall one so weirdly the
neutral one is more pink very strange so
I think this one's gonna be a better
match for me okay makeup done I use the
Eve LOM tinted moisturizer I'm open to
connect it can see let's soda powder
bronzer this beautiful new highlighter
form Laura Mercier oh look at that it's
so nice this Chanel blusher from last
year Tom Ford eye liner to face mascara
and the Sonia Kashuk matte eyeshadow
pada pada palettes which everyone asks
me how it compared this one the Vizio
and as you think they're very similar I
do think this one is better quality
bloody well should be for how much it is
but they're so similar if you're gonna
get one get this one because it's so
much cheaper but obviously both of these
are quite hard to get hold of if you are
from the UK but very similar it's just
missing this amazing orange shade in
this one which is I think the nicest
shade so that's a shame and I'm gonna
wear this Max Factor balm in refineries
which I'm a bit obsessed at at the
moment it's just so nice for like an
everyday pink I've had lots of nice
comments recently on my videos about my
teeth and how straight they're looking
which is really nice but I think I'm
coming towards the end of my clear guide
clear braces thing I don't you never
really know I've got them on the last
brace of the last batch that I dentist
gave me but sometimes I go back he gives
me 5 more so I don't know but I've been
taking photos from them every now and
again throughout my journey and it's
quite cool to look at them actually so
if you hate teeth but that's the first
photo and then it kind of straightens
off and then it kind of stops for a bit
because they move the back teeth before
they move the front teeth so that's why
it doesn't really look like it's doing
much until they're really yellow there
must be the light and then they start to
straighten out like really straighten
out there is that the most yeah that's
nice recent photos
so I haven't got the most pretty looking
teeth but I think these tears are that
straight yet I'm gonna ask my dentist
about those but the bottom teeth
straightened out so much since the first
photo like look how crossed they are at
the beginning that's like focus that's
like crazy crust at the bottom so I'm
really happy with the results and it has
taken a while I haven't even finished
yet but I knew it would like he didn't
promise me that it would be quick it's
it's moving bone so it's quite a big
deal you don't really want to rush it
and it hasn't affected me wearing braces
mind at all anymore so anyway I need to
get some food it's now 20 past 11:00 and
I haven't eaten one single thing
starving
just got the white company this isn't
even the proper brochures it's just like
a promo thing just flicking through
pretty pictures and then at the back
Keisha
look she looks so pretty and there's one
on the back as well very proud friend
also with our newspaper Saturday Times
the rich list I just think this is such
a weird thing I don't know if this is
just a UK thing the list of the most
rich people in the UK like in order
that's I just think that's so weird I
don't understand why norm wants to know
that all why they share that strange
yeah I'm just gonna make some scrambled
egg for breakfast company bother to make
it any else so I've got two eggs I'm
gonna scramble them up and then put them
on toast with ketchup
rich does his in the microwave which i
think is so it I just do mine in the pan
very easy even then let it kind of
scramble
Butterbean this guy number one on the
rich list I mean I hope you'd want the
whole world to mode to the scattering
queen is number 302 that's weird
like Philip Green is like number 20 stay

wouldn't really go into central London
