working from home today and then I'm
going out tonight with my sister good
news is we just got the internet
installed the Virgin guy they said
they'd come between 8:00 and 5:00 and he
came and he's done it and it's really
fast thank god this guy called like John
in the UK office somehow like we got
through to him and he helped us out they
were meant to be coming in November and
he somehow bumped us up the list I don't
know how but thank God because now I can
just sit here and work and it's amazing
to just have internet so I promise no
more internet complaining from me around
here you had an Accardo delivery
yesterday if you saw my snapchat so
fridge is nice and full I'm still kind
of getting used to what we want to buy
and stuff but I had breakfast this
morning and I had some yogurt and
raspberries and honey which is there in
this stuff I love this stuff this is
bright banquet Bayona which i love their
spelt pasta granola honey hazelnut
whole-grain OB or cane sugar but you
guys know I'm not like a health freak so
I just thought this would taste nice
because it's got honey and hazelnut in
it and it that's actually the Grenadier
inside by the way it tastes delicious
I'm a bit obsessed with it
look how good these little like wire
things are they've stuck on my desk I
love that so organized by the way to the
girl that commented on my bathroom
cabinet video saying just to let you
know you can turn your extractor fan off
and keep the light on thank you I wish
you were around before I filmed that
video I've just realized that we have a
button up here if the extractor fan so
as I go into the bathroom to vlog it's
peaceful and quiet and I really wish
that it would have been this peaceful in
that video because internet man was here
and I've been like faffing about doing
work Oh God our mirror is so dirty I
haven't done my morning skincare routine
now so I've just cleanse my face with
cotton wool pads and micellar water and
I'm gonna remember I showed you guys
this is why I keep products that I'm
like trying out I'm gonna be trying this
one from Loxy tan this is their precious
cream and it's an itty-bitty tiny sample
and love with samples come in like
how could you rather than sachets
because I would someone to open a sachet
it's quite hard to use it more than once
so this is really cute
my friend Gemma would absolutely die for
this late miniature thing so this is one
of their moisturizing creams and I'm
gonna give it a go
this little song pool will last seven
days so I can do like a whole trial for
a week
oh I really like this oh it's like
really really moisturizing oh my god you
know you just feel like your skin needs
something my skin is like drinking this
up that's really nice I love the smell I
love the smell of L'Occitane products my
mom has always used them so I feel like
it's already familiar brand to me and I
hope you really got into their shower
oil quite a few years ago it's just one
of those brands you know your mummys a
brand you know you can trust it it's a
lovely French brand mmm so just rub that
well it's my skin and I'm going to give
this a go every morning and night for a
week to see how I get on with it and the
reason I am trying this one specifically
is this is lock seat and have this like
interactive online tool let me take you
into my office so I can show you what I
mean basically this is what it looks
like on their websites they're four
different creams to suit different skin
types and I think this is a really good
idea because I personally think it's
really hard to know kind of which
products are aimed at your type of skin
and it's much easier I find when people
are asking you questions about your skin
someone says does it feel tight and you
can say yes or no it's much easier to
know what sort of skin you have that way
so basically this is like a really quick
questionnaire and so I'm gonna show you
guys now because I would've done this
press star and then it said just between
us - what's your age group oh I'm in the
25 to 35 bracket I remember the day that
I went up a bracket that was not fun
25:35 next and then asked how would you
describe your skin so I put dry my skin
is quite dehydrated and it can be quite
dry and then it asks what are your two
main skin concerns so dullness and lack
of radiance is always something that's a
concern of mine and then I put early
signs of aging because you know I think
you need to start the anti-aging being a
bit early on
I'm gonna put those two as mine and then
that's all you need to do it's like
really really quick and then it picks
the right cream for you so mine says
your recommended product is precious
cream firming and lifting ideal for
tackling the first signs for aging skin
silky cream is formulated with skin
firming immortal plant extracts to help
produce the look of fine lines and
wrinkles the skin that ultimately looks
smoother and more supple I definitely
want a smoother and supple and then it
basically has it or form the fill outs
if your neck first name last name your
email address and your location and what
that it does it means that you can go
and pick up your 7-day trial like your
little sample from your local lop seat
and store that's the bit that thing's
really good so then you go in you get
one of these and it's the one that suits
it to your skin type because you've
already filled out the questionnaire and
then you can try it for a week so that's
basically what I'm doing I think it's a
genius idea and this is the first time I
tried it just now on camera I really
like it my skin feels really soft I like
the whole plumping affirming idea I
think that is the kind of the key to non
aging skin and it's super hydrating
which my skin needs like the wetness got
so much colder in the UK and I can feel
my skin just drying out so if you're
wondering what moisturizers to get to
suit your specific skin type I will
leave the link to the online interactive
tool down in the description box it's
completely free service the samples free
so you'd have to pay for anything so go
and check that out if you're interested
we're trying to get really good at
making loads of food for dinner and then
putting it in like Tupperware and
freezing it so we have like food well
especially for me if I need lunch so I'm
eating chili that we had the other night
I'm gonna heat it up maybe have a bit of
rice or maybe just by itself and it's
quite a nice video decimate lunch it's
already made whoo then I'm gonna set up
our TV because obviously it's a smart TV
but we haven't had internet so I haven't
been able to do anything on it now I can
watch YouTube and Netflix and that's
pretty damn exciting I'm just gonna sit
and do some work oh this afternoon and
I'll get ready to go out tonight tonight

got offered a plus-one and I actually
really do like Mike Made in Chelsea but
my sister really likes it so obviously I
