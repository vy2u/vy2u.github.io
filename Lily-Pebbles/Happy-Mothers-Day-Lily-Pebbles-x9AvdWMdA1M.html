Day it celebrated on different days
around the world but the meaning is
still the same I think it's lovely
taking the time to say thanks mom you're
the best my mom has taught me so much
and still to this day I call her daily
for advice one of the ways I'm most like
her is with my friends she taught me how
to be social and inclusive and I think
I've developed such a good friendship
group from always seeing her being such
a good friend to hers to celebrate
Mother's Day I asked my friends what did
you learn from your mum I want to hear
from you too so comment down below and
tell me what your mum has taught you
happy mother's day if you're a mum and
thanks for watching
she taught me that if you try your
hardest with everything then you won't
regret the outcome no matter what it is
my mum has taught me how to laugh a lot
if you think it do it my mum taught me
to worry less how to fold clothes away
she has taught me lots of things but I
think the most important one is not to
care what anyone thinks of you my mum
taught me never to take my shoes off in
public especially weddings because it
ruins your outfit my mum has taught me
how to always win back my deposit from
shitty landlords and estate agents my
mum has taught me to believe in myself
and if I don't learn to love myself and
how can I know
don't other people dictate your
happiness told me how sometimes it can
be good to sit on the fence and not get
involved particularly family arguments
let people sort things out by themselves
the one thing my mom's told me is
housemate Persian mice don't take notes
too seriously on a bad day keep your
head up and just keep going growing up
she brought me out to be a really naked
baby I never realized that there was
such thing as people having body
confidence issues I think one of the
best things a month can ever teach her
daughter or son is to be body confident
and happy with who you are think it's
the sense of adventure and sort of
pushing my body and pushing myself to
the limit like that adrenaline rush I
feel like from my mom I have learned to
be a good cook well a semi good cook
when I was a really good cook but I'm
definitely just like I said okay and
then also to be like a good host and
then another thing which is just
remembered to buy good presents my mom
is like the best present I ever I do I
tried to inherit that from her the one
thing my mom has taught me is how to
tell a white lie how to make a good
chicken soup I think I love my mum is
that I walk into the kitchen and it's
silent I should just turn around and
back out it I don't think I've left for
my mum is when I'm a grown-up I have
grown-up children is to chill out not be
one of those months who's really intense
and demanding on my child's time my
mum's just let me do my own thing
and I really appreciate that and I'll do
the same for my children my mum taught
me to always find the silver lining in
the gray cloud and also to not over
pluck my eyebrows but I didn't listen to
that life always treat others how you
want to be treated why moms approach to
things is that it's always better to be
liked because you're smart and you're
funny then
people care how you look but then she's
absolutely stunning so she's taught me
how to look after my skin my mom told me
to eat well behave well be kind-hearted
and always moisturize things she told me
to be ready to take risks and not to be
afraid to fail because there's always
something to be learned
okay you ask me the question as well did
you sort like one sentence
okay can you ask me the question okay
okay what's one thing your mom taught
you one thing your mom taught you what's
one thing your mom taught you what's one
thing your mom taught you tell me
something that you learn from your mummy
once oh and II see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
