review video so I've been a bit naughty
and I've done some shopping I don't know
what it is about the whole Christmas
period time but I spend more money on
myself than any other time of the year I
really don't know why because my
birthday's in December Christmas is in
December there's no need to park myself
presents but I just can't help with
things because all the good stuffs out
during Christmas so I just go a bit
crazy it always happens there's so much
like promotion everywhere and not spend
loads of money most things in this hall
are actually fashion related but I've
got a few beauty bits as well so I'm
gonna get started first of all gap had a
30% off code and I always know when get
past a chip set off because my mom
always tells me she is like the gap
Queen and she always says 30% off let's
go so I went along wasn't really
expecting to buy anything but I spotted
these sweaters and I fell in love I
actually bought the grey one first and
then went back for the mint so this is
what the grey one looks like you've
probably seen it in some of my other
videos by now oh it's great cable-knit
and I bought this in size large I think
now I got it
extra large because I want it to be a
bit oversized it's really cozy and soft
and with dr. zernoff it was really
affordable I've rolled up the sleeves a
bit it's just really nice and slushy and
I've been wearing this gray one to death
so I went back a couple of weeks later
when they had another 30 percent code
and I got the mint one I saw a mint
cashmere jumper in gaps that I really
wanted it was quite expensive and then
they bought out this job in mint so I
went for this one as well and it's nice
a bit different for winter a nice and
bright kind of summery but if you pair
it with dark colors I think it can look
really nice and wintery so those are my
Gap sweaters I'm really happy with those
I've been wearing them to death and I
also went to Primark
I love Primark during the winter I think
it's when they bring out all their good
stuff and I spotted this cardigan and
I've put this on my blog so you may have
seen it already but I really really love
it it looks like a little jacket what it
looks like but it's actually really soft
it is cardigan material it's got a faux
leather lining so it looks like a
structured jacket with little pockets
but it's actually soft and it feels like
a cardigan and you can roll up the
sleeves and I really like this it's so
good because you can layer it like a
cardigan but also you can wear it over
layers
as a little jacket as well it's just
really soft and cozy and I just think it
looks much more expensive than it is it
was really affordable so that was a good
one definitely go look at Primark at the
moment they've got loads of good stuff
so the last bit from my fashion haul is
this handbag and it's from Topshop and I
spotted this my friend Deb's had it and
I just was like I need to go get that
sorry I hope you don't mind I've always
copier and it looks like this it's quite
different because it's got kind of a top
handle and it's supposed to come with a
long strap mine didn't but it does come
with a lobster but it's got a big zip
this side smaller zip this side and then
a big kind of middle section where you
can keep everything and I just really
like the way it sits I've got a photo of
this on my blog as well and it's got
kind of a textured leather look which
makes it look a lot more expensive than
it is and I love that I haven't got any
other bags like it so I knew it had to
be mine and it's come in really handy
it's really kind of easy to hold and it
looks good with color of every outfit so
next up is my naughtiest purchase I
still can't believe I bought this but
when I saw Lisa Eldridge talking about
Chanel Christmas collection I knew this
eyes shadow palette had to be mine and
it's that eyeshadow palette from their
Christmas collection and it's beautiful
I was waiting for November the 15th to
come and then Anna actually phoned me I
think was the 14th saying this Chanel
shop and Covent Garden has it taught me
to buy you one I was like yes please now
oh so it's amazing it looks like this it
has five colours yes and it ranges from
kind of a lighter shimmer to matte light
brown glittery bronze dark brown and
then there's nice kind of perfectly topi
shape which is really nice to use as an
eyeliner it's just the perfect palette
and I know I don't need any more
eyeshadow palettes it's ridiculous how
many I have and this was so expensive it
was like 45 pounds it's like stupid I
know but it's beautiful and I've never
owned a Chanel eyeshadow palette and I
really really wanted it and you know
when you just really want something so
I'm just babbling now and making excuses
but it's beautiful and I love it and I'm
really happy I got it because I've used
it loads and I know I
we'll use it loads more and you can use
it as miners all over shadows and
they're just beautiful colors Lisa
Eldridge has a couple of videos where
she's use this and I'll I'll link those
below because it just shows how amazing
the palette is it comes in a nice
velvety pouch which is always a bonus so
the final thing for this haul it's been
quick but quite expensive also makeup
brushes and as you guys probably know I
really like to invest in good makeup
brushes and I have loads but I've never
owned bobby brown makeup brushes and
every time I go past the counter I
always feel them and think I really want
to buy some but it wasn't until esday
from Essie box and started banging on
about them like I need them now so I
just went out once after date with
Richmond bought some and I chose these
two first one is the sheer powder brush
and I really like this it's small and
tapered so it's good for us using
setting powder like wherever you need
under the eyes and down the middle of
your face but I actually really like
using this for blush because even though
it looks small it's really good it stops
me from putting too much blusher on
inputs I put it exactly where I need it
and it looks small but it actually kind
of blends out really nicely so you can
just put it on like this and it's
perfect I have quite a little face so
it's good for blusher for me and the
second one I got is that I blender and I
really like this because it's quite a
bit bigger than a normal kind of
blending brush but it's really nice to
what I do is I keep this one clean all
the time so I use my Mac t-17s and so
Viva brushes to apply the color and then
if this one's always clean I just use it
to blend out the edges and it really
kind of like spreads out quite a lot of
really nice they're both so softness
such good quality and they wash
amazingly well and they're just amazing
quality so I definitely recommend Bobby
Brown brushes if you want to invest in
some the dream is to get the whole set
of Bobby Brown brushes but that's never
gonna happen but they're so nice so
that's everything from my haul and
review video I hope you like seeing a
few more fashionista bits
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye so first up is
of course a nail polish and this month
I've been loving nails Inka Victoria
which is actually one of their hero
shades</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
