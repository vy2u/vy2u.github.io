video so for this video I have six items
and if you haven't watched my haul in
review videos before they're basically
where I show you things that I've bought
but also kind of review them and tell
you what I think of them at the same
time so first up is the Mac and Rihanna
her cocoa eyeshadow palette I wasn't
really that bothered by this collection
when I saw it and I didn't really know
it was even coming I'm not very good at
keeping up with Mac collections but then
I saw a few instruments going around and
then I saw this palette and this is the
her cocoa palette and I just thought
that looks right up my street it's all
kind of brown neutral shades so I went
into store there were a few left in
comic Garden which is one of the bigger
stores and I went to swatch it and kind
of fell in love there's four shades
there's a white kind of velvety all over
the eye good like base color then
there's a really yellowy gold shimmer
which is really pretty and I haven't got
any other shades like that so I really
like that and then there's two darker
brands and they're very similar ones
they're more chocolate brown ones a
cooler tone taupe color and they're both
really nice blends down to the crease I
have a blog post on this I'll link it
below but it's all together I was really
impressed with this it was 33 pounds so
it wasn't that cheap but considering
that each Mac I showed is normally kind
of 9 to 12 pounds it's a pretty good
deal and I'm really happy with this and
I've been using it quite a lot I'm not
kind of crazy keen on the packaging it's
meant to be kind of rose gold it's a lot
more pink than what I would have
preferred but that doesn't really bother
me it's a nice little quad and it's good
for traveling and things like that next
up are these pima trainers that I picked
up last week I had a huge gap in my shoe
department I have black boots I have
kind of brogues but I don't really have
any casual trainers I have some changes
I showed in a whole video while ago but
they're black with studs and they are
quite smart and like in-your-face so I
just wanted really casual trainers I
could wear with skinny jeans in a
t-shirt I don't really wear train as
much so as a bit scary I tried on a few
but I really fell in love with these
ones they're really comfy they're kind
of suede gray with this little thing
here and on that side and they're really
comfortable they're not too like a
stereotypical to any type of person I
said to the guy that till I was like a
Pumas cool because I don't really know
he was like yes they're cool so that was
good but they're just really comfy
and I think they're really easy to wear
with jeans and they were about 55 pounds
which isn't too bad and I think I think
they'll last a while just really easy to
wear good weekend so you may have heard
about the buzz of Charlotte to Bruges
new makeup range everyone's been talking
about it and there's loads of amazing
makeup I went to the counter in
Selfridges to have a little look and I
fell in love with the contour highlight
kit and with this brush and I had to
pick one and I couldn't afford to get
both so I went for the brush because you
guys know I love buying makeup brushes
and this is the contour and sculpting
brush I think it's called and it was
about 35 pounds and it's a very small
tapered brush it's good to use under the
eye to set with powder it's obviously
really good to use for contour and I
thought it might be too small for
contour but it spreads out quite a lot
so you can really kind of blend in your
contour well and I really like this I
also really like that it's made by
people who make paintbrushes so what
they've done is they've put edges to the
handle so it doesn't roll on a table
that's just genius they're really nice
good quality brushes the bristles aren't
as soft as maybe I would have liked but
that means it's good for powder products
because they grip to the hairs and
another you notice is that everyone's
brushes are slightly different Anna also
got this and Amelia and I was all a
little bit different Anna's is a bit
more kind of spread out mine's a bit
more tapered a mine when I bought it
also had a few kind of hard bits in it
that have kind of disappeared as I've
got as I've used it more but that wasn't
funny but I do really like it now and I
use it kind of on a daily basis you can
use up a highlight as well it's a very
multi-use brush and it could want to add
to the kit so I'm happy I bought this a
couple of weeks ago I had an Essie
manicure I did a blog post on it so I'll
link that below and they used their
amazing new navy blue nail polish which
I am obsessed with and the manicure was
lovely and the polish lasted for like
over a week I was so impressed obviously
when you have a manicure it always lasts
longer but I thought it might be
something to do with the fact that she
used an Essie base coat and a Nessy top
coat I always use Seche vite which I
really like because it dries fast and I
think it makes the Polish last but this
was like crazy long so I thought I would
go and pick up an Essie topcoat and the
one I chose was the no chips ahead and I
thought because that really what I
wanted to get
fast-drying as much I really wanted like
no chips I wanted the nail polish to
last so I thought I'd get this and give
it a go
and I've tried it a few times and I'm
really not impressed unfortunately I got
chips like I'm a second third day which
is really bad I think a lot of the time
getting chips in your nail polish is to
do is like the natural oils that you
produce and everyone's nails a different
miner maybe slightly flake here but my
Seche vite topcoat they last at least
five days so this is a bit disappointing
and not worth the money I think is about
$8.99 so that's a shame I do love SC but
this topcoat wasn't very good next was a
bit of a splurge and I recently did a
blog post on this as well saying is it
really worth the hype and it's the by
Terry Baume De Rose lip balm a lot of
people talk about this it's definitely
hyped up
I have never picked it up before because
it's rose scented I don't love rose it's
at a pop I don't really like that cuz I
take the tube a lot and I think it's a
bit grubby but when I was in space and
Kay recently I thought just give it a
little go and it was actually a lot
nicer than I thought it looks like a
kind of gel texture so I was expecting
it to kind of just sit on the lips but
if you really work it in with your
fingers it's a really amazing lip balm
I've definitely got used to the rose
scent now I quite like it ish but the
lip balm is just really good it's a
really nice hard to use before bed I've
just been carrying this around in my bag
with me and I can tell it's gonna last a
long time as well you don't really need
much and it keeps your lips moisturized
for a really long time like a good few
hours it's nice to put on before
lipsticks I'm just really impressed it's
35 pounds which is crazy for a lip balm
I know it is I did use a discount when I
bought this and I probably wouldn't have
bought it without that discount but if
you are someone who has really dry lips
and I know how that feels and you can't
find anything that works I think it's
worth spending a bit more money because
it's all lips it's like on your face you
know on dry lips so I think this is
really good and it is worth the hype and
I'm glad I got okay for the final
product this was another kind of silly
unnecessary purchase but one I've wanted
for quite a while as you guys know I've
got the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in dim lights this is the one
that I chose there ambient lighting
powders if you don't know there's about
six I think and they're all suited for
different things someone for redness
some of the sallowness someone were to
highlight some like a bronzer I chose
dim light which is a
good curveball over setting powder and I
do really like it but I was never like
wowed as everyone else was and everyone
else always talks about fuse lights so
every time I go into store I always
swatch it and it always looks really
glittery but then I switched Anna's and
hers isn't glittery at all so I think
it's just because people have liked
swatch to get through one and then
swatch that one it's all just been
transferred so I thought I would just
give it a go and I picked up the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
diffused light this one is slightly
yellow so it's good for redness which I
don't have but it's also just a really
nice like kind of like a softbox liked
powder for your face it just diffuses
the light as the name suggests and I'm
wearing it today I've been wearing it
for about a week now and again it's not
like wow like instant you can see it but
someone like me that I don't really like
to use a normal setting powder because
I've got quite dry skin and I just don't
need more powder products on my face
this is really nice and shear and light
and doesn't look powdery at all on the
skin it just sets your makeup at whilst
adding like a slight glow and just
diffuses any light you may have in your
face like I do now and I'm filming so I
really like this and I'm glad I got it
these powders are just really cool it's
definitely worth going to have a look at
them and finding one that suits you
because I think they're worth investing
there about 38 pounds and depending on
where you get them you can pick them up
space and K and make sure you use your
indulge card because those Space NK
points of good although when you get
your email saying you've reached 100
points you always feel a little bit
guilty that means you've spent a hundred
pounds but it's also exciting because
you get five pounds or so that
everything from my haul and review video
