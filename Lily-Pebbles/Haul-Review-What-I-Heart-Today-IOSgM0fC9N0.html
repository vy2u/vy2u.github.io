video but it's going to be slightly
different to my usual ones instead of
just showing you I boards I've actually
used these products for the past few
weeks and i'm going to show you what I
ball but also tell you I think of them
the first purchase is one I made it I'm
at and I didn't have much time to shop
there but I knew which stands i wanted
to go to and i definitely wanted to
check out Hakuho do makeup brushes
because I've heard so much about them
and I love makeup brushes so I went
there to look around and I wanted to buy
one brush as a little treat to myself so
I thought I'd get one I could use for a
couple of different things so I picked
up this one I'd like you'd use this for
blush and highlighter I really like it
all their brushes and natural hair so
they feel incredibly soft and they do
pick up pigment really well I got the
white one so i can see how dirty it gets
and I know when to clean it I do like it
for 35 pounds it's probably not worth it
you can get kind of brushes from
japonesque or chrome brushes that just
as good if not better but I'm glad I got
it was a little treat to myself I
wouldn't save rush out and buy water
straight away but if you are ever at
someone like I'm at swear they
discounted then maybe it's worth having
a look because they are really good
quality brushes the next product I
picked up at Liberty beauty who I have
wanted this such a long time it's the
rent clarifying play cleanser every time
I go to a red cancer over the past kind
of year or so they've told me to not use
this unless you have oily blemish prone
skin Rena very into kind of separating
their products into dry skin oily skin
blemish prone skin they have different
products with different skin needs but
just because I don't have oily blemish
prone skin I really like using play
based products because they're really
cleansing and I live in London and
there's a lot of pollution around so I
like to have kind of a really deep
cleansing and cleanser to use at the end
of the day so I spoke to Caroline
hearings she said don't be silly it's
five all skin types and actually the
lady at liberty said it was fine as well
so I finally picked it up and I really
like it I use this in the evenings as my
first cleanse because in the evenings I
often do a double cleanse because as I
said I live in London and there's a lot
of crap going on my face so I like to
really get it all out because it's
clay-based it's really deep cleansing it
doesn't feel stripping at all on my skin
and I've got quite dehydrated skin so
it's important not to use anything
drying and it doesn't feel drying it
spreads really nicely and then I like to
use some
like the Emma Hardy cleansing balm which
is a bit more moisturizing as my second
lens I really like it comes in this huge
packaging and it the products in like a
look back inside so you can see when
it's running out yeah really impressive
this I would recommend it if you like
quite a deep cleansing and cleanser to
use at the end of the day next up a
couple of mascaras I picked up to test
out for my drugstore makeup starter kit
video which was my last video if you
haven't seen it i'll link it below the
two that i picked up where maybelline
the falsies and Maybelline the rocket
and one of them I loved it one of them I
really didn't love obviously if you
watch the video you'll know that I fell
in love with Mabel in the rocket I
really like this I'm wearing it now I've
been wearing it since i bought it gives
really good length and volume and just
really easy to use really like that
maybelline the falsies on the other hand
i used this when i was younger when I
was about 15 and I remember quite liking
it and it's definitely like a cult
mascara everyone loves it so I went to
pick it up and I was really disappointed
it has kind of a funny curvy brush which
I found quite difficult to use and it's
very bendy as well and the inside
doesn't do anything the outside curve is
better but I just found it didn't really
grip the lashes properly and just didn't
really do much you know any know
straight away that you don't like a
mascara that's how I felt about this so
that is a shame the next product is from
NARS and I saw Lisa L just writes about
this and one of her blog post which I'll
link below is a really good post about
summer red lipsticks and this just
looked like a red that I know I would
love it's an oz satin lip pencil I have
one of the velvet matte lip pencils
which I really like so I thought I'd try
one of these and I've got the color
Majella and it's a really nice deep red
color it's just so classy and elegant I
think it works quite well for the day
but especially good for the evening goes
with loads of different outfits and I
really like how the texture to be really
nice of these they glide on really
easily but it did bleed a little bit off
the edges throughout the day so if you
have any kind of invisible lip liners I
know that lipstick queen do one that
probably would work well with this but
as long as you kind of checked the
mirror and reapply it it doesn't dry out
or anything throughout the day so a
couple of things to note with the
packaging of these they're not wind up
like the Clinique ones so you have to
find a sharp that it fits and i also
find the lid comes off quite easily so
don't have leave them hanging around
your handbag but apart from that I to
really like them and I really like the
color and the texture so I'm happy about
it next up is a product from the bomb
and I heard sday from st bus and talking
about this quite a lot so when I saw it
in and other stories shop I thought I'd
give it a little swatch and I really
liked it so i bought it is the mary-lou
manizer they have such weird names and
packaging for this brown but it's kind
of cute this is basically a champagne II
Goldie highlighter it's very powdery and
pigmented when you swatch it in a finger
it's like really bright but I actually
found that when you put this on the
cheeks it's not that bright it's quite
subtle you can't really see it on my
kind of skin tone so maybe it's better
if you're slightly paler and it's a
source of products as well that feels so
soft I feel like it's gonna smash any
minute so you have to really careful
though carry around in your handbag I
probably wouldn't repurchase it and I
probably wouldn't recommend it i think
is a little bit pricey for what it is
but if you are paler it might be worth
it because it probably shows up better
on your skin so go and how to swatch and
see what you think I'm not blown away
but I do like it and I'm wearing it
today i have been using it i also went
to mak recently and picked up a few
things sort of products that I've just
wanted for ages and i don't know why i
haven't got them and i just thought I'm
going to go and get them get it out of
the way first one is a lipstick and it's
a lustre lipstick called lust ring and
its a bright pink it's not really bright
pink I'm wearing it today basically I
find it really hard to wear kind of
brighter pink because I've got quite
dark features a lot of bright Pink's
have blue undertones and they just look
funny on me for some reason but this one
has red undertones which is much more
kind of warm and my sort of fits to my
complexion so I went to try this and I
absolutely fell in love with it as I
said I'm wearing it today I do think
it's a really pretty ready pink and it's
perfect for the summer I'm a little bit
obsessed to this I've been wearing it
loads recently and I think this has
quickly become one of my favorite MAC
lipsticks I feel like I haven't heard
that many people talking about it I've
never heard of it but I saw her it's
watched it and was like this is the
perfect pink for me so I'm really happy
with that I also picked up nylon I
shadow and I always had tiny birds
talking about how great this is for the
inner corner of your eye and I haven't
really found an eyeshadow that I like
using in the inner corner yet I have
couple from my naked one and making 2
palette but they're just a little bit
too peachy and they never really work
this one's a bit more of a yellowy tone
as you can see it's kind of a yellowy
light golden shimmer color and it's just
perfect and wearing it now I just find
it so flattering and yeah I think this
is that going to be a staple mac
eyeshadow for me I really like it's
perfect for the inner corner and you can
use it quite lightly under your brow as
well as a highlight final Mac product is
a blusher and it's the frankly scarlet
blush this is literally the scariest
looking thing ever it looks like bright
red blusher but again I've seen Tanya by
using this and it looks amazing whenever
she uses in videos so i really wanted to
try it wearing it today you literally
need the tiniest tap on your brush and
even when i use the tiniest tap I still
put on the back of my hand first because
you can easily end up with a bit of a
red face but if you use a tiny amount
it's just the most flattering color
because if you think about when you
naturally flush when you get hot or
embarrassed you kind of go a little bit
red will I do I don't really go long
peachy pink which most blushes that I
use are so I thought I'd try this and it
works it kind of just looks like i'm
naturally flushing so i really like this
and really happy i got it and glad that
I saw Tanya using it in one of her
videos thank you tanya the final product
is a bit of a cheat because they haven't
actually used it yet so I can't give a
proper review but it's the philip
kingsley daily damage defense i wanted a
product that was a detangler and a heat
protector because at the moment i use a
detangler and then i use like a
smoothing cream and then i use a heat
protector and it's a lot of products
bearing on so i kind of wanted one that
does everything and this one says
anti-breakage heat protecting
conditioning spray suit of all hair
types which is great I straighten my
hair a lot so it does break a lot so I
really wanted something that was anti
breakage and all of that it comes it
with a little pump this is the travel
size I didn't want to get the huge one
in case didn't like it so I will try
this and let you guys know I'm sure we
will end up on the blog somewhere in
fact a lot of these products i think
i've reviewed on my blog so i'm going to
put loads of links below if you want to
go and read the blog posts but yeah i'm
looking forward to trying this I do like
philip kingsley products they're really
good so that's everything i hope you
like the different kind of format of
showing your light bulb also giving you
my thoughts on them i love so many of
these products especially the macro
photo let me know if you've tried any of
these products that mentioned and what
you think of them
and thank you so much for watching I'll
see you in my next video bye hi today

drugstore makeup starter kit I did a
