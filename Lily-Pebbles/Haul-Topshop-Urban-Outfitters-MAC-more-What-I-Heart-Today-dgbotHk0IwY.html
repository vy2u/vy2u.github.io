video and most of it is fashion there's
a couple of beauty bits I don't know why
I did this to myself last weekend I was
just in a really funny mood I was quite
upset and just feeling a bit depressed
and I don't know and I just really felt
like shopping and rich didn't stop me
which didn't help and yeah i just went
bit crazy but i did have quite a few
vouchers from my birthday left over so i
wanted to spend them i wanted to wait
till the sales kind of over and because
i hate shopping in sales and so I went
to spend this sorry if I'm distracted
but it's snowing outside this is so
exciting and the windows behind the
camera and I can just see the snow and
it's very exciting anyway I'm going to
start with the beauty bits because I
know it's probably the bit of you guys
looking forward to seeing because the
most of it is fashion stuff and the
first thing is this from Laura Mercier
and I was with flair Zoe Louise and Anna
and we were in Harrods and I completely
blame Fleur for this purchase because
when she came to meet us she said oh my
god have you guys seen the laura mercier
sale so we all went straight there and
basically the hair Estelle is amazing
because even that or when it's kind of
the end of the sales it's so neat and
tidy and every counter has there in a
little sales section so it's really nice
to have to go to one big like crazy
sales section you just go to the counter
you want and see what they've got and I
bought this set and it was half price so
it was originally 50 and I got up to 25
pounds and the Laura's secrets vol 4 and
inside it's called the illuminated
golden go and inside it has the
foundation primer the radiance one and
tinted moisturizer in a very dark color
so it's one you kind of mix your
foundation to get a darker color and
then there's a palette which has a cream
bronzer a cream blusher and a cream
highlighter and there's a powder bronzer
and I think this is amazing for 25
pounds I mean I didn't need I don't
probably won't use the tinted
moisturizer is very dark and I probably
won't use the cream bronzer but I really
wanted the radiant primer and I think
just for that I think that alone is more
than
five pounds for the big size and I
really like the bronzer blush and
highlight Allison that's a really good
set and actually really glad I got that
I was kind of almond and re but being
surrounded by all those girls they
convinced me to get it and I'm happy I
did I think that's really nice but my
second kind of beauty purchase after I
did my mac lipstick video which are
linked below a lot of you commented
saying that I don't like the majority of
my lipsticks was just true I've just
kind of been honest and showing my
collection but a lot then my god when I
was younger and I regret buying a lot of
them because they just don't suit me but
I listened to all of your
recommendations and I went to try few I
wanted to kind of made my collection
more of like colors i can actually wear
and you guys recommended me loads of
lipsticks thank you for that and i went
to try someone ends up getting too and i
got rebel which is a satin finish and
its really well it looks really dark
kind of berry in the bullet but it's
actually kind of a fuchsia pink color
and i wanted to get one that was a bit
more daring but one that was to actually
sue me and I do like this one and then I
got craving which isn't amplified and
it's one of those kind of your lips but
better colors just really natural and I
really really like so I've been wearing
this one a lot I always go for them all
kind of everyday colors but I wanted to
get a more daring one as well and i'm
glad i got this and it's nice for kind
of throwing out so happy with those to
the next couple of things i got our
beauty magazines and i want to start
kind of reading more at night instead of
looking at my computer so i bought these
to keep on my bedside table and i
haven't actually read them yet but I'm
excited too and the first one is
suitcase magazine and this is a
quarterly magazine so it's kind of
really thick and really good quality it
like a books definitely want to keep I
mean it's a travel magazine with all
kind of different bits and bobs and
they've got a really good beauty section
and it's written by Amelia eliana who
writes Leon a beauty blog is a friend of
mine so I bought it to support her but
also going really want to read it so
excited to read that and then I also
bought the cosmopolitan beauty magazine
and these two magazines are both kind of
quite hard to find I went to Selfridges
magazine department
it's amazing they have all the kind of
niche magazines and them everything they
have magazines from all around the world
so you can buy up America's and learn
magazine there as well so yeah this is
cosmopolitan at beauty magazines there's
a whole magazine about unity which is
just heaven in a book and I'm really
excited to read this as well I literally
haven't even looked at either of these
two yet so excited to get stuck in okay
now everything else from here on is a
fashion stuff the first thing in a
bikini you guys to know I'm going away
and I have two bikinis I really like I
just oh don't even get me started about
bikinis I find it impossible its fire
bikinis I am kind of smaller at the
bottom and I have quite big boobs so I'm
like completely different sizes I'm like
a 10 on the bottom and a 16 on top which
is just in places like Topshop only sell
sets I think they're starting to do
separates now but a lot of places just
sell sets which just makes me furious no
one has the perfect body if they do i'm
jealous of you but yeah basically really
annoyed and find it really hard to get
bikinis that are kind of supportive but
still it nice and actually the only
place i really find them are marks of
Spencer's which i don't really shop at
malls are so close but I think I bikinis
are really good and I found the perfect
bikini last year I bought it every color
which is only two but I'm going over two
weeks so I really need more than two
bikinis so I bought this one from M&amp;amp;S as
well it's not the same shape as the one
I like and i think the print is pretty
very subtly it's kind of turquoise of
green light and i will print it's really
on me and i have website if I like or
not but I don't really care as long I
just need a bikini that fits me and so
that's the top it's just kind of like a
toy thing and the bottoms but like that
with ties which is again I don't really
like ties I felt like they cut in and
make you look bigger than your iPhone's
just elasticated but whatever I'm just
on holiday rich I don't see anyone I
know and I guess
bikini so that's fine that I'll do next
couple of things at bags and it's both
from urban outfitters the first 1i
ordered online in the sale and it is a
rucksack and it looks like this so it
has like browser straps and it's got
like this feather print on it with kind
of brown leather details I don't worry
oxide I have a Warner upset since I was
in like primary school but i am going to
thailand and i'm going to be island
hopping and getting on boats and I've
been before and I remember that it's not
the sort of thing you want to be
carrying like a nice essaouira black
leather handbag or anything like that
jumping on off boats I just I don't
think a handbag would work so i bought
walk second i'm going to use this for my
hand luggage on the plane and the music
kind of women island hopping and just
put everything in there it's easy and me
as I can carry my suitcase whilst
carrying my handbag and I don't care if
I look geeky I think it could look
cooler there actually I'm going to try
and rock it but yeah that was I don't
know it says originally 48 pounds i
think i got it flat 20 or 25 pounds i
think that's 25 and yeah it's just
really useful and i'll definitely keep
it off the holiday if i ever need a
rucksack again and then I got another
bag as well and this bag I have been
looking at for ages I loved it when I
was full price Barbara from the Persian
babe got it and then I really wanted it
and then debs my friend got it and she
got it in a sale for 25 pounds and
whenever she gets something I'm like
often I really want it you all know Dez
from couple of videos back by the way
thank you so much for nice comments on
that video she is so happy it's like the
first thing like this she's ever done
she's like wow I've want to be so nice
so thank you um yeah I went to get this
bag it actually went down to 20 pounds
when i went to get it i'm so happy i got
it before it sold out it looks like this
it's black kind of fake leather and it
has them silver studs on the front and
loads of zips and like three
compartments and it has a long strap
which i really like because a lot of my
bags at the moment that kind of the
shoulder ones or the hold on your arms
haven't really got any nice ones that
has the long strap so I'm really happy
with this and I really like the size
it's just quite different to other
handbags I have and twenty pounds it was
a bargain I think yeah originally it was
48 pounds at my god of 20 so I'm really
really happy with that so just very glad
I got that in yellow and then I went hmm
and whenever I go into hm I always try
and remember to get best stops because i
wear these under everything I don't know
why I think might be like the security
of having something tights underneath my
top so like when I've been down you'll
be able to see down my top I just always
wear a vest top so i just bought a white
one and a black one and I think Henny I
call it Hennings by the way I know
people have pointed out in the past that
I sound weird but I don't know I just
call it her knees and instead of hmm so
yeah I by there like three pounds so
best place to buy the stops i think and
then while I was in there I also wanted
to get kind of a basic black jumper
because when I wear shirts sometimes I
like to wear jumpers on top or sweaters
and i already have any plain ones i've
got like a bright orange and they're all
kind of statement jumpers so i just
wanted to get a plain one I didn't want
to spend a lot on it so this one was
like ten pounds i think from pennies and
yes just call you Betsy was just the
basic black jumper and it's got a little
pocket on the front as well so it really
easy and it's a little bit cropped it's
just nice for wearing overshirt
something okay now on to the topshop
stuff which is the biggest because i had
vouchers and stuff i got this huge bag
and it's actually a top man bag I always
pay in top man because there's always a
smaller queue at the till they're just a
little tip top shop so the first thing
some new jeans these are the Lee jeans
I'm always talking about and someone
commented my last video saying wow how
to leave veggies look pretty love I'm 57
so yeah I by size 32 length which
actually a little bit short for me i
could buy 34 but then they kind of bunch
up at the bottom and I don't like that
so I'm probably 33 length but I by 32
and yeah I love these jeans the only
problem is they do stretch a lot which
means i am having to
the newly purchased them but I prefer to
buy a pair of 38 power jeans more
frequently then buy more expensive ones
i went out jeans shopping with rich last
week and the genes that he liked were
130 pounds so i'm happy that we have
topshop lucky girls and yeah i really
like these ladies they're just the
normal denim ones because mine is so
baggy and I bought them a size small at
this time as well because they do
stretch so the first couple of weeks of
wearing them is quite painful but they
stretch and then they're perfect next
are a couple of my favorite tops that I
mentioned in that video with Deb's as
well and they're the ones i have like
tight arms and then they're loose fit
either i got one in cream though they
have like tight this little arms and
then a really loose and longer in the
back and I got it a cream which i really
like these tops just remind me of
something you can get you to get in
cause and but it was so expensive it
costs so i really like just kind of
having loads of these tops i find them
really good for layering as well so i
got one in cream and i got one in orange
it's like an orange you read I haven't
quite decided if I like this yet I need
to try it on but these tops are 18
pounds which i think is all right and
they're just so comfortable when I
always wear desktops underneath is the
next thing okay I think you need your
sunglasses for this one ready it's
literally the brightest jumper in the
world i love it i love this color i have
a gap jumper with this kind of electric
blue and you guys always complement up
me on it when I wear it and I just
absolutely love this color and this is a
big knitted jumper and so it's quite big
method sleeves and it kind of did if you
can see but it's huge i bought it in a
10 I'm normally kind of a 12 so I bought
it a bit smaller um I don't usually buy
knitwear from Topshop I think it's very
overpriced this was thirty-six pounds
which to me is a lot of money I would
not spend that if I wasn't in such a way
of mood that day and is a lot of money
but I think it's worth in this case
because it's such a unique color and I
just love this color and I'm so excited
to wear it and I think it's nice to wear
I have a lot of black coat and black
jackets and I think it's nice to wear
some this under black because it really
kind of hate
saying like pop of color that does kind
of pop out and if you wear this with
black jeans and everything an asset you
know we need to think about the outfit
too much because this is kind of a
statement piece I really really love the
color I'm very glad i got this so i saw
yesterday they have a cropped version of
it as well if you prefer kind of less
big jumpers and more cropped and then
the final thing is this kind of t-shirt
dress which i thought was quite
different actually this was 18 pounds so
bit more sensitive than the tops and
it's basically quite thin hard material
you're not really going to say it's
black but it's got t-shirts leaves i'll
probably roll those up and then it's
just really long and it hasn't got any
kind of fit to it it's just kind of
loose and just goes to like thigh and i
think this is quite cool because i think
you could make it look quite expensive
if you are with nice tights and boots
you can like put a belt on it and any
kind of belt really or I might wear it
just kind of loose because I think it's
nice when you like loose tops and we're
like tights or something like that and I
just think if you play around with it it
could be quite cool and I tried it on
and really liked it so I'm happy I got
that a bit differentially um not very
top shop so i really like that and i
think that's everything so i went a bit
crazy but i'm really happy and excited
to like have all these clothes i don't
really do that sometimes when i'm in the
mood for shopping I go and browse and
never find anything which is a bit
annoying but this is one of those days
where I found a lot of things I like and
you know oh well I'm just going to not
look at my bank balance and not get
upset about it I'm happy I needed most
of those things and ya know much I've
been out until Thailand and because I
probably come back like a different size
last time I went away I came back a lot
thinner and I'll have a tan hopefully so
maybe I could start wearing more summery
clothes although it's still snowing
outside so that's unlikely so yeah thank
you for watching let me know what your
favorite thing is from everything in the
later showed you that would be nice and
comment on the video and let me know and
i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
