favorite high street drugstore products
I've got quite a lot I didn't actually
think that I would but when I started
gave our room picking things and I ended
up with quite a lot so I'll start going
through them now
so for lips I've got a few different
products that I really like from I'm
just gonna say drugstore we say we don't
really have a word for it in the UK but
I think most people call it drugstore
meanie we do you have boots and
Superdrug so the first thing is the
collection mm or they're now called
collection and cream puffs I got this
about a year ago and it's like a matte
lip gloss it smells amazing it's really
nice really easy to wear and really good
for the price so that's the cream puffs
and this is in the color fairy cake
number three it's quite a nice like
Coralie color
um I've recently discovered and I wrote
a blog post on it as well the Kate Moss
Rimmel lip sticks and I never really
thought about buying them before because
I just always think that cheap lipsticks
are always gonna look a bit cakey but
this is sorry this is number five I
tried it and really really liked it I
think they're really nice of
moisturizing and look really good on and
so I think I'd say this is probably my
favorite drugstore lipstick and this is
the Kate Moss one in number five and I
think I've got number eight as well and
they're really nice I'll put the blog
review they did below MUA do lipsticks
and I think they're a pound which is
crazy and for a pound they're really
good quality this one I've got is number
11 they're not like amazing but for the
price they're amazing
I'm really reasonable um
anyone can go get them I think they're
really good for how much they are
another one is sort of a new one the
l'oreal rouge caress they're sort of
lipstick lip balms a bit like Revlon lip
butters and this is
dating Coral link dating car through
coral 301 and it's so nice I'm wearing
this now I wear it all the time it's
really really moisturizing it's like a
lip balm with quite a strong color I
think this is really really nice and one
of the bests of lip products on the
market at the moment
and then the final lip product is from
soap &amp;amp; Glory it's the agree to kiss her
lip moisture balm and this is impeach I
think when I got it they only had peach
but now they've got coconut and
something another flavor as well but
this is amazing it literally smells like
those peach sweets you get from the
corner shop which I like my favorite
it's amazing really really nice yummy
lip balm I really like soap &amp;amp; Glory
products actually so there's something
else I've got in this video from there
as well
so yeah that's the great kisser lip balm
from soap &amp;amp; Glory so those are all my
lip products brushes of course I think
you all know what we're gonna say it's
the Real Techniques brushes I have the
cool collection the blusher brush and
the stippling brush and I absolutely
love them they are probably the best
brushes you can get on the high street
I'd say these are made by Sarah Chapman
from pixie loos and I'll put the link
below I highly highly recommend these
brushes I think they're really amazing
especially the buffing brush which I use
every day for foundation and it's like
changed my life probably by ever used to
use those paint brush brushes so yeah
those are the best brushes on the high
street in my opinion for the face I've
got a few things most my skincare
products are high end but the one
skincare product that I do use from the
high street is the oil a term natural
repair face cream which is a moisturizer
and I think this is so good it's really
cheap and easy to get and it clearly
does the job it's really good for using
in the morning under makeup because it's
quite light and it's not scented it's
good for sensitive skin really good I
just like whenever I find them I just
stuck up on them probably got like three
at the moment I always end up go back to
this one in between sort of trying
different high-end moisturizers so
that's oil a term national
natural repair face cream the good
foundation from the high street is the
Bourjois healthy mix serum I have
actually tried for the healthy mix
foundation I've just tried the serum but
it's really good I mean I think
bourgeois is made in the same sort of
factory as Chanel so I always think the
quality of Portia was quite good and
this is just a really nice moisturizing
foundation it is quite sort of jewy so
if you've got all your skin it might not
be great
I do sometimes have to use a bit of
powder with it but I think it's a really
nice summer foundation and I also really
like the bottle it's really kind of easy
to store and it's not that big so yeah I
used where the shade 53 well I did I
haven't used this for a while it might
be too dark for me but that was the
shadows using last summer for concealer
it's everybody's favorite collection mm
or collection perfecting concealer
currently remember exactly what it's
called but I wear shade an umber 3
medium and it's just like this all the
writings rubbed off I tried this quite a
few times in the store in Boots and
every because everyone was talking about
it this is put it right here ago every
time I tried it I thought it looks
really cakey really thick I thought it
was horrible but when you use on your
face some reasons I've completely
different products and so I just it
comes in like an applicator like this
and I just sort of dab it on where I
need it and then use a fluffy brush to
blend it in and it gives a really nice
natural finish but it's it's quite it's
good coverage so if on like a day like
today I'm going BB cream today so it's
really it's like a tinted moisturizer
and not much coverage I can then go on
with this and sort of put bit more
coverage where I need it and it works
amazingly I just this is something
that's quite hard to get hold on every
time I see them they don't really have
many in stock but so when I see them I
get for you and I think it's really good
concealer for eyes I've got a few things
here and something I really love is this
I shadow palette from the look Beauty
it's called the triple hit and this is
la Luke's
la luxe
I don't know how to say that and it's
like this it's got three eyeshadow
shades in it sort of taupe it was sort
of a light shimmery color a darker taupe
and then a gold and these are just so so
useful sometimes I mix them together and
put them all over the lid or use the
sort of the light shimmer and then the
darker taupe in the outer crease and
this is really good for traveling it's
kind of got everything you need well for
me I really like to add sort of neutral
colors of my eye so this is really good
and the eye shadows a really good
quality as well so that's good I think
you can get look beauty from the
Superdrug it's not everywhere yet but
I've seen it definitely in a few super
drugs my favourite high street mascara
is the bourgeois volumizer I've never
really been into like gadget mascara
before and the whole like 2-step thing
did put me off but I tried it and it's
amazing so the first step is the sort of
thin brush and then you put it back in
and you undo the second step and it's
like a much fatter thicker brush full of
like product so the first one really
separates your eyelashes and defines
them and then the second one just puts
loads of volume in and I think it works
really well on my eyelashes I really
like it it's probably actually one of my
favourite it's probably one of my
favorite mascaras like even comparing it
to high end mascara so I think it's
really really good and I always
recommend mr. friends when they ask
which mascara is again my favorite
eyeliner is the soap &amp;amp; Glory super
Katriona all the writings rocked off of
this but it's like felt tip eyeliner and
I find these really easy to use I've had
really mixed reviews some people hate
using these kind of eyeliners but I much
prefer them I'm not very I have really
bad eyesight so when it comes to putting
on eyeliner and he's like really easy
and not too fiddly and I like this one
because the the pen bit is quite stiff
so it's really easy to draw on it lasts
all day it goes on really really black
and it's really reasonably priced so
that's the soap &amp;amp; Glory super cat liner
and I really really like that
the final eye product
is something everyone's been talking
about recently the Maybelline Color
tattoo 24 hour color 24-hour tattoo I
don't actually know what the real name
for this is it's too long but it looks
like this and this is the back to bronze
nope it's not it's called the on and on
bottoms
it's really good cream eyeshadow it
looks like this I use a brush to apply
this instead of my finger because I find
it less messy and it's so good it lasts
all day
I love Waring's for work because I don't
have to reapply my makeup and talk to
you in the day it lasts amazingly like
all day it's really nice like bronzy
color it's really flattering and I think
it's really really good quality for high
streets I shadowed the last few things
are nail products I really like Topshop
nail polish I don't actually buy them as
much as I should because I do think
they're really good I think because when
I'm in Topshop I'm too busy buying
clothes to notice the nail polish but my
favorite one is pool party which I think
I've shown before in my nail polish
video and I'm wearing this now I always
get so many compliments on it it's just
a really nice blue aqua sort of swimming
pool color it's really really nice and I
use this all the time and another good
sort Brown for nail polishes bourgeois I
haven't actually got that many ever only
got three but I really really love this
one it's number 14 and it's sort of a
nice sparkly purpley green color really
like that so I think that polish is a
really good quality actually in lasts
really well and another thing from Boris
off to go with this is the one second of
nail polish remover which is just the
most incredible thing I think it's
pretty the favorite my favorite thing I
found this year it's a pot with soft
foam inside but I think I sort of soaked
in nail polish remover so you just stick
your finger in and it removes your nail
push in a second it's amazing someone
like me who paints their nails of every
other day this just makes everything so
much quicker and less time-consuming and
it's it doesn't feel bad for your nails
at all I think it's actually good for
your nails it's got loads of oils and
stuff in
so whenever I sort of took my finger out
and my nail pushes gone it's always
feels really nice and soft afterwards
and I think this is great it's only like
I think there's like 399 or something so
it really reasonable and it's just made
such a difference when it comes to
painting my nails so that's everything
and I hope you liked scenes of my
favorite high street drugstore products
let me know what you think if you have
any recommendations of products you
think I'd like and thanks for watching
