tutorial how I do my makeup video my one
of my best friends had her 25th birthday
recently and she wanted a Hollywood glam
theme and she told us we had to came
come as Hollywood glam so I didn't have
most amazing clothes to wear so I
thought I'd do like a makeup thing and I
ended up going with this look which is
kind of flawless skin quite subtle
shading on the eyes black liquid liner
and then a bold red lip so I thought
show you what i did on the night and i
tried to kind of replicate exactly what
i did on my nails before i get started
it's kind of black sparkly and i have
used these two polishes leighton denny
man-eater which is just black it's
really nice and glossy and then at
topshop Panther which is from the new
dark side of nude collection and this is
a really nice black and silver Sparkle
so that's why I've got my nails in case
you're wondering and yeah I'm gonna get
started with the makeup tutorial so I
really hope you enjoy it okay I'm gonna
start by just clipping my hair back so
it's out of my face I've already
moisturized i'm using my emory release
because I'm trying to finish it and then
finished I'm going to use my nas pore
refining primer which is the oil-free
one again I really like this one just
put it all over it's really easy to
spread which I like it was really
important to use a primer for this kind
of look or for me is because when I go
on a night out I really want the makeup
to last I tend to get ready quite early
for a night out as well so kind of has
to last from like eight o'clock or half
seven to like I don't know like two or
something so primer is a must and then
for this look I used the YSL the teint
touche Clair foundation because this has
no SPF in it and for those of you who
don't know an SPF causes flashback which
means people take photos of you use in a
flash it kind of flushed back and you
end up with a white pale ghost face so
it's important to use a moisturizer with
no SP
and it's been a foundation with no SPF
if he thinks give me like flash
photography so I also really like this
foundation and it's kind of bit heavier
than the rest that I use so I'm just
going to put a bit and then I'm actually
use my hands to rub it in first because
I just feel like hands work best with
this kind of gel foundation so he's my
hands to spread it all over my face I
really like this foundations well gives
really nice like flawless finish so
here's my hands and then I use a brush
to blend out I just bought this one it's
the Real Techniques expert face brush I
didn't need it but I wanted to try it
it's kind of like the buffing brush but
just slightly different shape so I use
this to just blend the edges sometimes I
take a little bit more just on the bits
i think you need a little bit more
coverage this is a really nice brush
it's really soft actually ok so now my
base is done i'm going to do concealer
and again like i always use the same
concealer because once you find one that
works for you just keep using it ready
so we use a bobby brown corrector in a
light bisque for my dark circles and
just apply that under my eyes and put it
up into the inner corner as well if i
get quite dark there and then just use a
mac 224 to blend that out I'm then going
to use my origins plant scription
concealer in 02 and just that use that
under my eyes around my nose on my chin
of them just blend out the same brush
with this look just make sure
everything's really blended properly
because i want to have really sort of
smooth looking flawless skin and then if
you feel like you need any more what I
do is I look down and then you can see
the shadows if you look down into the
mirror you can see where you need a bit
more coverage that's my little tip for
under-eye concealer so I'm going to use
a powder today because if it's for a
night out again like I just want it to
last so I'm going to use the Rimmel stay
matte powder in 001 transparent and
first of all I'm going to use this which
is another new Real Techniques brush and
this is the setting brush so I'm going
to use this to set under my eyes so I
just take a bit of the powder on this
brush and then just dust it lightly
under my eyes this will just make my
concealer it will just set the concealer
and make it last and then I'm going to
use my big job at japonesque powder
brush number 333 take the same powder
and just powder the areas i think my
makeup will disappear from first so my
head nose chin mainly gun center of the
face I haven't taken much I don't adore
to look powdery now as I said in my last
video i do my face first I don't know
why if highlighter now and I'm going to
use the Jemma Kidd cheery glow all over
radiance cream in 02 rose gold which is
just one of my favorites highlighters to
cream highlighter it looks like this as
the name suggests really pretty rose
gold and I just find this gives the most
natural glow so I just push my finger
around like that and then I'm just going
to put it on the on my high tops of my
cheekbones and just sort of press it in
and although it's not going to come out
on camera it is quite subtle actually
but it just kind of catches the light
and was going to put a little bit
my nose on my Cupid's bow and a little
bit under my brows so now i'm going to
use bronzer and i'm using my NARS Laguna
it looks like this and a real techniques
blush brush I'm not going to too much
bronzer but I always feel like I need a
little bit just to sort of define my
face a bit again just the contours of my
cheek up to my temples a little bit down
just to blend it and that's kind of
enough for this look for blusher i'm
going to use nas deepthroat very rude
name but this is a really nice kind of
peachy pink it's not too much I
obviously there's going to be kind of
black eyeliner and bright lips in this
look so I don't want the cheeks to be
kind of too much i'm using my japonesque
324 blusher brush just been a bit of
that and then just put really quite a
little bit just on my cheekbones just
sort of adds a bit of definition and
just on top of the bronzer so now I look
like I have cheekbones I'm going to take
a bit of coral an eyeshadow primer and
then even though I'm not wearing a lot
of eye shadow in this look it just
really smooths out the skin on my eyes
and just makes it look nice it gives it
a nice Sheen so I'm going to be doing a
black liquid liner but I don't
personally like where I just liquid
liner and nothing else so I'm going to
be using a little bit of shadow as well
actually before I forget I'm going to
use my HD browse and babita just on my
brows this is just a clear brow gel kind
of keeps them in place it seems sort of
go all over the place sometimes so this
is really good just kind of set them in
place and it's not too hard I don't like
it when I broad girls like kind of get
hard so in it for the eyes i'm going to
be using a shadow from my urban decay
naked palette and it's going to be buck
which is this one it's kind of the
darker of the two matte colors and it's
i'm going to use it as a contour color
and i'm going to use a tapered i shadow
brush this is called the small tapered
blending brush II 45 from Sigma just
take a little bit on my brush and kind
of i'm going to put up my hand as well
to make sure i don't have too much and
then i'm just going to put this in the
crease and slightly underneath just I
don't want it to look too much but just
kind of add a bit just put it in the
crease you keep your eyes open while you
do this you can see where the creases
and then what's it going to take a
little bit of that same color but
underneath I just because I quite liked
having with eyeshadow under though
so I think this balances a little bit if
you've got liquid liner it doesn't make
it like top-heavy so when you're done
with that just kind of tilt your head
back look in the mirror and just make
sure the eyes are completely blended
because you know you're not going to be
have your eyes open the whole night you
will kind of close your eyes you want to
make sure it looks tidy so I just tilt
my head back so I can see and that's
kind of I shadowed done really so then
I'm going to take my bobby brown
long-wear eye pencil in black and I'm
going to put this this isn't going to
look for if dude there's no way of doing
this looking good I'm going to put it in
the top inside of my lash line what's
that cool like tight line or something
like that okay so I'm just gonna I know
I've already done my shadow for isha
tons first but i'm going to lift my eye
art from the brown and just put this
eyeliner in here what this does it just
kind of adds more black to my lashes so
it kind of just makes them look thicker
and fuller this is a really nice I line
to do it with because it's really soft
it doesn't scratch your I tool and now
i'm going to do my liquid liner which is
always the hard bit to do camera when
you can't see anything i'm going to use
the soap and glory super cat and liquid
line and this is my favorite liquid
eyeliner i'm going to try and do one eye
on camera by my have to do the other one
off camera
so I start by just doing a really basic
line across my lash line I find it
easier once i have that to work from
there so once you have like just a line
across I'm going to try and wing it out
a little bit but not too drastically but
I'm basically going to just follow the
line
I'm just going to neaten it up and kind
of put more of a points to the end of
where it wings out so that's the kind of
look I'm going for just it's kind of
really simple just follows around the
eye and flicks up a bit early and
nothing too drastic but kind of pretty
black liner so that's both eyes done
with the liquid liner I'm now going to
use a mascara today I'm going to use the
Avon super shock max mascara and this
has a really fat brush and you can get
really thick lashes with it so I'm just
going to put this at the top I don't
wear fake lashes false lashes and it's
just a thing I just don't like them I'm
sure they look really nice oh they look
like this i just find them a bit creepy
so i just don't wear them so i'm just
going to use this it's not my favorite
mascara all time but quite like using it
sometimes and once the top lashes are
done i'm actually going to use a little
bit of their bobbi brown long-wear
intensified mascara on the bottom lashes
just to get a quiet out a little bit
just make it look a little bit more glam
just a tiny bit this is a really cute
mascara it's got a tiny tiny wand and
it's really good for bottom lashes it
doesn't smudge and then that's kind of
everything apart from the lips the lips
are the final thing and this is kind of
what makes the look really everything
else is very simple which is what I like
one where in a bold lip so I'm going to
do red lip and I'm going to be using Mac
cherry lip liner and the clinique chubby
stick intense in 03 mightiest maraschino
so first of all with the mac cherry lip
liner I actually when i did this look a
few hours before I moisturized my lips
with some lip balm I haven't done that
today so hopefully it'll be okay but
normally one over like a bold lip I make
sure my lips and really moisturized
first so I'm going to take this lip
liner and just kind of roughly line my
lips and just because it makes easier
chubby sticks really
kind of baked as I'm sure you know so
it's quite a nice to get use this sort
of define the lips first I rest my
little finger rich in and that's like a
typical not about is how I do
make the line quite thick so it's easier
with the chubby stick and for the top
bitch little bit more fiddling
just take your time with this that's
what I find works the best don't feel
rushed so once you've done that outline
with the red lip liner and then going to
use the clinique chubby stick intent
which the new ones which have much more
intense color and it's really nice if
you'll see you'll see so you can see how
amazing this color is and because we've
done the lip liner it's kind of really
easy to use there's not much space to
fill in and then once you've done that
you can kind of see if there's any bits
on the edges you need to fill in and
then that's the lips done the most
important step for the lips is put your
finger in your mouth so that you don't
get lipstick on your teeth like that and
then you can see the bits that come off
on your finger so that's kind of the
finished makeup look I'm really simple
as i said the lips are kind of the main
focus but i also i've had my hair in
like a rough kind of platinum sorts my
very Hollywood glam I'm not really a
hair person but I think I kind of
remember i curled list bit of my hair so
I'm just going to use my ghd
straighteners and just basically take
bits of hair and just kind of 12
straight those kind of gives a bit of a
column and I don't want to lick drastic
it just kind of wanted a bit of movement
in there and that kind of gives a little
bit of curl and then you just kind of
pin these bits up where you want really
so I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you
like seeing the technique intense in
action because it's amazing so let me
know what you think of this look and I
hope you enjoyed it thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
