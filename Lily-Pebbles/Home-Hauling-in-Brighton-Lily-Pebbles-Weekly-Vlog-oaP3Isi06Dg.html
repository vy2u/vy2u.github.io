this morning because Anna's videos go up
at 9:00 on a Wednesday morning so I
always think it's worth having that a
little bit extra time in bed watch our
video and then get up so I did that and
now I need to get on with my day
darkness in our fridge it's an organic
apple and blackberry crumble
I think it's Daylesford so I'm gonna try
some of this for breakfast even though
it then to be a dessert really yummy
crumble I'm just sitting and scheduling
the next three days our blog posts up
videos and stuff then I'm gonna start
getting ready cuz I've got a few
meetings today they'll show you quickly
what makeup I am wearing today well
apart from the usual boring stuff but
I'm trying out this palette which is new
for Mac and I really like this this is
the first time they've done 9i shadows
in one palette like this and it's got
cork which is my favorite and I think
I'm using that one that one and that one
and that one and yeah these are really
nice and then lipstick I'm wearing this
one which is from Clarins and it's 7 v
1t rose from their jolly rouge range
which is new it's a nice kind of
everyday nudey pink I'm gonna head into
town a little bit early to do some stuff
and then I've got two meetings and then
I'm meeting up with a friend we actually
have a school reunion tonight which will
be really funny I haven't been back to
my school for nearly 10 years and I'd
not really friends with anyone from
school so it'll be nice to see people

some pretty hungry yummy lunch and I've
got a bit more time for my meeting so

pumped into milli

other it's like I need your face okay I

it a part of the story and it's got the
most amazing prints and stationery I'm
just a bit shocked how amazing that shop
was and people in there were lovely so
I'm gonna go home and go and their
website straight away I'm just heading

looking forward to that here we're going
somewhere breakfast what's the play

think of the word that I'm thinking
about exotic the keyboard each team has
a show
I forgot to vlog my breakfast because I
was too hungry but wait let me get up
the photo on my phone that's what it
looked like
avocado on toast tomatoes a poached egg
and bacon and it was delicious
YUM this cafe has like amazing interior

go have a look before is paid for
breakfast Anna and I are both getting a
little trio of succulents because these

doing like a home interior bright and
tall forgive me Anna officer both areas
are no materials at the moment so we're
going to I just went a little bit wild
is facing cakes I haven't been to one
for a while
richer than the size of the bag oh my
god I think when I get back in the car
I'll do a lot mini cool for you guys
Anna's purposely lost the boyfriend so
that we've been going to I don't know
I'm just going to follow him her to be
honest she said there's a print shop
here and all of the bonus here I'm just
kind of following her lead and when you
want
yeah we're in Oliver bonus and I found
this left I'm think I'm going to get for
my office
pretty in gold really like that we're in
the lanes now we're just going to a
store called abode I'd spent loads of
money and a lot of bonus and some other
shop utility we just went to get some
salads for lunch from Hell's Kitchen and
we're just going to the park I forgot to
vlog saying goodbye to Anna remark but
we're heading home now it's still like
quite early afternoon but we've got to
go out tonight so we're gonna head back
it was so nice staying with them their
new place is amazing and it's nice
seeing them I think I've seen them next
weekend as well it was great we're now
gonna head home I pull the back from the
boots I can't really show you why I
bought but I might do a whole video for
the home stuff I bought I went a bit
crazy cuz there's so many things that we
need but I think I got some good stuff
and I'll show you what i got from space
and k when i get home so now long
journey home
we are home and I think I've decided I'm
going to haul video for all the other
homie things that I caught but I'll
quickly do like a space thing hey ho I
got quite a few things for my mum she's
like a regular user of quite a few
spaces hey product so she sent me a list
saying please get these from me I
haven't got time to pop out someday
Riley good genes she loves this stuff
Oh skier I wonder which is like that eye
cream I really like this as well and
then the Sarah Chapman day cream so
those three it from my mom I got the
ESOP hand balm and the hand wash for our
new bathroom because I want to have a
nice hand wash and these are these last
so long because they're huge so I
already like those I further exfoliating
one but I didn't have that and oh is
that all oh my god I know I got an all
Bay dry texturizing spray and the
original one comes in a box and then
there was this one as well which has
pink all over it so I asked what the
difference was and apparently this one
is a limited edition kind of breast
cancer one so I picked up this one I'm
guessing some of the proceeds go to
breast cancer care and it's in a pretty
pink bottle and then I got loads of
samples Wow they were like really
generous with their samples these are
the new quarterly moisturizer loads of
those wowza
this is from Eve LOM in its radiance
lift cream there's a couple more cord
leaves in there wow I've got those
samples so that's what I got from
spacing okay now we need to kind of
quickly get ready because we're going
out tonight for our friend Sam's
birthday and we're gonna head to the
flat first and drop off all the stuff
that stuff that we bought and do a few
bits and bobs there we have already
stopped I'm very tired but it'd be nice
to see some friends tonight I've just
kind of curled my hair a bit at
straighteners and leave my new orb a dry
texturizing spray I love getting a new
one I think the big bottles are better
they have more like oomph
and they're mini bottles um so I got a
big one this time I've just kind of
topped up my makeup a bit I'm gonna put
something on my lips I think I'm gonna
do a Mac saw and the MER combination my
fave saw lipliner it's just it's good
when you've got when you don't really
know what's pong because it's somewhere
in between like a bold lip and a nude
lip some reason
is one of the only matte lipsticks that
doesn't drag or cling to my dry patches
on my lips at all
it applies so smoothly probably gonna
blot it down a bit with tissue but if
you can like layer on quite heavy to
make quite like a bold lip I don't
really know what I'm gonna be able to
vlog tonight but we're gonna go get some
food and chill at our friends house
before going out to a bar don't know
where I'm going either should be fun
there might be a bit of like one tarji
stuff tonight because a normal friends
don't really one of them drugs I don't
think actually they do that's a lot but
I found find it awkward filming people

keep forgetting to vlog and that's about
it
