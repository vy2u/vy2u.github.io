sleeping pill last night because the
jetlag is the way around so that I
should be waking up late in the morning
and finding it hard to get to sleep at
night which is kind of what I'm like
normally but I thought I'd better get a
good night's sleep on the first night
home so hopefully the jetlag is not too
bad so I did actually sleep really well
but I woke up really early which is very
odd me so I feel like I should make be
productive with my morning I'm still at
so much John pack I mean look at the
mess there's like almonds everywhere
stuff everywhere so I did saw all of
this out I think rich is working from
home today and I've got a couple of bits
to do and then I'm seeing my friends and
I and I haven't seen them in so long so
I'm really excited for that it needs
straighten my hair I washed it last
night and left it so it's all kinky
so yeah happy to be home and I've got
lots to get on with I've just finished
my la lookbook I took so long to edit
even it's only two minutes long here's a
little preview that will be going up on
Sunday the 9th of August so right you
guys are like that video shirt like hit
and I have to have lunch at like half 10
I'll let you just have pasta off 10 it's
really weird
I'm just doing my makeup though and I'm
using some of the new products I bought
in LA I just used the it cosmetics CC
cream but I like it it's quite like
thick though I'm not sure if I love the
texture I'm also not sure the colors
perfect me it's and shade lights there's
a little bit dark which is weird but do
you like it I'm gonna see how it goes
throughout the day I'm also trying the
Sonia Kashuk clear brow gel and the
applicator you can see it here is like
really long and quite firm which is a
bit different to the Anastasia one and
it's also quite not as wet though so I
do quite like it I'll see how hard it
makes my eyebrows because I don't like
it when they go too crispy
okay I am I already mentioned this but
me and rich hopefully hopefully move
into our own place in these sort of
things take so long though it's been in
the works since February and it's still
not really confirmed - I probably
shouldn't be talking about it but I'm
heading over to our potential new place
now to do some measurements I have my
little handy
measuring tape measuring tape measuring
tape that's what it's good so I'm gonna
head over there now because I have the
keys for the day but I'll tell you guys
properly when it's all kind of confirmed
and happening and backside same very
grown-up
they although I still feel really weird
and spaced out
we are heading out tonight we have the
lovely people at Tom's kitchen are
putting it on like a little evening
event for me and my five friends well
that's it rich if I'm going to enrich as
a friend okay we'll be friends so rich
Gemma Byrne este Rubio or going for this
dinner at Toms kitchen in Canary Wharf
and I think we're gonna like sit in the
kitchen get involved to some of the
cooking and it sounds so fun and I've
eaten at Tom's kitchen before I really
like it but this should be a full-on
experience and rich quickly before we go
if you need to share more what I'm
wearing photos I just whacked on
whatever was pleased when I heard the
dirty but I kind of kind of like this on
song don't come around maestra three of
Scotland bagged this like a moon
everything that I bought last year from
Topshop Topshop cami black jeans and
office sandals and I'm feeling like
definitely dressed for LA and not London
for oh well crash top voyage sleep so
thought I would sorry gum in my mouth
so I tell you what lipstick I'm wearing
because if you saw my drugs don't fall
with
I report the Loreal and lack lipsticks
instead of the Labatt ones but this one
which is shade 209 took a really nice
mood I still got my lips yeah I really
like this I don't think I will like
Redrum I haven't tried it yet so Mike
you were in Canary Wharf now which is
just like a concrete jungle where she's
gonna Park in Rich's office if he works
fine here I just hit this photo of the
moody sky I obviously like Phil fit into
death on Instagram but I love like
putting the structure up high when
there's clouds I mean he looked so
pristine
say Tom's kitchen each course of your
dinner will be a surprise no menus
needed weird reset back love team of
chefs do the hard work so this is ice
thank you my taste see my new of the
week if I win it in LA to taste the
kitchen we have seven courses of likes
of mine it's also got a thing that said
we have to guess what the ingredients
are from the starter remain in the
person who wins in the sign cookbook
feel like Gemma's gonna win she's
already good with food
so we just met rich the chef and he told
us about looks like booze booze it's
like it makes your mouth
so you may design ricotta he doesn't st.
hard I won't try repeated but it looks
delish dig in dig in like nice little
like Crisco babe I think everyone's
pretty excited here
so we're not allowed to know what this
is we're just eating and guessing like
Gemma's like writing away like teacher's
pet gosh seems the think she really like
okay oh right yeah okay
this is round two you main course go any
guesses yeah oh no that is not allowed
definitely what lab like dark we've all
hands it in our sheets and we're
desperate to know what meets it was this
really some of us really know we're now
heading into the kitchen to chicken
mushrooms yeah there's bears right what
mushrooms that was dark I got that
right it was really good
we had such a nice evening that was
really lovely did you guys have a nice
time for my things uh yeah good Rob rich
nice time good time pad by old now to
head home for a good good morning today
is mainly a stay at home and do some
work day I was out yesterday here my
face-i without yesterday afternoon so I
need to do a bit of filming today
filming a very exciting announcement
video which I think should have gone up
by now I won't say just in case it
hasn't but I think it went up yesterday
so go and check that out if it's already
up and I'm gonna film a first
impressions video that's going up on
Thursday then I'm gonna edit both of
those and I'm gonna do some blog posts
and tonight I'm going out so I'm gonna
vlog today it's really not an
interesting day to vlog but I'm going
back to Suffolk for the weekend which is
a riches from for his sister's birthday
and I won't really want to vlog that so
today is kind of the only other day to
vlog this week hasn't been the most
exciting week but I know you guys don't
really mind okay the first thing I need
to sort out this hair of mine um it's
definitely much easier to straighten in
the morning I've had my Brazilian
blow-dry but I still need to do it cuz
otherwise it looks like let me get it
down for you this is what it looks like
so it's still obviously kinky and like a
little bit frizzy I normally just kind
of straighten it and then put a bit of
curl in it so I'm gonna sit here with my
straighteners and my ipad this is
normally when I watch YouTube videos I
was just watching James Corden take a
break
I love the James Corden YouTube channel
for the Late Late Show and the take a
break segment is just my favorite
hilarious and you just thought up a new
one it was so good I'm gonna stop
filming and I just feel in my bedroom
now I used to kind of worried more about
backdrops and stuff but at the moment
it's not really priority for me I'm just
worried more about not worried but not
concerned thinking more about the
content rather than the background
because I haven't really got any a
particularly nice to film in this house
so I'm just kind of forgetting about
that so I'm gonna do setting up my
camera I'm gonna have like one light
just on the side because I think the the
circle in the eye thing can get a little
bit
and also it means the lights quite close
to your face which I think when with
makeup tutorials can kind of change the
color of the makeup so this is very very
simple old-school setup and I think I'm
just gonna get started just in case
you've ever wondered how the pros do it
it's in tracksuit bottoms using that
dirty washing basket as a table here I
finished video one and I was really fond
of Lee it's like a first impressions
video and I don't do those that often
and it's kind of fun to have no plan and
just talk user now I need to film my
announcement video which I'm probably
just gonna do on this camera I'm really
lonely today I finally got my sight back
since I got back from LA I've just like
wanted to eat pasta at weird times of
the day and so I just went I got some
sushi for Richard from home so that some
behind and my sister who works from here
we all work from like the same house I
got cucumber maki salmon and avocado and
spicy tuna
I'm just editing the first impressions
video that I just filmed I'm wearing my
glasses because I'm really my life
that's terrible
these days at the moment I can't really
see and these are my old glasses so they
probably don't even see me anymore but
they're the ones that are on my desk
okay it's a little bit later now I've
been working all afternoon and I've
actually been quite productive although
I've made a massive mess in my office I
really need to tidy up later but now I'm
going to the Opera I'm going with rich
and my mum my best friend JK probably
seen in my vlogs is a professional opera
singer and he's in a show tonight I
don't know what it is I think it's like
handle I don't really know much about
for only really like opera when he's in
it if I'm honest but he's a countertenor
so he's got a really high voice I think
I once snapchatted him singing everyone
was like what and so that we really fun
I love seen him saying he's not really
in London that often these days so that
would be really nice and it's in town I
think it's at the Royal College of Music
unless I'm gave you all of this wrong
but I'm pretty sure it is like opposite
the Royal Albert Hall just where Irene
my Topshop which I don't want your
nakedness behind Topshop top I made wild
necklace chop shops houses all black
because it really nice Moss it is and
I'm black safe I just saw on Twitter
that it's International Friendship Day
and see it isn't going to see Jake in
his opera I'm even known each other our
whole lives 27 years to me 28 years for
him I just found this post on my phone
and I had to put on Instagram because
it's just so funny why we were in
matching outfits and we have one of
those necklaces it's like a heart slit
down the middle and oh my god both of
our teeth are just terrible I just
realised what I said about the whole 27
years for me 28 years for him thing just
doesn't make sense at all because the
year of that friendship I wasn't alive
so just ignore my stupidity we're gonna
try and go to cop12 Leben a
cuz I love the aubergine tagine
I'm back home now and I've got my cup of
tea and my biscuits so I'm happy and it
was really nice to see Jake in his opera
I mean he's been seen since he was five
so I've seen him in all different kinds
of things and he used to like have like
one line and I'd see the whole thing and
he'd just begin like a tiny bit and this
he was the main part he was like the
king and it was so nice to see him have
such a big part and he had like a really
angry scene that was really good and he
got a huge applause is that the word I'm
thinking off at the end everyone was
like whoo like you definitely got the
biggest ones I was a very proud friend
and yeah he's amazing now all he does so
that was nice although opera is not
really my thing it's nice to see him
sing and I love his voice so that's all
for this vlog I'm gonna leave it here
because as I said I'm going back to
Suffolk this weekend and yeah that's all
I've got
oh yeah I said that like Suffolk's my
home is not yours on Thursday I have a
first impressions video for one of the
products that I bought Wales in LA so
hopefully you guys were like that and
that is all good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
