far away I'm just gonna roll with it
today's video is going to be how to make
a weekly vlog and for the benefit of
having an easy title I've said how to
make a weekly vlog but this is actually
just how I make a weekly vlog obviously
everyone's very different and the most
important thing I think about a vlog is
putting your own personal spin on it and
making it yours so this is just how I do
it and I hope that you can just take a
few tips and advice from this and make
it into your own thing because no one
wants to see all the same vlogs on
YouTube and you may be wondering why I'm
making a video like this and I'm aware
that it will definitely kind of ruin the
magic of a vlog showing you behind the
scenes and how it's all done but I
really like to share these kind of
YouTube tips I feel like I like watching
these kind of videos and if I was just
starting out I'd find them really
helpful and I also like you guys knowing
what happens kind of behind the scenes
and what goes into making a video
especially the vlogs because I feel like
they seem much easier than they are so
I've broken it down into a few
categories and let's start with
equipment so the first thing you're
going to need to make a weekly vlog is a
vlogging camera this is the one I use
this is the canon s120 I've had this for
a couple of years now and there has been
an update the canon g7x i think it's
called but i chose not to get that one
the difference between the upgrade is
the quality in the camera and the fact
that there's a flip screen that flips up
so you can see yourself I definitely was
interested in the quality update I want
the best quality for my video as always
so I love that there's better quality
but because of the flip screen the whole
camera in general is bulkier and I like
to have something really small that I
could put in my pocket if I need to
throw into my handbag and I know that if
it's bulky I won't carry it around with
me or I'll feel like it's a burden I
also don't really like the flip screen
for me I've had no issue with this
camera focusing so I don't feel like I
need to be able to see myself and I also
don't want to be looking at the screen
instead of looking in the lens because I
feel like that's quite annoying when you
watch a video so I really like this
camera it's very small it kind of does
what it needs to do I also have a spare
battery which I bought on Amazon because
the battery does run out quite quickly
especially if you're vlogging all day so
I tend to carry that in my purse just in
case the camera comes with a charger
which is obviously very important if I'm
traveling I always take that with me
and then other than that what you need
is a memory card the one I have in here
which I would recommend is from my
memory and it's a 64 gigabyte that is
huge you probably don't need that much
but I don't like my memory card to get
fill up so I just get a huge one and
then you also need some kind of computer
and editing software I use my Apple
computer either my iMac desktop or my
MacBook Air and I use Final Cut Pro X
but I would definitely recommend
starting with something like iMovie
especially with vlogs you just don't
need anything fancy because all it
really is are sticking your clips
together Final Cut Pro X is about 300
pounds I think for me it was an
investment this is my job and I
purchased it years after starting but I
wouldn't recommend starting with it
because it's just unnecessary my vlogs
are usually somewhere between 10 and 15
minutes long that's not ideal for
YouTube they say that the perfect length
video is like 3 or 4 minutes long if you
want your video to do well on YouTube
all kinds of there's all kinds of like
algorithm things going on but I just
like to kind of do it as long as I have
content for that makes sense so they
normally end up between 10 and 15
minutes
I usually vlog two or three days a week
it's kind of coming down to two because
I'm more chatty in my vlogs now so
they'll just be 25 minutes long if I did
three days it's normally just two days a
week which I think a lot of people don't
realize they feel like because it's a
weekly vlog it they feel like that's
what I did all week but it's just two
days which is kind of crazy and I do
tend to pre pick the days I'll have a
look at my diary the week before and see
oh look I'm out on a Wednesday I'll vlog
that day and then on the weekend me and
Richard go into a festival so I'll vlog
that day that's about as much prep as I
do I don't plan things on purpose to
vlog but I do kind of look at the week
ahead and try and plan which days I'm
going to vlog so I can charge my battery
the night before and just be aware I
feel like I need to get into the mindset
to remember to vlog all day on that day
now as I said I don't plan things on
purpose to vlog but I do try and map out
my day and imagine what it would be like
in a vlog so if I know I've got three
meetings and a dinner I know I'm not
going to be able to vlog during those
meetings so I make sure that I've got
footage of me going to the meetings and
coming out and then I know I'll vlog at
dinner if that makes sense I kind of try
and map out in my head but I feel like
the most important thing in a vlog is to
not miss out huge chunks if I wake up
and say good morning I'm just getting
ready I'm going to
tene and then suddenly it's I'm at
dinner although I know it's really hard
to vlog and that can happen easily I
like to try and fill in all the missing
gaps because I feel like the video flows
better so for me it's important to kind
of create transitions throughout the day
and explain to the camera what you're
doing and where you're going just so the
puzzle fits together it's just a case of
I'm now going here or talking about what
you've just done and how it went
those little kind of talking bits in
between are what links all your clips
together I also try to go by the rule of
a film what I want to use I don't kind
of film that much extra footage because
then when it comes to editing it's much
easier to just kind of clip everything
together so I try and just film what I
want and sometimes throughout the day
I'll look through on my camera and if I
don't like a clip I'll delete it so that
I don't have to do that when I'm editing
that's usually because there's smaller
time for editing my vlogs especially if
I vlog on a weekend
I'll finish blogging on a Sunday night
and then my vlog goes up on Tuesday so I
just have that Monday to edit so I try
and make the process as easy as possible
and make sure I've only got the footage
that I need and want this seems like a
silly thing but how I hold my camera I
feel like it can make quite a difference
it of course depends what camera you
have I don't hold my camera like you
would a normal camera like this one
because the microphone is at the top so
you don't want to cover that with your
finger but also if you hold it like that
it can get quite awkward when you're
kind of moving around so I hold my
camera on either side and that gives so
much movement it means I can switch to
myself switch to someone else move it
around I'm not blocking the microphone
it's a much kind of smoother process
it's the little things and then let's
talk about filler clips and I call them
filler clips because they're the clips
that kind of come in-between the talking
fill some space create a mood kind of
explain where you are create an
atmosphere if you want to speed up your
Clips then I would recommend the best
way to do that is to have a tripod in a
camera but no one's got time for that in
a vlog so just try and get your camera's
still as possible the best ones are when
they're kind of leaning on a on a wall
or on the floor and but I have done them
handheld before just this camera is
really good at like stabilizing so just
hold it really straight and film for a
longer time than you would expect
because then when you speed it up it
will be a shorter clip I really like
those for kind of traveling when you're
in a car or
train station just showing those kind of
sped up clips sped up clips I think that
make sense so I bought this thing from
Amazon for like 10 pounds you can put it
that way and clip your phone in it for
your sat-nav or you can put it that way
and clip your camera in it so then if I
just left it in I can drive and vlog at
the same time safely now filming in
public that's something I got a lot of
questions about on Twitter yes it is
majorly awkward you can kind of dodge it
by only vlogging when you're in the
quieter back street side streets but
sometimes I find a just me to vlog and I
haven't got time to try and find a quiet
spot and on the middle of Oxford Street
you know what my theory is who cares
really yes those people mind look you
think that's weird or they might go home
that evening say how weird is this I saw
this girl walking down the street with a
camera and she was talking to herself
but I feel like if they really knew what
you were doing and they knew that you
were filming a vlog for your YouTube
channel then they probably think it was
quite cool and I think you know go you
if you want a vlog what we're doing is
pretty cool on this YouTube thing and I
feel like you just have to kind of suck
up the embarrassment because it's worth
it I have more commitment to you guys as
viewers than I do to a stranger walking
down the street so I know it's not worth
me having a huge chunk of my vlog
missing or making a bad video just
because that person thought I was weird
so that's what I try and think sometimes
I'm just far too embarrassed and then
I'll just try and do it later but most
of the time I just try and think look
for 10 seconds of embarrassment is worth
it I find when I'm actually talking to
the camera and filming that's not the
embarrassing part is when I stopped
filming put my camera down then suddenly
I just feel like everyone's looking at
me and I just want to go into a shell
but that point I normally kind of leave
the area and go somewhere else
I'm currently sitting alone in Leon
this is example when it would be really
embarrassing but the good thing about
this camera is the microphones really
good so much it doesn't quite quietly
right now and I think you guys probably
hear me really
only one person looks me weird them if
you are filming other people in a vlog
like your friends or family I would
definitely recommend asking their
permission first and you don't want to
kind of bring the mood down just before
filming but I normally say like does
anyone mind being in my vlog I don't
mind if you say no just let me know and
sometimes someone will say yeah I'm a
policeman I don't think I should be in
the vlog and I'll say okay fine and I
just make sure that person on the vlog I
just think being really open and upfront
about it is the best thing if you're
vlogging in shops some places can be a
bit funny about it I feel like you can
kind of get a sense if you walk into a
big shop then you can kind of try and
film a bit if you want and if someone
comes over they'll just say excuse me
please don't film in here and then you
just stop it's fine if I go into a
really small quiet shop and it's more of
like a boutique I'll always ask say
excuse me do you mind if I film a bit
sometimes they'll say note and that's
fine sometimes they'll say yes fine
just ask that's all you can do really
using music for weekly vlogs is really
hard I actually had a musician friend of
mine he kind of wrote five backing
tracks for me to use you've probably
heard them over and over again and I've
already run out of music YouTube does
offer some free music in the back end if
you're a content creator but it's not
great stuff is the music thing is hard
as a whole nother video I just think
it's really important to be yourself
when vlogging there's no point trying to
be happier than you are or trying to
kind of put on a front I think the whole
point of vlogs is to let people in a
little bit and show your true
personality when I started vlogging
everything changed because I feel like
you guys got to know me so much better
than my videos where I'm just sitting
like this and you can't even see my legs
so just really be yourself I think
that's the kind of best advice I can
give but the final thing I am going to
say is switch off when you need to even
if you're doing weekly vlogs if you're
sitting at dinner with your friends I
feel like you can just get a sense of
when it's time to not put the camera on
give yourself some time to just chill
out and not be in the camera because it
can get a bit much I feel like week
you've log in can make you feel like
you're just always in front of the
camera but I think it's important to
have some no camera days as well so I
think those are all of my tips for now
it's hard to imagine myself in your
position and think of the questions you
would want but I did ask on Twitter and
I think I've answered most of them but
if you have any other questions about
creating a weekly vlog leave them below
and I will try answer as many
I can they are some of my favorite
videos to film you're really are putting
your personal life out there but then
again it is just 10 or 15 minutes of a
whole week so it's such a small chunk of
your life it's an interesting thing
anyway I hope this was helpful for you
guys and thank you so much for watching
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
