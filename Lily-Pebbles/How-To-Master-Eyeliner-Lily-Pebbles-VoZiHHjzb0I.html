it feels very weird to be filming even
though you probably didn't even notice
that I went anywhere because I pre
filmed all my videos but I am back now
and today I'm gonna be doing the video
all about eyeliners I absolutely love
eyeliner I think I wear it pretty much
every single day so I've got a lot to
talk about because I haven't filmed for
a week I feel like this video may get a
little bit wofully so what I'm gonna do
is in the description box below I'm
gonna add all the tips and tricks that I
mentioned along with all the products
and links to where you can buy them so
definitely go and check that out for
more information so let's kick things
off and talk about some eyeliners brown
eyeliner is probably my most favorite
way of wearing eyeliner I pretty much
wear every single day I think it's
really nice and natural not too
over-the-top but it adds just that a
little bit of something that makes it
look like you're wearing makeup and for
me my eyes are a little bit tired when I
just wear mascara so I love a bit of
brown eyeliner these are the most
long-lasting formulas that I have in
eyeliner form as you can see some of
them are literally worn down to such
tiny little stumps pixi endless silky
eye pens are great they go on really
smooth they don't tug at the eye and
they're really opaque and they last a
really long time and very similar so
that is the Makeup Forever aqua liner
which I have too and my favorite shade
is 2l this is a really nice kind of dark
brown my favorite Brown eyeliner shade
is a medium to dog I think it was too
light bronze then there's not really
much point of it and if it's too dark
then it's too heavy and it kind of makes
the eyelid look a bit heavy I found the
Marc Jacobs one in I think it's Coco I
found this to be a little bit too light
and there wasn't really much point to it
although I love the formula of these
they're really smooth and silky
I'm just wasn't that happy with the
color of this one but two L in makeup
forever is the perfect Brown for me and
another one I love is the urban decay
eyeliner and hustle there 24/7 eyeliners
are really good they're waterproof they
literally don't budge they last all day
and I think that's really important with
a brown eyeliner alloy is it will just
end up smearing all over your eyelid to
find a brown eyeliner that I'd really
recommend is Mac Teddy it's an again a
really nice Brown it's just really
flattering it's not too dark it's not
too light and I think this is an
all-around favorite for most people I
don't often wear black eyeliner if it's
not liquid I just for me I have slightly
hooded lids so I find it a little bit
too heavy if I do wear black eyeline
I wear it really close to the lash line
and I don't wear it much on the top lid
I just really work it into the lashes
into the base roots of the lashes and I
find that that just makes my eyelashes
look a little bit fuller and thicker the
ones I would really recommend are the
gel formulas because they're much more
long-lasting then they're not gonna kind
of smudge all over your eyelid I have
three here that are all very similar the
Bobbi Brown perfectly defined gel
eyeliner these are all in pen forms by
the way I find gel eyeliner in a pots
with a brush just a little bit too
tricky to use and I just don't think you
need to because now most brands do them
in pens form so the Bobbi Brown one is
great Mac have a new one out called
fluid line eye pencil and Urban Decay
also have one called all-nighter
eyeliner these are all very similar they
all do the same thing it will have very
small little tips so it's very easy to
work into the lashes and I think there's
a nice thing to do if you want to make
your eyelashes look a little bit thicker
and if you have quite a smoky eye in the
evening this is the nice thing to add so
let's talk color and I do like to wear a
little bit of colored eyeliner every now
and again the colors I always go for a
green or purple I find those colors work
the best with brown eyes and it's the
colors I always end up gravitating
towards gravitating a word I think it is
for green I really like the Mac eye
liner in minted and I've had this for
years like since uni days I think I
remember watching a Tanya burr tutorial
like back in the day maybe a Rihanna one
which I find that video link it below
because it was really good as she used
this and I was like wow I need that when
I use the green colors I tend to use it
under the eye so just the thin line
underneath the eye and blend it out and
I think that's the nice is way of
wearing a brighter color because I think
when it's on top it can look a little
bit kind of too young and maybe a bit
tacky should now have a new eyeliner
coming out as well with suite-style
which has a really nice kind of greeny
blue I think that's a very pretty color
for under the eye as well so with the
green eye where at under the eye but
with purple I like to wear it from the
top of the eye above the lash line I'm
not sure why but I think because it's so
similar to brown it just works really
well Purple's really flattering with
brown eyes and the one I'm absolutely in
love with I've used in a video before
it's Charlotte Tilbury Elizabeth violets
and it's a really really pretty
flattering purple by the way with all
these eyeliners a lot of them are
high-end just because they're the ones
that I have at the moment but you can
get good job
stop eyeliners I recommend just trying
them on the back of your hand giving
them a little bit of smudge to see how
long-lasting they are but really most of
it unless I'm talking about liquid
liners most it's just down to the sort
of shade that you like I also think Navy
eyeliner is really pretty because it's
not as kind of dark as black it's kind
of really sophisticated I think really
nice for a night out this one is from
Urban Decay and it's there 24/7 velvet
eyeliner so these are just as
long-lasting as the original 24/7 ones
but these are mattes and I think they're
really nice this one is in the shade
minx and it's a really nice dark navy
nude eyeliners are great when your eyes
are looking very tired and when the
inner part of your eye is quite red you
just kind of put it on the inside of the
waterline and it immediately opens up
and wakens up your eyes the two that I
love to use are the Rimmel scandaleyes
in nude and the Charlotte Tilbury I
cheat for bigger brighter eyes she
pretty much says that as it is it does
give you bigger brighter eyes and both
of these are really great so let's talk
about black liquid eyeliner and probably
the most complicated category outs of
all the eyeliner categories and I think
I get the most questions about this some
people just get it and can do it it's
fine but a lot of people really struggle
with black eyeliner my favorite high-end
black eyeliner is the Tom Ford defining
pen which is double ended and my
favorite drugstore eyeliner is so
glorious super cat liner these aren't
very different I think the key to black
eyeliner and apologies for any in you
endows is to have a stiff hard nib I
think it was too long and bendy it makes
it much harder to apply and two examples
of that are the Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner and the
Revlon one these both have quite long
bendy nibs and I think you have to be
slightly better on eyeliner to get on
with ones like these I think if it's got
a fur manip that doesn't move as much
it's much easier to use Tom Ford one is
great so easy to use and it's lightly
weighted so I find it really easy to
balance at my hand and the 7 course if
pick out one is really nice it has to
like be a thicker nib so if you want
slightly thicker line this one better
I find the main difference between
drugstore black liquid liners and
high-end black liquid liners are that
the drugstore ones tend to dry out a lot
quicker a lot of the high-end ones like
my DHC one here have a special lid that
has a slight cushion in it
so when you push it in you can kind of
feel it's a bit bouncy and this stops it
from drying out so I think that's the
main difference between high-end and
drug stores so if you use black liner a
lot
I'd recommend investing in a high-end
one others I really like the Chanel one
I think this is new and it's really
great and Urban Decay also have one if
you're big urban decay fan this is ink
for eyes and this one is waterproof
it's very thin so it's very easy to hold
and if you want a thin black line this
one's good my trick for doing my black
liquid eyeliner is I tend to lean on my
dressing-table so I'll lean forward and
rest my elbow on the table and that
gives you a nice kind of steady balance
if your hands just like this it's much
easier to go wrong so I balance my elbow
on the table I lean forward into the
mirror and I hold my eye out like that
to make it taut
I have slightly hooded lids so it really
helps me when I do that I then kind of
look down but keep my eye open and I
start from the outside and work my way
right into the center of the eye I don't
go too far out at first I just go from
the edge of the eyelash into the center
and then I do a little bit on the inside
if I need it but sometimes I don't even
do that and then I thicken the outer
corner slightly going out it's important
not to go down at the edge of your eye
because then it would make your eyes
look sad and kind of tilt down if you
want to go slightly up then just do it
gradually and slowly keep building on it
but I like to just kind of go to the
edge of my eye and slightly out so I
think that's the most flattering look
for my eye shape so I think that's
everything that I said of my eyeliner
collection and a lot of recommendations
for the ones that I love I hope you
found this useful and I'd love to hear
any of your eyeliner tips and tricks or
