gonna be on how to get spring ready skin
I really hope you have been enjoying my
daily videos this month don't forget to
subscribe so that you don't miss any of
my uploads or turn on notifications if
my videos don't go into your
subscription box in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how I prep my skin for
fake tanning and my favorite time to use
at the moment my whole kind of skin care
body skincare routine but before I show
you that I wanted to tell you the
inspiration behind making this video
I've recently collaborated with the
teenage cancer trust myself and a guy
called Jake quick erdan who is a singer
musician you guys might know him from
x-factor we got together to help Teenage
Cancer Trust on their Sean Byrne
campaign Sean Byrne is a campaign aimed
at raising awareness for skin a safety
in the Sun especially between thirteen
and twenty four year olds but for
everyone really it's obviously a topic
that means a lot to me as a lot of you
might know my auntie passed away from
skin cancer and myself and my dad go to
get our moles checked every six months
so it's something I think about a lot
and something that's very important to
me I remember as a teenager that it was
really lame to be the person putting on
Sun cream it was the cool thing to do to
sunbathe and to have a tan I just think
times have changed fake tan is an orange
and patchy anymore and I could
definitely see a difference in people's
attitudes towards the Sun now which is
amazing so at the end of this video I'm
gonna be giving you guys my kind of top
tips for staying safe in the Sun so stay
tuned for those so important please kind
of take note and don't be ignorant
towards the topic before I do that
though I thought I would give you guys
an option if you don't want to lay out
in the Sun if you want to be a bit more
safe about your skin fake tan is the
best alternative option and as I said
times have changed so much fake tan is
so much better than it used to be I used
to be so scared of it as a teenager I
never ever once it a try fake tan I
thought I would just come out looking
Orange nothing more embarrassing than
having like stripy fates hand all over
your wrists so I kind of just avoided it
but over the years since doing Beauty
blog being I've been able to experiment
with different brands and formulas and I
figured out what I like and I think I've
shown you my Zen tan routine in the past
and my San Tropez expressed that's the
one in the blue box all I really like
that but today I'm showing you a
different faith pad I thought I'd talk
you through like the four steps I do
when trying to get spring ready skin so
the first the most important step for me
is exfoliating my skin
oh she just gets rid of any dry skin any
patches smooths out everything and just
makes a nice blank canvas there's a few
things you can use for this I really
like the Zen tan face and body
exfoliator this is a fake tan brand so
it's an exfoliator that's specifically
for tanning and that means that they
haven't got too many oils in it and it
won't kind of disrupt the town or make
it go patchy so I'm really liking using
this at the moment I've used quite a bit
another thing I use for my exfoliating
is actually my epilator I'll talk to you
about this in a minute but if you take
the lid off the epilator this one is the
braun silk-épil 9 and it comes with an
exfoliating head or a brush head so you
take that part of the lid off and then
you click the brush on and I love this
it's like a body brush let me turn it on
for you so the brush spins and you can
use yours foliate or shower gel and this
I find is the best exfoliation because
it really does get rid of any rough skin
and you can use in the shower it's great
so step two is actually epilating I've
spoken a bit about epilating in the past
I know that it's something a lot of
people are really scared of but I swear
I am such a worse and it's just so worth
it it does hurt cause it has more than
shaving I don't think it hurts more than
waxing to be fair but it's so so worth
it and the reason I love epilating is
because unlike shaving when I used to
shave my legs I swear the hair would
grow back by the evening with epilating
the hair takes like at least a week to
grow back and when it does is thinner
it's not thicker like when you shave I
absolutely love it and I do this after
exfoliating just to get rid of any hairs
I do it on my legs I do my arms as well
I never used to do my arms but since
doing it I just really enjoyed having
kind of smoother arms I will show you
like a before and after of my arms
they're not that bad at the moment but
if you long as you keep it up sometimes
I wait like too long to epilating and
when the hairs along it hurts even more
so definitely try and do it regularly
step 3 is to moisturize and I can never
really get my head around moisturizing
before fake tan some reason it just
seems bizarre my head but it does really
help if you moisturize your ankles knees
elbows wrists here wherever you think
you're gonna get slightly patchy it
really does help now I'm gonna be honest
I'm not completely clued up on whether
it matters what sort of body lotion you
use the one I'm using at the moment
the ameliorate body lotion that I
mentioned in my monthly favourites video
but this has a HEA in it and I wonder if
that's gonna affect the town I think
it's okay to use before you tan but
maybe using this after you tan might not
be a great idea because it might kind of
exfoliate the tanned bits if you know I
mean I think this is really good to use
before because it really smooths out
your skin so I kind of put that all over
really but mainly focusing on any dry
areas now the fourth and final step is
to fake tan and the tan I'm using at the
moment is the bond ice and liquid gold I
was quite scared of this when I first
got it because the packaging I think is
a bit intimidating I definitely think
that's something that the tanning
industry needs to think about more I
think you want to convert people to fake
tanning who don't usually tan then I
think the packaging needs to be less
light focused on being really really
really tanned some people just want like
a subtle glow anyway this is a self
tanning dry oil it's got a really nice
coconut scent and the thing that's great
about this is you don't have to wash it
off so my San Tropez tan as much as I
love it you have to apply it and you can
either wash it off in the shower one two
or three hours after application this
one you can just apply and then you're
done you leave it so it comes in a spray
bottle a bit like some cream and I like
to work in sections when I fake tan so
I'll focus on the lower part of my leg
if the upper part of my leg my stomach
my left arm my right arm and then my
chest if I get rich to my back I tell
him to do it in like top left top right
bottom left bottom right and I apply it
with a mitt I think this is the best way
to apply fake tan you can get these in
boots or superdrug they're pretty cheap
one side is high of a bit furrier and
that's the side that you use so you just
pop it on your hand and you spray the
tan on to where you want to have it and
then you apply it with the mitt and kind
of rub it in and the annoying thing
about this town is there isn't really a
guide color so you can't really see how
much you've applied or how tanned you're
going to be but you just have to kind of
remember where you've applied it and be
quite quick with the application I use a
couple of layers of this and then it
takes about 15 minutes to dry maybe you
can get dressed straightaway and it
develops over 24 hours so if I do in the
evening they're kind of next evening I
feel like it's done developing
does get quite dark Ashley I think if
you just want a subtle tan one layer of
this is fine I always think if I'm gonna
go through the hassle of exfoliating
attorney and I want it to be like a tan
it's worth it I think this tan doesn't
last quite as long as the San Tropez
wall and I feel like with the San Tropez
one I could be tan for up to a week this
one it's maybe kind of four days of good
tan before I feel like I need to
exfoliate again it's so handy though if
you are in a rush because it's a dry or
you can just apply it and go I usually
take what's left on the mitt and use it
on my hands and feet and a bit on my
face but I do find that because the skin
on my face is so different to my body
and it needs a bit of extra care I like
to use a separate tan for my face and
for this one I use the Clarins liquid
bronze self-tanning I've used this
forever it's just a lotion you put on
cotton wool pads and you apply over your
face at night time it's very subtle it's
very different to this it's not like an
sudden fake tan look but it's just the
subtle glow and then I feel like you can
use makeup to bronze up your face quite
easily so I want to give you guys some
tips for staying safe in the Sun and I
really hope that the stigma of being
safe in the Sun will eventually go
everyone has very different skin types
but there are certain Sun safety things
that everyone should really follow so
first of all if you do have moles on
your body whether it's just a few or
loads like I have it is really important
to get them checked and I know it's a
bit scary intimidating because you don't
know what they're gonna say and even now
even though I go every six months I
dread if the doctor says I need to get
one removed I hate it I really do but
obviously it's worth it it's so so
important
I'd recommend asking your GP for a
specialist someone that does something
called mole mapping I'm trying out a new
clinic soon so I'll probably be
reviewing that on my blog but if you're
not based in London try and find your
local kind of mole mapping service when
you are in the Sun always wear a Sun
cream I've always worn thirty-plus even
when I was 15 and it was uncool to wear
Sun cream I always wore thirsty and just
make sure to reapply it after you've
been swimming just be sensible I know it
can be like quite a chore and I
personally hate the feeling of Sun cream
when you're sandy and you're wet but
again think about your skin frying in
the Sun it's just terrible
also make sure your Sun cream has UVA
and UVB in it that's really important
never use sun beds just don't I feel
like there is no excuse I can't believe
that
some birds actually legal I know some
people use it if they've got psoriasis
for other reasons but if you're using it
to get a tan I mean it just shocks me
when I hear of people I know who use
sunbirds they are so so dangerous so
unnecessary there's fake tan and other
ways of getting a nice glow I have never
ever used the sunbed and I never will
and then my final tip would be that if
you are in a country that has very hot
Sun or you're on a holiday
just avoid sitting in the Sun between
like 11:30 and 2 they say 11:30 and 3
but I know if you're on holiday you kind
of want to make the most of been in the
Sun but I always try to avoid being
directly in the Sun between kind of
11:30 and to go and have lunch sit in
the shade it's too hot it's not good for
your skin so definitely try and avoid
those kind of really hot intent hours so
I'm going to link the Sun burn campaign
below you guys might remember for my
vlogs that I did a little photo shoot so
you can go and have a look at those
photos read more about the campaign
share it if you would like to I really
think it's something people need to talk
about more and I hope that my kind of
fake tanning tips were helpful to you
guys let me know what your favorite fake
tan is at the moment because I'm always
looking to try new ones and if you have
any other application tips or any other
Sun safety tips as well please share
them I love it when you guys chat
amongst each other and leave tips and
tricks so thank you so much for watching
I'll see you guys in my next video
