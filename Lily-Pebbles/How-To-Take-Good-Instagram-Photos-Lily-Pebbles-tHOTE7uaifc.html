talking about my favorite social media
platform Instagram
I just thought I could sit down have a
little chat with you guys I've got quite
a few different like categories that
I've split this up into profile grid
taking photos editing photos posting
growth and who to follow so there's lots
of different stuff going on this video
and I just want to say that it kind of
take what I say with a pinch of so
Instagram is meant to be fun it's a
hobby for most people some people work
at brands and it's work some people do
what I do and it's a bit of work and a
bit of fun but it's meant to be
enjoyable so any kind of tips I give
just to make you enjoy it more don't
take it too seriously it's just photos
on Instagram is this video interesting I
don't know your profile is the first
thing someone sees when they find you on
Instagram so that's the moment they
decide whether they're going to follow
you or not so use it as like a little
bit of an Instagram CV I think your
profile photo is pretty important a lot
of people have a logo as their profile
photo you can it does look really neat
but I think a photo of your face is the
best thing I think with all social media
that applies more personal you make it
the more your followers feel like they
can get to know you the more likely they
are gonna want to get to know you so put
a nice picture of your face I very
rarely changed mine but you can change
as often as you like use your profile to
tell your potential new followers who
you are and what they can expect if they
follow you on Instagram so your name you
could be your age if you want or your
location and what you're into so if
you're into home decor or food you can
write what I eat for lunch every day if
that's what you're going to put on your
Instagram or a mix of beauty and fashion
and lifestyle just give a bit of a
description of what people can expect
from your Instagram if you have any
important links you can add them there
as well if you have a blog or a YouTube
channel or a brand website or your
Twitter add the link there why not then
they can get to know you better on other
platforms as well the whole Instagram
theme grid thing is all very new to me I
didn't realize that people take there
when I say grid it's like when you go in
your profile and you see all your photos
together in a grid people take that very
seriously people have like themes on
their grid I didn't realize that was a
thing I think I kind of have a theme
because I edit my photos all the same so
they look the same but some people can
have like special borders around their
photos so it looks really nice when you
see
all together or they only put certain
photos up at different times so it looks
really symmetrical do what you want with
your grid I think the only time a grid
or a theme is important is when new
people find your Instagram page because
other than that they're just gonna see
your photos on the feed so I don't know
it's up to you whether to take the whole
theme good thing seriously or not but
it's something to think about and I do
think it's very pretty when people have
like a really nice Instagram theme but
it all got a bit too much for me when I
try to do that so now I just kind of
post things that I like but if you do
want to plan out your grid more then
there is an app which I will talk more
about later in the video called vsco cam
and you can use that app to see what
your photo will look like against your
other photos before you upload it to
Instagram so it has it all laid out on a
grid the same as Instagram you can
upload it and you can see does it look
nice next the last photo I posted and
you can decide before you put on
Instagram I think taking your photos is
just as important as editing them
probably actually more important as I've
mentioned in the past when talking about
blog photography it's all about finding
the right thing to take a photo of
having the right light the right
positioning really taking your time to
get the right photo flat layers are huge
on Instagram that's when you lay things
like flat on a surface and take a
picture from above and I think that you
can also experiment with flat layers as
well using a light from different angles
it doesn't have to be bird's eye view
straight down you can take it slightly
from the side I think that looks really
nice I like to really pack my flat lays
full I think it looks really nice when
you've got quite a full image but just
play around have some patience take
loads of photos that's what I always do
I take so many photos and then I go
through and pick the one that I like the
most and then edit so you're never gonna
get the perfect shot right away
sometimes you do that's always a great
day but feel free to like play around
and add things in add layers and
textures I sometimes use notebooks
underneath just to add a bit of depth
and that can look really nice when I'm
taking my photos for Instagram I use
square mode on the iPhone so it's
already in square you know what it's
gonna like on Instagram because if you
take it in like full photo mode then
you're gonna have to crop it down to
square Instagram now have the ability
that you don't have to just post square
which really broke my heart
I feel like that is the best thing in my
histogram that everything is beautifully
square and when they change that I just
I can't even deal with it of course
I still only upload square editing your
photos I think this is one of the most
fun bit I don't go crazy with my editing
I know some people spend like a really
long time editing their photos but by
the time taking a photo that I really
like I just want to like post it like
all like keep it in my little stash of
photos I'm gonna post later but can't
really be bothered to spend a long time
editing so I have they're kind of few
things that I do and I'll show you in a
minute how I edit my photos I think the
Instagram editing tool that's actually
on Instagram is so so good I use that
mainly all the time really there are
loads of other apps you can use vsco cam
has lots of filters and they're really
good but again I still think Instagram
kind of does it all so let me talk you
through now my process of taking a photo
and editing it to put on Instagram so
I'm gonna start by opening a photo that
I just took which is basically just of
some flowers and a candle on some books
and I'm going to open that up in
Instagram now this is where I normally
resize things or crop it if I need to
and then I'm just gonna click Next and
press this button on the right-hand side
which is the editing tool on Instagram I
usually start by upping the brightness
quite a lot I like my photos to be
pretty bright and then I sometimes turn
the contrast down to make it a little
bit softer if I'm taking a picture
outside or off the sky lights 10
structure up because it really defines
the image but for this one I'm just
gonna keep it down sometimes I turn the
warmth down just to get rid of any warm
tones and I turn the highlights up just
to make it a little bit brighter again
and the shadows down to make it a bit
softer sometimes I like to sharpen the
image but for this one I'm going to keep
it down so then I just take a screenshot
of that image and I go into my photos
and edit that back into square mode I
then take the photo that I've just
edited and I put it into facetune now I
don't use this app to edit my face at
all don't worry I don't remove any
wrinkles or spots or change my face
shape I just use this for the whitening
tool so this really helps to whiten an
image especially if it's a really warm
toned image this one doesn't need it
that much but I'll show you as an
example you just rub your finger along
where you want to make it white and it
whitens that part of the image it's
pretty genius and then I like to upload
it into vsco cam to see how it looks
along the other photos in my Instagram
feed and it's very rare that I don't
like an image where it's it's isn't
justified like two pictures of my face
in a row and it looks a bit weird so
that's pretty much it and then I just
upload it onto Instagram I think it's
worth thinking about when you're gonna
post the photo what time of day your
followers are most active on Instagram
you know if you post a photo at 4 a.m.
is everyone gonna be asleep and miss it
I know it's obviously not all about the
likes this is to the people who care
about how many likes they get I think
it's worth thinking about what time of
day you post the photo how long has it
been since you last posted I don't tend
to post more than what like 1 or 2
photos a day I find it quite frustrating
when I'm following someone who's
constantly posting photos that kind of
makes me unfollow someone but if you
like to post loads that's your thing but
I would say to try and space them out
quite evenly Instagram does have the
Edit tool now so you can edit what you
write under your photos but really I
think the first 5 to 10 minutes once you
post the photo
everyone would have read it then so
going back in editing I'm not sure how
beneficial that is I think it's only
good if you've made like a really bad
mistake one thing I would definitely say
is don't over hashtag hashtags I think
are good when you're starting out
because if you do a big kind of general
hashtag like London or restaurants then
people might search those hashtags and
find you but hash tagging oh my god this
photo is amazing or hash tag I can't
think of any other hashtags you know
like the silly hashtags that aren't
really a hashtags I find them they kind
of just clog up the photo and I find it
really annoying when people just hashtag
everything hashtag London hashtag
weekend hashtag brownie hashtag bakery
hashtag ah stop hashtag game please
growth on Instagram is important to some
people so I wanted to cover that how you
can kind of grow your followers I know a
lot of people find it really frustrating
that they just want more followers in
Instagram and they don't know how to get
it definitely getting more involved in
the community is the same with every
other platform comment on other people's
photos then people will see your comment
and they might check out your profile
there promote your Instagram on other
channels that you're on if you have a
Twitter feed or a Facebook tell people
on there to go and follow you on
Instagram if you don't tell them they
won't do it and they won't know that you
exist on Instagram
be consistent if you don't post a photo
for weeks then people would just forget
about you and the thing is I know
Instagram have changed it slightly but I
think when someone likes your photo it
pops up on the explore page that's how
used to work so the more people who are
liking our photos the more likely other
people are going to find your photos so
just be consistent if you're not posting
you're not gonna get followers there's a
website called icon of square I think
that's how you pronounce it and you can
look at your kind of Instagram stats and
your most liked photo and the people who
like your photos the most there's just
loads of Instagram analytics on there
that are really interesting it's good to
see which photos do the best on your
page because then you know to like post
more that kind of photo people love your
outfit photos you can post more of those
I'm a bit of an analytics geek but if
you are - it's a very interesting
website so now the fun bit whoo I love
to follow on Instagram I've got loads of
Instagram feeds that I am just so
obsessed with I'm not going to talk
through every single one what I'm just
gonna do instead is link them all down
below so you guys can just click and
then you can look at their grid and
decide for yourself if you want to
follow them Instagram is so fake and
false but that is why I love it I feel
like it knows its place in the world
Instagram is not the place you see
people looking at their worst that's
snapchat I think instagrams are okay to
be like overly pretty and planned out
that's why we all love it so I hope you
found this video a little bit
interesting let me know if it was just
completely irrelevant and I should never
do a video like this again or if you
kind of liked it I've done a few kind of
blogging and YouTube tips videos in the
past so I will link a playlist here
where I've got tips for how to start a
blog tips are how to start a YouTube
channel

of techie Bloggie related things in this
playlist so go have a look at that if
