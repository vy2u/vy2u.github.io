we are starting an exciting little
series that we've got planned for this
week we're going to be uploading videos
on both of our channels today Sunday and
Tuesday and it's kind of like a mini
guide to vlogging and vlogging so we're
going to be doing alternate videos one
I'm vlogging vlogging on both our
channels so I'll put the links below and
explain it yes today we are going to do
our tips to help out to start a beauty
blog and it's kind of right from the
beginning and then designing your blog a
bit about content this is like quite
comprehensive guide to beauty blogging
definitely so when it first when you
first come to like deciding on where to
host your blog there are quite a few
places but I'd say the main two websites
pick from our blogger calm and WordPress
calm and they are actually quite
different and luckily I use blogger at 9
uses WordPress you know we've both kind
of give like our idea of how it works so
in saga it's Google based so it means
you can sign up with the same email that
used for YouTube and emails anything
like that and blog is quite well known
to be really easy user friendly so you
can kind of design it with yourself it's
all done by widgets and you can move
things around and it's really easy to
use once you learn how to do it you
don't really need to know about HTML or
coding or anything it's sorry because I
used to use blog and then I move to
WordPress so blogger is amazing but then
because it's so easy it's almost quite
restricted you can kind of any customize
things to a certain point so I actually
leave my blog from blogger - WordPress
which wasn't too difficult to do however
I have a very techie friend from uni you
helps me if you have a techie friend
they can come in quite helpful because
personally I'm a bit of a tech noob so
WordPress I think you have to actually
have your blog on a server can you tell
I have no idea what I'm talking about
but basically the backend you kind of
just see the post and the design is
actually all HTML coding so unless you
kind of really know your HTML you kind
of icon personally customize my blog too
much so I just see the backend of all
the posts but you can customize it and
make it look proper proper switch from a
designer's point of view there's a lot
more you can do work first you can have
like the swishy movie things I'm not
saying that if you have a really good
designer
my friend that helped me from uni as
well really he's managed to find a way
to do a lot of things on blogger that
people didn't think possible so I think
kind of just pick I definitely say start
blogger because I don't need to pay
anyone to design your blog it's really
easy to use I end up paying the service
basis well
like each month whereas blogger is
completely free yeah the next thing
we're going to cover is picking a blog
name which i think is such a toughy I
think both me and Louie would say you
kind of pick one and then if you're so
down the line you're like why did I call
it that I picked my name about ten
minutes or yeah me and instantly
regretted it well we have a lot of
bloggers friends and I think everyone
kind of hates the name but yeah don't
worry too much about it I'd say but um
try and pick something that you like at
the time so it's not too on trend
because you don't want it to kind of go
out of fashion yeah and keep it unique
and not too similar to anyone else and I
think it's also a good tip and Lily
actually changed name so it's not the
end of the world if you end up really
really hating a blog name it's possible
to change it so if you're looking to
kind of redesign your blog or thinking
rather layout we have a few tips on the
design my top tip would be to keep your
images quite big definitely I think big
image is just a beautiful right um I
think it's quite nice have quite a
visual based blog whatever your subject
matter is definitely make sure they fill
the width of the post of notes really
tidy and nice it's good I'd say keep the
whole emerald I designed quite simple
obviously if you have favorite colors
and stuff incorporate them in you want
it to kind of be personal to you but
make easy to read I know there's some
kind of research on like dark writing on
I like my hair so I'm easier than live
on dark I actually think my background
was black but I first thought really I
realize it was quite hard to read so I
changed it just play around with it
until you're happy but I'd take you but
quite simple yeah and also make sure
that your social media icons are very
like visible yeah I think both of ours
both quite at the top so you can easily
find our Twitter pages and our YouTube
and everything like that and then
everyone can find it for the mini
definitely when I find a blog that I
love
always want to follow that person on
Twitter as well because you kind of want
to know everything about lovely exactly
yeah especially I'd say make it easy
people to comment on my favorite parts
about blogging and reading the comments
so yeah whether you're on blogger make
sure the comment systems working on
eases discus or well yeah this isn't one
but you can actually have that on
blogger as well so yeah make it easy to
come in and try and have it so you can
reply if you want to and also to have a
design where people can easily scroll
from one page to the next definitely
it's a good one because I know that I
end up spending like hours on some
people's blogs just pressing like next
post Nick yeah I can actually reading
the whole things that's a really good
feature to have I think so if you're
going to invest in one things I think
you have to get something to design that
that's definitely a good one with this
so we're going to talk about kind of
blogging equipment and setup in a later
video but really all you need is a
camera and a computer is as easy as that
you don't even need some kind of fancy
SLR thing as well but we will talk about
that later date so when it comes to
editing photos you don't need any kind
of fancy Photoshop I have no ideas
Photoshop I don't own it it just
confuses the hell out of me tonight I
wish I did is that clear we don't really
edit our photos something I like to do
is make sure I really like the photo as
I'm taking it so there's not much
editing is required but yeah if we do I
think the both of us we just kind of
resize the image crop it sometimes make
it a bit brighter because it's so dark
in the UK yeah that's the only thing I
ever do is the like brighten button I
both have my press press press back just
to brighten things up and make white
things look a little bit whiter and yeah
cropping and resizing but aside from
that I think that's really all I do I'm
like Lily I would take like 20 photos of
the same product and usually you know
what if always the last photo always or
in the last place to me when you get it
you're like yeah that's the one and then
the minute I know I've got the one we'll
just move on to the next thing so
usually there's climbing one I really
like anyways is really easy Ted don't
work on the composition then you'll
probably be happy with the finish point
when it comes to content I think the
main
is just to be quite creative and be very
unique and write a blog that you would
like to read that's always what I try
and do in mine anyway definitely don't
be afraid to have your own opinion
because that there's so many blogs and
we love reading hundreds of mugs but
that's what makes you stand out as
having your own opinion no one else will
help saying voices use so don't be
afraid to say what you think and also be
quite consistent whether it's once a
week on a Friday of four and that's when
you post I think it's good for people to
know when you're posting you can come
back like we both pass up quite early
every morning seven days a week at work
with it's seven nine seven in the
morning something quite consistent my
Kindle schedule is good even if it's
like 170 weeks and then tell your
readers about as well if you upload
every Friday tell them so they know when
to check back also put yourself in the
readers position so try and post stuff
that you think will be helpful to them a
photo if your think about taking a photo
will this actually help them see the
product or is it going to add to the
post to try and put yourself in their
position and I think if you write a blog
you read a blog too so you can yeah so
we mentioned this in Anna's first video
as well but obviously it's sign up to
all social media platforms that you
would like to and promote your blog
across all of them yeah we've got
Instagram Twitter Facebook Pinterest I
don't really use Pinterest and Tumblr
but they're good platforms to use as
well the good ones as well so make sure
you kind of got the same user name if
you can across everything that'd be
really helpful because then people there
to find you on everything exactly if
you're going to be working so hard on
the blog email so tell me more about it
promote it but also make sure of social
media platforms have the link to your
blog as well as your Twitter profile
Instagram profile yeah and a link so
people follow you on there and they also
have a rule about keeping everything
connected that's something I think one
of the main things take away from these
videos is google it research it because
we're very self-taught in everything
that we do like it's not like anyone
ever told us how to use iPhoto or
anything I learned all of that through
YouTube videos or just googling things
googling things you will be able to find
an answer there somewhere whether it's a
YouTube video or in the answer to your
question ever find that sanssouci my
daily Andy
thank you for every Uli's to always say
to me Google that exactly you should
just drive me same for anything easy
answer the truth you type in how do I
move my comment system on blogger yeah
will come up I literally write in
exactly where your question is yeah so I
hope you enjoyed this video we're just
going to leave you with a few tips to
sum it up the first one would be it's
all about the content so keep it
creative and original to you and unique
also with your blog now try and make
everything match so make your social
media names match your blog if you can
might it would be Google it Google is
like your best friend when it comes to
these kinds of things and also promote
your blog because if you don't no one
else will unless you had some really
nice family members or something exactly
so if you want to see the video we did
on Anna's channel about how to start a
YouTube channel click on her lovely face

Sunday for the second video and then on
Tuesday for the third one yeah I think
the next kind of subject we'll be
covering is filming setups and all of
our blogging equipment that we only so
it should be a good one but I hope
