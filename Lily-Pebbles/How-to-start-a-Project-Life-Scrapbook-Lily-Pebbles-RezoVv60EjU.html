apologies for the setup this is very
casual because this is a proper
spontaneous video I wasn't planning on
uploading today because I just thought
I'd give you guys day off it's New
Year's Day I don't think I was going to
be watching YouTube but I was just
reading through the comments from my
December favorites video and I'm
completely blown away at the response to
my scrapbook I had no idea you guys
would be so fascinated and interested in
my scrapbook I've had messages from
friends and fellow bloggers and
youtubers who now in a start scrapbook
so I thought I would make a more
detailed video for you guys about my
scrapbook because when I started I
really struggled to find any videos on
YouTube that word from like proper
they're like serious scrapbooking
fanatics out there especially in America
and I wasn't that into it I just wanted
to look more basic video about
scrapbooking so I thought I would make
one for you guys today I actually think
it's quite hilarious to do this video
because when I first discovered project
to life which is the program I guess
that I use for scrapbooking I discovered
it in November 2013 and I told Anna
about it and we both became completely
obsessed with like researching
everything about it I spent the whole of
December I spent so much money on the
stuff and then January 1st
I started scrapbooking and we kept it a
proper secret for most of the year I
mean she's probably going to even kill
me now telling you but we became a
little bit obsessed and I really now
kind of shared it with you guys and
you're loving it so let me tell you a
bit more about it I discovered project
life by Becky Higgins through a
beautiful mess which is one of my
favorite blogs from America and it's
just a system to make scrapbooking a lot
easier
I bought most of my bits from hobby
craft which I don't know if that's
everywhere but it's a big kind of craft
store that you get in the UK and at
first I did spend quite a lot of money
but a lot of the things that I bought
aren't things that you have to
repurchase you just have to buy them
once at the beginning there are some
things that I bought that I kind of
don't think I really needed so I thought
I'd go through with you guys what I got
and what the essentials are so first of
all I got my book and there's no
different prints you can get these are
project life scrapbooks I got this one
that says life is beautiful on it which
is actually my favorite film so I was
really happy with this one it's soft
feeling it's this
huge I think you can get small ones but
I went for the big one and then I also
picked my inserts so the inserts are the
little clear folders that go inside like
this and there's loads of different
types I think I went for type a if I
remember correctly which is the one
where it's two 4x6 photos at the top
three small little square things and
then two 4x6 at the bottom you can mix
it up and do a different insert for each
page or whatever you like but I just
wanted to go for one type of insert to
make it easy throughout the whole
scrapbook so I've got a lot of inserts
and they also got the dividers as well
that separate the months to go along
with the book dividers and inserts I
also bought my core kit which is one of
these and you don't have to get these
when I first started my scrapbook I
thought you had to get one of these but
you really don't and I won't be getting
another one for next year I think I'm
just going to do mine with photos but
inside here are all the different cards
for you to fill the spaces so up here
there's like little instructions and
different ideas for scrapbooking in here
you get loads of cards so you have
smaller ones these are really handy
actually and I probably will use these
next year but as you can see I've done a
whole year and look how many I have left
it's still pretty much full but these
are nice if you want to write in the
scrapbook as well and if you have
different shape photos you can stick
them on here there Derry handy to have
and there's different styles I got the
Jade edition and which was the nicest
one I could find at the time and yeah
I've used that quite a lot so along with
all that stuff I have built up a little
scrapbooking box here and this is just
one of the boxes I got from Staples I
think and in here's where I keep all my
scrapbooking stuff so I've been
collecting lots of pieces of papers like
some gold paper here um actually I got
up scrapbook related birthday presents
stuff so I've got papers washi tape
washi tape is really good to stick on
and write on top of if you wanted titles
I got these like sticky letters which
are really handy if you just want to
write things and I don't want to spend
too much time with the whole like
creativity part of scrapbooking I like
to just kind of print photos so I'd like
to make things easy but I have lots of
washi tape I really
I should tape it's good if your photo
doesn't fill the whole space you can use
it as a border I have ribbons the best
thing I have and the most useful thing
is whoa it's falling everywhere is this
corner rounder I don't think that's what
it's called but you basically use this
to make the corners of your photos round
you don't have to have round corners but
I really like the effect so you just
slip your photo in here and you press it
down like that whoops and it makes the
corners round and it's very satisfying
this the best thing ever I have pretty
thick a clue but the best thing I don't
have anymore because I've run out is a
little blue mouse that you go like that
and the it puts a strip of glue down I
found that really handy for sticking
photos down on things I don't bother
with Pritt stick and PVA just use these
little mouse things not the glue dots
it's the strip of glue and a cotton ball
it's called I've run out but that is the
best thing ever so what else can I tell
you about scrapbooking I am bought a big
roll of craft paper which is like that
brown paper and that's really handy for
tearing up and sticking on and writing
things on I also like to collect
postcards Paperchase do really nice
postcards and birthday cards or
Christmas cards I got this one from
Paper Chase life on the open road and
that would be good for pages where I'm
traveling if it was scrapbooking it's a
good idea just to keep things along the
way so if you go to a concert keep the
concert concert tickets if you go on a
trip keep your boarding pass wristbands
and festivals I basically been
collecting those things throughout the
year to scrapbook and I don't always do
it straight away it can be quite
stressful to remember to keep up with it
that's why I think next year I won't do
it as regimented like month by month it
was nice to do it this year but I think
next year I'm just going to put photos
in a scrapbook it was fun at times I
felt like I had a scrapbook for a month
and it was quite stressful but what I
found quite handy is to write it all
down in my phone in notes and things
that are happening in order so when I go
back I can take my photos from Instagram
and print them my ezreal photos I
normally just printed on a four piece of
paper and quite small and cut them out
and stuck them on things and for my
proper photos I either printed them on
my Canon printer and but if I had loads
to do I just do them in Boots you can't
print them online if you are more
patient than me I just always want them
and then paper clips are good things to
have in your little collection because
they look nice to clip things together
let me take a look at my scrapbook and
see if there's anything else triggers my
memory to tell you guys okay actually I
think what I'll do now is flick through
a couple of pages talking you guys
through them and that might give you
some inspiration to start your scrapbook
or just give you an idea of how I've
done mine if you look at some other
videos on YouTube I mean people go crazy
full-on out with their scrapbook I don't
have time this is just a little hobby
for me because after my blog and YouTube
channel became my full-time job I felt
like I didn't really have a hobby
anymore so this became my hobby I
absolutely loved doing it all year I
feel so proud of it now that it's like
finished I just need to finish off and
put some Christmas photos in and it's
almost finished and I love having like
hard copy of something to look at
because I feel like people never print
photos anymore if you haven't got a need
to print photos I feel like you just
don't so what I do now is I take loads
of photos at a family event and then
I'll go through delete all the rubbish
ones only keep the really good ones and
then I'll print those and scrapbook them
and I just think it's a really nice way
to keep some memories
most my photos in here were taken on my
Canon EOS m with the 50 millimeter lens
because that's my kind of on-the-go
camera some of them are from instagrams
they would have been from my phone but
they're not quite as good quality I
haven't really found a good way to print
Instagram photos yet so if you guys know
anyway let me know so yeah let me take
you through a couple of pages of my
scrapbook okay I'm not going to show you
all my family photos and stuff but I'll
show you a few snippets from a few of
the pages as I said this is the photo of
me and rich when we went to Harry Potter
world and these are all came with the
core kits and then this I made so it's
one of the core kit cards and I've used
tipped expert 2014 and written my news
resolutions which were take more photos
explore London wake up early try more
coffee and be more creative
cheesy here's some photos from New
Year's Eve so I printed this officers
cheese and wine is fine Year's Eve 2013
2014 and then this is a picture of me my
friend SJ and I put a ribbon and numbers
in five four three two one
I used my paranoid camera a lot at the
beginning of the year so I used to stick
those on two cards and picture of our
table this was when we went ice skating
says pictures of me and my sister so
this I prin
some plain paper and stuck on to another
card same as this one of Bailey and
again photos just printed on my computer
this says patent bar night all this out
at the restaurant stuck it on and then
here a picture of me and Bailey and I've
just added a bit of text saying what we
were doing where we were going
this is one of my favorite bits of the
scrap but Keisha came to London for the
weekend and I took these three photos on
my phone and then just printed them out
and black and white and we went to a
restaurant and the napkin actually this
is from the napkin is that mustard on
your chin and I thought it would look
nice in the scrapbook so it's all that
out with this which was from my little
place setting and stuck them all out
like this
on this day I went out for lunch with
Anna Lucy and Ruth so we took some
polaroid photos and I stuck one here of
Anna taking a photo of me and said that
she took some outfit photos of me that
day this is how it came out this is the
Polaroid camera that I was using a lot
at the beginning of the year I take a
lot of family photos this one's one of
my favorites of Joe Joe and honey I
printed it in black-and-white this is
when I won the Johnson and Johnson award
so I took a photo of the award and
printed it out I actually drew around in
pen and the logo there and a picture of
me set Cine award and then here's a
picture of all of us out for lunch which
was really nice my foot Thursday 23rd of
Jan s day Sammy Amelia and Anna there's
a picture of all of them I printed
beauty bloggers lunch on top of it so
this is what I found the brown paper
really useful for I'd tear out stick it
on and write on it so here I've written
watching Papa play the ukulele I use
washi tape to stick photos down like
this but also to write on photos like
this so this is a really like family
page I took pictures of the kids I took
a Polaroid of each of them stuck it on
one of the cards and then put their
initials a H and B and then this photo
of Bailey I really loved so I put a next
to a post card I got from Paper Chase
that just says smile in here I've used
the scratchy letters just to write
family lunch and the date again here's
where I've used the brown paper just to
write on a photo and I think it looks
really sweet this page was Easter Bank
Holiday and I've used this post card
here that says oh I do like to be beside
the seaside that I think I also got from
Paper Chase just to kind of set the
theme so as I said in my template I also
have these small square photos through
the middle and sometimes what I like to
do is take a 4x6 photo and using the
small cards I use them as a template to
cut the 4x6 photo in half
I then round only the outer corners and
slip them in here so it still looks like
one big photo but it's actually split
into two and I really like that this is
a really nice page this is where me and
Anna went to Milan for its achieved
there's a photo of us here stuck down
washi tape says Milan it's a tube 2014
here's a little postcard and then here's
some pictures I just printed from my
phone and that's the meetup we had in
Milan this is another postcard that has
live inspired and then it was my
grandma's birthday and she was 84
doesn't she look amazing when I got to
this part of the scrapbook I started to
just kind of use mainly photos but I
really like this one that we took in
Brighton here are some photos from
Greece this one didn't quite fit so but
washi tape around the edge and this
one's from my phone and this I just
printed on some tracing paper and then
tore out and stuck it on top and this is
a postcard so hope this was kind of
helpful to you guys I'm so glad that so
many of you want to start a 2015
scrapbook it really is so much fun and I
definitely recommend project life I was
a bit embarrassed about my scrapbook at
first because I don't know it's not
really something we do in the UK it's a
very American like homemaker thing I
don't know anyone else that has a
scrapbook and it kind of feels a little
bit childish but I don't really care
because I think this is a more grown-up
version and it's a really nice thing to
do I don't know if I've covered
everything here I'm sure you guys have a
lot of questions so if you do you can
comment on this video I'll try and reply
to as many as I can or you can tweet me
at Lily pebbles I'll try to help you out
where I can I'm no scrapbook expert this
scrapbook could be much better than it
is but it's the best I could do with the
time I have and I just really enjoy it I
did it for personal reasons not really
for a youtube video I just ended up
making one so good luck with your
scrapbooks if you do start one and
please send me photos on Twitter and
Instagram I would love to see how you
guys are getting on month by month
thanks so much for watching hope you
guys have recovered fully from last
night and happy January the 1st Happy
New Year see you guys on Sunday for my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
