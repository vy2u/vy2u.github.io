you're in Australia I hope you're all
having a really nice weekend so far
before I start this gigantic home haul
which I'm very excited about and I hope
you guys are too I just wanted to
quickly mention that I've been nominated
for another award I feel like it was any
a minute ago I was talking about the
blog loving award this time it's for the
InStyle 13 projects I think it's called
Project 13 I've been nominated for the
outstanding award I think it is I'm
against some really good other vloggers
and bloggers and whoever wins gets like
a piece in the magazine and I'd
absolutely love it if you guys wanted to
vote for me don't worry if you don't but
if you do I will put the links down
below I hid there's a few days left to
vote and I would really really
appreciate it
so I'm gonna do a huge home haul and
I've been planning to move for a few
years now so I've been collecting stuff
here and there I've also got loads of
gifts recently now that we've actually
got our flat and I've picked up some few
things recently as well but we are
literally moving with nothing we have no
furniture we have no kind of kitchen
equipment or anything like that so
there's so much to buy these are just a
few like accessory bits but I'll show
you guys as we move like we've already
bought a toaster and a kettle but those
things are kind of boring to show so
these are like the fun things and I'm
sure I'll be doing lots more home hauls
soon so I'll start with H&amp;amp;M home because
I went in there just the other day it's
such a good place to pick up things for
your home especially like decorative
bits you don't necessarily want to
invest in because you want to change
them like seasonally and it's just so
affordable I always go to the one on
Oxford Street because I think that's the
best one that I've seen so far this is
definitely not an essential but I just
saw it and fell in love this is a bottle
and it looks like just a plain clear
plastic bottle there's actually glass
and I thought this would be so nice if
you're having dinner to put a bottle of
water just on the table you can kind of
poor-people water into their glasses I
think it looks so cool and also I could
just put on my desk to make sure I drink
a lot throughout the day I just think
it's so cool and different I've seen
anything like that before
I also bought this and I've seen this so
many times before I feel like everyone
has this it's definitely not something
kind of unique but it's kind of an
essential I think it's really good to
have it in your kitchen it's this is all
kind of wooden tray it says extra virgin
olive oil it looks kind of rustic ish
and you can put your olive oil or salt
and pepper any kind of oils in there
just put it on your work top and it
keeps them all in one place and it's
quite it's kind of narrow as you can
see but I like that kind of wooden II
look and this is the white one now hmm
home have definitely jumped on the whole
like marble thing they know that
everyone loves marble at the moment so
they've done so many different things
that marble I've got a makeup brush
holder it's like a cup okay so you can
use it for your toothbrush or anything
you like and I showed that in my makeup
brush video and then I also went a bit
wild for some other stuff as well I know
I won't necessarily always love marble
but I feel like with these things they
were so affordable that it doesn't
really matter
first thing is a flower pot and I
thought this would look so nice on the
coffee table
I could put like some little flowers and
there or something and I really like
that I haven't seen a marble flower pot
before I also bought this which i think
is meant to be a kind of cat or dog
water bowl and I picked it up and then
thought Oh actually that's for cats and
dogs when I put it back in him I was
walking around I thought I could
probably use that for so many other
things it's quite deep I probably
couldn't use it for like rings but I
could use it for bracelets and jewellery
or for stationary stuff on my desk I
don't really know I just thought how
much was this it was $6.99 okay so if it
was 399 that wouldn't be better it's not
that that cheap but I really like it I
also picked up this plates um I don't
know maybe I should have got more of
these I feel like how useful is one
marble plate but again I could use it
for jewellery or something in my office
or bedroom I don't really know I haven't
really figured out how I'm laying
everything out yet it's probably too
early to be buying these things but when
you see something at H&amp;amp;M home I feel
like you need to buy it because it's not
like IKEA where it will always be there
you know it might not be the next time I
go I'm so sorry for the lawnmower it's
so loud and annoying but I haven't got
time to wait for it to stop when Anna
and I were in LA we went to the
Container Store is one of my favourite
shops in America everything is just so
organised and beautiful and there's
everything you can imagine if you're
like an organised freak like me you
would love it in there we went to a huge
one by the Grove and I've got a couple
of bits I think I copied Anna and both
of these are pretty sure she's very good
at finding stuff and then I kind of just
go oh I have one too first thing is a
measuring spoon and this is really
different to any I've seen normally you
have to have lots of different spoons or
something like that and this is just all
in one so it's got one tablespoon two
and a half teaspoons two teaspoons one
and a half teaspoon 1 teaspoon half a
teaspoon and you kind of just pull this
down it's bit stiff and it just makes
this boot and bigger or smaller there
you go it's bit easier that way around I
just thought this was really clever so
that would go in my kitchen drawer and I
also picked up these these are the
Lounge Cable drops so their little kind
of sticky balls that you kind of stick
on to your table and if you want to
charge your phone or have any kind of
cables like that instead of it just
dropping to the floor and looking messy
you stick one of these on the table and
you kind of put the lead through it and
it just keeps it in one place and I love
that I'm gonna have one of these on my
desk for my phone charger I'm gonna have
one on each of our bedside tables for
our phone charges and anywhere where you
have leads I just think it's such a nice
way of keeping them organized and tidy
the last thing I got from H&amp;amp;M home is
this little thing it's very useless but
it's a lovely kind of mint green color
and I have these like shelving units in
the kitchen that I think it would look
really nice on to keep whatever bits I
want to keep in there I'm gonna try and
not be too messy in the new place but I
just think that would be nice on the
Shelf whilst we're in Berlin we had a
day on the Bank Holiday Monday where we
just looked around the shops and I found
the most amazing shop with all these
cute little bits in it and I couldn't
resist buying this it's a little kind of
salt pot you put it on your countertop
in your kitchen and it says remember to
add salt and it comes with a little
spoon I can't believe I've got this back
without breaking it
so like delicate I think it's like China
or something the little spoon says salt
on it and I'd really like this my mom
has one of these it makes it so easy to
have to open the cupboard and get the
salt you just kind of have this next to
you and you can either just grab it with
your hand or use your little spoon and
you can kind of fill it up with rock
salt this is this is better for rock
salt rather than kind of fine salt but I
love the colour as well and I think they
look so nice in the kitchen okay now I'm
going to show you a few gifts that I've
been given I'm so lucky I literally have
the best friends and I've had such nice
things over the past few months most
recently from lovely girls a gleam who
are the people that kind of look after
me they bought me this West Elm throw
and I love it it's gray and it's so so
soft it's got like Tassili bits at the
bottom it comes all wrapped up I haven't
unwrapped it yet I think I'm gonna put
this in the bedroom because my lounge is
gonna be very gray all the kind of
furnitures gray so I'm probably gonna
put like some nice orangie warm coloured
throws in there and I think this would
look so nice on the bed that I had like
white bedding on it's so so soft it
could also be used as like as a blanket
as well when you're sitting on the sofa
I love this when I was in New York with
my friend Gemma
I think last October maybe it was long
before I think it was last October we
went to somewhere called the nourish
kitchen I think it was called and they
had the most amazing mugs on sale and we
didn't end up getting them but
from my birthday she surprised me cuz
she ordered someone line for herself and
thought she'd get some for me as well
these are literally the coolest mugs
ever I have to I think the brand is
called Reiko Kaneko I'll try and find a
link please and link it down below but
they look like this so they're really
nice simple white mugs and then they
have gold around the top and a little
gold lipstick mark which I just think is
so nice I mean these are special monks I
feel like I wouldn't be letting guests
use these these are just for me I think
they're so nice so yeah two of those and
that was such a nice gift I have it I
literally kept these wrapped up since
December and then finally from Anna she
knows me so so well I absolutely love
this it's a print I think the artist is
called ham I'm pretty sure it's ham I'll
try and find out but I think it is and
is this huge like framed print of a
bunny rabbit jumping on a trampoline and
I absolutely love it she knew I loved it
because I had the little postcard in my
office for a few years and she got me
the full size and I can't wait to put it
up I think this will go up in my office
and it's so so nice so thank you Anna
okay so that everything from this home
hall but as I said I'm gonna have so
many more coming up because we have so
much left to buy I've just sent rich out
now to buy some cardboard boxes and some
sandwich bags so I could pack up my
makeup but we're taking our time we
haven't got internet in the flat yet so
we can't and move in but we will be
there very soon and I'm so excited it's
just been so nice to kind of decorate it
slowly and now that it's all painted we
can get some furniture and if it ever
arrives that is thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys have a really
lovely relaxing Sunday please vote for
me in the install Awards if you would
like to it means so much and I'll see
you on Tuesday for another weekly vlog
