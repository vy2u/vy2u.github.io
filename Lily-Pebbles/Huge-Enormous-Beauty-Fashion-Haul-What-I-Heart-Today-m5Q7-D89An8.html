video and it's quite a big one I feel
pretty guilty about this but I didn't
buy it all at one time as usual it's
kind of collective so I'm gonna get
started and show you what I picked up so
first I'm gonna start with Mac and if
you've seen my vlog if you haven't I'll
link below I went to the BAFTAs and they
did my makeup and I really liked the
makeup they do that Sheen it's kind of
maybe want to go into Mac and pick up
new things which I haven't really done
in a while first thing I picked up was
just another brush cleanser because I've
run out of mine and I actually wash my
brushes using the dr. Bronner magic soap
I've done a blog person it's all in that
below but in between like proper deep
cleansing I just like to spot clean them
and I think this is the best one I know
it's a bit more expensive than others
but it doesn't dry on my brushes and it
cleans and really quickly I just put bit
of this on kitchen towel and swish my
brushes around and it gets rid of any
sort of brown eye shadow so yeah I
picked up another one of those and then
for the makeup bits the first thing I
got was the face and body foundation
which is something I've never tried and
everybody had any interest in China I
think what kind of put me office I
thought it was a real kind of makeup
artist products that I thought it was
really high coverage obviously hadn't
done my research the fact that it says
it's for face and body just kind of put
me off a bit but they've recently
started doing the smaller size the 50
mil size so I was kind of tempted to go
and pick it up and then when she used it
on me at the BAFTAs I really really
liked it it looks like this so it's kind
of got funny packaging and you have to
shake it up before you use it it's
really liquidy so I think it's kind of a
bit intimidating to use but I just put a
little bit on the back of my hand
dab it on and then use my Real
Techniques buffing brush just like I
would with any other foundation I tried
it with my hands but I think it gets a
bit more coverage when you use a brush
because it is really sheer but what's
amazing about this foundation is that
you can wear it really sharing really
light or you can just keep it layering
it and building up and it doesn't go
cakey just you could just literally get
whatever coverage you want which I just
think is really cool and I got the shade
c2 which is a perfect fit for me
she's c3 at the BAFTAs that's why I
looked a little bit too tanned but see
to the benefit for me so yeah I've been
using this for three days now since I
bought it and I really like it so I'll
probably do a review on this soon on my
blog but so far so good
I also picked
a new paint pot and this one is part of
their new collection which I don't know
what it's called
sorry I'll link it below but take what's
called a Claire and she's this on me as
well as a base under my eyeshadows it's
a really nice Brown that's kind of how I
can describe it's a bronzy brown quite
kind of light but this is just really
nice you can wear on its own you can
wear it as a base I haven't used it yet
as you can see but I'm really excited to
and it looks really nice and she used it
on me at the BAFTAs so yeah this is out
now I think it's a limited edition so if
you want a kind of brown cream and Paint
Pot then quick before it sells out so
yeah this is really nice I'm looking
forward to using that then I also bought
the eyeshadow that she used on me as
well which is called texture and it's
one of them fell better shadows they
didn't have any of the refills in stock
when I went so I had to get one in a pot
but I'll probably just kind of deep pot
it and put it into my palette but it
looks like this and I really like this I
don't know I've never really picked it
up or seen it before because it's a roni
color but it's kind of it's a brown but
it's got really orange undertones and
she used this on that edge of the Paint
Pot in everywhere just on the edge and
in the crease and underneath and it
really kind of warms up the eye and I
love warm eyeshadows shades and anything
like that and it's really easy to blend
so I'm really happy I got this I've kind
of used it every day since I got it I
really like it
final thing from Mac is an eyeliner
another thing that the lady thar used on
me and it's um teddy
which I think I've heard tanya burr talk
about quite a lot it's definitely one
that I've seen and heard bloggers talk
about it's bronze eyeliner it kind of
reminds me of a Rimmel scandaleyes one
but slightly darker yeah it's just an
eye Kohl who Teddy really nice bronze
and really nice to use on the top and
easy to blend out really creamy she used
this on the top and on the bottom and
blend it out and it just created a
really nice brown smokey eye so really
happy with that it's a gorgeous eyeliner
color definitely recommend this one if
you like Brown eyeliner so these next
purchases are just ridiculous I am NOT
sporty actually that's a lie I used to
be really sporty to play girls football
and netball and tennis but I'm not
really into exercising and
like competitive sport but I've never
gone to the gym or done running or
anything like that but recently me which
got warrants or going for walks and I
really enjoyed it the weather was much
better than so obviously got me in the
mood but I just thought I found a good
little route in the park near my house
and I thought maybe I could try running
again I haven't tried since uni so I
spontaneously went out to buy trainers
with riches just for anyone who knows me
just knows how ridiculous that idea is
but I went to lillywhites which is in
Piccadilly Circus in London and I think
it's just sports Durex but in the old
lillywhites building and they do
discounters trainers so I picked up some
night trainers that are in sale the ones
for me cuz I've got quite narrow feeds
skinny ankles I need like quite a good
support because I always spray my ankles
when I run so they told me like you know
any from this row and they were all
pretty horrible really so I just thought
I'd go all out and get the neon orange
ones I thought I could wear kind of all
black and just have I know it doesn't
matter what you look like when you run
but you know I like to look good so yeah
I got these I have no idea what they're
called they are just night this is fly
wire on the side but if anyone thinks I
have huge feet I have these are a six so
what standard I think but yeah not small
so I just picked up some trainers and
they weren't expensive at least if I
don't end up running you I could wear
these to play tennis so much I love
today so now for the space and case
stuff and this definitely wasn't bought
all at once with space and K products I
lust after them for a while they stay on
my list and then sometimes I'll just
decide to get them and they are really
expensive so I didn't get these all
together but I have accumulated quite a
few things first up is the shunt ik I
just skin and this has been on my list
for over a year seriously what Anna
first spoke about it I really wanted to
try it every time I went to space and K
I used to swatch on my hand and I think
it was like 57 pounds or something
ridiculous I was always just like no I
can't I can't I don't need it and then I
went in recently and one of the guys
who's I think the head of training for
Sean Skye happens to be in the store so
he's the schoolkids been tried on me and
color-matched me and I was in one of
those shopping moods so I just went for
it and I got it and it looks like this
there was one left in stock
so it was meant to be I got the shade
nude which is a perfect fit for me I
love the packaging in this tube it's
called the ANSI smoke tinted moisturizer
SPF 15 which just sounds like the London
girls dream tinted moisturizer I really
liked it I was quite shocked actually
when I first tried it on at home that
it's a lot more sheer than I thought it
would be for the people who I know the
bloggers who liked it I didn't realize
they like such a sheer finish its best
using your hands that guy told me and
I've also tried it both ways and I
prefer at my hands but yeah this is
definitely for summer good skin days but
I do really like it I don't have to take
your bad skin so I feel like I can get
away with a sheer tinted moisturizer but
it just depends on the makeup look I'm
going for but it's really nice I don't
know if it's worth the price tag I think
it is for the people who shop at shad
Sakai but I'm happy I got it next is a
product from Kevin oh queen I think it
is I used to Kevin a corner but someone
corrected me I think it's Kevyn Aucoin
but it's just sounds like we should be
wrong but I think that's right and I was
when I did my 100th video and I went to
film Gemma a company magazine I had half
an hour to spare but they're burly so I
went into space and came Broadwick
Street in Soho which is the best one and
the guy in there was so nice a camera
for his name but he was a lovely guy and
we were like playing with all the
products and I kind of narrowed it down
to the highlighter and the sculpting
powder and I just didn't know which one
to get and in the end I went for the
sculpting powder so I still want the
highlighter it's definitely still on my
list it looks like this it's kind of
like a grayish brown contour color and I
normally use my NARS that give you know
but it is quite blondie so it can make
me look a bit too bronzed up and the
reason I really like this because you
can create a really subtle shadow just
under your cheekbones if you lightly put
it under there and on your temples it
creates a really natural shadow and it's
it's really good if you're just kind of
getting into contour you know you don't
want to use a bronzer especially if
you're pale this is really nice and I
know lots
bloggers a fan of it and yeah I'm really
impressed I'm really happy about it cuz
it's something really different you
can't really find anywhere else and so
yeah really happy with that and the next
thing from space okay is one of the
hourglass ambient lighting powders and I
first heard Kate to invest parties talk
about these I think she was the FIR
and then everyone went a bit crazy over
them I am always late to the party I
like to kind of hear what everyone has
to say about products first they go onto
my list I asked a lot of people i
swatched them a lot of times and then I
buy it so I don't like to rush just
because I want to write about something
first I like to make sure it's worth
spending money on so I kind of like the
sound of these meaning you know Anna
love them I trust their opinion so I
went into space okay I shouldn't know I
went to the hourglass calendar at
Liberty it asked which one is best for
me I didn't really want one two
highlights I've got highlighters I
didn't need anything to change the
redness or color correcting so the lady
said the best one for me it'd be dim
light which is one you can put all over
it just kind of gives you a nice glow
and yeah it's just an easy one to use
and she said that's actually their most
popular shade so I went for dim light
and it looks like this so these are part
of this new wave of powders Chanel it
will support one out so they're
completely different texture they're not
at all cakey they don't make your face
look powdered I really like this because
it makes my skin feel incredibly soft
which is just so nice I feel myself like
stroking my skin all day and it's nice
to kind of set your foundation as well
especially with something like Mac face
and body which is quite wet finished and
it's nice to put a bit of this on top
and it does give a little kind of Sheen
and grow but this one dim light isn't
sparkly so I really like that and yeah I
think this is nice it's very subtle it's
not going to kind of change your face in
any way but it's pretty and I like the
idea of and I really wanted to try out
another couple of bits I've been sitting
on my last list for ages are the new
Essie nail polishes from the resort 2013
collection and I saw missglamorazzi talk
about these polishes and since then I've
really really wanted to track them down
but for some reason I found out from the
sunday girl it tweeted her and she told
me that they're not bringing this
collection out into the diffusion line
which was the one that sold in boots and
Superdrug which is such a shame but I
did find in my local Phoenix I found the
collection so I was really happy about
that and I bought two colors and I
bought in the Cabana which is the one
I'm actually wearing on my nails now
which is a bright blue turquoise and I
bought first timer which is a kind of
spearmint green and I really like these
but it's just such a shame that they're
not
the mountain the diffusion line because
these have the old brushes and the old
formula and I'm actually really
disappointed and informally I just
painted my nails this morning and it's
just really gloopy and it's really hard
to get a smooth kind of finished and it
was really messy and yeah I just might
refer the new brushes and they were 1095
which is more expensive than the new
ones so I don't know why they're not
bringing out maybe they will at some
point but apparently they won't I don't
know we'll see but I do really like the
colors so I'm glad I got them they're
very bright and summery and it does look
nice in the end once you put seseri on
anything I think it makes it look nice
so I'm happy I got them and then I also
bought myself a little something from
dip teak
I love the baked handle but the candles
finished so quickly and there's always
such a sad day when they finish so I
thought this time I'd get the room spray
and I like to keep this in my office
it's just a really uplifting positive
smell makes me happy but it's so nice
and summery I'll try to slip it in this
and the fig one but things a bit more
wintery I feel like this one's a bit
more summery so I'm really happy I got
this it's in a beautiful glass bottle
and I just keep this next to my computer
spray every time I feel like the room
needs a bit of refreshing and yeah I
really really love this I definitely
recommend it they're not crazy expensive
to compare the fragrances and I think
secretly between you and me you can use
these as perfumes I know people kind of
spray them on their scarves and jackets
so yeah you can if you want ok so to
finish it off I've got a few things from
Zara and I literally don't know what's
gotten into me I had some sort of weird
like bag buying frenzy it all started
with this bag that I bought to wear at
the BAFTAs I really needed a clutch bag
all the ones I had didn't really go with
my I was wearing a bright orange dress
so I needed something
not bright and colorful I wanted to get
one of those perspex like see-through
clutches but the only one I could find
was in Zara and it was orange and it was
big orange orange so I saw this is Zara
and I really liked it it was 15 pounds
which I just think is such a good deal
because it's really structured it's not
flimsy at all it's white and black as
you can see and it has m Philipp started
that's got a magnet there and you open
it and it's like this it's got one
pocket inside but it kind of as you can
see it's not too flat it feels quite
structured and I just think sometimes
ARA i feel like they price things wrong
and I'm always a bit
shocked so fifteen pounds I think that's
amazing and when I bought this one I saw
they also had a neon yellow one and I
really wanted that but obviously that
wasn't gonna go with an orange dress so
I bought this one and I couldn't get the
yellow one out of my head so I kept
going back to try and find it and I
couldn't actually find it anywhere but
then I did find it but when I did I also
saw another bag I really liked and
stupidly I was with Anna and she is just
such an enabler so I ended up getting
both but I was having a really bad day
this is what my computer had broken and
I just think buying neon yellow bags is
a good way to cheer yourself up so I
ended up getting both which is just so
ridiculous so I got this one which is
the same as the other clutch but it's
neon yellow and I just love how it has
the black trim on the outside I think it
looks so expensive especially cuz
there's so much black I think this is
going to be really useful because I can
wear all black to go out like in the
evening and just accessorize with this
and I think that'll work really well and
in this bag I just love this I saw it
and I just don't it's not even very me
but I really wanted it it's got a long
strap so it's a shoulder bag so it'll be
nice for summer went out sometimes I
like to downsize from my big kind of
Michael Kors or Zara handbag and just
take a day bag out so it looks like this
is kind of a box shape it's quite a wide
as you can see it has two parts and it's
the same it's got this black trim around
it this one isn't as neon yellow it's
more of just a bright yellow and it has
this little flap at the front and then
inside it has a front section another
front section a zip in the middle and a
back section with another zips it's got
loads of compartments which I really
like you actually fit a lot in there I
fit my umbrella I'm a huge Mimi purse
all my bits like I didn't really have to
downsize that much to for everything in
here so I really like this bag and it
doesn't fit nicely I'm just I'm really
happy about this this almost 25 pounds
so it wasn't as cheap as the clutch but
it's more of a popper bag so that's what
I still think that's really affordable
for a nice bag such a good quality I
just love Zara
anyway wow I feel like I've been talking
really fast about Zara by but that
everything I bought I didn't buy all at
once I swear gosh so much stuff it's all
surrounding me now making me feel guilty
but I hope you like seeing all of that
and thank you so much for watching
I've just put my
look video live whilst I'm filming this
one so I'm crossing my fingers that you
guys liked it cuz I know it was a
different kind of style to my normal
videos but as you can see I'm back to my
normal ones for now so if you liked it
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next one bye hi today I'm
going to show you a few different ways
to wear red lip and how to kind of build
the confidence to do it as well I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
