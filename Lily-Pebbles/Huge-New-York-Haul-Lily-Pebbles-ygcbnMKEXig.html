before I start I have a few things to
note one I'm currently in New York but
I'll be back when you're watching this
too sorry that I look and sound very
tired it's very early in the morning and
three apologies for the strange lighting
and background it's very hard to film in
hotel rooms I actually have an amazing
view of New York right behind the camera
so I'll insert a little clip of that
there but because of the light
this was the only option so obviously as
I'm in New York I've been doing a lot of
shopping I came with my friend Gemma as
you would have seen in the vlogs and two
girls together shopping in New York is
very dangerous I bought a lot of stuff
I'm literally surrounded by bags I've
also put a lot of presents I have
Bailey's birthday coming up my mom's
birthday Rich's birthday there's lots of
presents I feel like I've bought a lot
of stuff but I haven't actually bought
anything that special for myself like a
pair of trainers or shoes or whatever so
I might still get something today is a
little kind of pre birthday gift to
myself but I'm going to show you
everything that I've got including
makeup food clothes a handbag for my mom
so let's start the whole my room for
this holiday is that I'll only buy
things that I either can't get at home
or a much cheaper here so the first
thing we'll show you is from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and I always like to go in and
take a look but I'm not the biggest fan
I feel like the scents can be quite
artificial and a lot of the candles are
very sweet styling which isn't really my
thing but I did pick up two little
candles first one is an absolutely tiny
tiny teeny weeny leaves and I've had
Flair talk about this a lot I don't know
if I like it every time I smell it it
smells a little bit so you kind of maybe
cinnamony for me but it's quite a cool
smelling as well and I just didn't want
to invest a huge three wick candle and I
saw this absolutely tiny one at the till
so I thought well that's kind of easy to
pack
definitely smells very warming and
Christmassy so looking for it's burning
that and then I also got one of the
little kind of tin candles and this one
is fresh
balsam this smells like Christmas trees
yeah it really smells like pine I really
like this smell it's very fresh and I
feel like it would really be a nice one
for like a big room in your house
very green smelling I think these ones
are much easier to travel with than the
huge 3 wick ones so I wanted
one of these yesterday when we were
walking through Soho we came across
brandy melville which we do actually
have at home just off Carnaby Street but
I wanted to go in and see if it was any
cheaper here and it really is I mean the
prices are amazing things are like 15 20
dollars and it's really nice good
quality clothes so I picked up a couple
of fits but I do want to go back today
first thing is this gray top and it's
kind of long-sleeved it's jersey
material but it's cropped and I thought
this would look really nice with and
high-waisted skirts I haven't really got
many high-waisted skirts but that's the
sort of style I like to wear in the
autumn winter with tights it will how is
the skirt and I don't really have many
cropped tops that aren't too short I
don't like to show my belly off but it
will just cover the top of the skirt and
this is such a nice soft material I also
bought this of course it has stripes I
love stripes it's a thin kind of t-shirt
material and it's stripy but it's kind
of extra long it looks a bit like a
dress but it's kind of just like a long
t-shirt that you can wear with black
skinny jeans and they looked really nice
when it just sucked really nicely and
it's very comfortable I always like to
go into Urban Outfitters when I'm here
because I think they just get better
stuff than the American ones and it is a
bit cheaper I didn't actually find any
clothes or shoes that I liked but they
have this huge Beauty department this is
the one next to Macy's in New York they
have this huge Beauty problem all these
like new cool Beauty bands there was
stuff like Anastasia or anastagia or
whatever it's cool it but there's also
loads of brands I've never heard of and
I spotted these and I think I've seen
Ingrid talk about these before so I
really wanted to give them a try they're
from a brand called doll face and it's
the pretty puff so these are like I
think they're like sponges you put your
clothes on and use it to cleanse your
face this one is the natural one so it
says it's exfoliating and then I also
bought this black one which says it has
bamboo charcoal in which is good for
purifying so these were really cool they
look like they're kind of already wet
and soaked in stuff but you're meant to
put your cleanser on it as well so look
before trying this when I get home
something a bit different I don't know
if you can get these at home and I think
that's all I got from Urban Outfitters
so on to Sephora the stuff I know you
guys all want to see now I went into
Sephora and I was thinking I'm going to
get stuff that is an hour
we don't have at home but I felt really
overwhelmed by that the huge store and
they're just sometimes I go shopping I
buy stuff because I think this would
make a really good blog post or I'd love
to feature this in a video but on this
trip I just wanted to buy stuff for me
that I knew that I'd really want or
needed and there just wasn't that much
stuff that I needed obviously I put so
much beauty products so I was trying to
be quite strict and I really wanted the
Oscar Blandi texturizing spray because
Ana uses it and it smells amazing but
apparently they've stopped selling Oscar
Blandi and Sephora they only have the
travel sizes at the till which is such a
shame so at first the first thing in
here is this little free bag I got
because I bought three of the little
Travel minis at the checkout I really
wanted to try the Kat Von D tattoo liner
this is the liquid eyeliner I've heard
so many people talk about this
everyone's it's amazing and I love my
Tom Ford liquid liner but it's really
pricey so I'm definitely gonna give this
a go and see how it compares I also
bought a clear brow gel from Anastasia
and I've actually used this one because
I really needed one I was using one from
RMK
and it was making my eyebrows far too
crispy that they actually hurt towards
the end of the day this one doesn't make
them crispy too but it really sets them
in place so definitely will repurchase
that when I run out I really like it I
also bought a rollerball version of the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana for her so
this is Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's
perfume and I tried both the black and
the white one black comb was a little
bit too sweet for me the white one is
kind of I think it's very scented it
really reminds me of the stellar perfume
it's been a more by a huge while and I
don't need it but so many perfumes but I
wanted a little rollerball because we
don't really get rollerball perfumes at
home so yeah this has been really good
for my handbag I picked up this foam
living proof we probably do have this at
home but we don't tend to get that many
travel sized things at home this is
called straight and it says that
heat-activated straightening humidity
blocking and weightless shine making
heat protection up to 450 degrees so
obviously I straighten my hair a lot do
this sounds like it would be great for
my hair another product I've had a lot
of people talk about is the Bosque rat
cleansing gel and I looked at the
original one most votes the lady and she
said that she preferred this one because
it's kind of more gentle on your skin it
still takes up you're off your eye
makeup really well but instead of just
being a just the cleansing oil this is
the cleansing gel that turns into an oil
so it's called the Tsubaki cleansing oil
gel so yes thousands of gel and as you
wipe it in it turns it to an oil so it
takes your makeup off as well it's kind
of cleansing the skin and these coming
really good packaging with the pump so I
think that really handy to use I picked
up another Sephora lip cream in zero one
always red because I'm actually running
low on mine this is just the best red
lip product that let me use I've spoken
about before it's like a thick cream but
it's so long-lasting that I actually
struggled to take it off in the evening
it's really really good though and it's
definitely like a WoW red lip I also
picked up a travel size of the only
Henrichs and white white and I really
actually don't love these but they do
travel sizes here and I liked it my
makeup off on the flight home from New
York because it's an overnight flight so
I thought these would be good for that
and because it's the travel size I'm not
like investing in a huge kind of box of
them and the final thing from Sephora is
actually for my mom she really wants me
to get her the living proof perfect hair
day because we don't sell this in the UK
we have living proof that this product
isn't available in the UK and it's a
five in one styling treatment that her
friend really recommended to her it says
it smoothes volumizes conditions
straightens and polishes so that's my
mom okay moving on here is my bag from
Kate Spade and I'd say this is probably
the most exciting and stuff that I
bought just because I absolutely love
Kate Spade and we went to the flagship
store and discovered that they have a
whole floor for home wear and I don't
think we get Kate Spade home we're at I
hope I've never seen it I love home
where the first thing I got actually
isn't from home where though it's a new
phone case I was on a hunt for a new
phone case and most of the ones I saw
were the same at that we had at home but
this one is new in and I really like you
I haven't put on my phone yet it's gold
and like reflective so you can basically
use as a mirror and it says hello
sunshine on it and I think that's really
sweet I love a good Kate Spade phone
case I know I kind of only just got my
Marc by Marc Jacobs one but it's quite
rubbery on the sides I don't love how it
feels where these wants just clip on and
I feel like they feel smaller on the
phone they just love the packaging that
Kate Spade
stuff comes in look at this box I bought
myself a little necklace as well as a
little treat it wasn't too expensive
comes in this little pouch and it's
basically a little necklace circle that
has an L initial in it and I think that
would look really sweet try it on it
comes to about there and I think this
was $58 okay so it wasn't too cheap but
it's not like crazy crazy money for a
really nice necklace so yeah I'm happy I
got that now this one in the big box is
probably the most ridiculous purchase as
you guys know I don't have my own house
yet so I definitely don't need plates
but as I said they don't do home wear at
home and I like to collect things under
my bed I can definitely use this in my
bedroom I'm gonna show you what it is
it's a little plate it's all wrapped up
I'll do a little cut away with gold
detailing that says odds and ends and I
just think that is so cute to put lay
your watch on or your jewelry or your
keys or whatever you want basically bits
and bobs you don't have home before on
this cute little plate and I love it I
just literally fell in love with it
Gemma bought one as well I don't know
why we definitely don't need plates but
it's so nice I just fell in love with it
I've just turned the aircon off I
completely forgot it was on so I really
hope that wasn't annoying you guys but
the next thing I'm going to show you is
from Whole Foods and you probably think
it's strange that we went to Whole Foods
because we do have loads at home there's
a lot of stuff you can't get at home
that you can get here there's just so
much more in terms of options and
Gemma's had complete like healthy food
freaks I was just following her around
and copy and what she was getting
because rich and Gemma have a lot in
common
and I went to buy him some stuff to add
to his birthday present for the first
thing I got is from Brian for Justin's
which I don't think we get at home and
this is the chocolate hazelnut butter
so this is kind of like a healthier
slightly version of Nutella I think
he'll love this I'm actually really
excited to try this as well
I also bought him some toasted coconut
chips with caramel sea salt from a brand
called dang again from Justin's to dark
chocolate peanut butter cups
he loves peanut butter flavored stuff so
I've gotten a couple of those and some
almonds Gemma is so obsessed with
almonds and apparently you just can't
get dry roasted unsalted almonds at home
it's like a real thing
I think a few places now might be
starting to do it but every time she
comes to America she just stocks up she
seriously has like a case full of dry
roasted unsalted almonds and I know rich
like sneeze so I got some for him okay
next up is really exciting if you've
hurdled into the glass you'll know it's
a really great peachy website that I've
read for years
and they've recently started their own
at beauty brand called glossy er as you
can see here and they had like a
temporary pop-up store and I saw before
I came that it was gonna be open whilst
I was here and I'm so excited so we
tracked down to where it was kind of
quite far from where we are saying and
we finally found it it's a really cute
little pop-up store and I basically got
one of the kits that has one of each
product in because I just really wanted
to try it so it came in a little box
like this this has a G on it and she
called a match to me to the foundation
oh gods like postcards and stickers
flying everywhere so it comes in two
bags like this but it's only for
products in the first bag is the glossy
err priming moisturizer it says
buildable hydrating cream and the bomb
calm so that's like a skin bomb like
all-purpose bomb and then the other two
products are a soothing face mist rose
water spray and a tinted moisturizer and
this is what she color matched me - I
think she matched me to medium and it
says perfecting skin tint and I tried
that on my hand in the store and it felt
really nice so I'm really excited to try
out these products because you can't get
to my home they don't ship to the UK I
was just very lucky that they had this
pop-up so whilst I was here and I'm
really excited to try it
CVS something are English people get
very excited about it because Duane
Reade and Walgreens and all of those
birbee I did most my shopping at CVS and
again there just wasn't that much stuff
they thought I needed Revlon Mabley
they're all kind of the same with a few
new things that I spotted and picked up
I bought quite a lot of sweets though
first thing something that all Americans
keep taking the piss out of I can't say
the first thing is something that all
Americans keep making fun of things are
getting because apparently they're
revolting but I've never tried them
candy corn it's that time of year
although like Halloween's sweet out and
I always see these in like films and I
really wanted to try these and I've got
them for rich as well more peanut stuff
for rich Reese's Pieces peanut butter
and peanut butter M&amp;amp;Ms I think we get
peanut M&amp;amp;Ms at home but not peanut
butter M&amp;amp;Ms for me I got some ice
breaker sours because I really like
these I think that's all the food the
first thing I got literally the first
thing I bought I love all of this was
this shaver I was so excited to buy it
or razor whatever you guys call it I
think I've seen flower talk about these
and they're so handy it's a travel sized
razor from Venus and we just don't get
these at home and it's so cute and
amazing for traveling I feel like I need
to get another one but I know it don't
it's just one of those like panicky
things because I know I can't get it at
home it's so cute I love this I also
bought some deodorant and there's such a
2-pack because Jemma said she always
bought these when she comes here because
they don't do this scent at home and
it's dubbed urgent in cucumber and green
tea how do we don't do this at home so I
thought that sounds really cool I'm
gonna get some as well they weren't
expensive so yeah but to pack up
deodorant on the revlon style i spotted
these lipsticks and i don't know if that
our at home i don't think i've seen them
they're called the ultra HD lipsticks
and I bought two one Impa tuna and one
in iris so it's like a raspberry pink
and I heard deeper berry like dark berry
so I'm really looking forward to trying
these lipsticks they look good on the
little stand but who knows they might be
quite drying it might be moisturizing I
will let you guys know I'm sure they'll
pop up on the blog somewhere
the final thing from CPS is from
Maybelline and this is one of their
color tattoos 24-hour cream eyeshadows
but these ones are the leather ones and
I don't think I've seen these at home
and it obviously different texture I
haven't opened it yet but I got the
shade chocolate suede which just looks
like a really easy Brown which is what I
like to wear so looking for its try
those because I really like the 24 hour
tattoo you like the original
okay I think I've just got one more
thing to show you and this isn't even
for me this is for my mom I went to Saks
Fifth Avenue to get her this because she
she had a long list of things she wanted
me to get her but this was the important
one it's from Rebecca Minkoff I love a
recommend cuff I have a bag myself that
I ordered online oh we're trying to open
this and she wanted a mini crosby so
this is one that has like a chain handle
I'll show you
she actually wanted in charcoal but they
only had black and I think it's really
nice and black so it looks like this
it's got a really des stick on the front
and a sit at the top and there's quite a
lot of space in this but a really nice
kind of color lining as well and the
handle just looks like this I think
she'll really get a good way over so
that's everything for my New York hope
as I said I've got two days left so who
knows what can happen I'll try and post
the rest of my haul on Instagram if
there's any more to come it's maybe less
intense than others there's a lot of
stuff but there's nothing that exciting
I don't think it's quite a lot of food
I've had such a great trip if you didn't
see my vlogs go and check them out I've
already put up part 1 and part 2 and I
just had the best time while I'm still
here I am having the best time so thank
you so much guys for watching this video
and I'll see you in my next one where
hopefully I have better lighting and I
don't look so pink see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
