in the morning that's better I look a
bit more human now I'm quickly gonna
grab some breakfast I bought some of
these um little yogurts my friend Jemma
says she has a whole one of these in the
morning but that feels like a lot of
yogurt I'm gonna give it a go but I
don't have a very big appetite in the
morning so I'm gonna have some joerger
and honey and granola and then this
morning I'm going to a place with a lamp
lighter London and I'm so so excited
they've invited me in to learn how to do
calligraphy which is something I've
wanted to do for so long like modern
calligraphy I think looks beautiful I
used to be quite arty when I was younger
but I just can't do it I think you need
the right tools and stuff so I'm gonna
head over to their kind of head office
studio it's called a studio and they're
gonna teach me how to do some
calligraphy and I can't wait so I'm
gonna take you guys with me to film that
and then I'm heading into town later for
some meetings I think I'm seeing Anna so
it should be a busy day you're good
honey
see granola so do you guys remember when
I bought this book near been inked by
Keira Perron oh so this is the lady that
owns Lamplighter London and this is such
a good book where you can literally
learn how to do calligraphy and practice
yourself which obviously I haven't
gotten to doing yet because I just have
no time but it's such a nice book so I
think I'm gonna be meeting here today
her studio so very exciting I'm gonna go
now I have no idea what to expect but I
will film whatever I can
well let me show you what I'm wearing
today I'm wearing my new shoes from a
sauce which I think it might be a little
bit uncomfortable cousin this is wearing
for the first time so I hope they're not
my jeans from Topshop my whistles top
and my Chloe back and I've talked my
hair up because I didn't have time to
curl it
I'm just parking but this parking sign
is so confusing
normally when there has a time it means
you can't park in those hours it says
free so I don't know that means let's
just hope I don't get a ticket I think
it's free it says free okay I'm in the
Lamplighter studio now and Kira's here
and we're gonna do some I think she's
going to teach me have to do numbers I
don't to give away too much about the
wedding but there's something that I
need to do that involves numbers and I
have no idea how to do it so she could
teach me how to do that this is the
studio I'll show you around it's so cool
like this like there's all the supplies
here imagine if I could write like that
it's so pretty
so think we're gonna do some stuff here
oK we've got all the kit laid out so ink
nib and then hot pen holder yeah it's
right and then like paper that you
can come see through all the letters
underneath
alphabet that I've just done it was so
relaxing so crowded here looks pretty
good
oh my god guys I think I found my new
hobby I love doing calligraphy Kiara and
Tina and the girls at Lamplighter London
are so so lovely I was in there for an
hour I think was like the best hour I've
had in months I felt so relaxed and I
really really enjoyed it she was so nice
and she gave me a pen and ink and stuff
so I'm gonna practice this weekend I
think now I might be able to do like
some of the wedding stuff myself I
thought I was gonna have to get someone
else to do and I just really enjoyed it
I feel like you know I've mentioned
before had my blog and YouTube always my
hobby and now they're my job I feel like
I haven't got a hobby
I feel like calligraphy could be my new
hobby sorry I'm like going off on one
but I just absolutely love that I just
had the best time and it was so so am i
certain I was talking in my head
sharp I had such a nice time I have so
many ideas I feel so inspired I just
want to go home and do you calligraphy
all day but I'm going out I have no
plans this weekend and that is what I'm
gonna be doing practicing and practicing
I learnt so many good tips about like
how to use the pen and the up and down
action definitely check out the
Lamplighter London website they have
like services they they you know they do
calligraphy for other people they
sometimes do workshops she has a book
which is really cool that I showed you
guys earlier so so good loved it I'm
home and I'm gonna have some of leftover
dinner from last night which was like an
aubergine tagine thing you'll have that
for lunch I'm really hungry it's quarter
to twelve it's not even that late and
then I'll probably head into town I've
actually got a couple of hours planning
to be in town so I'm gonna edit the
video that I filmed yesterday which you
hopefully would have seen already it's
the whole video if you haven't seen it I
will link it up over there okay I've
done some editing and now I'm gonna head
into town I haven't got a meeting in
till 4:00 but I'm gonna go to an art
shop because I need to buy some paper
ahsha's and wedding supplies
I'm in M&amp;amp;S there's any twice Anika's
glamorous life I just picked up some
gold calligraphy ink and some other
supplies so I can get practicing this
weekend they're like those two clips
made it look like I went into M and s
finishes he came out with calligraphy
ink M&amp;amp;S didn't have the nick as I wanted
and then I went to an art shop in Soho
so now I'm headed to gleam I'm gonna
catch up with Anna and everyone there
licking my peer box and then I've got
the meeting now I'm now in Burlington
Arcade which is why I like Piccadilly
Circus and Anna's here that way I'm not
wearing black we're now going to meet
with the lovely ladies for Chanel PR PR
Cosmo Chanel and they're gonna show us
all the new stuff that they've got and
it beats the one in here didn't even
know there was one in here just not
amazing this is very London in here the
meeting was really good and I love the
new collection our 3zo blog post on this
you guys could mean about it there and
I'm getting at home now because I use
exercise and I have seen quite a while
so Annie's get home in like get myself
in the mood okay I just got home quickly
changed and I'm gonna go to the park to
do a quick workout I'm so hungry though
I know you shouldn't eat and then work
out but I'm so hungry so I will see you
guys afterwards looking at much sweaty
er than I do now
I just got back from doing some exercise
and I'm so so hungry which is maybe
dinner and I'm very excited I'm gonna
eat this now I mean Richard just sitting
down watching TV after dinner and I'm
actually gonna use my Nibin ink book to
practice the calligraphy that I learned
today I've got a pen and ink everything
I need so I'm just gonna do some
practicing now I'm so impatient that I
got 2d and then I wanted to start
writing names but it's just not looking
good I don't know why I did Lily rich a
nanan I think it's cuz I saw tannin
today so she's on my mind I think I need
to go back and practice the full
alphabet it just gets so boring
what's not boring but I just want to
like be really good already
okay this is my alphabet practice
looking okay I can't get the s s s are
so hard they like treble clefs like on
drugs it's just really confusing me yeah
look okay I mean I feel like the pen
makes it look better than it actually is
I need to keep practicing
it's 10:58 p.m. and I'm gonna be really
sad and try and get the Kylie Jenner
eyes shadow palette because I'm really
sad and I think it would make quite a
good video if I could use it and review
it so I'm just gonna give it a go I
won't be upset if I don't get it but I'm
awake and it's launching in two minutes
so let's see that is insane I let you
run on the website at 11:00 on the dot
added it to my cart by the time the
because they put you in a holding area
by the time it put me through sold out
ridiculous no eye shadow is worth up
parently she sold out in one minute I
think they just put a small amount on
the first Laura product so that they get
a height and I hate that and now I'm
giving the the hype and the promotion Oh
makeup you just get sucked into it I'm
heading to bed I look so pale I hope you
guys have enjoyed today's vlog I will
see you on Sunday for another new video
see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
