all about why I love autumn and why it's
my absolute favorite season I love going
for long walks and just kind of going
into the woods and exploring me and rich
go for walks most weekends I love the
weather in autumn it's like cold and
crisp but you can still wear nice
clothes and it's definitely scarf season
the scarf is from Topshop I'm also
wearing a bag from Urban Outfitters and
some new trainers from adidas
I also love the berry tones in autumn I
love where I bury in my makeup and on my
nails so it's the perfect time of year
for me for makeup this nail polish is
Revlon vixen which is one of my
favorites I also love SV soulmate
they're very similar and it kind of goes
with any outfit I love
illamasqua magnetism lipstick I've worn
this for years it's a lovely berry with
quite a pink undertone I also love to
bake in the autumn time when it starts
getting a bit colder in the evenings
nothing like a good baking session this
is an apple and black fruit crumble is a
deliciously ello recipe and it's really
easy to make and so delicious I just
ground up the almonds and mix them with
some jumbo oats and then I just combined
some maple syrup some coconut oil and
some cinnamon and melt it all together
in a pan
once you add that to the oats and
almonds and mix it all together that's
pretty much your topping done so then
what I'm going to do is peel and cut up
some apples
and then I add the apples and
blackberries to a saucepan and add about
a centimeter boiling hot water I'm
preheating the oven putting the lid on
the saucepan and just letting the fruits
soften up add in a bit of maple syrup
and cinnamon for flavor then I add the
fruit first and put the topping on top
and put it in the oven to cook I'm gonna
put the full recipe for this down in the
description box it's so easy to make and
it's delicious
I love eating it for dessert for
breakfast pretty much all day I just
snack on it and it's so comforting at
this time of year I like to switch up my
wardrobe in the autumn as well I pretty
much wear monochrome most of the year
but I love to add textures and patterns
into my wardrobe and I do love a good
polo neck I just love a big knitted
jumper final favorite is just relaxing
in the evening and watching a good film
and snuggling up with a good cup of tea
a good film and a lovely blanket really
it's pretty much my favorite thing to do
so that's all from this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it here are my two
last videos in case you missed them and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
