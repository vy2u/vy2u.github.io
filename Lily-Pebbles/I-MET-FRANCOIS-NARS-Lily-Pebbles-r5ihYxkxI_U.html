well and having a good Sunday morning I
bought my stories whether to do a vlog
today or a kind of sit-down style video
I think I might do that style video in
some way maybe within a vlog another
time
anyway but I knew most of you guys just
prefer watching a vlog and I prefer
watching vlogs as well so I thought I
would just flop my day and I've already
got dressed and done my makeup I'm
wearing my purple and Other Stories
shirt I shall mine full and upper
stories and Asura's genes and then I'm
gonna wear my Gucci shoes these are my
misnomer necklaces I've got a whole day
and kind of early evening in town I've
done my makeup but my hair like just
turned and got so greasy and it takes me
a good two hours plus to do my own hair
and wait for it to dry and stuff so I've
been quite cheeky and I've booked in to
go to get a wash and blow-dry just at my
local place like 15 pounds so it's not
that bad yeah I just thought you know I
was so much going on today I haven't got
time to fit in a hair wash last night I
was up late editing a sponsored video
and it's really confusing actually
putting this vlog out now because on
Wednesday I've got a sponsored vlog and
then the Wednesday after that I've got a
sponsored vlog as well so I've already
done two vlogs but they've all gone up
in different orders depending on how
early the brand needed it so the one
that's going up in two weeks time they
needed it like three weeks early and
then the ones next week they needed it
today so and this one obviously isn't
sponsored so put it up whenever I like
so I've got three vlogs going up all in
the wrong order so I hope I make sense
when I'm talking about stuff and
referencing things but today I'm going
into town I have a meeting with PR I
want to talk to them about this like
book club thing they're doing to see
whether my book can fit into that
somehow I'm getting my eyebrows threaded
at linked brow bar
I can't wait they're so overgrown and
then meet up Anna and we're gonna meet
up with for any good and whoo I'm so
excited to meet let me talk on Instagram
and I think she sent me her book I
haven't got it yet but she is really
really cool
so we're gonna meet up with her and have
a coffee then I'm going to probably
clean for a bit and then I'm going to
meet France was not so excited about
that
what an inspirational guy and I've been
such a massive fan sorry I'm still sound
so blocked up it's just hay fever I
getting really bad in mornings and
evenings I've been such a massive fan of
NARS
for so many years so I'm really looking
forward to that and then I'm gonna head
home I'd like to check in on the house
at some point today so I might go this
evening I always get a bit nervous when
I've got a good day in town and I can't
go check on the house because there's
always something that you have to like
point out so yesterday when I went there
they were doing the underfloor heating
they had to done it under where the
kitchen island is gonna go so he has
asked them to kind of move that so we
don't have it under the island and if I
wasn't there that wouldn't have happened
so I feel like a big responsibility to
go there every day obviously riches at
an office every day so it's pretty much
all on me to be doing house stuff during
the day so it's tricky to balance it all
but we're still loving it it's it's been
such a good experience I'm really
enjoying it I'm gonna go make some
breakfast I don't think we have anything
in this house but I think we have some
eggs
okay I'm home from having my hair done
grabbing a quick Apple and I'm gonna
head into town really gross Mother's Day
I'm wearing like a winter coat which is
ridiculous
in early June but I don't really have
any like summer coats I don't know what
to wear when it's like drizzly out so
I'm gonna head my first meeting is in
the Liberty cafe which is beautiful so
keyboards are that
okay first stop Liberty and Briony just
counts this afternoon
yes you know something's come up so I've
got a bit of time this afternoon right
it's a gleam fun first Liberty
I've always so obsessed with the flowers
out here look over here
I'm gonna head to gleam to put this back
down and probably get some lunch on the
way because I haven't really eat so much
today and feeling a little bit hungry
okay I just had my Leone lunch I always
get with a meatball lunchbox the one
without the slaw I don't like this law
and fries when I'm like really hungry
that's my like alien guilty pleasure and
I've just come into a room to vlog
because it's really quiet in the office
today and I'm like too embarrassed to
vlog in front of everyone and everyone
who works is like super cool
so I thought I would show you what I was
just given at that meeting I met with
someone from TCS which is the
communication store it's like a PR
agency and often when you meet up with
PR agencies they bring you like any new
products or products that they think you
would like and often other people who
work in the PR agency who work on other
brands also like to throw stuff in the
bag so they've given me this like huge
heavy bag obviously I don't have to talk
about any of these things but I thought
I would just go through the back with
you guys and show you what's new what's
interesting hair is going so puffy
always like this on the first day of
wash okay I'm just gonna grab this so
much stuff in here just gonna grab the
stuff and talk through it Liz Earle
apparently she's got a cleanse and
polish for your body coming out that
comes instead of with the cleansing
cloth it comes with like emit the night
buff your body with as well am I allowed
to say that yeah she wouldn't told me if
I wasn't that to say that but this is
the hot cloth cleanse and polish
cleanser which I really like which is
also a massive fan of this use the men's
one although I think the men's one is
the same just with a different scent and
he uses it in the shower this is from
this works which is a brand I love
that's actually who the meeting was
about and this is their perfect legs
100% natural scrub this is so good I've
tried this
this is a no I think I've never seen its
outer packaging it's got pink Himalayan
salt in it and I love using this on my
legs as exfoliate I already have one of
these so I'll probably give this to a
friend well this is cool she was telling
me about this I've never heard of it the
brass called all eleven no it's not
brands called all even and this is the
color shield hydrating tinted protection
so finally this is like a foundation for
your body so you just kind of spray all
over your arms and legs and it's it
spray that really even without streaks
and it gives your skin just that kind of
like smooth look apparently Beyonce use
this at Coachella
so look II was trying that I don't know
what shade she gave me but hopefully it
will work for me also in here is the
Vita Liberata Beauty blur so I think
this is like the body blur but for your
face just even things out this in a
latte light moisturizing primer and skin
finish in one got some shampoo and
conditioner from away which is a brand I
love this is the repair range which I
haven't actually used this one so that
would be good to try and also their son
of a beach Ambra spray I actually got
sent this I can't use this because my
hair is too dry but it's really cool
it's a bit like Sun in used to be if
anyone remembers that from the 90s you
spray it in when you're in the Sun it
makes my hair go lighter so that is
really cool one of my blood and friends
should use that what else is in here
Paula's Choice and skin for skin
perfecting BHA liquid salicylic acid
I've got this and really liked it so I'm
going to keep that as a backup told you
there's a lot of stuff didn't ask for
any of these very kind of them and this
works in transit pollution shields this
is an anti-pollution spray on skin
barrier there in transit range is really
good actually
ah this is exciting a candle from do
teak the iris candle I've never smelled
this one actually I love love love
let me see oh my god it's strong I can
already smell it I've been just taken
off the plastic packaging oh it smells a
bit like power violets it's nice I
wouldn't say it was like my favorite dip
teks and i feel like it would make a
room smell quite fresh so I think it's
quite good for the bedroom oh my hay
fevers back there's a couple more bits
from Liz Earle
they're super skin concentrate which
I've used and I like and the botanical
essence number 15 perfume which I think
honors a big fan of theirs actually
knows what it smells like the next fifty
eight and a half case you didn't know
that Liz Earle does perfumes they do and
they really nice they come in this
really cute packaging the her before
pink clay which I also have I have quite
a lot of these things that's what I
thought I'd check here and some stuff
from Achanta car as well how cool is
this packaging that looks like the South
of France it's got a really really cool
packaging oh that's like a runs a
highlighter and then I think these must
be little eyeshadows yeah so there's
green oh look at that that's like a
brown with pink and gold running through
it finally a glossier bag and I think
these are the two new colors from the
cloud paints these are meant to really
good for darker skin tones which is
great so this storm which looks like a
kind of dark burgundy color and Dawn
which looks more orange and the cloud
paints are basically cream blushes if
you're a bit intimidated by the colors
because they all look really bright in
the packaging Emily Weis only vice
Emily Weiss I don't know as processor
name the girl who founded glossier I met
her and she actually recommended mixing
the colours obviously they look like
little tubes of paint I've never even
thought of that before so she often
creates a couple of colours mixes them
together in the back of my hand and then
uses them so they're really versatile
and you can use these shades even if you
have lighter skin you just use them in
different ways and mix them in different
colors so that is everything and I've
probably got a box full of stuff here as
well in my peer box
but I feel like if I go through that
with you guys it might be a little bit
overwhelming so maybe there was
something in there that you thought was
interesting I think the most interesting
things are that all even the way spray
if you're into that kind of thing and
the two new cloud paints and oh the shun
sky and I'm looking for that little body
thing when that comes out as well
I'm going to tighten this up I had to
interrupt the time lapse to show you
guys this really really cute delivery
it's from caught these people for 10
year anniversary which is marred
actually both are - it's one of the
first piece of runs I ever fought to
halt it when I thought you loved each
other really appreciate what's inside
there's a cute note saying thank you and
then they've got this which is like a
personalized thing for me and it tells
me my first order was in the 27th of
March and I've made 18 orders and that
probably cuz they started 7 to be lots
of stuff in my first order was the
Beautyblender zero and then the thing
I've ordered the most is of course the
therapy Himalayan detailed salts and
then in here so few they've got like
some broth and then they've basically
got the best selling products from every
year so they launched here's the list
which is really interesting to see if I
cutie blender centric molecules so I
love those the merlot Greenbaum Armas
Beauty living Luminizer I remember when
all of these are popular liquid gold
Beverly Hills brow Wiz beverly hills
dipbrow Hammad oscar renascence
depending gel and glad that leader and
then beauty beauty as well really and
just to see which products don't
and then in this cool little thing and
really cute cookie as well so these are
the best-selling products over the last
ten years from Colt bTW I'm so glad to
have a new one of these really cool he's
such a clever idea absolutely love the
bag that they've made and they've like
stickers and a pop sock or whatever it's
