have ever had a physical of war before
and it's so pretty
good morning everyone today is Tuesday
the 6th of December and I've got quite a
nice day today with quite a few you'd
like fun things going on thank you by
the way so much for your comments on
last night's video it was my blog from
Saturday I was very overwhelmed by the
amount of really nice lovely comments so
thank you and I was also really
interesting hearing from people who also
got into car accidents because some of
the things you're saying I was like yes
it's so true like you don't stop
remembering how you felt at the time
until like days later and lots of
people's telling me to take easy and I'm
trying but unfortunately this is like my
busiest week ever
yesterday it was crazy I didn't vlog but
I had like some jobs to do and lots of
videos to film and it was just one of
those days where everything was going
wrong it was quite stressful so if you
follow me on snapchat I was moaning a
lot but today should be nice still busy
but nice things this morning I'm
starting at Jo Malone at their townhouse
because they're having an intimate
Christmas event just to say thanks for
all the support throughout the year and
obviously Jo alone helped out a lot at
my wedding so I'm really excited to go
and have like a Christmasy breakfast
with everyone so it'd be nice it's
really really cold outside so I'm
wearing a big scarf this is a sauce I'm
wearing my Zara coat I've got like a big
jump underneath it I can't stop wearing
I have washed this by the way and my
Gucci bag jeans and boots oh I'm just
like I need to get some gloves as well
that's freezing
it's not quite as cold anymore kind of
warmed up after going on the tube I'm
just heading to Germany now I didn't who
are scary time looking forward scene
they're heading into the gem Malone
offices now look how crispy it is in
here
there's a huge Christmassy
breakfast-table here
hi my name
million tomorrow dinner photo shoot
behind the seat
my little ornament up on my tree I'm
back home and what's the time okay it's
cooler past 11:00 I've probably got
until about three o'clock actually no
he's get ready so I've got till two
o'clock to do some work I'm gonna try
and be really productive
let me tell you about
a couple of hours of work done I'm gonna
make myself some chili for lunch
Speight sir but it need rice or anything
cuz I'm going for afternoon tea I'm
gonna start tonguing not tonguing I'm
gonna use my straightness to start
putting some waves into my hair I've got
about an hour till I need to leave and I
have no idea what I'm wearing yet
oh I haven't said where I'm going so
first what I'm going to buy Terry's
house her name's not by Terry her name's
Terry but you know the brand by Terry
founder Terry is having she's having
some of us round her house for tea again
like a before Christmas thing to say
thanks for supporting the brand all year
and I think there'll be some familiar
faces there media is gonna be there
again I saw her this morning and Lydia
not sure who else and then I'm going to
the InStyle Awards so the project 13
awards I won best beauty blogger and
tonight I'm getting an award but it's
quite like a casual vibe this is in a
bar so I really don't know what to wear
I don't know how dressy or not dressy to
be I have no idea I think it's like a
cool bar vibe I'm just gonna do my hair
and then figure out what
you
trying on I basically decided to wear my
play suit from next but the back is
quite open it shows my bra and I don't
really like showing my back but then I
found a safety pin I thought I could
safety pin it although there's no one
here I'd have to get someone to do it
there and then I thought maybe I could
wear something on top and then I put on
my new Topshop blazer which I know I've
just worn but I don't care and it goes
so well so I'm gonna wear my next play
suit which is like this I actually think
it looks even better with the blazer on
because the blazer comes just below the
play suit and I think it looks really
cool so this is all gonna wear with my
Topshop boots and I feel like it's
dressy but it's not like high heels like
toes out like dress on type thing I feel
like this is the perfect in between
between overdressed and underdressed I'm
pretty happy with it yeah I'm so glad I
got this blazer really wasn't sure at
the time and I feel like it's already
coming so Andy rich is gonna kill me for
this but he has to forgive me because
I'm his wife now that is the best part
about being married so yeah
so I'm gonna wear I just touched up my
makeup a little bit I'm wearing
Charlotte Tilbury very Victoria on my
lips I think that goes my lips are just
still too sore to do anything too heavy
I'm wearing my Chanel handbag and is
actually coming down from vitam to come
to the InStyle Awards with me she's so
so kind because rich can't come he's got
an important presentation tomorrow and
we'll original it was gonna be me and
mark and rich and then mark couldn't
come and then rich couldn't come so
Anna's coming just coming all the way
from Brighton just for the evening but
it was so nice to have her there
hopefully she can vlog me getting my
award I've been told I don't have to do
a speech if it turns out I do I'm gonna
freak out because I just don't know
what's a pop and thank you I'm excited
like I hope I actually get like a
physical award that would be really
exciting ok what's the time and he's
getting Boober it's a really long car
journey like an hour but I can't walk to
the tube in these shoes so I'm gonna
have to just try my best not to get
really carsick because that won't be fun
for everyone it by Terry I don't care
how cool an event is I'm not going
anywhere without a curtain scarf it's
bloody freezing
I'm just waiting outside because Amelia
just got here I like watching her drive
up and down the road like doing
three-point turns where you definitely
shouldn't do three-point turns and then
try a part I'm going to go meet her and
we can go in together look how beautiful
this table is oh my gosh this is mine
because my name
it all points right to the
I've just been in Terry's house and it
was absolutely beautiful I've never ever
been in a house - oh my gosh were like
statues everywhere it was gorgeous and
she's so kind she it was a really
intimate teeth just say thank you and
she really was like thank you so much
for all the support she's great the
great present like normally don't meet
like a founder of a brand like that yeah
it was really really nice amazing tea
now I'm on my way to the InStyle Awards
in a very fancy car actually that's
driving me there which is exciting and
I'm really looking forward to seeing Ana
when I get there I've just arrived I
like got out my fancy car and like ran
away from it cause really embarrassed
for me the really few milli
let's we do you could walk Alaska so
this is where it is lights of Soho it's
literally like a lighting place what
this looks so cool
my son
and the winner
okay look guys I got an actual award and
if you have ever had a physical of water
for and it's so pretty I'll show you
probably when I get home very excited
and it's quite quick and enjoyable these
things can go on it was painted it with
in a cool bar let's see James mother
peace box
Megan ellaby says we broke on bridge of
thorns
okay I'm heading home I'm leaving this
one the next we seen it Jesus this is a
fake to buy because I'm gonna put the
camera away and then we're gonna keep
talking and vlogging Lateran it was so
nice for Anna to come with me to the
awards she's a very very supportive
friend I would do the same for her of
course I mean then we had dinner
together and caught up and like we
always make it like a work meeting as
well but it was like half work half like
normal personal stuff 21:33 1:09 is 9:33
and I need to pack because I'm going to
Devon tomorrow I don't really know if
I'm going to Devon or Dorset I always
get them confused by thinking going to
Devon tomorrow is the gleam Christmas
party we're staying overnight so I need
to pack a bag I don't know what's packed
but I'm gonna do it now and I need to
schedule I mean I need to edit this vlog
my thought of the day is that if you
work really hard at something for a long
time
ie six years then people might
acknowledge you and give you an award
and you'll feel very proud of yourself
but don't do it for that purpose because
you should be able to reward yourself
and feel satisfied and proud without
someone else telling you you're good at
it that's my way of saying thank you for
the award I think do you have thought of
the day which is sort of the day that
his head hurts which has a really
important work presentation tomorrow in
practicing for weeks that's in a week
less than a week oh you found out last
week of doing it that makes you sound
I'm prepared
oh they invited me to it laughs I'm
gonna end the vlog here and I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
