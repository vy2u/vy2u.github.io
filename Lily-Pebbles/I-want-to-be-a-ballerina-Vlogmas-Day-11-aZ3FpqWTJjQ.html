got up quite early this morning because
I have a lot to do before I need to
leave the house I'm not wearing a watch
and maybe like 20 minutes I had to so I
wore my emails and blah I'm editing
whatever and I'd wash and blow-dry my
hair or straighten it and that you guys
know that takes a long time so I've just
finished doing my hair and today I'm
going over to Anna's house because we're
gonna film a couple of videos we're
doing like I said the betta chat for
hers in a Christmas video for mine and
then tonight we're going to see the
Nutcracker ballet I'm so excited
Clinique are taking us which is so nice
of them and I think tonight is like the
preview night and I'm really excited
because I studied the music for the
Nutcracker when I was doing music at
school like your dance of the sugarplum
fairy you'll know it if you hear it it's
like doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo that
one and I don't think I've ever actually
seen ballet like properly and it's meant
to be amazing so I'm really excited but
I have to think about what I'm wearing
and I have Taylor's stuff with me to
Anna's and I'll probably have that
tonight and it's all like logistics
stuff so I'm gonna now go around and
pick up all the products I need for
filming today get into some nice clothes
and head over to Anna's tasting about an
hour to get to her so I should probably
get going
I've got so much to take with me today
like Christmas jumpers everything so I'm
taking with me this huge Aston or of
London bag they sent me this as a
present a couple of weeks ago and it's
like I'm completely in shock I so don't
deserve something I was like wow that's
the best thing I've ever been the same
ever didn't even like this is just like
a present to say I think it was Merry
Christmas
very lucky it's a beautiful bag it would
be perfect for traveling it's absolutely
huge I feel like we can't even like show
you how huge it is I've stuffed it full
of stuff you can get so much in there
got my laptop in there Christmas jumper
Santa's hats everything I like how it's
really structured as well I hope you
guys don't think I'm showing off when I
say that things have been sent to me I
just know when you to think that I
bought them because I very rarely buy
really expensive things I'm not really
that kind of person like I buy a lot of
high street stuff so just didn't what
need to think that I go out and just buy
kind of a smell
Londyn bags because I don't I'm just
very very lucky all right before I get
honors I'm just making a quick bit of
lunch and there's literally nothing in
my fridge but there's this little pouch
like a superfood salad which is pretty
neat from M&amp;amp;S super wheat berry I
thought that would just fill a hole it
makes two portions so I'm just gonna
have one I'm obsessed
this source at the moment so I think I'm
going to use this as well you get it in
like Thai Vietnamese restaurants it's
really spicy but really good
I'm Anna's now and the whole tube
journey I was thinking I put soy sauce
in that salad and it made me so thirsty
you know and you like the thought of a
glass of water actually do you want to
cry so I'm just enjoying this yeah here
now I'm gonna film I'm so excited to
pursue my at you and by the way Anna
used to be a professional ballet dancer
and then she was nearly in the
Nutcracker and she decided to pack it
all in for lipsticks so she moves
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
I'm stopped singing that all day haven't
seen it yeah okay I'm gonna do my
lipstick before we film and I'm gonna
use the Mac lip pencil I bought
yesterday and vino and the Charlotte
Tilbury lipstick that I really like whoa
at the moment which is I wish forget the
name of this love Liberty wearing a
bright red jumper so I didn't want to
wear bright red lips I think I could
dark purpley would be nice and
Christmassy and will go with my Santa's
hat I've done my lip liner and this is
how I always like to do it I don't like
to do just a line because then when the
lipstick fades away you're just left of
the line so I like to fill in kind of
thick line maybe let's just leave it
like this for the video yeah start new
training like nineties I have my Santa's
hat on which is great so it means don't
really have to do anything to my hair
and we're gonna film Anna's video first
so I've got a hair in my mouth on no
hands you just have to do all that we're
gonna do the beach at first we have ten
questions yes and I haven't really
thought them through yet normally I
prepare a little bit beforehand only
have one put up with me
but to be sure ages probably just been a
month soon as you guys loved my
behind-the-scenes stuff the other day
after I'll show you an is behind the
scenes so we film in Anna's bedroom and
she has one right here so that goes to
like the back cuz I that corner would be
really dark it's not lit and then
another light here that likes this dark
little corner and then the ring light is
lights us our face and she also uses
this little kind of external microphone
which I don't use because I'm lazy but
it does make sound better and she has
saying cameras me canon 600d and the
Sigma lens oh you've got the fancy like
thing on it okay snazzy outfit son of a
nutcracker little nurse starts to go
with it this is all good we're gonna get
started so I'm gonna leave you guys just
here in this little ledge and maybe I'll
film a little bit of us filming I can't
really do that in my video because it's
gonna ruin Christmas jumpers and I
haven't got any bottoms on so I'm just
gonna be in tights we finished filming
Anna's video it was really easy and fun
yeah so now we're gonna film I won I
need to get to my Christmas jumper and
tights sorry so I decided to put some of
Anna's pajamas on top of my tights
because it was getting a little bit
sexual here's my Christmas jumper I love
it I haven't tried it on yet this is
from Primark I got it in a small bit
more fitted than previous years
this is an actual stocking that you can
put things in amazing I genuinely like
this jumper feel like I could wear this
out Anna's gonna get into her Christmas
jumper and then we're gonna film the
Christmassy video Q&amp;amp;A thing it's a wrap
for the Christmas video you get it I
said it I didn't do it it's a wrap
literally I had fun now I just want to
sing Christmas songs better one no I
really want to put things in my stocking
yeah so I think we're now going to I
don't I don't know I don't know how to
finish the sentence I might import those
files am I gonna get some food the world
is our oyster
alright solder one of Anna's delicious
chocolate coconut milk drinks and think
gonna edit what we just bill
because when your doom blog misused to
have time for dawdling around that's not
a word addling no he's our dad Lane
didn't say that um I don't know what
that alene means but I'm just gonna edit
now and then we might go out I think
we're both gonna have a bit of an
editing session but the videos I filled
with Anna are so easy to edit I mean
we've got a lot of laughing to edit out
but we film pretty quickly when were
together I don't know why these because
we're just chatting and it's fun so oh
oh
hmm home the little copper bowl I love
this I so nearly bought this when I
bought other copper stuff marks right he
was like what the hell are we gonna put
in that patio fruits fruit you know
napkins anything it just loved that
hmm copter stuff so don't know how long
I've been editing for but things seem to
have got a little bit dark in here but I
finished my edit so whoo and it's just
watching her video through I mix 14 and
then I might upload it feeling quite
productive but also quite sleepy because
it's very dark
Anna's found an old facebook thread with
her a friend
she scrolled all the way to the top and
it's like about her message to her about
mark this guy and then I also he got
everything you wanted so this is really
cringey
I just needed to tell someone that was
one thing he didn't get to and then he
said he wondered if it was
we texted back saying I wanted you
Christmas Oh
then he think back thing I wanted again
from a package six years ago two
thousand eight thousand egg why was I
here I just had a genius moment we were
sitting here in the dark all like sleepy
like we need to go out we were gonna go
out early for dinner before the show but
then we all are quite bothered and then
I realized they were going somewhere
that's may Homeslice and I've been
craving pizza for so long and we haven't
read The Home Slice for ages and you
guys always go and might tweet us so a
great time slice did you recommended it
I actually have me for ages so we're
gonna go and eat giant pizza and I'm
excited about that road walkies common
garden and we're just hoping that that
homes letters table is it open
oh yeah cross all your fingers and toes
and okay she's running think they're
space
the weights is in that place so good
looking and I accidentally asked the man
I said can we have the big salami is
that all is it and then you made this
action flustered they got pretty oh the
Christmas decorations are not common
garden Anna hasn't seen a sister act
please someone join me and the thing
each is a complete weirdo getting angry
it's all a happy day okay we just
assumed Moss's Lane Hotel oh it's a
ranger for my I see we're gonna have a
few drinks and canapés and some other
ballet area so so much
you're gonna go find our seats and then
me and I are gonna do it like spoon I
need to make sweet
and it's amazing public awesomeness
minute bombs cuz recycles water look at
their bombs and I thought the men's go
home
yeah absolutely amazing I just I love
the music for my it's so beautiful I
really enjoyed it
did you enjoy your first bit their
stomachs crazy muscles right I'm home
now and I'm gonna make myself a hot rope
inna and then go upstairs to edit my
vlog and some of you guys asked how I
make a hot Raveena it's literally a
Ribena but instead of using cold water I
use kettle water so I'm gonna make one
of those now it's really good if you
have a sore throat I think it's a habit
from back when I had a long hair but
when I get home I always have to tie my
hair up okay there's definitely
something wrong with my bedroom whenever
I walk into a gym I get such a drive
through and I wake up in the morning
with a dry throat you might be the
heating sorry
moaning again but it's very weird in my
room so tomorrow is national Christmas
jumper day I think I definitely needs
double check I will look like a fool but
I think it is and obviously I want to
take part and be jolly and merry so I'm
gonna wear my Christmas jumper that I
wore today in Anna's video on my video
whatever and because it's got an actual
stocking that you can stuff I thought
it'd be a nice idea to put some like
little individually wrapped chocolates
in there in my stocking and throughout
the day
it's like a little mission if anyone
complements me on my jumper I'll give
them a chocolate I think that might be
quite fun so I think we're gonna do that
that's if I can get some chocolates in
the morning I'm going to duck and waffle
first thing and literally I need to be
there at 8:30 in the morning that's what
time I normally wake up so I don't know
how that's gonna happen but I've got a
breakfast with Benefit Cosmetics and I
love benefit and we're gonna meet there
well I've met them before I think it's
the founders daughters they're like
first cousins because the founders are
sisters and their two daughters right do
a lot with the brand so the guys duck
and waffle for breakfast it's like a
Christmasy thing with benefit and then
I've got a meeting
we do some work and then tomorrow night
I'm babysitting like a good auntie so
yeah I'm just gonna check online to make
sure it's definitely national Christmas
jumper day tomorrow but if it is I'm
gonna wear my Christmas jumper and we're
gonna stuff it with chocolates I'm gonna
take off my makeup now because my
lipstick is as you can see it's
completely faded and it's time for bed
gonna get into my pajamas I'm gonna open
my laptop like I normally do at 11:00
p.m. start editing probably a seat by
one and then I need to be up at 6:30 I'd
say mmm that's gonna be tough I hope you
guys have enjoyed today's vlog I loved
the ballet if you if there's still
tickets available definitely go and see
the Nutcracker it was completely magical
and amazing what amazing experience see
you guys tomorrow for vlogmas day 12
I'll see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
