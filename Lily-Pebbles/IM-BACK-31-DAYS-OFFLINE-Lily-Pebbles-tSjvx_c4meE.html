been a long time since I've done this
let me put my tea down I am back on the
Internet where do I even start at the
end of September actually on the 1st of
October I put up a photo on Instagram
and Twitter and I said to you guys be
right back
having some time away from the internet
and in my head I was thinking I'm gonna
try and do this for the whole of October
and but I didn't want to tell you guys I
didn't want to put like a time limit on
it because honestly after two weeks I
might have felt like coming back and I
just wasn't sure how I was gonna feel so
I didn't put a time on that and I'm
sorry if that was frustrating for anyone
and but I actually did manage to do the
whole month without any content
uploading so for any of you that weren't
sure what my kind of break was I was
going on the internet but definitely not
as much I think naturally when I wasn't
putting content out there there was less
for me to check I put all the apps and
social media apps to the back of my
phone so I was definitely checking far
less than usual but I was going online
yeah that's where I kind of read my news
and stuff and I didn't want to be
completely alone and bored or month it
was mainly about not sharing anything
online not making any videos or blog
posts or tweeting or Instagram or
commenting or anything like that and the
reason I did it I actually don't really
have like a straight answer for you it's
a mix of many things it's a mix of
September was my busiest month ever
completely overwhelmed me and I've got
some really big projects on I really
just needed to focus on this month and
focus on that kind of job alone it was a
mix of that and also I just got into a
really weird negative space at the end
of September I'm sure you guys noticed I
was like tweeting very angrily a lot and
I was I felt like I was getting a lot of
hate for unnecessary stuff and I was
finding it frustrating and getting hate
and stuff is fine but when you're in
like a bad headspace it's really
difficult
handle it and I was just I just kind of
hated life and I hated my job and that's
just not what it's about because I
actually love my job so I really wanted
to know what it felt like to just be a
normal person like someone who has a job
where they don't really have to tweet
all the time and that's not me
complaining I love my job but I really
just wanted to know what it feels like
to not have to be on social media all
the time because then I knew I would
appreciate it more when I came back and
it's been a very interesting month the
first week was really really difficult I
was literally thinking in 140 characters
it made me realize how often I'm sorry I
feel like I haven't spoken yet today and
my voice it made me realize how often I
just tweet my thoughts immediately
because I think something and then I'd
go to tweet and be like oh I'm not
tweeting this month so it was really
weird and very interesting for me to
notice how often I really do just think
and then tweet and there isn't really
much space between those two things so
the first week I found really hard the
second week I suddenly felt like my head
was so clear my thoughts were becoming
more kind of elaborate and I'd walk to
the tube station and instead of like
scrolling through social media I would
just have thoughts have my own thoughts
and I know it sounds crazy and to those
of you who don't do social media for
your job you probably could have told my
friends about this you probably can't
even imagine what it's like but the sort
of jobs that we have as fun as they are
and kind of flexible as they are we
don't have time off I haven't had a day
off the internet in eight years even
when I go on holiday I am doing some
kind of social media so it's very
strange for me to suddenly feel like I
have these thoughts and I don't I felt
very cleansing and my head was starting
to kind of I felt like a fog was like
clearing by the third week I was loving
life sorry that's the dishwasher I
literally wasn't even reaching for my
phone to ever post on Instagram or
Twitter or anything I like had
completely forgotten about it it just
it's like I felt like a normal person it
was so weird and I just never felt the
need to tweet or anything I was really
enjoying it and I was a bit worried
actually that I was loving it too much
and I thought am I ever gonna want to go
back to the internet and then by the
fourth week which is kind of what I'm in
now and I'm filming this and then by the
fourth week which is kind of what I'm in
now while I'm filming this I started
missing it again and I knew I would I
knew I'd want to come back I'm a
creative person I love creating stuff
and
and that's like the fav my favorite part
of my job so I am excited to come back
and it's feels weird to be filming this
video but I just want to say most
importantly thank you guys so much this
whole internet break has made me realize
what an incredible audience I have you
guys were so supportive when I said I
was going offline and then even not
knowing how long it was happening you
know in the third or fourth week I had
people being like come back we miss you
but there were all positive supportive
comments I literally don't think I got
one single negative comment about me
taking a break which I appreciate so
much because I think it's important in
every job for people to take holidays
and a proper holiday means not doing
your job so in your job as social media
I think time off the internet is
important and it's definitely something
I've learned I've realized now coming
back I'm going to give myself some more
boundaries know when to get off line
take some more holidays maybe which just
came home maybe they take like more
holiday days throughout the year like a
traditional job and yeah just I really
don't want to get back into that place
where I'm lying on the sofa watching TV
and I'm scrolling through Instagram and
then I put my phone down and then within
five seconds I've picked it up again to
do it like I just don't think it's
healthy so I'm definitely more aware of
that so thank you guys so much for your
patience I really really appreciate it I
have lots of exciting things coming up
both personal and work stuff and I can't
wait to tell you guys all about them I
feel like when I do you will understand
why I needed a break
B I'm really excited to be back I don't
know what else to say I feel like I
don't you justify it that much you guys
were so kind about me taking a break so
I don't want to bang on too long about
this but quickly if any other youtubers
YouTube friends watching this video I
really really really encourage you to
take a break
I feel like by doing a month it made me
realize that week isn't enough two weeks
is probably enough but I actually think
by the third weeks when I really noticed
it and it's very scary to take a break
you worry that your audience won't stick
around or brands won't want to work with
you anymore but everyone has been so
kind and I really think it's okay people
don't notice that much so if you're a
youtuber I encourage you to take a break
it was pretty life-changing I got so
many messages from YouTube friends like
asking me like what are you doing
why how's it working so I just thought I
would say that I definitely definitely
think it was a good idea so today's
Sunday it's technically still October
but I'm a pre filming this video so I
have something to go up in November and
Rich's sister and her boyfriend are
coming down for the day they haven't
come down to London for a while so
that'd be really nice I think we're
going to go to chicken sours in Covent
Garden for lunch I haven't been there
for ages then we might have a little
walk around Covent Garden I think
they're gonna go to the Natural History
Museum I need to come back and do some
work rich nice a decent work as well but
it's like that nice time of year where
it's nice to stay in I feel like I've
missed all the awesome content by taking
October off but I've thoroughly been
enjoying autumn I just love it when the
weather's when it's not too cold yet but
the leaves are pretty colors and you can
wear a coat I just I really love this
time of year I'm gonna update you guys I
think in my next video on all the things
that I've bought throughout the month
because obviously I haven't been sharing
them on Instagram or anywhere so I'll do
like a little haul for you guys I
haven't gone crazy but there's been a
few things I've picked up throughout the
month this jumper is the cashmere jumper
that I got on the trip to New York I
with Bobbi Brown and it's so soft
absolutely love it we stayed up really
late last night watching stranger things
I think we're on Episode five or six
it's so so good stranger things too on
Netflix I love it it's just so like
beautifully 80s I'm trying to think what
else I want to update you on I feel like
when I come back on Wednesday I'm gonna
do like a little story update on things
that I've been up to so hopefully you
guys would have seen that follow me on
Instagram if you don't already because I
do love to do stories on there I got my
hair redone I went to hirtius ins and I
saw Jason who does my color he redid it
it's obviously very natural which we
wanted I don't want to go like really
blonde I think it just needs to look
like a really nice natural balayage
which it does and Shawn cut my hair he
is brilliant okay I think that's all for
this little intro quick update though
actually in terms of coming back I am
thinking of doing one video a week for a
little while just while I still have a
lot of things going on I think I'm going
to try and do a video every Sunday and
then if I have like a brand sponsored
video I'll pop it up on a Wednesday
me and Anna be talking
- for a while and we both feel like one
video week is kind of what we need to do
to make our work-life balance a bit
better but I do have a girl starting
soon who's gonna try and help me out as
like some kind of assistant one or two
days a week I have no idea how that's
even going to work if it works then that
would definitely free up some time but I
think in the new year I'll have like a
clearer idea of my upload schedule so
for now I'm gonna like try out one video
a week sometimes two videos a week I
know you guys don't mind me being
flexible so I'll just tweet and let you
know if there's a new video right let's
get on with the day so I could show you
guys what I'm wearing today so I've
shown you the cashmere jumper this coat
is from Topshop long and checked and I
love it so one of the things that I have
bought in the last month but I'll show
you properly in that whole video my
Gucci Soho disco bag my Urban Outfitters
jeans and my fans this has pretty much
been my uniform for the whole month and
I love it so many people are like
talking about trying not to wear jeans
and a jumper so much I love Reggie's
another jumper so I am fully embracing
it
we're gonna go to Covent Garden now and
have some lunch I need to lock up
everyone's downstairs ready to go
we're in Covent Garden I've been here
four years
blogging again and back rich doesn't
seem very excited we got you're walking
so fast as an agony I had like my first
PT session in two weeks yesterday and
coffee I'm absolutely in agony coffee
ice cream on floor okay guys chicken
sours a hunger it's 12:30 give me an
early lunch but I'm ready you ready yes
I understand
the first time we came I can't remember
what the menus like
to be
we just finished lunch and it was then I
got run over really yummy and it's like
a Korean inspired chicken place so I had
chicken wings and chicken nugget type
things and pickles and chips
it was pretty on me and I'm now gonna go
into squirrel earth because everyone I
know has their birthday in November so
I've got about seven cards they need to
buy I panicked they were waiting outside
for me too many cards to buy too little
time I'm gonna do it during the week
instead so I think I'm gonna just do a
crown cotton Gordon now yeah what do you
have the key
chicken sandwich huge bitch chicken
my fault yes
I forget what it's like to vlog you get
asked by people of coffee shops if
you're on holiday because they just seem
you're a tourist but they've got hot
chocolate as a little after lunch street
there's a Rococo shop here now so we're
gonna go take a look inside
they're doing is really cool
collaboration with roald dahl and
they've got all the different line books
this one's mr. Twitter says but sardine
Stilton and cornflakes in it but
actually tastes like blue cheese milk
chocolate crispy rice banana yogurt I'm
good
what do you think about those Sogeti
riches mama president forgetting her
these they look like asparagus but
they're actually chocolate that's really
clever it's coming to shop good our kids
I've never heard I mean I think I feel
like I've had someone talk about it but
I've never been in here kind of got home
where beauty and clothes it is really
cool
put your own socks essential you got to
suck from here super fancy I've got my
Sexton H&amp;amp;N wonders who will shrink first
cook you want to pop into the pizza from
nursery shop became here when Ana came
to London recently I just love it so
much I love looking around
okay I am home we had a really nice
little wander uncon garden a really nice
lunch in chicken Sowers I'm gonna get on
some work but before I do I thought I'd
quickly sit and chat to you I was just
in my office and I had this on my Beauty
desk and it reminded me there's so many
things I couldn't talk about when I was
offline so I'll probably put them in
some videos as I kind of gradually come
back online but this is the new glossy
APF you know I got send which is really
exciting and I didn't know they were
launching a perfume I think some of the
first orders that people made when they
launched in the UK and they sent a
little vial of perfume I didn't get one
of those with my order I found that all
the delivery was okay I think they had a
bit of trouble when everyone started
ordering so there's a delay on my
delivery I just got a couple of bounced
serums and an SPF like top-up anyway I
then got sent the perfume when it
launched it's really exciting it comes
it's really called packaging with an
elastic round it's all pink and red and
it's called glossy au and I'm wearing it
today actually I'd read a review online
that said it was a bit like the molecule
oh one perfume but I don't find it is at
all it's actually quite floral I find um
it's probably a bit more powdery and
girly than I would normally pick for a
perfume but there's something about it I
like that makes me want to kind of keep
it I love the packaging it's a little
pink glass bottle with a red lid and
it's got this like thumb imprint which
makes it really easy to hold when you're
spray in it I love that it has lasted
quite well throughout the day I like it
there's something interesting about it I
wouldn't say as my favorite ever perfume
but worth trying I would say also on my
lips I'm wearing something new from Dior
this is Dior rific matte fluid and it
can be used on your lips or your cheeks
it's like a velvet matte color and this
is in charm so I'm wearing it on my lips
now and I really like the color I
haven't tried it yet on my cheeks but
I'll show you what the actual bottle
looks like it looks like a nail polish
it's really cool and then you take off
the lid and it's a little doe foot
applicator really cool I'm just excited
to be wearing lipstick again because as
you guys might notice my lips are so
much better than they were think I've
finally found a cure which is crazy
because I've been to so many doctors
including
top dermatologist in the UK I've been to
every pharmacist I had like cracks in
the corners of my lips as well they got
so bad throughout October and then my
sister went on holiday and she forgot to
take her face moisturizer with her and
she always uses this on her kids bodies
because they get quite Joy X moist skin
like her so she was like oh I'll just
use theirs then what their body moisture
that I'll just use it on my face in the
meantime she put on her lips she had the
same problem as me and her lips got so
much better just overnight so she told
me to try it
it's dip base cream and this is the
amoliant people who have eczema normally
use this it's just basically like a
really heavy moisturizer
I basically smother it all over my lips
and they're like 80% better I can't
believe what a difference this is made
and none of the doctors or pharmacists
recommended this at all you can use as
much as you like it's not a steroid
cream it's just a moisturizer so if you
do get really really dry lips I would
highly recommend this it's completely
changed everything it's so soothing when
my lips are so dry and itchy I'm so
happy I'm so happy that my lips are
finally feeling better and I can
actually wear lipstick again it's Sunday
afternoon all I really want to do is
watch stranger things we didn't finish
it last night and I'm just loving it so
I want to finish watching that got to do
some work I mean my pajama bottoms now
and cashmere socks and I'm feeling very
happy about that it's your sister and
her boyfriend have just left it suddenly
got really dark outside I'm gonna sit
here and do a little bit of work and
riches kindly unloading the dishwasher
loading it
it's just squeals I don't know what are
you dropping your foot an egg that is
gross
I was there rich as a black toe from
when he did man versus mountain it's
disgusting
oh rich you have to clean that so bad
unless you're gonna get ill oh god I'm
gonna get shouted at again for shouting
at you
I'm swear I'm really nice to him over
time one time darling would you like me
to clean up the egg no no way
rich is working egg all around the
kitchen okay we're both a bit hungry now
it's like 6:30 come on it's also much
later that winter oh yes clock different
all my ribs are so a queue from work you
know okay food rich is making an omelet
attempting to make an omelet on the
floor I think I'm gonna make myself some
pasta please put on some more cream on
my lips actually I was just talking
about my lips are better I haven't put
any cream on and they're feeling a bit
so ah where is it oh it makes me look a
bit crazy because it's like proper white
this guy's is the new autumn lip trend
don't you know you guys know how I'm so
obsessed with those pickled cucumbers I
get from my sushi place
well I asked and lost I went and I was
like how do you make these please tell
me I was like I promise I'll still come
buy them here I need to know and they
told me that I had to buy this stuff but
I don't know what it is because there
isn't anything English on it but I'm
guessing it's some kind of like vinegar
and they said cut up cucumber and pour
this on and and put it in the fridge for
a couple of hours why actually is it
first because my sister told me to as I
put salt all over the cucumber and then
let it kind of sit for a bit and washed
it off and that Perrineau keeps the
cucumber crunchy and then I pour it in
the vinegar put it in the fridge with
cling film and leave it there for a
couple of hours I've already eaten half
of them but they are incredible and so
obsessive pickles
mmm they are so good so now I know how
to make them I can make them and like
huge batches I think these things were
like how much like four pounds or
something for a bottle maybe a bit less
and you do go through quite a lot to
cover the cucumber totally worth it they
totally worth it
rich found our old money bank and
randomly decided he'd count the money in
it and then we suddenly realized that
the old pound coins are illegal I think
you can pay them into banks luckily but
you can't use them in shops anymore
neither a mid counting I don't interrupt
no oh my god so random for a Sunday
night
look at these Oh dollars that's naive I
have no plans to go to America no hold
oh and you rose quite a lot you guys
wait is that euros and Berlin you're
going to Berlin next week yeah they go
pocket money oh my god this is actually
really satisfying I'm gonna time that
see okay
now ritually where can we go they may be
brighter see anima Hawk 50 do you know
how much it costs to fill our coop 50
pounds
how many pound coins do we have well we
can have 50 pounds of them we can go
somewhere in your PA that's pretty good
let's fill the car up and drive to
Brighton no go to Dover and then we've
got wait these URIs to come all right
going somewhere where you can spend
euros then we have to get back again I'm
impressed
