my honeymoon it's really nice to be back
and today is Tuesday and I have no video
planned for tomorrow obviously if you
saw the whole read out comic relief
things my Sunday video went up a day
late so I wasn't sure whether to put
something up tomorrow or not and then I
thought actually I just want to sit down
and say hey and catch up I don't know if
I've ever really done a video like this
before before I carry on with this video
I have a favor to ask
I really want to film a Q&amp;amp;A video I
haven't done one in quite a while so
please please leave a comment on this
video with any kind of question I
normally ask on Twitter or Instagram but
I realize that I'm making this video to
put on YouTube so I want you guys who
are watching my videos to ask me the
questions and especially those of you
who don't usually comment I know so many
people watch videos and don't comment
and that is fine but I really want you
guys to have a chance if you have
anything ask me or anything you want me
to discuss hopefully there'll be some
interesting ones don't be shy you can
literally ask anything but I really want
to do a video I think they're really fun
so please go and leave me a question in
the comment box but I was about to do my
makeup for the day and I thought I would
combine a few different things in this
video
one catch up with you guys and tell you
about our honeymoon but there's so many
of you asked if I can make a video about
it and I was going to do like a proper
sit-down video is rich but it's just not
going to happen because he works
full-time so I thought I'll talk about
in this videos too I was going to make
like a video on my honeymoon hot climate
makeup routine I didn't really wear
makeup much but when I did in the
evening I really liked it so I think
I'll show you that in this video I'll
chat you who asked them doing my makeup
I'm hoping this camera's okay because
this is the one we took away with us and
rich got some cream all inside the
camera like the Sun cream exploded in
his bag and the lens was covered like
our whole video I made a video just for
us for our honeymoons and like every
shot it's got like a blurry lens because
it's got some cream on it but yeah the
video so nice you made like a little
video I didn't really do like talking to
camera I just filmed a few clips and put
it together and I think it'll be really
nice so thank you you guys because a lot
of you said that you love watching your
parents honeymoon video and I should
definitely make one so I did and it's a
refresher on ground
and I didn't load photos as well okay
I'm going to start doing my makeup and
chat to you about our trip so if this
video isn't interesting for you guys
just kind of skip it and come back on
Sunday for the next video I'm definitely
the minority when I'm on holiday or in a
hot climate I want to look at glossy and
jewy and sweaty as possible I know that
most people want to kind of mattify
their skin because they're in a hot
climate but I find that I just don't
want to look on wearing loads of makeup
because I think that looks kind of weird
so this is my kind of minimal makeup I
did on a few evenings when we went out
for the first part of the trip I didn't
wear any makeup at all just what I
wanted to kind of spruce up a little bit
so obviously I mean you might get
cosmetics CC creams because it's so
gooey and hydrating and lovely and I
literally just like cut a tiny bit on I
mean I've completely lost my tan and my
dark circles have already returned but
on holiday I didn't need much I just put
a little tiny bit so let me tell you
about our trip so those of you who are
interested
anyone who's carrying on going south
africa or just planning on booking a
honeymoon it was absolutely incredible
we actually used a travel agent called
orde-lees and me and rich and not travel
agent people at all
we never use them I think I used to use
them when I was like 16 just because I
was like lazy and I didn't want to do it
myself I actually really enjoy planning
a holiday the reason we use the travel
agent is because one we're both very
busy at the moment but also we were
going to a country that we've never been
to and planning on traveling around a
lot so it was quite overwhelming we were
getting lots of different
recommendations from people we thought
look if we go to a travel agent where
there's an expert on that country it'll
just be easier so I wouldn't use them
again if I was going back to the same
places because now I know it but it was
really helpful for our first trip there
that's about all the tinted moisturizer
that I'm going to put on really thin
layer so we had two weeks to play with
and I think our attitude was let's see
as much of South Africa as possible now
looking back there's definitely some
things we would do differently there
were areas we wish we spent more time in
and areas we wish we hadn't maybe have
gone to in general as an overall look
off the trip we did safari Cape Town and
then the garden route if I was to go
back I wouldn't do the garden route I'm
glad
did but it wasn't my favorite part of
the trip I wish I'd spent more time in
Cape Town I was really the route we did
was a bit kind of back and forth in a
mint I had to go on more internal
flights which by the way South Africa
internal flights were bloody scary I
think it's a windy there all the planes
are very small they were very scary
flights and I feel like I could have
avoided that if we've done like safari
garden route Cape Town Rosslyn Safari
Cape Town garden route and then all the
way back to Joburg we started with
safari I think I'm going to do a blog
post and actually list all the places we
went to because talking like this will
just get really confusing by the way I'm
going to put on a bit of concealer this
is the Urban Decay Naked concealer as I
said I didn't really have dark circles
and all the way but I'm just going to
put a little bit here I've kind of
voided so we started in Safari went to a
place called gauranga safari camp and
I'm not hungry sensor on this but I'm
pretty sure that if you go to Kruger
it's like a public reserve which means
that anyone with a licence can go which
I think I mean sorry this is wrong but I
think you have to stick to the main
roads when you see animals you can only
look at them from afar but if you go to
a private game reserve which this one
was a private one you can go off-road
and you can track animals and we go and
find them any of you that are wondering
it was so like I was a bit worried I
thought am I going to like Safari is a
bit weird
it is if it weird to drive and stare at
animals and kind of disrupt them is it
going to be unpleasant for them but it
really wasn't my targeted to see the car
as a one big object and they're very
used to seeing them so they're not I
just didn't see any animals that seemed
distressed at all
it was incredible we went on two drives
a day so I thought we woke up with like
half 5:00 in the morning and then
there's another one in the evening and
in between you just get to chill out the
weather wasn't amazing and in that part
of South Africa so we didn't get much
cool time which meant the day was a
little bit boring but the dry ice was so
incredible the Rangers were so lovely
and so talented and brilliant they've
done like years and years of exams and I
said don't you get bored of doing this
every day and they were like we're
living our dream which is just so nice
to hear the actual camp itself was
amazing the place we stayed was like
that hotel was want the hotel
Hank it was incredible and you could
hear the monkeys and hyenas at night it
was so loud and you'd wake up in the
morning they'd be like elephant - right
outside your room which was terrifying I
kind of had too much to say about that
I'm going to put a blog post because
that hotel was outstanding
he's saying Hotel it wasn't a hotel it's
like a camp we saw all the big animals
we did see hyenas we saw rhino we saw
white and black rhino giraffe zebra
cheetah leopard lion elephant we were so
so lucky and I could load the photos and
I just loved Safari it was incredible
then we went to Cape Town and we only
had two full days though stayed in a
lovely hotel I really really liked it I
wish I'd had more time one of the days
we saw a friend for lunch and in kind of
walked around DNA and it was a kind of a
walking chill day has the most
incredible foods food in Cape Town is
unreal and then on the other day we had
a private tall guy who took us like to
Cape Point and bald beach to see the
Penguins and we drove around the whole
day seemed like loads of stuff that was
a really cool day I just wish we'd had
more time in Cape Town okay next I'm
going to use this cream bronzer from YSL
which I'm so obsessed with it just gives
you that glowy buds look find that
powder bronzers tea powder is for none
away clay tums brilliant I wish we've
had more time there but it's sort plain
I would definitely go back it's an 11
hour flight which is long if you do it
overnight you just have to sleep on the
plane and then there's no jet lag
depending on what time of year you go
there can be no time difference and when
we went there was a two hour time
difference which is just nothing which
means you don't lose like couple of days
off the trip at the beginning in the end
so I really do think is like the perfect
holiday destination I don't know why it
took me so long to go there but I would
definitely go back you can just go so
like a week's holiday because of the
time difference and it's really
affordable when you're there well for
English for UK people it's affordable
the flights are expensive but when
you're there is cheap by the way talking
about expensive not expensive
this whole trip was expensive it was our
honeymoon something we saved for it's
not what we would spend on a normal
holiday just in case you guys are
wondering kind of nice a sponger is i
put it on my cheekbones and across my
nose and i love it
neil it's really natural like you just
have a time
after Cape Town we rented a car and
drove to Fran Shack which is the wine
region we stayed in a beautiful place
hula petit fermion and we had a few days
there I think we had too many days there
the landscape and the surroundings were
absolutely beautiful and I loved that
about it honestly I was a little bit
disappointed in that the wine tours
because my impression was that we were
going to get to have like the tour of
the vineyard and learn about how they
make the wines and I thought it'd be
more educational but you kind of just go
to each vineyard and you just sit at a
table and they bring you wine to drink
which if you're like really into
drinking I guess it's like fun and I
think if we were with a group of friends
it would have been more fun but we're
not massive drinkers so it was a bit
like I would have be more interested in
learning about the wine wasn't just
drinking it so that was weird I think
that something they could improve on it
as a whole but in France it was really
pristine and then we started kind of the
drive down garden roof we as I said we
only had two weeks so we couldn't stop
everywhere the first place we stopped
was wilderness and we continued with my
makeup followers I'm never going to get
this done first 30 went was called
wilderness and we didn't love it but I
think there are a few things that went
wrong so I don't know if it's the place
we didn't love were just like that
overall experience when we got there we
checked into our hotel and we both were
just like no this is not right to fair
we stayed in so many places would have
been hard if we've got every single one
perfect I think that would have been
quite unlikely it was just a little bit
too rustic and when I was travelling on
a younger would have been absolutely
fine with it but it was a honeymoon we
wanted to meet luxury and we wanted a
bathroom that didn't feel gross and we
didn't want like ants everywhere I don't
know it just wasn't it wasn't right so
we kind of left that hotel and went to a
local nearby hotel that was better but
it wasn't great we hiked the waterfall
when we were in wilderness and it was
beautiful like this that everywhere you
go South Africa is beautiful too you
have like the mountains and the sea and
the river and there's so much to look at
so that was great but we are such idiots
and we forgot to take water with us and
I was ok because I don't really sweat
that much I don't really drink that much
anyway but rich is quite a sweaty guy
and he got really
a heat stroke and it was so-so but I'd
like to the point where he was like
shivering because he felt so cold but he
was boiling hot and I had to cover him
in wet flannels and he had cold showers
and then without going too much detail
there was three days of disastrous
side-effects that kind of ruined that
part of the trip for him I felt really
bad for him by the way cause for makeup
I'm going to use this Clarins blush
which I just lost she's not used that
I've holiday to put - one - and then
blend it out so rich wasn't well we had
the hotel disaster and that kind of
ruined wilderness for us so we moved on
from there stop the swelling down just
for lunch which was cool and went on to
pleasantburg bay which we really really
liked I didn't realize when booking that
plettenberg bay it kind of split into
two has like the ocean side and the
river side and when we got there we were
a bit gutted that we weren't near the
ocean because it just it looks so
beautiful and I like that kind of fresh
ocean air we were more near the river
which felt a bit more inland and by that
point we were kind of done with the
whole light wilderness field
but once we got to our hotel which was
called Emily Lodge we would just like
blown away with how incredible it was
it's like Soho House in the middle of
kind of South Africa it's it's kind of
very eclectic and amazing like we love
the hotel so it was worth has not been
near the sea for that and we had a week
couple of reason I stayed obsessed about
favorite speech we saw something less
restaurants that was kind of our chill
time because we'd be traveling around so
much we just wanted to take it easy for
the end of the trip and then from there
we flew back from George all regrets
Joburg fly home which was a bit
backwards and silly I didn't miss with
me away it's the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter liquid in opal and this just
gives you like wet highlighted looking
skin oh it's always so hard to get like
a little bout but I just like Pat that
on my cheekbones and like down my nose
so overall the trip was incredible like
I absolutely fell in love with South
Africa I would recommend it to anyone
who's thinking of going just for a
holiday or for a honeymoon it's really
good for so much you can do you can have
like the relaxing beach vibe and you can
have the more active holiday and it's
just a mix of everything I loved it
because
the foods are so great as well I always
try and want to go on holiday like I
have to sacrifice good food I'm so used
to like amazing London style food I go
away and I'm always a bit like
disappointed but the food in Seattle was
incredible better than it is in London
I've got so many restaurant
recommendations we just had a brilliant
time if you have any questions about
honeymoon
leave me a comment and I'll try and get
back to you on that obviously we're not
going to say exactly how much it costs
because that's just weird oh not really
like that about any type of details and
what we did and how I planned it just
let me know I took this with me it's
Matt groundwork and I just use my
fingers you put a little bit of that on
my lids it's like a bit of a bit of
shadow because any of you guys follow me
on Instagram but I did use Instagram
stories ourselves away I was going to do
like a no social media thing but now I
figured I'm in this amazing country that
lots of people probably aren't able to
visit and I wanted to share it I feel
like I just it took me like a few
seconds to just take a photo and share
it so it wasn't like taking away from
the honeymoon at all rich didn't mind at
all rather than like doing emails and
stuff so that was really nice to share
that if you guys saw some of that on
Instagram stories okay the final step is
this mascara from tot its first lifted
confusing because they've got one called
gifted but this is lifted and it's a
black brown mascara and it's swept
crease I did not what the difference you
sweat proof and water creases but I got
on really well with this when I was away
I haven't really decided what to do
about the whole Instagram stories versus
snapchat thing I didn't snapchat at all
of those away so the first time I've had
like a massive two week gap and break
from snapchat and honestly I think like
a lot of creators are struggling to do
both just as if they're so similar and
I've had a lot of feedbacks from you
guys saying he prefers kind of chatty
snacks like on snapchat and then more
kind of edited photos on Instagram
stories which completely makes sense but
it's just kind of hard to do both
there's so many things now to keep
updated with it's just hard to fill out
you're not repeating content and spend
your whole time like on your phone and
not doing other things so I'm not really
sure what to do but I think the reason
why everyone's in a bit
predicament is not just the kids like
which one do you prefer it's because
Instagram stories get so many more views
obviously because people's following is
bigger on Instagram and snapchat is like
so small and nisha so hard to find
people it's quite hard to grow on there
so it kind of makes sense business-wise
to do Instagram stories and it's easier
but I also don't like doing too many
stories on Instagram
or is on snapchat you can kind of be
more chassis at the moment I'm kind of
just doing Instagram stories but maybe
every now and again I'll snapchat I
don't really know I haven't quite
decided so that's my honeymoon makeup
it's whoa I think I put too much
highlighter on I didn't do that when I
was on holiday but I like to look glowy
and glossy and my eyes are very simple
and everyday simple I think it took so
long because I was talking when I
actually did this on the honeymoon it
was like five seconds routine I know
everybody's been away for two weeks but
this is the first holiday in like four
or five years I've been on where I
didn't take my laptop so it feels like
epic to me feels like I've been away for
so long so this is fun being back I have
a new video coming on Sunday morning so
don't forget to check back for that
video and I will see you guys then don't
forget to please ask me the question so
you start collecting them for the Q&amp;amp;A
video thank you so much and I'll see you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
