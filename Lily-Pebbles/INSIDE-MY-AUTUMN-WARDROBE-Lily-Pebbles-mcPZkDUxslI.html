to be talking to you about autumn
styling and I'm going to be showing you
my favourite pieces for autumn from my
wardrobe so these are the sort of trends
and styles and staple pieces that I'm
gonna be wearing throughout autumn I'm
also going to add all the links to all
the items mentioned in the description
box below if anything sold out or I
think it's too expensive I'm gonna put
alternative links so just check down
there I also have a link that says shop
on my blog and I normally put items in
there as well so go and check that out
layering is one of my favorite things to
do in autumn just put in lots of nice
layers on and I think you can be a
little bit clever with it as well
instead of just putting on like a vest
top and a jumper and a jacket I'm loving
the new kind of style out at the moment
that has the neck detail there's lots of
tops to either come with chokers
attached to the top or this one which
I've shown before in a video which is
from Urban Outfitters it's just a light
t-shirt and a really nice fabric it like
hangs really nicely and it has this
crisscross detail on the neck I actually
got this in a small cuz I thought it fit
alright actually and it comes in three
colors I bought all three colors it
comes in this grey it comes in a car key
green which is very autumnal and then it
also comes in this beige color they're
not the best colors ever but I just
absolutely love this t-shirt you can
wear them alone or what I often do is
wear this underneath a shirt I think
it's really nice just kind of peeking
through you can wear like a cardigan or
a slouchy jumper and just having that
next detail adds another layer that I
think is really nice so talking of
shirts this one is actually from Urban
Outfitters I really like it because it
looks like it's denim but it's not it's
actually really soft and I find in
autumn in the colder months I want to
wear like soft fabrics and really fussy
about things how they feel on my skin
and this is so nice it's it's very
loose-fitting I got it in a large
actually I don't think they had a medium
but I quite like that it's oversized
kind of looks like you're like painting
your flat or something like that
but I really like it and I either wear
it open and like layer on a leather
jacket or as shown in the cutaway where
the nice kind of crisscross t-shirt
underneath this is so comfortable I
absolutely love the color I've actually
thrown out my old denim shirt because I
much prefer this one I really really
like this
that's my Urban Outfitters I also love
this shirt and this kind of crosses two
categories shirt and animal print this
is from Lily and Lionel they do these
amazing silk shirts and I really love
this because I find I can wear it during
the day maybe you feel like more smarter
days where I have meetings but I can
also wear it in the evening and this
definitely crosses over to my next
category animal print is massive for
autumn but it is quite difficult to wear
and I think if you haven't got the
courage to wear it or you're not really
sure how you feel about it I've got a
few tips on how you can incorporate it
into your wardrobe without kind of going
full-on Pat butcher but I've been one
way of wearing animal print is
definitely by going with an alternative
color so this is like a leopard print
but it's a cream with black and blue and
I really like this I definitely wouldn't
wear this shirt if it was like the
orange and black standard leopard print
but because it's blue and kind of cream
and black I think it's so so nice and
much easier to wear still very like on
trend because this is a silk shirt it
hangs beautifully it fits so nicely and
I wear this all the time another great
way to incorporate animal print into
your wardrobe without going full-on
animal print is with accessories this
belt is from Topshop I pick this up the
other day I got it in medium to large
because I thought if I want to wear it
in my jeans or sometimes though the
high-waisted skirt the small was just a
little bit too small it's really nice
it's got that kind of pony textured
effect to it which I think makes it look
a bit more expensive and this is the
standard animal print color like a
leopard print color with a really nice
gold buckle but because it's just like a
pop of animal print you can either have
your top like a little bit tucked in or
fully tucked in it's not as kind of
crazy as wearing an animal print top or
discuss way of incorporating a bit of
animal print into your outfit and making
your outfit a little bit more on trend
I don't always go for trends there's
often trends that I just kind of miss
I'm like no not for me animal print is a
trend I quite like but as I said I
prefer doing either an alternative
colors or little bits of and print in my
outfit I think cold shoulder which is
when your shoulder is cut out off the
top is such a clever idea because it
kind of makes your tops a bit small
a bit different a bit more like girly
and sexy but it's perfect for this time
of year where it's too cold to actually
just wear like sleeveless tops it's just
showing a bit of skin but it's not like
too much at all this top I have from a
while ago it's from whistles and it's
just a plain black kind of 3/4 length
sleeve with the cutouts and some cutouts
are bigger some really open your whole
shoulder area and this one's more of
just like a little triangle cutout I
really like it I don't know if they
still have the black in stock but last
time I went in they had a stripy version
and I reckon it's one of those tops
they're gonna keep bringing out in
different colors so I will find the link
and link it below but I really like this
it's a little bit thicker as well so
it's perfect for this time of year it
fits really nicely and I wear that one a
lot
and then the other cold shoulder top I
have this from a sauce this is new and I
really like it's quite like daring and
different for me because it's quite
freely but it's white I really like
wearing white tops I think it's really
fresh and this one can be worn tucked in
or untucked but I've tucked it in for
this cutaway so it's a white top with
cutout shoulder a little bit of sleeve
and then this amazing ruffle as well and
it just makes it look a bit more
interesting this is really affordable
it's from ASOS but the ruffle I think
makes it look expensive I think it's a
really sweet nice kind of girly touch
but because of the sleeve and the kind
of vesties detail it's not too girly I'm
really excited about this top and I
can't wait to wear it more so that is
from ASOS and I think the cold shoulder
kind of ideas just very clever and easy
to wear next up is knits and I
absolutely love wearing like chunky
knits warm or like cashmere jumpers
during autumn I'm a massive fan of being
warm comfortable and owning lots of
jumpers so this first one you've already
seen because it was in my Asus haul I
decided to keep it and I loved it it's
funny because my best friend Deb's also
has it we often accidentally buy the
same things as each other
it's like a nice kind of creamy gray
color and it's slightly high neck but
not like really high neck it just cuts a
slightly different so it's not low which
I like this is just a big chunky knit
it's very comfortable it's nice with
like jeans or like even with a skirt you
can wear this around the house but I
think you can also wear this out I
really like it
and it's slightly batwing
so it's definitely more like a baggie
big chunky knit this is great you guys
have seen it already I love it this next
piece I'm so in love with I'm so in love
with it that I bought it in the wrong
size because they were sold out on a
medium and I really really wanted it
it's a cashmere sweater from Rhys this
comes in gray and a blush pink you guys
know how much I love blush pink so I'm
desperately trying to find it in one of
the other stores I got in a large
because actually I quite liked it in the
lodge I might get the pink in a medium
so I have one of each the mediums a bit
more fitted the large is like big and
cozy and comfy and I don't mind that
look even when I'm out and about so this
is a cashmere sweater so you do pay a
bit more for cashmere I think this was
170 pounds but I personally think it's
worth investing in beautiful cashmere
jumpers because they really do keep you
warm when it's really cold I love this
so so much I definitely want to get the
pink as well and actually I'm happy I
got the large it slightly splits on the
side which makes it much more flattering
it's got this like edging down the side
I love the gray I want the pink it's so
warm and cozy not at all it she and
it'll keep me very warm this winter
the final knit wear piece is from
Topshop and bell sleeves are also very
in this autumn it's kind of like a 60s
maybe more 70s trend
there's definitely photos of my mom as a
teenager wearing like big bell sleeves
so it's when the sleeves kind of go out
and flare and I like the trend I think
it kind of suits me this is from Topshop
and because over the material it's kind
of stretchy it is a bit more fitted
around the tummy area than I would
normally like but I think it kind of
needs to be fitted so that the bell
sleeves really kind of show up so it's a
gray blue thin knit it's not kind of
really thick and chunky and then the
sleeves just kind of go out and I think
it's so cool and really different and
I've had lots of compliments when I've
worn this already it's a little bit
strange I think some people won't be
that into the bell-sleeve trend but I
think is really nice
I haven't attempted to put on like a
tight jacket on top I think I'd have to
wear like a coat and there's some really
crazy sleeves out there but I think this
one's quite understated and you don't
you can't really tell it just creates a
nice movement like when you walk and if
you like lift your arm up to do
something I think it's really cool so
that's from Topshop and that's new in so
now let's talk about jackets and that's
one of my favourite things
about autumn I love wearing little
jackets for as long as I can and i layer
them over jumpers to keep me warm I
think I'm good leather jacket is such an
important piece to have and actually my
favorite leather jacket that I've had
for years probably about three years now
is from ASOS it's nothing fancy it's
just gets the job done I doubt they do
the specific one anymore but I will link
to some other leather jackets that I
really like this actually has silver
hardware which I don't normally get I'm
a gold person but I feel like with
leather jackets sometimes the gold is
just to like yellowy and shiny I don't
really want the hardware to be
noticeable at all so this is just a
simple leather jacket with a collar I
wear it all the time there is no need to
get a new one I like that it looks
really worn it's not too sure not too
long perfect
everyone needs a good leather jacket in
their autumn wardrobe this jacket is I'm
so in love with it
it's from Rhys and they often do these
suede jackets I can they bring them out
every season but always in different
colors I know Anna's got one in purple
I've seen someone with like a beige one
before I'm so glad I waited this is my
like ultimate color it's like a bluey
gray this is like my favorite nail
polish color you guys know I love blues
and this is like a not too blue blue
it's like a grey blue if they have said
gravy blue too many times it's gorgeous
it's like the most buttery soft suede
ever definitely an investment piece but
I've already worn it like way more than
I expected to and it definitely like
worn it's worth nope that's not the same
got my wear out of it I don't really
know one saying but you know I mean I've
worn it to death and I know I'm gonna
continue wearing it it's so beautiful
it's like a little bit heavy I
absolutely love this it's my favorite
thing for my autumn wardrobe and then I
also think it's really great to have
some long big kind of coats and I love
that kind of grandpa coat look where
it's almost floor-length big hood on it
and this is my one from last year I'm
still loving it it's from whistles
whistles do great coats I've also seen
some really nice ones in next and Rhys
Rhys have some nice ones with like belts
on it this is the light grey and a dark
grey you guys have seen this plenty of
times it's got a big zip up the front a
big hood I know this isn't like
flattering but I love the look of like a
big coat with like skinny jeans it does
even though it's not even that thick it
does really keep me warm I love it
just can do no wrong in my eyes let's
talk accessories I don't have that many
I actually forgot to bring my chokers
with me but I think the whole choker
trend is great really enjoying Joe
because I have two that I like I'll try
and link some from ASOS or top shot
below that I think you guys would like
as well but I also needed some new black
boots and I saw these in Topshop I
wasn't that sure when I first tried them
on this is what they look like they are
I think they're called sock boots and
they're black leather oh my god sorry
for looking in the viewfinder but they
look great on camera I'm very excited
about these new shoes so this is what
they looked like and I tried them on in
store and I wasn't sure about this bit
because they were really tight on my
ankle and I used to get not tease but I
was always really like self-conscious of
my skinny ankles when I was at school so
I asked like someone who was just
shopping in Topshop like what do you
think she was that you need to buy those
and I said yeah but don't they make my
ankles a tree skinny and she was like
that's the point of the whole sock boot
trend which is true and I think now I'm
28 I can just accept my skinny ankles
and embrace them I really like them
because they're not too pointed and
they're not too round I was I feel like
I always buy shoes are too rounded and I
hate really pointed shoes so somewhere
in between the heel is high high enough
that it's flattering but not too high
that I can't walk in them and I look too
tall so that's perfect they've got a big
zip down the side because they go up so
high and this fabric it's like a really
nice soft buttery leather but it is
thinner than like normal boots I feel
like you can you have to wear really
skinny jeans with these or tights you
can't really go somewhere in-between
because then they'd bunch up you have to
wear things that can really tuck into
the boot but I just think they are
gorgeous I love them and I think that
they're gonna wear well because they're
they're leather I have like so many nice
suede boots they're just destroyed
because they get marks and them so
easily and then this I wasn't really
going to show because I just got this
literally yesterday but I'm doing a job
with far-fetched which is a blog post
I'm very very lucky to be gifted this
bag if the blog post is already up I'll
link it below as usual if not look out
for it because I took some you nice
photos with me with this bag but it's a
bag from Farfetch'd and it's Phillip Lim
so this is the Paschal II medium bag and
I didn't really know what I wanted like
I had a voucher to spend it was very
exciting but I didn't know I wanted
there was so many like beautiful
smaller bags but I feel like I have so
many and actually what I need is a bag
that can fit my iPad in so I ordered
this for that purpose and then when it
came I realized it also fits my laptop
in which is so exciting I know that's
probably a lame thing to be excited
about but it's always so difficult to
let go into town with my laptop and I
always have to take a rucksack so now
having like a nice bag that really
doesn't even look that big
it fits my laptop in I love it let me
know if you want me to do like more info
on it but it's got like these straps at
the top it's also got a long strap that
I wear most of time like on my shoulder
or crossbody it's gold hardware with a
textured black leather and it's huge
inside let me quickly show you it
literally fits so much in there I love
it why have I got masking tape in my
handbag random really really happy with
this and I think it's the perfect like
autumn accessory for me so those are all
my favorite pieces from my current
autumn wardrobe I really hope you guys
