setting today because I'm even so I'm so
excited we're gonna be looking through
her makeup bag we've just filmed my
makeup bag on her channel so go check it
out if you've been living under a rock
and you don't know who Sam is she is
just amazing one half of pixie rule on
YouTube
one of the first YouTube channels over
subscribe to so I'm pretty excited
because Carly but yeah we're going to
look through your makeup bag and it's
huge where is this bad for right this
this actually this bag was sent in to
the studio and they have loads and loads
of different patterns it's from a brand
called Loki and I know it's just so good
but it's really thin yeah really good
for kids but looks so pretty the problem
with me is when I have a big makeup bag
I'll just fill it up and then I'll need
a bigger one so I'm except right I'm not
going to show you everything because
that could take forever
okay so I'll show you my favorite
favorites oh also I have a separate bag
just for my brushes yeah I didn't even
bring any brushes with me today feels
like they definitely not fit in a tiny
little thing I have to keep them
separate because um I don't clean them
every time I use them yes they're not
for clients so they sometimes are a bit
grubby and this bag is from my kit code
you know that no that was really good
they are so so good so it's a makeup
artist called James Malloy a friend of
mine and he started his own brand which
is makeup brushes and these lovely
little kind of containment systems so
they're all kind of transparent and
really good on ya so massive look for
him okay so no surprise is this is face
up on ya face and body like I mean I
love this foundation yeah it's just so
brilliant for me and as a makeup artist
you'll always always have this in your
kit because it's so good kind of on legs
and all over the place and you can get
you can build it up to get like a fuller
coverage and I always have two colors
because I changed we travel so much that
I change color and I'll just make so
much it's brilliant times made as bed of
it I was right and liked it but Anna
Anna reacted really badly to it your
fonts all over her face on like how long
does that risk if there's like a year
ago well they did change the formulation
it used to have it used to have kind of
grapefruit in it
they changed it I had some other kind of
fruit in it anyway they changed in my
try it again so try it and see but I I
mean I love it is yeah I always go back
to it it's my fave fave um I have a
couple of skincare bits as well which
I'll show you quickly user in this one
is the replenishing face cream to use
any other side my sister does she gets
really bad x-men she swears we're doing
they did yeah and I was pregnant I got
eczema and this is the stuff yeah but if
you have dry skin like me then this
stuff is a really good affordable thing
then now something a bit more expensive
which is the creme de la Mer my gel
which I just put on before I put just
around my eyes I put my foundation nice
and then I have all should i do
concealer this is a bit gross I'm
excited for this because in my video
Santa she doesn't use the Urban Decay
one because it's too dry I'm like what
is this concealer that's less dry this
is where it gets a bit expensive little
bit stupid but because I just do this
okay because it's just a bit of mixing
things so I use the lemare conceal of
okay which is ridiculous because it only
comes in three shades and the dark one
is my shade now right okay but what I do
is I like the texture of it but really
it's the same as the mac studio finish
so you could get much to do finish a lot
cheaper and then I use this which is
rubbed off but it's it cosmetics
under-eye something under eye I can't
see it's not the CC cream they have an
under-eye CC cream no is this what this
one covers everything it's like it's
like a tattoos and zs type thing but
it's too much on its own for me so i
just mix a little bit in there and i mix
the two together
Wow and then I get the color I want as
well as over those things on my face
this is another it cosmetics than you
and I are loving it yeah alter um this
is their naturally pretty palette that's
so nothing that gorgeous it's like a
bloody all is I've those are shadows I
like this one's black or winter they are
too little mad and they're absolutely
stunning the edges of them I totally
recommend it when you go in there grab
it and I've been wearing it since I got
it it doesn't come out
my makeup bag and I don't see why I'll
ever need to change it because for
everything I need in there really really
nice and they blend so beautifully and I
just haven't got enough good words do
you normally just wear Matt's like as I
get older I'm starting to wear more Matt
I'm definitely less shimmer over bronzer
is another limit huge its massive but
the bronzer inside is not really nothing
I have to say that it's a ridiculous
size it's really stupid but I like that
shade of bronzer on me yes so it's good
if you yet it's good if you're fair as
well um best powder in my opinion is the
Charlotte Tilbury airbrush artist powder
okay I'm going to leave here with such
an expensive shopping list I haven't
tried that it's really good today the
best part is even better it's absolutely
the best it's really a high because it
translucent or is it translucent but
comes in shades you know highlighter Mac
hush I'm a green color base I like it I
like a cream highlighter because you
know it gives you that real high shine
that you don't get with a powder it
doesn't sit on the skin so much and I'm
little bit lining around there so it's
kind of better for me then I have Oh
eyeliner right so my favorite eyeliner
of all time is the Lancome art liner do
you sir no my it's just a standard one
it comes with a little padded brush but
it's super easy to use quite nd very
very flexible so yeah are you asking
quite good at eyeliner spending on oh I
don't know I find that really easy you
try that like it's my easiest easiest
one and in fact they just launched this
year which I don't like I didn't get on
with that one because there are jagir of
it but I'd really work for me gimmicky
yes the point I tried to use it in every
position and it's actually hard have you
tried it on other people does it make a
difference when you're doing it on other
people I can't use it from the wand on
other people because of my idea so to me
I don't like them I don't like the one
so much no and I just don't feel that
that makes it any easier I think makes
it yellow I'm around today yeah yeah
yeah
funny I always have it it's just so easy
I used to use like a gel eyeliner in a
pot but yes it is the pain to carry all
that stuff back yeah and brushes in
there in there then my masks are is
always this one why I sell volume effect
it's classics really good now we're down
to all lips 1/2 throb I use a different
mascara on my bottom lashes because it
transfers yeah so that was mac gigablack
okay so my lip products there's a lot of
lip products in here because I do pretty
much the same on my eyes and with face
all the time I just changed my lips do
you do that yeah but what kind of
different thing yeah so at the moment I
am obsessing over BSA Edit pencil
oh I haven't tried that oh hi choice
right mother stuff and wasn't fine press
but I didn't try anything lip liners
well this is what happens I look the
whole collection and I'm a bit like yeah
I'm not overwhelmed by that and then
suddenly one day I'll be like oh I need
a nude lip line or I find this and it's
the best thing ever and limited edition
Oh No so is my darkening well they've
still got two in Selfridges oh but it's
to my blinders yeah y9 then what they
might be more kicking around the other
one I have this morning coffee which is
a Mac one which is a little bit darker
but the same tone I love those kind of
shades there's a circle as I love so so
good um right I like that I love it oh
yes this is clinic blushing pops such a
pretty kind of matte lipstick love that
then um these are my favorite lipsticks
of all time these nose ones yeah I chose
they're they're quite intense yes but if
you've been aware of red red or
something you want it to be a fun I
think those nose ones are the base I
love they're like ah yeah
oh it's satisfying isn't it and if you
have a bunch they all stick together
yeah oh I have so many Charlotte Tilbury
lipsticks this one is live it up and
that's part of the matte revolution yes
I'm at revolution I don't know if I'm
like super super in love with them
because the map revolution do they go a
bit funny on the lips after a while have
you firm I quite like them there's a
shameful love Liberty which I'm obsessed
with but I don't know I didn't find that
or maybe it's just me yeah but I have I
have loads of them so yeah they're
really good they all good
this is another really nice one this is
a wire so I think I have that one as
well and always impossible to know the
numbers there's an 1/8 and that's a
really nice lady great lipstick of all
time
Schumer Oh fine 310 this color is so
beautiful nice such a nice undertake
with others yeah like quite a bright
deep it really is but it works really
well I'm going to put something nice um
and I feel like it really brightens my
face up good god I'm shiny
I need your hips and hard on actually
this isn't in my makeup bag but I found
you on the table and if I want to be in
my makeup bag if I'd seen it as they'll
order like trio however what's called
it's nice though isn't it so much
bronzer because I'll be a color this is
like they had a limited edition blusher
couple years ago put like T's or
something Oh real and that blusher is
very similar and I really like that yeah
I don't know how much that was probably
about this yeah looking good and nah
sorry that's it that is it
alright well I did I have Nivea lip
butter and coconut
do you use these oh yeah they smell real
I came out actually
that's not good oh it's not monkey oh it
smells like holiday yeah I really like
that and then I have my little sweet
card light ya know I've ever this is
brilliant you need one of these I was
showing my sister this the other day
Scott scissor so really good for
chopping into not your real eyelashes
but your false ones breathe into your
eyelashes yeah
and then your tweezers which really work
very well they look like they'd be
rubbish but they're brilliant yeah
it has a pen in there Wow yeah
magnifying glass that you'll never use
there's even a pin I won't believe get
these and I was a kid and never know
when that look that was a pen it's a pen
and then knife probably woulda superfox
ID if he gave you one for sam chadwick
your bag a knife and a little torch
people are longness impressed by this
than I am
guys need to do your makeup in the dark
and stab someone useful though honestly
you definitely need one amazing you
wouldn't realize until until you're like
oh I've got some scissors in there back
oh one last thing because I really
should show this because it's lovely
this is I know it is I know that Brad
I'm going to guess oh it says Mac oh I
thought it was an things that Bradley
Joe and John Lewis I had a little
Japanese yes it's like there you go like
that
I was mad this is from a while ago it
was there an Tony Lopez collection and
he's like a he was an illustrator so
it's really pretty but what I love about
this so much is it's three shades of red
so if you ever want to do the Marilyn
lip yeah you can get amazing kind of
dimension using those with others yeah
but yes love that so that I'd be that
big like anything inside a makeup bag if
