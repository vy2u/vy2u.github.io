my suitcase in the background here me
rich and our friends Rob SJ Gemma and
Ben are all going to Dorset for the
weekend we're going to the sand banks
and we are staying in the most
incredible house three nights six best
friends I don't think we've all been
away just our six together and I'm so
excited I'm gonna bring my two cameras I
want to film some pretty footage bring
you guys along though let's do this I've
picked up rich from work and we're on
our way
everyone else is meeting us later and
I'm very excited and I'm gonna add it in
the car I think we're in Bournemouth
I don't know where we're going but it
says that we're six minutes away all the
others are in the car kind of an hour
and a half behind us we're gonna get
there unpack make some food get some
Prosecco ready and then this is all we
can see right now it's a bit creepy
but just trying to suss out which house
is I think this is it oh my gosh we are
here and it is incredible and I feel
like I haven't really explained why
we're here like I said we're coming away
with friends but basically a company
called blue chip holidays offered me
this house for the weekend with friends
not like in return for anything just
because they were being really nice and
I don't often get to like take people
with me on all these cool things I do so
the idea of being able to go away with
friends for the weekend was so exciting
so that is why we're here it's on
sandbanks
which isn't an area I know that well so
I'm really excited to kind of get to
know it over the next three days we're
here until Sunday it's now Thursday
night SJ Rob Gemma and Ben aren't here
yet so I thought I'd quickly give you
like a house tour and I'm gonna try and
keep it short because I think this video
would be really long oh my god this
houses aren't real so we walked through
this like amazing front door to this oh
my god how insane is that it would be
more insane if it was in focus so let me
take you upstairs first I feel like this
is like cribs up here is the lounge area
which is incredible and out there it's
gonna be an amazing sea view in the
morning and the huge kitchen Oh Gemma is
gonna die like look how big this fridges
wowser seriously insane there's like a
dining room here okay let me show you
downstairs
so back down to like the ground floor in
here is the garage slash games room
there's a pool table we are gonna love
that and then this is the bedroom that
me and rich are staying in nice double
bed so much Waldo space we're having so
much fun playing with the wardrobes
because we have like half this for both
of us at home so this is the ensuite
bathroom it has a shower and a bath
separate which I absolutely love and
then like some sinks I've just put all
my products here that's of my skincare
now gonna show you all the bedrooms
basically there's another double with an
ensuite there's a double there with the
bathroom and then you go downstairs
again and there's two more bedrooms
there this one is really lovely because
it's got like a walk-in wardrobe
bathroom it's all carpeted and nice but
then this is the most insane thing in
this room is a cinema room oh my God
look at that screen there's like sofas
and you can like play DVDs or movies I
mean this room is the best I told you
the house is insane now I can't wait for
everyone else to arrive but if we're

best three days ever I feel like I'm
hoping it up too much but I know it's
gonna be so good Lucia este
