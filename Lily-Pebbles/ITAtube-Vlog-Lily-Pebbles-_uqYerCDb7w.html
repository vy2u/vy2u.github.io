excited to be here we literally just got
to our hotel and I came around to mine
this morning sorry for my gum I'm gonna
take it out Anna came around to mine
this morning and we got my mom to drop
us off at the coach station we then got
a coach to the airport which took ages
and it was very cramped and hot how'd
you feel about being on the National
Express and then we got to the airport
and started queuing up for our flight we
were having lovely conversations and we
were very chilled and next thing you
know we have seven minutes until the
plane takes off and we have no idea how
that happened or seven minutes till the
gate closes so I don't know me and I
know like the most organized people in
the world so I don't know where we got
confused along the way but we basically
had to run through the airport to get to
a flight we had to buy priority tickets
so we rushed through security
I got beeped and had to be searched and
my hand sanitizer had to be taken out
and it was very stressful I mean I'm
running through the airport we managed
to grab a bottle of water and then we
made it onto the flight literally within
minutes we nearly missed our flight that
was fun
we're on the plane now and we ran faster
without breath we have been heat or
drunk anything warning me Christian
machine share them flight was okay there
I'm a bit of a nervous flier but it was
fine we watched a really nice film you
watched Philomena together and it was
really easy quick flight and then we
landed in Milan
a temperature as flight actually really
good my family had boats the way to go
so we're now here at the hotel it was a
bit of a journey to get here we have to
get a coach and a taxi again so it's
been a long day of traveling but I'm so
happy to be here this is my hotel room
I've just finished unpacking all my
stuff and I think we're now gonna go out
for dinner
we both are craving pizza it's like 7
o'clock and I haven't had any pizza yet
what is going on so I've just quickly
changed into this kind of comfy outfit
and we're gonna go and eat something
right let's find some pizza me and I
having a bit of a moment indeed his
bread basket was so hungry there's like
a mini crew Tom Poquette it's the best
thing I've ever eaten and we look ten
miles to find it leave me forget we did
it was so worth it
come to the supermarket stock up on
snacks and raid the minibar so far I
have these that look like some kind of
jaffa cake equivalents and some like
Nutella so I can eat it with a spoon
because that's what I like to do I was
gonna get the big pot but that's
ridiculous Oh what are you getting I'm
gonna get these they look sissy ooh what
is this difference really I'm guessing
and then some biscuit okay so we're back
from dinner one thing I've learned from
Milan is that hay fever is in honey
season my nose oh no got a fever and so
back in a back bedroom and I'm in my
pajamas and me and I are gonna have a
bit of an editing session and I think
you're gonna leave today here it will be
more exciting from tomorrow onwards I
