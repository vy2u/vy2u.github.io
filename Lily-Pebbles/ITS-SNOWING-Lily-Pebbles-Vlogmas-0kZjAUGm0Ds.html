warming my coat and scarf and go out get
Rick back in the room now after having
some fun like snowy times outside I
heard a little bit snowy and we've got
about an hour to get ready for not

up but I know everyone here so I just
want to be comfy I'm gonna wear jeans
and a top so it's actually a good thing
that me and Katie are sharing because
we're both really messy this is working
out well this is what I'm wearing
oh you can't really see with this tapas
for a sauce it's like a really nice wine

standard for me look at this lovely
mirror Maddy checking out her outfit of
the evening looking lovely everyone
looks really nice we go down oh this way
I'm just cold this soon but
Rudo knows where to go
on this cold December day I am piloting
my no joke I just came to my room and
had on half an hour power nap at 10
o'clock because I have such a headache
and I'm so tired but I'm gonna head back
down now I went back downstairs but to
be honest I feel really rough so I came
back up and I think I'm just gonna go to
bed
really annoyed myself because only like
11 and I know everyone's gonna have so
much fun and I'm gonna watch back
everyone's videos and just feel like I
missed out but I just don't feel like
myself I feel absolutely shattered and I
am not so firstly gets tired in the
evening that I'm normally like wide
awake until 1:00 and I can't get sleep I
feel so tired I just really don't feel
like myself and I feel like I'm like
being a really rubbish person to chat to
and I have like no chat and I don't know
I just don't feel like myself so I'm
just gonna get ready for bed and snuggle
up and get some sleep and it's such a
shame because I love the Christmas party
and I wish I didn't feel like this but
it's been a busy week so I'm gonna get
some sleep
