boxing class this is very unlike me I
like to lie in and relax on the weekend
but my friend Rob is a personal trainer
and he's testing out making new boxing
class and getting all his friends to
come and try it out so obviously I
wanted to support him so I'm already in
my gym gear and I'm gonna put on like a
little bit of makeup just because it's
Saturday I'm already gonna go out
afterwards so that's what I'm doing
right now so I'm having for breakfast
which currently made it for me yogurt
granola and fruit and honey Rob told us
not to eat he said to an hour before but
no sooner but that was just never gonna
happen because I can't wake up that
early and he also told me to have a
light jog the day before because he
knows how unfit I am but that obviously
didn't happen either so today should be
fun and a room full of people I know and
I'm gonna be the most unfit we're gonna
go pick up Hannah and she's gonna come
with and I haven't seen it for a while
so many people words that I just bought
a bit of my by tureen lip balm I haven't
worn this one which is like the original
player1 for ages so in that kit just
watching toddlers and tiaras
it's a program we have on TLC it's like
an American program and people dress
they're like three or adds up for
pageants is completely shocking kind of
addictive to watch it was just so
terrible if like me you get really
frizzy bits of hair because I find one
might suppose you might when my hair's
short when I tie it up in a ponytail I
just have flyaway bits everywhere these
hair bands are great it's from Lululemon
and wasn't that expensive and they've
got like grippy bobbly bits underneath
so it really grips the hem doesn't slide
off and I love wearing these when I do
any kind of like workout or pilates
hannah has completely disobeyed the
eating rule like I did but her she's
actually eating in the car on the way
and wearing shorts it's pouring rain
estimated the weather not the cows
lately pouring with rain
we're in the gym and I'm watching the
class before us and it looks really
intense and they're all really sweaty
and now
scared and not prepared for this and
there's lots of jumping I don't really
like jumping look who's in London
welcome back she her and Jason her
boyfriend her hair and they're gonna
make a scene look really unfair back in
the vlog how did you find it they
finished a boxing class so it wasn't any
boxing it was like but they put it like
how you can see weight lost something it
was lots of like burpees and sit-ups and
jumping star jumps and omaha died like
nearly died many times but i tried to
push myself a carry on I think I was
okay I could definitely be better but
I'm like really 18 now and I'm going to
wedding tonight I don't know how I'm
gonna dance Hannah how did you find it I
loved it wait you're like an addict that
was my friends Rob's class when he has
like a Facebook page or something I will
let you guys know because yeah it was
good if you're into that kind of thing
and now we're gonna go home and shower
off the sweat and eat some food because
I'm in constant thinking about food rich
picked up some yummy sandwiches I need a
that's before my shower I'm so my god
lifting the back hurt all right sandwich
time isn't that Rob's gonna tell you huh
okay I got what did I get my sandwich
beef beef and a load of other stuffs
well yeah bulky so is it for me
we put on the affair yeah oh my god that
smells amazing this is what you call
chicks they're like sweet potato chunks
with like kale and yummy stuff look at
the sandwich oh my god after some
serious showering and some serious
shellac same and feeling a little bit
better
my thighs definitely hurt when I walk
downstairs but I think I will survive
we're gonna go have a little mutual on
the high street I think I want to just
see if there's a gap because I think
that's 40% off at the moment and I'm
obsessed with this jumper that I bought
the other day edge and if you go saw on
snapchat I bought it in the gray and the
beige it's so comfy
I just love gap during autumn I think
they have the best stuff it's really
like underrated I think so
yeah I need some chocolate too something
to give me a bit of a lot go pick me up
and not very much makeup because we're
going out tonight so I'm going to come
back and like add lots of makeup to my
face just came as a gap and it's a by
one supposed to get another one
half-price I just don't - such as the
other day just ran into paper chases I
wanted to get a proper portfolio but for
my magazine clippings because they're
just in a folder I'm an analyst that you
got a good one for Paper Chase so it's
just like an awesome photo outlet and
basically
big sticky sheets others we're just in
the market in Camden passage buying some
little and always kind of shot glasses
just sherry glasses
I think I'm doing some baking tomorrow
with honey
my niece so I'm just probably entertain
sprays and me all the supplies I need
for the cake I've been sent something so
exciting and I thought I'd show you guys
whilst I open it I love the box okay so
basically brand is called Lily and
Lionel which is completely amazing
because my dad is cooed Lionel and my
name is clearly spelt Li ly so this just
feels like I can't believe someone has a
brand called lily and Lionel and it's
not me and my dad I've just it's so
random that it's called that I heard
about it years ago when they started
maybe like a year ago and I told my dad
straight away it was hilarious it's
named after the lady stars of the
branded her grandparents are called lily
and loner anyway it's so funny and it
just makes it feel very special so I
love this box it's all like what's a
cool like what it feels like 3d I know
I'm gonna open this and show you what
they sent me
so it's all wrapped in this pretty
tissue the sticker bishop sent me a
shirt and a makeup bag look how nice
it's wrapped so I think in here is the
makeup bag it's not the pretty ribbon
I'm gonna keep this ribbon if you think
you've got my name on it because this is
the makeup bag and I saw this one they
have Lilian Lionel bags in Liberty at
the moment I love this one because it's
got the rose gold there's some that have
silver and some that have gold and this
is like a navy blue blue print with
flowers and it's a really nice size
makeup bag I really like that actually
and I don't know what shirt they sent me
they said they're gonna send me a shirts
which is interested in I think it's like
a silk shirt
let's see it was a nice little card in
there and there it's a meter 15 castle
this is what the shirt looks like it's a
really beautiful silk shirt feels really
nice and thin and I was like a nice
weight to it it's got this like black
with a white print it's like a floral
kind of trees I really really like this
and looking forward to trying that on so
thank you very much Lilian Hainan little
moment all in love it I've just been
getting ready to go out on my camera
battery charges we're going to my
friend's brother's wedding like the
party bit sometimes I don't know if this
is the UK thing if obviously they can't
have everyone at the ceremony because if
it's a small venue sometimes in the UK
they invite people just to the party bit
in the evening so we're going quite late
a half 9:00 to a nice hotel in London
for the party so I think before how
we're going to go to my friend ash
jimbob's and we're going to watch The X
Factor and have some drinks and have
dinner and then all go together to the
wedding which would be fun so I've just
been getting ready make myself look a
bit more human I've just done my hair
and makeup and I think I'm gonna put on
Charlotte's Hillberry red carpet red for
a bit of a red lip and I didn't mean out
to work weddings are always very hard
especially when you're just going to the
evening bear one of the smart bite
everybody wear dresses but I've just
caught on like a black I've just a
little black dress that I've got fun
whistles I'll show you my outfit in a
minute I'm just gonna do my lipstick
okay so this is what I'm wearing I've
just kind of touched up my makeup I just
some matte eyeshadows like all the
glitters and cork and Charlotte Tilbury
red carpet red lipstick because red lip
and love that dress always works and
it's makes me feel very festive I just
like getting my hair a bit and my
necklace is from made well this is that
your very festive outfit skirt is
whistles and this is my I'm not gonna
say go-to because I hate that saying but
it's the little black dress so I always
kind of pick up when I just need a
little black dress to wear basically
wearing tights because who can be
bothered straight for their legs these
days not me
and it should probably be more sheer but
I don't have any and I'm wearing my
black boots from June which I don't
really love anymore but you know by the
time we get to this wedding
I like off nine and wasn't really drunk
anyway I'll probably be drunk because
I'm in so much pain
from working out this morning my thighs
are already killing me and quisha likes
the dance and I'm not gonna let her down
so for that to happen I'm gonna have to
be quite intoxicated so that's the plan
my clutch bag Azusa from whistles from
last year still love this bag
and I need a jacket let me go see what
jackets I have the leather jacket would
work but I'd probably be quite cold oh I
could wear my fur coat might look like a
hooker though that a bit too hooker
esque oh no my dress comes out the
bottom I think I can pull it off do I
really care
probably not rich do I look like a
prostitute No
while we wait for our left I've been a
bit like tired so we're gonna have a
shot of Stoli which is caramel vodka I
think I discovered that when we went to
Ibiza like years ago then we've got it
in a restaurant and it's just delicious
it's like the most delicious thing ever
I would have any shot glasses just put a
tiny banner cut put classy thank you
well it's clear I didn't expected it to
be brown which is nice mugs

drink and we've just ordered some
takeaway food like an Asian II place
