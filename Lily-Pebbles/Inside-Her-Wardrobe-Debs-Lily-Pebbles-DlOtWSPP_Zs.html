nursery when I was three so that's
nearly a 25 year friendship despite what
she may say I think she's always been
effortlessly cool and I've always gone
straight to her for style advice and
inspiration from a young age she's
always just had the confidence to wear
whatever she likes and not feel like she
has to stick to one particular style I
wanted you guys to get to know her a bit
better so I wanted to talk to her about
her wardrobe and style and I really hope
you guys enjoy this video I think I
already know what my style is god I
really think I have a style it's just
like whatever is comfortable and nothing
too girly so like red leather trousers
and a t-shirt where do I like to shop I
don't know I like Urban Outfitters ASOS
I got lots of things going to work
Topshop I used to shop a lot at but I
hate so if I feel like I'm a bit old now
for Topshop recently I've bought a few
things in the Selfridge this is from
Primark which I never shop at I have
like a trailer addiction so like a lot
how did our story tip trailers that have
a knife which someone told me is now it
is actually pronounced Nike officially
if I see a star that I like I just buy
them Paul would say that all of my
trainers look the same but that's not
true I like to go into the shops I like
to make touch of film and it's always
easier to try things on when you've got
makeup on so you know what it looks like
yes I do know what suits my body shape
because I've been shopping for so long
and I have a shopping addiction so I'm
always always shopping and because I
used to be personal shopper so I know a
lot about body shapes and I've tried on
lot clothes so I know what works and
what doesn't most of my jobs have been
in fashion
apart from actually when I was about 16
my mum said okay now you have to go and
get a job and I was a waitress and I was
a terrible waitress I had to carry a
tray of brownies once and it was so
heavy and yet to my white shirt and I
remember carrying the tray and I was
like oh if I just like tilt it a little
bit it's so much easier to carry and I
was carrying it around and then they got
back to the kitchen and they
tray down head like a big line shock
blur across my white shirt and I got
sent home did some work experience and
some music magazines because I wanted to
be a music journalist and I worked for
Rick Owens he's a designer which is
really fun and then I did like assistant
styling work and then I guess the
biggest like fashion job I had was
working at Topshop
I used to be a personal shopper there
I've pretty much dressed the same for
work and for the weekend
and they come very much jeans trainers
and a t-shirt kind of person don't
really ever dress up for work or for
going out or anything like if I'm gonna
dress up the way that I would dress up
would be like I'll put makeup on or I
can't put a bit lipstick on oh if I have
to go to a smart occasion like wedding I
freak out I'm not ready I could dress go
our friends got married last year
and I were jumpsuit like a black
jumpsuit when my cousin got bride a few
years ago I refused to wear a dress and
I wore like a suit so I thought have
silk shorts and then share and then a
black blazer to make it a little tuxedo
I think if I go back to when I was like
13 14 was a bit chavvy I dunno if I'm
allowed to say that okay um for more
like the which are now really in fashion
like the Adidas tracksuit bottoms with
the three stripes and like they popped
open and then I would I had a shocked
jacket don't have shot jackets are still
around saying what you wore a few a
rudeboy don't even know if that word so
like this and then I became a bit more
like I'm a girl and then I started
wearing I used weigh like a lot body con
no I'm very like baggy baggy top there's
a tomboy so I like don't do like girly
things I understand like a douche but I
think I just do my own thing I think
like I like I subconsciously will pick
up on trend so I really wanted a little
like button-up denim like a line skirt
and then they were everywhere I was like
oh did I want this because I thought I
wanted it first or because I
accidentally saw it I kept a corner of
my eye somewhere I don't know wherever I
go I plan my outfit the night before
like even if it is literally like an old
t-shirt ratty pair of jeans and like
some old trainers I have to plan it
because otherwise it would honestly take
me like two hours in the morning to
decide what to wear if I had the time
I'd be like putting it
and outfits together like trying
everything that I own and my water want
I found something good so if I just plan
it the night before quick and it's easy
and I get like an extra 10 minutes event
I went through a phase of being like
very into stripes and very intellectual
now I definitely wear like block colors
like green I love green black Navy great
like if you don't get my wardrobe it's a
sea of black I think because I've got
red hair and get away with wearing less
color and still look like I'm wearing
color I wear this necklace every day and
never take it off it was like 14 dollars
from a little thrift store in New York
coats are definitely I'm definitely like
coats and shoes and I think I get that
from my mom and I recently bought a
little like bomber jacket from a sauce
from this brand I just discovered who
Lola may like shearling and not real and
then it's got like a pink lining which
is not very me but it's quite cool with
the Queen I'm going to get in so much
trouble but I would say that my dad has
the best style not better than my mom
just like think he's very stylish so I
would always go to him for fashion
advice more my mom is just very cool
she's got very good clothes and I
inherited her a Shopaholic Jean my mom
likes a lot of leopard print and a lot
of color so we're quite opposite like
that whereas my dad I think is a bit
more kind of classic but then he also
likes a trainer so don't know if I got
that from him I think to be honest when
I was 15 or 16 like I wasn't as
confident as I am now in wearing my own
style I kind of wanted to follow the
trends a little bit more whereas now I'm
like oh we fit a trend that's cool
because then it's going to be in the
shop if I want to buy it can buy it or
my only piece of advice is and please
stop wearing the shorts that show your
bum advice you're like demanding and a
request that's a request as a request
for the teenagers of the nation no one
wants to see a bunch eeks okay end it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
