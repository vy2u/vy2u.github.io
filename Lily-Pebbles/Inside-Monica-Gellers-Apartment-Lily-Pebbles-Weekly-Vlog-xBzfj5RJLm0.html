come here today because we have a couple
of deliveries coming today we've got a
little dining room table from West Elm
coming and I've got some drawers from
Urban Outfitters for my office and all
my makeup coming at some point today as
well and other guys coming to fit
something and then Lucy's coming over to
help me film so I think I'm pretty much
making this my base for the day which is
weird because hasn't had my stuff in it
yet heavenly Wi-Fi hopefully I can
connect to like the BT open Wi-Fi and
I've got any food either in like a panic
I stole some cherry tomatoes and avocado
from my house so that I could like have
something to eat this morning but I
might have to pop out a lunch this I
hate how deliveries like the window
sometimes it's um like 8:30 in the
morning to 5:00 p.m. and you've just
gotta like wait around all day so she if
you don't live at the property it's
really inconvenient but I've bought lots
of stuff with me to do I'm gonna film
Sunday's video which you would have seen
already and I'm gonna write some blog
posts and just get on with some stuff so
I'm gonna make myself comfy on this
little chair which I I'm so in love with
this is the cushion I got from Brighton
it'll probably gone safer when it comes
because the colours were too similar
my lovely Westone throw I forgot to SL
there's a song as a gift and they make
myself comfy here in the Sun and let's
see if there's anything pluggable today
yeah the West thumbs in every came I
love this table look at the legs and
then a big marble top it doesn't really
mean cut that's an ounce fine chair that
works but I love it
now I can sit here and well okay I'm
gonna film a video now my Sunday video
which is an honor
easy favorites because I just have
everything packed away and there's
nothing else I can film so hopefully
it's okay for you guys I bought like so
much stuff with me and all my charges
and cameras and stuff so I'm just kind
of setting that up and then I need to
find some way to film this will probably
be my only nice background so I'll
probably just like sit at one of the
coffee table filming done and I'm
snacking on these just such a weird than
eat but I've got nothing flat and I
grabbed these for leftovers on it
alright so now I use this to put my
memory card in because um the MacBook
Air hasn't got something for a memory
card and then I'm going to use my
external hard drive and put all my
footage on there and then edit let's do
this
I forgot that I was vlogging might open
outfits his drawers came the jaws were
delivered with DPD and I'm really angry
at them because the guy turned up and
said scuse me can you help me carry this
in and I said not really it's a huge
chest of drawers I can't like what about
back he said oh well I can't lift it by
myself and I haven't got anyone else
here he was really rude so I'm really
annoyed about that and luckily there was
a nice man walking by that said he'd
help and so they bought it upstairs but
really that's like terrible service so I
don't think home companies should use
DPD honey's here now
Joe just left me with her because she's
taken Bayley to the doctor and we've
been eating pizza honeys eating pizza
and watching have a pig and I'm gonna
get on with some work
okay my sister's back here now I'm still
really annoyed about that DPD man but
look I put the drawers together and I
love them design it like they've got
like a wooden top they don't eat them
right smoothly but I'm gonna keep all my
makeup and stuff I really like this side
it's a shame that that's not seen as
much but I think that looks really good
that fits perfectly
JJ's rearranging my cupboards because
that's what she does best tell you what
to put my pots and pans baby's coloring
in he's not a school thing doesn't feel
well and honey's making bracelets very
pretty
I got another delivery from Urban
Outfitters
I got a cushion and a shelf which I have
no idea where it's gonna go so I might
be giving this away to a friend if it
doesn't work I really wanted to see what
it was like in real life didn't have any
measurements on the urban artist
outfitters website which I thought was
ridiculous it's not the Christian looks
like that's one side and that's the
other it's really really flat like look
how thin it is kind of thought it would
be more puffy but I guess I could look
nice over here let's see well I haven't
got a set for yet what I do I have more
space for cushions I quite like that
there is a zip so I might take off the
cover and get different cushion because
this is a bit flat like that okay so
basically this is how the Shelf my over
Netflix's comes and it's meant for like
in the bathroom to hang like a towel so
you don't explain it goes on the wall
like that and then hangs it's too close
to the wall to use for coat hanger what
I'm gonna do because there's nowhere for
this to kind of go together is I'm just
gonna take this pop is really hard to
show you you prop you up on the table
you see there's some shelves there I'm
basically gonna put it underneath so it
kind of hangs from under the Shelf so I
really like these piping shelves and
much nicer than kind of our IKEA one
that we were going to
there so that's what I'm gonna do it's
really hard to show you but I'll show
you when it's done
yeah just take it off my eye makeup
because Lucy's coming around to help me
film and part of it is do my makeup and
when I'm waiting for her I'm just
watching Jacqueline Hills new video
because she's amazing
so I'm halfway through filming video
that said Lisa's chorion to help me film
her to camera around her neck
she's been painting my nails and I've
got all like my makeup and plants and
mirror set up here so that's about all
I've got to update you on rich is here
oh he's doing a big wing nice bleeding
the radiators I just got home I need to
go back to flatten a bit to pick Ritchie
up because he's there the TV guys like
15 and Arielle I'm just watching Bake
Off from last night I'm gonna have some
dinner and I'm reading through your
comments on my videos that you've gotten
up which is the review of the book and
they're really nice comments actually I
feel like cuz that's such a normal real
just honest video it's created really
like I feel like for me a good comment
on a video isn't oh my god you're so
pretty
or I love your shoes it's like really
long intellectual comments where people
are just saying really nice things about
fact they like I'm being honest and they
like getting to know my personality so
thank you for those comments and it was
fun filming that video yeah I'm gonna
finish looking today because I'm gonna
go and pack some boxes full of makeup
and yeah it wasn't a very interesting
day sorry but I'll vlog again on Sunday
where we'll be moving in this weekend
hopefully and I'm going to friends fest
with Deb's I'm really excited for that

seven this morning I'm really trying to
be like a changed woman at the moment

wardrobe empty sad times the exciting
times be like spent the whole day at the

carry on moving in and I've got some
stuff going on later this afternoon as
well so heavy I also I'm gonna take with
me this penny board it's like one of
their new kind of longboard version so
it's way bigger than the original at
little penny boards and I'm gonna let
mark have a go on it cuz he wants to
he's think about getting a longboard
slightly girly color for him but I love
it's all like pastel blue yellow and
pink so pretty
