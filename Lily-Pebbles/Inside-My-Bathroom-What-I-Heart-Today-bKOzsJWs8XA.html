my bathroom video I've seen a couple of
other girls do this on youtube and I
love watching these kind of videos
because I'm so nosy so I thought I'd
show you inside mine and I hope you
enjoy it so this is my bathroom it's
quite small but it feels more spacious
because it has these sorts of skylight
things and so it's nice and bright in
here and Amy my boyfriend shared this
bathroom so firstly the sink area I
always had all the boring toothbrush
toothpaste stuff i also have a neon hand
wash and from there sensuous range and
the hand cream to go with it and these
are both really nice and i also have a
jo malone body in hand lotion this is
the grapefruit one which is really nice
and refreshing and then up here is a
mirrored cabinet where I keep all my
sore skin care products apart of my
moisturizer which I keep my makeup in my
bedroom so I just open this up so just
here i have my sort of main products
that use all the time i have my own
little cleanse &amp;amp; polish the big one and
i have the origins never a dull moment
exfoliator which i just got and I'm
doing a visa and I really like this i
also have origins drink up intensive
mask which is like the overnight mask
and the origins brighter by nature
exfoliating pads and this is richest
self uses the lizard cleanse &amp;amp; polish as
well up here i've got a few products
from arcs in character real i've got
masks exfoliator and a cleanser I've got
a couple of
more this'll cleanse &amp;amp; polish which I
think I got one with her promotion with
John Lewis and another one came in like
a set and these are so good for
traveling so I just keep those for when
I'm traveling I have a couple of things
from gazelle ii and skin balancing
cleanser and mask this is a really nice
brand as well that I've mentioned before
i'm really not skincare products i also
have a couple of dermalogica products
mask and their phone ian the israel
glossybox and i really like these i'm
still sort of saving them for what i
really want to use them because they're
small I always have i don'ti now say
there's Antipodes or Antipodes and this
is the Juliet skin brightening gel
cleanser I haven't used this much yet
but I've used it a little bit I quite
like I still found my liz earle i also
have a dr Bragi radiator and the Marlin
Garrett's and soya protein mask yeah
detox face mask which is quite nice I
have a lot of skincare so I've thrown so
much stuff out or like passed it on to
friends and family and it's just things
that I really like so this is a drawer
set I think it's from Ikea I just need
to something to put all the have so many
products and I can't if I keep them on
the cabinet will the drawer in my room
then I don't use the stuff I really like
so this is all over I keep the bulk of
my stuff and it's kind of scripting hair
and body as much as I can and the top
floor is hair stuff it's kind of all
thrown in and the Joe house with oil
frizzes three days straight as a ghd
hair brush in here there's kind of just
a bit of everything Phillip Kingsley
elasticized which is really nice there's
just loads of stuff all bummed in men
and then second drawers body so I kind
of have like a bird speeds body lotion
Carol shared body lotion this is really
nice diptyque fig body lotion and so all
different kind of things in there some
fake town and just body lotions and
stuff like that and then the bottom jaw
is female stuff that nobody wants to see
so this little sort of basket thing I
got a tan in an Oscar event but I've
actually seen it in John Lewis that's
right it's from if anybody wants to get
it but like a little lid so I keep that
up here and I sort of put products in I
use quite very clearly or want to use up
so I've got the red can extreme shampoo
and conditioners which I'm sort of
halfway through and need to finish soon
I've got my max my mac brush cleanser
and a neon body oil which is lovely and
these sort of my hair for us I've shown
before we just color look Sebastian
potion nine and i look like a leave-in
moisturizer there this is also really
nice this is the RF Ludo I don't mean
how to pronounce that or if Ludo Sahara
tested and so it's basically like
hairspray that's meant to protect your
hair from like all the elements and it's
actually really nice it smells quite
manly it's got a quite Uncle masculine
scent but I really like it and I've been
so experienced on my head for blow
drying it or if the weather's particular
use this and it's quite nice for my hair
so we're in my shower now this feels
quite weird but I basically have one of
these metal things in the corner to keep
my products on me and rich sharethis so
a couple of things I've got on here I've
got the neon organic body scrub which is
an amazing
squirrel bits like a massive part i love
this when I've got time I use this all
over my body and it's just amazing
wasn't this Richie's is this it's the a
URI mean body wash and this also came in
the glossy box and I've also got a lock
sea tan shower oil this is the arm and
shower I just got this and I used it
yesterday and I love it it goes on like
an oil and then allow this off when you
rub it in and it's really nice has a lot
of really strong scent but it's really
nice and subtle the shampoo conditioner
that using at the moment from a John
it's the drive recovery range and they
look like this and a really nice
luxurious hair products or just need my
hair feels so amazing and healthy and
soft rich uses her blessings two and one
such boy and i also have an are born fc5
vigor eating body cleanser this is a
really nice shower gel it smells like
Kiwis and strawberries and fruits I
really like its massive it lasts me for
ages so then up here I have this sort of
hanging contraption that i got from home
base because i had more things i wanted
to go in the shower there was enough
room another one so this sort of hangs
on the side of the shower and is working
my hairbrush and my shaver and i've got
a rockin oil treatment mask and a couple
of like spare shampoos and a bubble bath
company shower gel dipped teak fig
shower gel which is really nice and a
joico k-pak me constructor which is like
a hair treatment which I'm try finish
now some more like motor oil shampoo and
riches cleanser so that's just where I
keep the stuff that doesn't really fit
it in the other place but I still want
to use it when I can so that's my
bathroom tour I hope
